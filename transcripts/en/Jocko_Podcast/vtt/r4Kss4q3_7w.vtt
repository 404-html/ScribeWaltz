00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
This is Jocko podcast number 36 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.930
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.070
<v 0>good evening echo.
Good evening.</v>

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.450
Behold

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.170
the world is a sight to behold.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.190
I'm just back from a trip to the wilderness in the Sierra mountains of

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.184
California.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
And every time you open your eyes there's a sight to behold,

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.580
an image of beauty
from a distance,

11
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.970
a mountain of solid granted almost a hundred million years old,

12
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.770
juts up from the valley floor

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.200
up close the roots of a newborn tree trying to find purchase maneuvering around

14
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.950
and over and through rock until it finds soil.

15
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.510
<v 0>And in doing so draws an infinitely complex picture of life.</v>

17
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.880
Yes,
the world is a beautiful place,

18
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.240
but we also know

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.520
that the world can be a horrible place for wretched place.

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
And in the military I was usually sent to the bad places

21
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240
and in a way I was sent to those bad places to deal with them.

22
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.250
<v 0>To keep them away from us.</v>

24
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.380
<v 0>Those of us lucky enough to be born in the right country with the right form of</v>

26
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:01.100
government and the right supply of water and food and energy.

27
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.920
And it was our job

28
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.400
as the lucky ones.

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.530
<v 0>To keep the horror away,</v>

31
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.140
to shield the eyes of the blessed,

32
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.450
but there are other people

33
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.390
whose job it is to open eyes,

34
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.130
to show the world,
not just the light,

35
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.093
<v 1>okay,</v>

36
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.100
<v 0>but also the darkness</v>

37
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.940
and that's the life of a photographer

38
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.000
and like the soldier,
he must travel and like the soldier,

39
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.270
he must take risk then like the soldier,

40
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.330
he must face the darkness and live with it

41
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.720
and like the to an even greater degree,

42
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.990
he must detach from what is happening.

43
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.900
He must observe from the outside be a part of what is happening in front of him

44
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.530
without being a part of what is happening in front of him.

45
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.760
We have a guest on the podcast tonight,

46
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
friend of mine who spent his life with a camera in his hand capturing light

47
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.330
and capturing darkness.

48
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.670
Welcome to the podcast Mr Kiran Daugherty,

49
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.240
who in addition to being a friend,
an outstanding drummer,

50
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.120
a husband,
a dad,
and last but not least,

51
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.850
an award winning photographer.
Welcome to the pod pat podcast.
Karen,

52
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.020
thank you for having me.
Good to have you on detected a little accent there.

53
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:07.910
You're from,
uh,
it's an English accent.
You entertains.
Yeah.
Just a little on that.

54
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.290
So you're from England and how did this whole business start?

55
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.630
How did you end up start taking pictures?

56
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.450
<v 2>How did I start taking pictures?
Um,</v>

57
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.150
my dad was a good photographer,

58
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.170
always had a camera and I think I got to my 17th birthday and he gave his

59
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.280
cameras to my sister.
Now I had no interest in the cameras at the time,

60
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.190
but I suddenly had an interest when I found he gave them to my sister.

61
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.420
So I demanded that I have them.
I had to do some sort of swap,

62
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:43.220
but I got the cameras.
Um,
but I didn't really use them.
Um,

63
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.610
I really wanted to be an artist.
I wanted to paint,

64
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.920
but I wasn't good enough in my own eyes.
I was okay,
but not good enough.

65
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.880
So the camera became a tool for me to create and express myself.

66
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.620
And
I ended up,

67
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.280
I did a degree course after school in sports science and then I went on to do,

68
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.070
oops.
Yeah.
Hey listen.

69
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.960
It was a great course.

70
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.870
I had three years playing tennis and football.
I mean,
come on.

71
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.750
Who's a great games?
So,
um,
I wasn't,
I,

72
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.350
I wasn't really good enough to get onto an art foundation course.

73
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:35.100
So I did the sports course and then I wanted to concentrate on doing a course in

74
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:35.934
photography.

75
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.680
So my mum found a course for me and there's only one causing the country.

76
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:45.600
And then he took 12 people and normally had to apply five or six times to get

77
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.900
on.
And so when I applied for the course,

78
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:53.280
I went for an interview and I showed a portfolio of appalling black and white

79
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.400
pictures that I shot.
I mean,
really appalling.

80
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:58.070
I'd gone to a couple music festivals and

81
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 3>I had pictures of dribbling babies in prams.
I mean,</v>

82
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.210
this is what I took to my interview,
but they put me on the reserve list.

83
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.130
So I was number 13 and it meant that I wasn't going to get on the course cause

84
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.180
they were only taking two earth.

85
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.290
So my mom every day for about six months,

86
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.200
rang the head tooth and said,
come on,

87
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.940
put them on the course and come on,

88
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.760
put them on the course.
And after six months,

89
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.110
he just thought to stop this woman calling me every day.

90
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.910
Okay.
Okay.

91
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.310
And he put me on his number 13 on the course and I did the course.

92
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.120
Um,

93
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.120
and I ended up spending most of my weekends traveling at home down to an agency

94
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.410
at home where I,
you were really working.

95
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.160
So the course was teaching you how to do stuff and,

96
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.470
but the job that I wanted to do,
you can't learn it in a classroom really.

97
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.730
It's a bit of common sense and just reacting to the environment around you.

98
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.050
So I used to spend my weekends traveling home and working for a real agency and

99
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:10.220
they would just send me out on stuff and I would be shooting pictures,

100
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.910
developing transparencies,
black and whites printing,
putting it on why a drum,

101
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:17.120
sending it into the papers,
you know,
in the real one.
That's what do my weekends.

102
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:20.540
And then I go back to the course and I just felt the course was really dragging

103
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.730
for me.
Um,
but I finished it.

104
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.940
And the root is you join a regional newspaper and then you sort of cut your

105
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:33.111
teeth in the industry.

106
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:38.111
Then you go to maybe a big provincial paper and then you head down to maybe

107
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:44.561
London for work on a national and then maybe after the national you might

108
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:47.990
consider working on agency.
Well,
I didn't have time for any of that,

109
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.420
so I just went straight down to the London out of college.
Um,

110
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.150
and tried to
try,

111
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.730
I tried to get a job,
but I ended up,

112
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:02.060
what you end up doing is you go around and you just spec pictures into

113
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.680
newspapers.
So you find a job,
you shoot it,
you ring them up and you say,

114
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:10.220
I have this great picture and you need to,
you really should have it.

115
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.520
And they would say,
okay,
bring it in.
And you would take it in.
And they go,
thanks.

116
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:17.060
But we had our own photographer there and blah,
blah.

117
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.430
So I did this for two or three years,
not really getting anywhere.
And uh,

118
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.180
I ended up,
I learned a few tricks of the trade,

119
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
which is you turn up to a news event that's happening and you shoot the pictures

120
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.270
and then you ring the desk,
the wire desk,
wherever it is,

121
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.980
you want to sell the picture too.
And you say,
listen,

122
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.960
very few people were here and this is a big story and really you can't afford

123
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:46.280
not to take this from me because your opposition was here.
Um,

124
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.030
and I think you really should see this picture.
So they'd say,
come in.

125
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.980
And I went in once and I'd shot this picture of this tank that appeared outside

126
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.310
the High Court in London.

127
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.300
And coming out of this tank was a 20 foot Marlin.

128
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.240
It was just the most ridiculous thing.

129
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.970
And it was some guy protesting about a divorce.

130
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.930
He was going through Siri just loaded up the t just headed out the court slugged

131
00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:14.880
yet.
Yup.
And I drove,

132
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.660
I was driving past a with a friend and I thought,
I better shoot that picture.

133
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:22.590
And I shot that picture and I rang up and I said,
listen,
Associated Press,

134
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:25.830
we're here Reuters,
you really should take this picture of me.

135
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.910
And I went in and it was such a ridiculous looking image that they said,
great,

136
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.013
we'll take it.

137
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.010
And so they just snip the negatives because it was filming those days they take

138
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.910
three negatives,
the one in the middle,
they want a Biz,
the one they scan,
um,

139
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.410
and that was 75 pounds in my pocket.
And I just thought,
right,

140
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.300
I need to keep doing this.
I said,
if I come in here with a picture,
is it,

141
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.330
do you give me 75 pounds?
Every time I come in?
They said,
well,

142
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:53.880
every picture we take,
we'll pay you 75 pounds.

143
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.250
So of course I just can't ring him.

144
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.080
And kept ringing them and kept bringing them and eventually they cottoned onto

145
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.240
the amount of 75 pounds.
They were giving me an a day and they said,
okay,
listen,

146
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.630
we'll put you on shift so we will pay you a hundred pounds and you will work

147
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.190
five shifts.
We will stop paying you five times 75 every time you come in.

148
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.170
And that's how it started.
And um,

149
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.170
so it's a bit of luck and a bit of determination.

150
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.100
Um,
and yeah,
that's how,
that's how I got into it.

151
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:27.510
And if I'm totally honest,

152
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:32.630
I really didn't know that that sort of job existed.

153
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.440
Um,

154
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.060
I'd seen magazines by photographers and like Don McCullen who used to shoot the

155
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:41.940
troubles in Northern Ireland in the early days.

156
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.000
And he used to see his spreads on the Sunday Times,
but it never dawned on,

157
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.880
I used to look at the images was mesmerized by these black and white images,

158
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.850
but never put two and two together and worked at,
well,
sorry.

159
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.200
So this is obviously a job and somebody does this and he's paid to do this.
Um,

160
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.360
and so yeah,
it sort of dawned on me,
there's this,

161
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.960
this is an existence that I really quite liked because I don't have to wear a

162
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:01.794
suit.

163
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.190
I can wear jeans and a tee shirt and I can just shoot and create and I can earn

164
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:10.740
a living.
And that's really how it started.

165
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.230
And then you ended up staying at Reuters for what,
10 years?

166
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.860
Uh,
no,
from 1993 to 2008,

167
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.420
so I was freelance until 2000 and then 2000,

168
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.640
um,
when,
which was really fortunate as cause my first daughter was born,

169
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.370
they made me staff.
So there was the security of the job there.
Um,

170
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.550
and then I resigned in 2008 so I'd sort of done my stint of staff and I decided

171
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:42.960
that I wanted to move on to other things.
Um,
but yeah,
it was a bumpy road,

172
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.370
but it was an,

173
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:50.870
I couldn't have asked for a better grounding into photojournalism than working

174
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:55.120
for a wire agency in that Reuters because you just got to cover everything from

175
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:59.290
spot news from something that was happening in Downing Street to

176
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.910
covering Wimbledon to covering world cups.

177
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:09.070
Olympic Games was owns,
um,
you name it,

178
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.480
there was nothing a wire agency photographer didn't cover.
And so,

179
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.910
you know,
you literally,
you could,

180
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.420
you could come off from shooting a Champions League football match and the next

181
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.370
day you could be in Afghanistan shooting,
shooting a new story.
That's,

182
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.610
that's how it worked.
And that's incredibly intoxicating,

183
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.070
especially when you're a young guy,
you know,
I mean,

184
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.230
I didn't get to travel immediately.

185
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.920
Obviously I had to cut my teeth and they had to trust that they could send me

186
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.150
away.
And I must admit it took,
took a couple of couple of years.

187
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.370
Um,
and in fact,
my first assignment by my line manager,
he just said to me,

188
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:47.350
one Friday night,
I need to go to Belfast,

189
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.640
the third for July the 12th for the troubles.
And I said,

190
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.720
I can't.
And he said,
what do you mean?
I said,
well,
I,
I'm,

191
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.160
I've got a gig tonight.

192
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.180
I'm playing in London and there were 13 other people in the band and if I get on

193
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:05.850
a plane,
they're not going to have a drama.
Wrong answer.
So,

194
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.480
so you went to Belfast?
Nope.
Oh,
you didn't do the health,
the Gig,

195
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.740
the Gig Bros for,

196
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.160
because I didn't realize I was too naive to realize the implications of y y you

197
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.120
know,
sorry,

198
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:25.390
this guy wants to work for Reuters and I'm going to send them to Belfast to

199
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:29.260
cover that.
The troubles.
And he wants to play drums in a club.
Yeah.

200
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.190
So I learned that lesson pretty quick.

201
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:35.920
How long did it take to get another offer to travel like that?
Um,

202
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:41.310
I think the Belfast offer was 95 and then I ended up traveling literally 98.

203
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.010
So it's pretty on the bench for three years.
I mean,
yeah,
totally.

204
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.150
But when I did get to go,

205
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:51.670
he waited till I been married a month and then said to me,

206
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.230
I need you to go away for four months.

207
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.910
I'm just just married.

208
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.780
I've been married for a month and you want me to go in here?

209
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.560
And it was the Caribbean,

210
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.550
believe it or not to photograph cricket England against the West indies.

211
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:09.420
So it wasn't that tough gig.

212
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.180
And I ended up being able to take my wife with me as well.
So,
um,

213
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.760
so you can't complain about that at all?
Not at all at all.
We had a great time.

214
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.560
So tell me about like a little bit about the times where you went to Belfast and

215
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:25.690
what that was like for the first time we are going.
Okay.

216
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.240
Do you feel that tension for the first time you feel kind of the presence of

217
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:32.500
violence around you?

218
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.600
I was a nervous wreck and bearing in mind that I had lived in Belfast,
so,

219
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.410
um,
I lived in there during that at the side of the troubles and uh,

220
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.890
fulfill your five or six years of my life.
I was there,

221
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.860
although I never experienced any of the troubles.
It was very protected from it.

222
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:52.850
But um,
yeah,
I mean,
you know,
I went back and I was petrified.
I thought,

223
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.840
where do I go?
What,
what,
where,
where can I not go?

224
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:59.780
And I was very conscious of my name,
very Catholic name.

225
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.500
And there are certain areas of growth.

226
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.260
For those of you who don't know Karen's name is,
is the same name as one of the,

227
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.070
the heroes of the Ira Ira and who actually died in prison from a,

228
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.330
from a hunger strikes event.
That's your name.
So there's no,
that's my name.

229
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.840
There's no hiding that one.
Absolutely.
And of course,
just to clarify,

230
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.040
was not named after him butts,
just coincidence.
But there are murals.

231
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.180
We'll have a Belfast with Kiron Duck.

232
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.180
So there were certain areas of Belfast I could walk into very easily.
Um,

233
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.810
and there were certain areas of Belfast that I didn't really want to be caught

234
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.340
with my Prescott in my pocket.
So,
um,
so yeah,

235
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.120
it was,
yeah,
I was,
I was petrified.
You know,

236
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:49.430
there's no snow Arthur White stripe it in.
Did you start thinking yourself,

237
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:53.120
well,
maybe this isn't the job for me,
or did you,
were you thinking yourself?

238
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.920
I'm scared,
but this is awesome.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Of what I figured.
Yeah.

239
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.840
Cause yeah,
that's,
that's sort of the typical,
you know,

240
00:16:00.841 --> 00:16:03.290
when I talked to obviously all,
all my friends in the military,

241
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.430
that's everyone's feeling,
you know,
hey,
I was scared,
but that was awesome.
Yeah.

242
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:09.740
That's what everybody wants to do.
And I mean,
as a photographer,

243
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.890
when you're in there and there's the potential to have those shots,

244
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:19.940
those moments,
um,
of,
of human existence,

245
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:23.450
that only happened at that place at that time.

246
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.030
And you've got that opportunity that,
yeah,
I mean,
you'll waiting,

247
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.950
the worst thing is you get over that and there's nothing happening because

248
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:34.470
that's what happens.
Know,
leading up to July the 12th and the,

249
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:38.660
maybe the pockets of violence and that that happened usually in the evenings

250
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:42.950
after the pubs closed.
Um,
imagine that,
you know,
I mean,
yeah,

251
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.810
I know.
And the one thing he did,

252
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:48.410
it made the flames really stand out when they did throw this petro bums,

253
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.900
you know,
but what you were doing was you,

254
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.930
you'd be doing a lot of driving around and there would be nothing and you'd get

255
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.300
back to your hotel.
Anything,
okay,
what am I going to file today?
You know,

256
00:16:59.301 --> 00:16:59.931
I'm over here,

257
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:04.610
I'm being paid to be here and I need to be filing some imagery just to sort of

258
00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:07.970
justify the air flight out here and what not.

259
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.010
So [inaudible] and it would be really tough.

260
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.060
And so those were the toughest moments because you are having to find images

261
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.370
that sort of told the story,

262
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.970
but they weren't really the reason why you were there.

263
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.060
He was sending them because they were expecting trouble and then he'd be sitting

264
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.670
in the bar at night and somebody would say,
right,

265
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:34.130
this is happening on the falls road.
And you'd go,
great.

266
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.930
And we just go straight out there.

267
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.370
And if you had something physical happening in front of you,

268
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.750
it's almost as if he needed to get one under your belt to calm down because then

269
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:45.561
you were able to say,
okay,

270
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:50.460
I've produced something from here that's noteworthy and newsworthy.

271
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.080
Um,
and sometimes you go on these trips and to be nothing for a week and you'd be

272
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:55.691
sitting in your head in the,

273
00:17:55.691 --> 00:17:58.790
behind the scene in the hotel and there'd be nothing for a week.
And that,

274
00:17:58.791 --> 00:18:01.140
that was the worst.
But as soon as something did happen,

275
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.220
it was then a catalyst for maybe something else to happen.

276
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.040
And if there was something happening that night,

277
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.500
there was always the clear up the next morning.

278
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.540
So that was then the catalyst for actually what would maybe happen during the

279
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.200
week.
Um,

280
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.200
and one thing would lead to another and you'd end up beginning to feel a little

281
00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:23.160
bit more confident.
And,
you know,

282
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.430
I was just watching the guys that were a lot older than me and far more

283
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:30.540
experienced and I just sort of hung around with those guys,
sort of,

284
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.040
you're just trying to work out what do you do?
And that's how you learn.

285
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.400
You just watch how these other photographers are doing it and you just think,

286
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.170
okay,
well I'll remember that next time.

287
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:44.970
And because these guys come in and they just look to mentally cool and you know,

288
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.700
they sort of knew what they were doing.
And also to just,
did you ever,

289
00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:52.230
ever a time period where you thought you were more bad ass than your war or were

290
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.960
you always pretty humble about,
hey,
you know what,
these guys,
they,

291
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.060
they know more than me.
I'm just going to watch him and learn.
Um,

292
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.080
I mean you obviously thought you were pretty bad ass when you're like,

293
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:04.120
you know what,
I'm not going for the regional vapor.
I'm going straight to London.

294
00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:07.590
Yeah.
Job.
Yeah,
you're right.
But honestly,
I don't know where that came from.

295
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:09.360
I just thought I'd lost enough time.

296
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.430
I think I kind of hang around doing,
you know,

297
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.270
I mean no district and there were no jobs going anyway at the end of the
coolest.

298
00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:21.270
So I just thought,
well you know,
so yeah,
bad ass and probably not.
Um,

299
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.470
I mean I'm still,
if I'm,
I,

300
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.500
I'm not really wanting to work with other photographers now,

301
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.770
but when you're working in fleet street and you're working for a news agency,

302
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.740
you can't help but be in the pack and you're always working with other

303
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:38.530
photographers.
And there are,
as time goes by the,

304
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.730
there are sort of few photographers that you begin to sort of look to.

305
00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:46.731
You can sort of work out which of the ones that are doing something similar to

306
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:48.630
the way you want to be doing it.

307
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.660
And there are others that do their own thing cause it all photographers are

308
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:54.240
completely different that you're gonna have 10 photographers standing next to

309
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.800
each other and they can all shoot the same picture.

310
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:58.510
But every single image will be completely different because each photographer

311
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:02.700
has decided there's a different part of what's happening in front of him that he

312
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:07.140
wants to concentrate on.
So,
and that's what I found,
you know,

313
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.040
was happening a lot with,

314
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.760
especially with your sent down to Downing Street to do the prime minister and

315
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.870
the prime minister,
it would just walk,

316
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.280
the door would open and the premise will walk out of the door and get into the

317
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:17.040
car and drive off you take and it was seven pictures.
Yeah.

318
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:20.000
And the guy next to you could be a,
could be at uh,
uh,

319
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.180
a trainee and he will stand there and he'll shoot the same imagery with the same

320
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:28.140
cameras in the same lens and that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference

321
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:33.141
between a guy who's been doing it 20 years and a trainee because that's a very

322
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:37.380
sort of orchestrated theatrical moment,
you know?
And that's,
I didn't,

323
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.450
I wasn't really interested in that sort of stuff.

324
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.540
I was interested in stuff that was really spontaneous,
sporadic.

325
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.800
And it happened and you had to be ready for it and you had to react to it.

326
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.610
And that's what I like to do,
react

327
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.930
<v 0>to what was happening.
Did.</v>

328
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.640
Did you feel like going to Ireland in the,

329
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:58.600
in the late nineties and early 2000 did you feel that that prepared you at all

330
00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.290
for,

331
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.560
for going to Iraq for going to the other places that he went to in the world?

332
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.810
Was it good up her preparatory step?
Yeah,
absolutely.
And you know,

333
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:07.923
to be totally honest,

334
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.370
<v 3>I've never even thought about that.</v>

335
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.160
That thought has never crossed my mind until you just said it.

336
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.730
Did you think that prepared man actually,
do you know?
Yeah,
of course it did.

337
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.910
But it's funny when you were working you don't,

338
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.830
you don't think about things like that.
You don't,
I mean if I'd kept a diary,

339
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.200
which I've never done,
in fact I did when I was in Sri Lanka,
but if I was,

340
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.400
if I'd kept a diary,

341
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.540
I maybe would have had a little bit more self awareness of my progression

342
00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:38.510
through my career.
But when you'll,

343
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.110
you'll priorities are on earning money,
you know,
and,

344
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.240
and being able to pay the rent and am I going to get work next week or is that

345
00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:49.790
other guy who's come in who looks quite good,

346
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.730
is he going to start getting my shifts?
You know,

347
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.780
and so you're constantly on your toes and you're not thinking and you think if I

348
00:21:56.781 --> 00:22:01.700
get the,
the Northern Ireland Gig,
I got that and he didn't,
that's enough.

349
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.550
You know?
And that's how you were thinking.
You weren't really the,
I had no,
um,

350
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.550
structure to my career whatsoever.
Um,

351
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.060
and I think maybe because the whole thing was so new to me and I just couldn't

352
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.670
get my head around the fact that I was actually making your living as a

353
00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:20.240
photographer.

354
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:20.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

355
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.280
And that's really a actually pretty similar to what I experienced on my first

356
00:22:25.281 --> 00:22:28.640
deployment to Iraq where nevermind,

357
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.930
nevermind anything.
We were happy to be out doing operations.
Yeah.

358
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.770
Like we were going to go do real operations,
man.
We were,
what the strategy,

359
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.270
the,
the danger,
the whatever.
It was like,
Hey,
we are here.

360
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.720
We are doing operations to catch bad guys.
Awesome.

361
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.470
That was our focus.
Yeah.

362
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.330
So it sounds like you and the mindset that similar mindset and it's hard,

363
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:55.521
you know,

364
00:22:55.521 --> 00:23:00.521
it took me a couple months of being in Iraq and getting that out of my system

365
00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.990
before I was like,
okay so let's take a look at it,

366
00:23:02.991 --> 00:23:05.960
but we're actually doing here and how we're trying to effect the battle space

367
00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:10.961
cause I was just too young and inexperienced and I just need to get some

368
00:23:10.971 --> 00:23:14.690
experience under my belt.
So sounds like it.

369
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.900
And really sounds like Ireland kind of prepares you for that.

370
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.260
But I also look at,
okay so,

371
00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:25.160
so let's just go straight then two,
you get the call.
How did you know you got,

372
00:23:25.161 --> 00:23:28.640
we're going to get the call to go to Iraq.
Was that,
was it a lottery?
How do they,

373
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:31.490
do they just say,
hey,
we want to get you down there.
How did that work?
Okay.

374
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.880
<v 3>The,
the,
the way it works roads,
this was,
they um,</v>

375
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.160
no photographer was ever forced to go to a hostile environment.

376
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.400
So it wasn't part of your remit that if you work for Reuters you must go to,
oh,

377
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.330
some of them,
they were never liked that.
Um,
they,
you know,

378
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.440
and you can see why

379
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.230
<v 0>is it wrong for me to picture every for talk cause I had,
I put my,</v>

380
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.430
I put my personality over a guy with a camera.

381
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.160
And so I think like every guy with a camera is going,

382
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.430
I want to go to the war zone tomorrow.
Is that not true?
No,
that's,
yeah,

383
00:24:02.431 --> 00:24:03.264
that's not true.

384
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.370
There are a lot of guys that don't want to go anywhere near a Halston and
funner.

385
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.540
Okay.
Yeah.
See that's,

386
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.530
that's important for me to know these things because in my mind everyone's just

387
00:24:13.531 --> 00:24:16.110
thinking,
I'm going to go get after it.
I'm old,
I got a camera,

388
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.050
there's a war going on.
Let's go make it happen.
Yeah.
I mean that was then,

389
00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:22.130
that was,
yeah,
2003 I would say maybe,
maybe

390
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.830
<v 3>it's slightly changed now.
There were a lot more photographers,</v>

391
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.020
young photographers going to war zones,
but then no,
it was,

392
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.170
I think if I remember rightly,
they,
they,

393
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.740
because the buildup to the wool was so,
you know,
prolonged.

394
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.850
I mean we knew it was going to happen and to re and immediately they were those

395
00:24:42.851 --> 00:24:47.080
guys that wanted to,
that was one that embedded with the artillery in Qa.

396
00:24:47.081 --> 00:24:50.260
So he had a month wait and Qa and then just went with yachts.
Hillary,

397
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.880
there were the Reuters had very seasoned,

398
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.620
uh,
photographers,

399
00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.730
very experienced in those sort of environments that would then embed with

400
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.840
Americans or Brits.

401
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.310
And those were the guys that were being shot at on a daily basis,

402
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.290
but extremely hard to produce imagery from those situations.

403
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.010
Um,
on our member had a very good friend of mine said to me,

404
00:25:15.011 --> 00:25:16.510
he did a lot of that stuff.
He said,

405
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.420
the Kirin thinking about going and embedding with the soldier is that,
um,

406
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.460
you can get in the way and the last thing you want is to compromise a unit.

407
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.690
But they set these units up and they said,
Yep,
the media has to come in.
And,

408
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.450
you know,
show us what's happening.
But most of the time he said,
you,

409
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.710
you have your head down and your hand in the air and you'll just blindly

410
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:42.430
shooting and hoping.
And he said in variable you get nothing.
You know,

411
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:44.710
I mean that's not always the case,
but he said majority of the time,

412
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:49.240
and you have to do it a lot before your sort of hit rate,
you know,

413
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.240
gets uh,
gets moved up.

414
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.890
And if you're embedded,
I think you struggle if you go unilaterally,

415
00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.400
which is the really unsafe way to do it.
So you're on your own,

416
00:26:00.401 --> 00:26:02.720
you're on your own and take pictures there.

417
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.080
You've got the chance of getting something and again,

418
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:07.030
it's being in the right place at the right time.

419
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.360
So they'd said they had certain guys in place that stuck their hands up straight

420
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:15.580
away.
Yup,
I'm doing that.
That's me.
I'll be embedded there.
Um,

421
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.840
and I'll do this and I'll do that.

422
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.320
And we spent a month looking at the stuff that was coming out and it was

423
00:26:20.321 --> 00:26:25.120
invariably pictures of soldiers within sandstorms and stuff like that.
It was,

424
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.400
there was no action.
You know,
it was,

425
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.910
I wouldn't say that was true from all of them,
but the majority of the case,

426
00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:34.330
it was very difficult to produce imagery when you're embedded.
Um,

427
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.770
I certainly wasn't interested in being a unilateral that time,
um,
at all,

428
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:44.100
but I was really interested in going and

429
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.980
<v 2>doing what happens after the war.</v>

430
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:50.070
So what interests me is the people afterwards,

431
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:53.100
I always tend to think that people go in and shoot what's happening and that

432
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:55.200
moves on and then the photographers move on with them.

433
00:26:55.290 --> 00:27:00.290
And I wanted to just sort of go in that backdraft and photograph what was

434
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:06.540
happening lifewise after,
you know,
soldiers had been in there.
And,

435
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.030
and that's exactly what I said.
I said I'd be happy to go to Baghdad,
you know,

436
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.420
pretty much,
almost once it's secure.

437
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.540
<v 0>It didn't quite work out that way.
I think led a little,</v>

438
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.530
we went a little bit earlier.
It does,
does it?
Yeah.

439
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.250
And it never is as secure as you think.
And I remember,
I think I got the,
the,
the,

440
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:24.370
the

441
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:29.140
<v 2>day after the,
um,
the,
uh,
statue of Saddam was pulled down.</v>

442
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.650
Right.
Um,
and it was,
um,

443
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.990
it was just,
it was a moment if you for you for Baghdad's.

444
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.490
And I just thought,
hey,
you know what,
this isn't,
I mean,

445
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.570
my first trip to Belfast was worse than this.
This is okay.

446
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.650
But we'd had,

447
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.810
but we turned up and had the faced with the problem of one of our cameraman had

448
00:27:52.811 --> 00:27:56.910
just been killed under friendly fire and uh,

449
00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:01.950
that had taken a huge hit on Reuters and that really hit home that actually this

450
00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:06.470
is really not a safe place,
you know,
um,

451
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.850
because there's still an awful lot going on and there's still an awful lot of

452
00:28:09.851 --> 00:28:11.350
misunderstanding and,

453
00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.990
and so that was a real leveler when we got out there.
And,

454
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.843
um,

455
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:23.060
and staying in the Palestine Hotel was incredibly exciting because it was just,

456
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.970
there were just photographers and journalists and just buzzing around
everywhere.

457
00:28:27.971 --> 00:28:31.270
And you know,
you were Theo cam here now,

458
00:28:31.271 --> 00:28:33.070
so what am I going to do?

459
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.480
And it was almost as if I had to get out there and start shooting and I didn't

460
00:28:37.481 --> 00:28:40.600
care what it was that I started shooting.
I just,
I'm here now.

461
00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:41.530
I need to start shooting.

462
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.580
<v 0>So that is the feeling that I had in my life.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

463
00:28:46.581 --> 00:28:50.650
So,
um,
and,
and I said to them,
I said to my,
the,
the chief photographer out there,

464
00:28:50.651 --> 00:28:52.700
I said,
Jack,
what do you want me to do?
He said,

465
00:28:52.701 --> 00:28:57.140
I don't know what cat into the square and see what's happening.
So I did.

466
00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:59.890
And I walked out into the square and there were kids playing around in the,

467
00:28:59.891 --> 00:29:04.130
in the,
in the main square and the fountain,
because you kind of go out,

468
00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:05.690
and we were talking about this earlier today,
but you,

469
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.540
and you just said the word euphoric,
right?
And a lot of people,

470
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.930
because of the war in Iraq actually still going on right now,

471
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.310
but it's really easy to forget the initial,
I don't know,

472
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.720
four or five weeks after it started when we had crushed,

473
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:21.771
you know,

474
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:26.690
Saddam's regime and now the people were waving American flags.

475
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.870
The Iraqi people were waving American flags,
they were hugging,
they were,

476
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.400
they were happy.
And,

477
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:36.710
and it's really easy to forget that because things turned so bad,

478
00:29:36.891 --> 00:29:41.060
really,
you know,
within,
within a couple months they'd turned bad.

479
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.370
Then they went down

480
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.280
<v 2>from there.
Yeah.
But you were just like,
oh,
you know what,</v>

481
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:47.680
I'm going to go out in the outside,
the Palestine who tell which is,

482
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.500
which is by the way,
across the river from the Green Zone,

483
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:53.050
but still was a very well protected,
you know,

484
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:56.960
fairly well protected a hotel that a lot of westerners who stayed in yeah.

485
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.840
And you just said,
oh,
I'm going to walk outside and check it out.

486
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.900
No security,
no security.
He was getting enough it.
Yeah.
Jess,
uh,

487
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.390
can I shoot and,
yeah.
And I,
and I,
I,

488
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.570
I found this picture of this kid and I still have that picture on my website,

489
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.750
but it's a little kid and he just pulls his head out of the Wilson.

490
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:18.340
He's swimming in this fountain.

491
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:20.470
Then you wouldn't believe what was in the fountain.

492
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:22.000
I couldn't believe these kids are swimming in it,

493
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:23.810
but he just sort of popped his head out and,
uh,

494
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.720
stood there and flexed his muscles.
And it was just a young nine,

495
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:33.310
10 year old guy just flexing his muscles and the light was fantastic and it just

496
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:37.390
made such a beautiful image.
I mean,
it really did.
And I thought,
okay,

497
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:43.000
I'll just go ahead and I've shot a really nice picture and I felt really proud

498
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:45.850
of myself on I thought,
okay.
And I just walked that back in.

499
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:49.150
And of course it was mayhem happening and what Reuters were actually doing was

500
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.830
in there in the process of moving out of the Palestine Hotel to,
um,

501
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.000
a house that they'd rented because we were then becoming quite a big outfit.

502
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.170
And the Palestine has held,
was never going to house it,
uh,

503
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.610
the amount of staff that we had.

504
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.380
So we were moving out to a big house just a couple of blocks away.
But again,

505
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.400
it was like Belfast,

506
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:13.360
I had got something under my belt and I felt pretty good about it and I thought,

507
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:15.620
okay,
right,
let's bring it on.
Um,

508
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.160
let's see how many places I can get to,
how many stories I can shoot,
um,

509
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.840
every day.
And I was,
I didn't want to stop shooting.
I just,

510
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.590
I want it to get up at seven in the morning and go and what with the light.

511
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.270
And then middle of the day was never really a good time to shoot because the

512
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:35.730
light was dreadful.
Um,

513
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.020
and then I'd wait for the sort of late afternoon and the Golden Hour,
uh,

514
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.260
which became tricky because we were never really allowed to be out at dark.
Um,

515
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.830
so I just want it to shoot,
shoot,
shoot,
shoot,
shoot.

516
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.460
And of course it doesn't quite work out that way because there were certain

517
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:58.951
responsibilities on a photographer whose first language is English.

518
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.850
When you go into,
uh,
a place like Baghdad where the,

519
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.620
the captioning on images is extremely important and it's extremely important at

520
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:10.780
the captioning is correct.
The information is correct,

521
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.100
it's a valid verified and it's has no spelling mistakes.

522
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:20.140
And of course,
being the only photographer there,
that first language is English.

523
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.260
I ended up wearing where are most of the photographers from what we had,

524
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.500
I mean all over Europe or if we had different,
you know,

525
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.260
and there was maybe only four,
four of us in there at a time,

526
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.390
three or four was in there at the time.
Um,
and I've got a French or guy,

527
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.120
a German Jaeger Croatian.
Yeah,
absolutely.
You know,
and we were all looking for,

528
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.800
you know,
we're all,

529
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.780
<v 3>we're all looking for those great pictures.</v>

530
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.920
So in a you began to wonder,
okay,

531
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:49.610
how's this going to be divided up every day?
Who's going to get what,
you know,

532
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.720
am I going to get you looking for pictures at this point that are good pictures

533
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.860
that you want to see or you looking for pictures that are going to be news,

534
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.730
are going to be front page newspaper.
Which one of those two?
Or is it both?

535
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.240
Primarily,
if I'm completely honest,
because,

536
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.120
because a picture of like when you describe that picture of a kid pulling his

537
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:11.450
hat out of this dirty water,
he's 10 years old and he's flexing.

538
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.720
That's just an awesome image.
Right?
And I'm sure that's a great picture.

539
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.540
That picture is not going on the front page of newspapers though,
is it?

540
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.810
Absolutely not.
But you don't,
but,

541
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.850
but that's your focus is I want to get good pictures that are capturing the

542
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:28.640
images of what you're seeing around you as opposed to,
hey,

543
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:30.710
I just want this front page picture.
Yeah.

544
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.500
I mean I was never really one for looking for publications.

545
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.440
I was always shooting for mate.
I mean somebody wants to ask me in an interview,

546
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.980
who's your biggest audience?
I humbled me because that's who I'm shooting full.

547
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.290
Um,
so I'm not looking to please
editors,

548
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.340
whole whatever.
Obviously it helps if that helps with what you've done.
Yeah.

549
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.480
But I was primarily looking to satisfy myself and I've never,

550
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.800
that's never changed with me.
Um,
and so yeah,

551
00:33:57.801 --> 00:34:02.660
I totally understand that.
You know,
when you're in a situation,
um,
I say that,

552
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:05.510
but obviously we'll get onto something like to that showed I completely didn't

553
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:08.050
understand.
But,
um,

554
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:11.600
I understand when this is the front page and I understand the impacts and I

555
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.960
understand what they mean to the company.
Totally.
And don't get me wrong,

556
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.110
when I was getting front pages,
it was a great feeling.
You know,

557
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.160
it sort of verified,

558
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:23.410
you're justified to find that you were out there and you were doing it.
Um,

559
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:24.763
but you know,

560
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.800
there are so many other agencies out there and so many other photographers out

561
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:30.680
there,
you have to get really lucky or you just have to get that one image that

562
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:35.240
separates it from everyone else.
And I knew how,
you know,
how difficult that is.

563
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.010
So I,
I never concerned myself with looking for that image.

564
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.780
I sort of began to think,
listen,
if I think the image is strong,

565
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.463
um,

566
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.290
you have a bit of confidence in your own ability to judge whether or not an

567
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:54.230
image is strong or not on whether or not it has a good chance of making.

568
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.750
So if you will not,
if it say,
listen,
this features today,

569
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:02.690
just go out and find something that,
you know,
every picture you shoes,

570
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:07.550
not going to tell the story of what's happening in Iraq.
But for me,
that picture,

571
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.750
that boy,
that day,

572
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.670
three days off to whatever bank that had been liberated now had a kid playing in

573
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:17.210
the water and looking,
feeling happy.
And I thought yet,
you know what,

574
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:18.230
that's what's happening.

575
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.380
That whatever's happening in Baghdad and now is being that child is a conduit if

576
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:25.210
we're capturing them.
Yeah.

577
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:28.630
Captures her lotion and the spirit of what's going on around here.
Yeah.

578
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.380
And that's,
that's,

579
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.510
that's a good overall I think attitude to have with everyone.

580
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.010
And you hear this all the time,
right?
He would say,
you know,
do what you're

581
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.060
<v 0>go with your heart is basically what you're saying.
Absolutely.
And I,</v>

582
00:35:41.061 --> 00:35:44.070
and I'm an agreement with you,
I mean,
and again,
we've talked about this before,

583
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.080
even just with what we're doing here.

584
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:51.860
This is based on what we want to do in our toughest audience or our most

585
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:56.280
important audiences.
Like by us,
you know,
what do we want to do?
What can we,

586
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.120
how do we feel about making this and how does it feel to record it and how does

587
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:01.620
it feel when I put the headphones on and listen to it?

588
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:04.600
Isn't what I want to hear because that's what,
you know,

589
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.620
that song I'm doing it and we're doing it more for the value of itself rather

590
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:15.510
than,
I mean,
there's no doubt that we're not saying,
hey everybody listen to this.

591
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.373
You know,
cause

592
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.650
<v 4>we know that this isn't for everybody and we're okay with that.</v>

593
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.860
And I think that's a good attitude,
dad.
Yeah.

594
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.170
That's usually how it turns out the best anyway.

595
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:31.350
Because you know what you like and you know what's going to make what you like

596
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:33.610
good or look good.
Your case,

597
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:38.740
if you try to estimate what everyone else likes,
all you have is this,

598
00:36:38.741 --> 00:36:42.190
like gray,
put brownish water.

599
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.300
You're not talking about just one other individual that you know really good.

600
00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:48.970
You're talking about a bunch of people.
So a lot of times people,

601
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.240
and it turns out real obvious when they're trying to please other people with

602
00:36:52.241 --> 00:36:55.000
what they're doing.
And she only goes for so many things.

603
00:36:55.001 --> 00:36:57.270
Just like how you're saying.
Yeah.
So you know,

604
00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.030
they're trying to basically play for the cheap seats.
They're trying,
you know,

605
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.963
they're trying to,

606
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.540
we talked about this where the goal should be doing a good job,

607
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.540
doing the best that you can do.
And we talked about it with Jujitsu,

608
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:12.340
with everything that the belt isn't the goal,
the front page,
that's not the goal.

609
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.950
The goal is to do the best that you can do for your work,
you know?
Yeah.

610
00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.710
And like I said,
if,
if you,
if you don't do it that way,
man,
it just,

611
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.900
you can smell it from a Ma from either way,
man.
I mean,

612
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I don't know that there are any,

613
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:31.620
<v 2>apart from even even the image that did make all the front swabs in Iraq,</v>

614
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.733
um,

615
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.460
I don't think in my career there's one image that's made front page that I would

616
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.000
keep and put in a portfolio of images.

617
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.390
So that just shows you that the stuff that I really like is,

618
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.710
is really the stuff that most people don't see.
And it's,
you know,

619
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.090
people will say,
Oh,
you shall that picture.
Yeah.
And I really liked that picture.

620
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.860
Um,
and I have really weird reasons for really liking that picture.
But the,

621
00:37:56.861 --> 00:38:00.820
and that's the stuff that I really enjoy doing is most people never see that

622
00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:04.810
stuff,
you know?
And they're surprised when they do see it.
But I,
there's,

623
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.230
I don't think there is a picture that I would take from a front page that I've

624
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:11.200
had,
um,
that I would want to keep and show.

625
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.460
<v 0>And,
and that's one thing I know from,
from knowing you and things you've told me,</v>

626
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.360
there's times where you're looking at a picture and you're saying there's a

627
00:38:19.361 --> 00:38:23.320
tragedy here.
This is a person's life being destroyed.

628
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.950
I'm not going to sell this fixture,
I'm not going to publish this picture.

629
00:38:26.951 --> 00:38:29.660
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna delete this picture.
You know,
you,

630
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:31.690
you have your own personal standards,

631
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:36.520
which I have the utmost respect for that you're not going to,
I mean,

632
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:40.390
there's so many people in me,
especially now with social media and everyone's,

633
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:43.570
everyone's a photographer now now because everyone has an iPhone and people will

634
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.351
just shoot.
I mean,

635
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:49.270
there's whole websites that are dedicated to debasing people.
Right.

636
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:53.590
You know,
and,
and the fact that you're a professional and you,
you've drawn,

637
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.000
you drew that line a long time ago is very respectable.

638
00:38:59.070 --> 00:38:59.903
<v 2>MMM.</v>

639
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.940
<v 0>So you got some kids and you've got some nice things about the euphoria of Iraq</v>

640
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:09.490
as it kicks off.
They're liberated.

641
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:11.830
And there's also some,

642
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.700
some horror mixed in there as well.
Yeah,
yeah,

643
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.180
<v 2>absolutely.
Um,</v>

644
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.890
just an a and it always comes when you least expect it.

645
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.020
Um,
and

646
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.700
we just moved into this new house in Baghdad and everything was set up an old

647
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:33.110
the are set up.
And um,

648
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.780
I knew it was about five o'clock in the afternoon and a call came in and the

649
00:39:38.781 --> 00:39:42.190
cool just said,
a photographer and a

650
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.530
TV guy,
we need to get to this address in Baghdad.

651
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.290
And I was sitting there and Jack said,
Kiran,
you know,
off you go,

652
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.820
um,
and take,
um,
take it obviously took a vest and the hat,

653
00:39:58.821 --> 00:39:59.810
we always have the trouble with those.

654
00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:04.160
And we traveled to down with vehicles everywhere.
So,
um,
we,

655
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.740
we went to this address and I sort of,

656
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.970
I got out onto the pavement and I was looking around and I,
I,
we had no idea.

657
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.720
We had no idea why we've been called.

658
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.280
And somebody came running up to me as soon as they saw the cameras and they
said,

659
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.060
are you the photographer from Reuters?
And I said,
yeah.
And they said,
okay,

660
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.300
wait here.
And they went to get,
uh,
uh,

661
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.690
a gentleman,
he,
and he came out and he was,
um,

662
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.060
I couldn't understand what he was saying.

663
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.070
And there was somebody there sort of translating.

664
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.920
Then it soon came to pass that his son had just been killed from,

665
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.310
he'd found an IED and he just been,
um,

666
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.650
it had just blown up while he was,

667
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.380
he and his friends were playing with it and it was the young,

668
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.920
it was a kid that was killed,
his son,
and I'm,

669
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.310
the father just had said something to the interpreter and the interpreter said,

670
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.130
listen,
can you wait?
He'll be back.
And he came back with a plastic bag.

671
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.420
And I wasn't even up up until that moment.

672
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.440
I would just wasn't aware of what was,
what was going on.
Um,

673
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.110
but I think the TV cameraman had sort of,
uh,

674
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.810
grasped the situation a little bit quicker than me,

675
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.190
and he started to,
uh,

676
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.990
produce body parts from the bag that was,

677
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.550
you know,
um,
uh,
they were unrecognizable as body parts,

678
00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:34.910
but they were coming of this bag in and the interpreter saying,

679
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:39.911
he needs you to photograph this because he wants you to show the rest of the

680
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.990
world that his son was killed playing with an Iad.

681
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:49.970
And he doesn't want his son's death to be in vain and he can't start grieving

682
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.960
until you take these pictures.

683
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.490
And so I think I took six or seven pictures,

684
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.773
um,

685
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:07.930
and he ended up putting the plastic bag back down on the floor and he just said,

686
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:12.530
thank you.
And it was just shock run.
And he just,

687
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:15.320
then he walked in and the interpreter said,
now he can start to grieve.

688
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.470
And it was then that I noticed that the,
um,
the,

689
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:23.180
the TV a journalist,
the cameraman was,

690
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:28.010
he was Iraqi and he just completely
collapsed.

691
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.650
Um,
and I remember having to get him back into the car because what had the heat

692
00:42:32.651 --> 00:42:37.651
just witness was just so shocking and I was just numb going all the way back to

693
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:45.930
the office because,
you know,
I,
I,

694
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.020
I just hadn't anticipated anything like that happening.

695
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:56.470
And it just come out of the blue and I understood why I could understand the

696
00:42:58.071 --> 00:43:01.580
father sentiments.
I totally got what he was trying to do.

697
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.050
But at the same time I totally understood that this,
you know,

698
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.760
those images weren't,
couldn't go on the why.

699
00:43:08.761 --> 00:43:13.160
They were just so utterly horrific and graphic.

700
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.670
And I remember as I was shooting,
I just,

701
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.080
I wasn't even looking,
so I had my,
I remember my,

702
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:24.170
I was the camera,
but I wasn't even looking at what was,
you know,

703
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.340
sort of view apart from the first moment.
If you were to say to me,
you know what?

704
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.330
I couldn't tell you.

705
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.410
I just knew that it was just coming out and being held up and being put back.

706
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.470
I couldn't even bring myself to look.
And then I sort of got back and I,

707
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.260
the first thing I did was just delete.

708
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.660
And I never actually said to my bosses there that I've deleted those images.

709
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:53.180
I just thought,
I am not putting those images on the wire.

710
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.750
I sort of took an executive decision there and then at that time he didn't

711
00:43:56.751 --> 00:44:01.310
mention anything to anyone else there.
And the only thing I had was that I kept,

712
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:05.090
was it just a portrait of the father so we could move the portrait of the father

713
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.830
and talk about the story.
Um,
and

714
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.850
I think I then spoke to my dad that night and I sort of

715
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.000
took the,
began sat phone and just writing him.

716
00:44:19.001 --> 00:44:22.910
And I just told him what had just happened.
And we were sitting in the garden.

717
00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:27.320
And then that,
um,
that night,
um,

718
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.680
Reuters wanted to give the staff a,

719
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.390
and so they'd organized a barbecue and there was,
um,
you know,

720
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:37.800
there was going to be some,
there was,

721
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.920
I think a belly dancer turned up and it was an amazing night because all the

722
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:46.290
Iraqis that had not been able to party in 40 years,

723
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:49.530
we're all sitting on the roofs of their houses surrounding the house that we

724
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:51.960
were on.
And they were just listening to the music.

725
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:53.490
And it was an incredible thing to see.

726
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:58.800
But you'd gone from something that happened like that at five o'clock to

727
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:01.800
something,
a barbecue that was happening at 7:00 PM.

728
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.700
And those moments were incredibly difficult to sort of disseminate and work out

729
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:10.410
what was going on because,

730
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.800
and of course it was something I kept to myself apart from the,

731
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:16.620
I think maybe they find out maybe the TV journalist had said something,

732
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:21.480
but I just didn't want speak to anyone remotely connected to the office about

733
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.520
what had just happened,
you know.
Um,
and I do.
And I think,
to be honest,

734
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:30.840
they would've completely agreed that this is not imagery that we can put out,

735
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:33.450
you know,
it serves no purpose and it's just,
you know,

736
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:38.850
just not MGB that they would move.
So,
um,
so yeah,
there was,

737
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:45.020
there was plenty of that in Iraq and you sort of had to just take it in your

738
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:51.621
stride because the next day you'd be up and there'd be the next story and you'd

739
00:45:52.591 --> 00:45:55.620
sort of move on to that.
But that would still be in the back of your mind,

740
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.390
you know?
And then do you know,
quite honestly soon enough,
you know,
if,

741
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.070
if you're busy and you're doing a lot of stuff when you're sitting around and

742
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:04.890
not doing anything,
that's when you really began to think about stuff.

743
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.580
But if you're busy and you're out and you're traveling.
So a week after that,

744
00:46:08.581 --> 00:46:10.590
I would,
I was taking anything and he was,

745
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.830
even if I was being sent out on stuff that I thought,
ah,
why,

746
00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:18.030
why am I being sent to do this?
You know?
Um,

747
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.160
I didn't mind.
I just thought I'll take it again better than

748
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.070
<v 0>sitting around and just see with your own.
Totally.
Totally.
I absolutely,
you know,</v>

749
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.910
and um,
and it's also a weird,

750
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:34.050
and it's hard for people that they haven't been in a war zone before to

751
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:37.740
understand how things like what you're talking about this obviously everyone

752
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.280
anticipates or expects that there's the horror of war.

753
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.820
But then understand the barbecue part.

754
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.650
Let like that's a hard thing for people to understand that Yep,

755
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.750
you can be what does three months into this war and we've got the Reuters staff

756
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.420
having a staff party.
I mean,
okay.
Um,

757
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.540
people in America know what a little staff office party is.
Hey guys,

758
00:46:57.541 --> 00:47:00.360
we're going to go,
we're going to order some pizzas.
They do that.

759
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.490
They do that in these war zones and,
and the military does it.
The,

760
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.500
the,
I mean,
I've talked about it a bunch.
I mean,

761
00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:11.130
these big basis that we had eventually built had subway sandwiches,

762
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:15.940
the company subway and the company Burger King and the company Starbucks were on

763
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.140
these bases.
So if you wanted to have a little subway party for your boys,

764
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.600
you could do that.
Fire up the grill,
have,
you know,

765
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.990
so it's really hard dichotomy for people to understand that inside the,

766
00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:31.750
the protected areas,
we carve out little of America,
little chunks of freedom.

767
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.340
Did you take any pictures of what the Iraqi's looking at the party?
Yeah,
I did.

768
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.700
That must have been awesome.
But you know what,
they weren't great pictures

769
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.593
<v 2>because</v>

770
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.970
it was so dark and it was,

771
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.070
I took a few and I saw an under course.

772
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:52.180
There are other photographers there that were taking stuff as well,
you know.
Um,

773
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.770
so yeah,
I did.
And I,
I've always thought about that.
I remember those pictures,

774
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.860
but they didn't,
we didn't,
they weren't good enough.
I just,

775
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.080
I just didn't shoot it well enough.
You know,

776
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.500
I just didn't have the right lens and I just,
yeah.
And uh,

777
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.410
and I think that was the sort of,
uh,
you know,
um,

778
00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.690
that might've been as a result of what had happened earlier,
but,
um,
yeah,

779
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.190
I have thought about that.
I have thought about those an f

780
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.980
and that remains with me.

781
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:24.260
It's a memory that I saw because I think,
you know,
it's like anything,

782
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.080
if you concentrate so hard on taking pictures,

783
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.630
<v 0>you never actually take anything in.</v>

784
00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:31.140
But that was a moment that I really wanted to take in because it was just

785
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:34.380
incredible to see these people out on their roofs.

786
00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:39.030
Just enjoying the music and not being afraid.

787
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.960
And you know,
somebody said to me,
this is not happened in 40 years.

788
00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:45.840
And I just thought that was just incredible.

789
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.080
And those are the people that I talk about in ours.

790
00:48:49.081 --> 00:48:53.220
I always end up trying to explain to people that there's the normal citizen.

791
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:58.221
Iraq is a normal person that wants to have a job and raise their kids and have a

792
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:03.300
house and that's what they want to do.
And it's really hard.
I mean,

793
00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:06.480
America does a terrible job of showing that.
I mean,

794
00:49:06.481 --> 00:49:10.740
America media does a terrible job of showing what that is.

795
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.130
Nearly all you see is the crazies.
All you see is the extremists.

796
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.670
But that's a great example of people going,
hey,
you know what?

797
00:49:17.671 --> 00:49:21.600
We've been oppressed for 40 years.
They're listening to music.
This is awesome.

798
00:49:21.601 --> 00:49:23.620
Let's,
let's watch him.
And,
and,

799
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:28.290
and those are the people that wanted to take Iraq in the right direction.

800
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:30.763
Um,

801
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.190
that you did end up getting some pretty important or maybe not important,

802
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:37.680
well maybe important,
but you ended up,
uh,
with some,

803
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.990
some pictures that did end up on the,
on the front pages of yeah,
that's right.

804
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:44.960
Newspapers just right.
It was,
um,

805
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.960
<v 2>coming off the back of another amazing story where the,</v>

806
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.340
I'd been to nudge to follow,

807
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:54.500
follow a cleric who was coming back who'd been exiled 40 years before,
uh,

808
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.610
by Saddam.
And uh,

809
00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:01.670
he was coming back to nudge Jeff and I spent two or three days down there

810
00:50:03.331 --> 00:50:04.260
waiting for him.

811
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:09.290
And that whole scenario of him turning up with thousands of followers and being

812
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.960
pushed into the mosque,
cause I'm trying to photograph him and you know,

813
00:50:15.961 --> 00:50:19.540
finding myself in the middle of a mosque as a westerner,
just thinking,
you know,

814
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.630
how did I get in here?
It was just,
you know,

815
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:26.490
and that's what happens when you stand in front of the door and wait for the guy

816
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.650
to turn up,
but you're just going to get taken in with them.
So,
um,

817
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.660
and I'd done that and I'd really enjoyed that job and this sort of anticipation

818
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:38.890
of waiting for this guy to turn up.
And it was an incredible moment.
Um,

819
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:43.400
and we would,
I'd left and of course in those,

820
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:46.700
in the days when I'd walked from the mosque in the draft back to the hotel,

821
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.570
which was probably a mile,
you know,
and I,
and those,

822
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:51.460
you didn't think twice had all my camera gear around me.

823
00:50:51.461 --> 00:50:54.140
You just didn't think twice about walking down that street.

824
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.930
And we got back into our armored vehicle and we traveled back to Baghdad and

825
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.470
about three quarters,
the way that we got a call and it said,

826
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:08.590
you need to turn off to visit a mass grave has been found at Hiller and you're

827
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.370
on roots while you're going to pass it on the way back into Baghdad.

828
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.440
So can you stop off and have a look?

829
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.500
And my first reaction was I was so shattered from the four days in the job that

830
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.780
I was sort of slightly resigned about having to,
you know,
um,
you know,
um,

831
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.860
really because we have to be back in Baghdad before it's dark.
And you know,

832
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.680
I just,
I had a really sort of ambivalent attitude to it.
So we,

833
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.010
we found this place when we pulled up and everyone said,
right,
hey guys,

834
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.120
you've got literally 40 minutes because we got to be out of here before the

835
00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:47.954
sun's down.

836
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.130
So we got out and I just sort of walked over this mound and as I walked over the

837
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:53.150
mound that was here,

838
00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:58.151
that there was just hundreds of bodies just laid out in front of me and they'd

839
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:00.434
been there.

840
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.210
I think it was probably about four or five days,

841
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.000
I think it was obvious how long they'd been there because you could see how many

842
00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:11.630
bodies that they pulled out of the pit that they dug there.

843
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:15.740
And it was obviously an execution spot where I sit down.
I'd taken them,

844
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.650
I don't know how many years before,

845
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.520
and they'd all been executed a just a bullet to the back of the head,
all men.

846
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.720
And they were,
um,
they,
they dug them up and pulled the bodies out.

847
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.320
And I imagine the relatives had obviously had an idea of where they were,

848
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.550
but they were never able to do anything until,
you know,
they were in a position,

849
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.580
Baghdad had been liberated and they felt it was safe enough now to go and try.

850
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:41.660
And I think they knew sedan was on the run.
So,
um,

851
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.840
they were,
um,

852
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.480
excavating this area and they'd found all these bodies and they put these bodies

853
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:52.280
into plastic bags and they had a name tag on each body.
And,

854
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:56.780
um,
that's when I realized,
okay,
this is,
um,

855
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.080
this is probably quite well,

856
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:04.490
this is bigger than any other mass grave that I'd shot,
um,
during my time there.

857
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.030
So I started shooting it and I knew the light was going down and the light was

858
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:11.420
incredible.
It was just incredible.
The lights on the sand and everything.

859
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.990
And I just started shooting and I started shooting the women that were sitting

860
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:16.580
around the edge behind the barbed wire.

861
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:19.220
So it obviously made the women sit round and then when they'd finished digging,

862
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:23.240
the women were able to walk through the bodies and try and identify to family

863
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:26.220
members.
And they were just picking up,
um,

864
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.410
id cards and you know,
trying to sort of figure out who was who.

865
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:37.270
And I remember there was one really bizarre moment where somebody had taken a

866
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:43.251
body what was remains of the skeleton and the corpse and they laid it out in the

867
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:48.300
shape of somebody just lying on the ground.

868
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.780
It wasn't a case of the remains were put into a plastic bag.

869
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:55.620
They had actually almost constructed this person as they were.

870
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.610
And so they were laid out and it looked like a person lying on the ground with

871
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:03.090
their arms out and their legs in the correct position and the head to one side.

872
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.770
And I just remember a young kid just walking past,
holding his dad's hand,

873
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.020
just staring at this.
And I thought,

874
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.100
that must be an unbelievable thing for a kid that age to be staring at.

875
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.150
And I remember taking that picture and it's,
um,

876
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.940
I remember thinking that is,
I,

877
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.000
I've never seen anything like that and I thought it was,

878
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:28.470
somebody has actually gone to the trouble of trying to do this and I couldn't

879
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:32.520
work out why.
And I thought life,
they done this,
you know,

880
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.600
I was pretty sure that it didn't help with the identification of that person,

881
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:40.020
but somebody had gone to the trouble of laying this,
this corpse out.

882
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.110
So I shot that picture and,

883
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:45.510
and I started moving around and shooting the women and the women were crying.

884
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.900
Um,
and I found,
I subsequently found out they were only,

885
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.900
they were crying because I had turned up with a camera.

886
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.730
So I had altered that situation and when they realize that I was no longer

887
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:58.350
interested in shooting them because they were,

888
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:02.520
they were crying because they thought this is what this photographer needs to

889
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:05.790
see.
Um,
yeah,
I just,
I,
I,

890
00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:09.870
they went back to playing with their dice and so I sort of moved away.
I thought,

891
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:14.320
well,
I won't be taking any more pictures of that.
Um,
yeah.
And just in and saw,

892
00:55:14.321 --> 00:55:18.180
and they had,
and I know this isn't the right word,
but remind me Jocko,

893
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:21.960
what's the American version of a JCB?
Oh,
backhoe.
A backhoe.

894
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:26.280
So they had a backhoe in this pit pulling out the bodies and they had a couple

895
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:31.260
of kids underneath collecting the,
the remains and just put into one side.

896
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.203
Um,

897
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:36.930
and these kids were doing it as if it was just another day,

898
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.970
you know,
it was no,
it was impossible to see the,

899
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:46.110
if there was any shock or any,
you know,
they were just getting on with it.
They,

900
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.990
it was as if they knew this job has to be done,
so we're going to do it.
Um,

901
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:55.890
and it would just,
you know,
I remember seeing a skull roll off the,

902
00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.750
uh,
the claw of this backhoe,
you know,
in this kid caught it.

903
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.570
He just called it like a goalkeeper would catch a football and they just put it

904
00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:08.340
into a bag.
And uh,
yeah,
I watched that one.
I didn't actually shoot that one.

905
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.360
And,
um,
so it was a case of,
um,

906
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.970
getting the job done as quickly as possible,

907
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.060
getting back in the van and getting back to Baghdad.

908
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:23.090
And I got back to Baghdad and I moved I think four or five images because I was

909
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.920
never really a person to move a lots of imagery.

910
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.500
I thought if I had some really good stuff,

911
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:31.750
I didn't want to dilute it with stuff that I thought was inferior.

912
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:36.751
So I just put the four or five best images out and was just hanging around.

913
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:39.670
When the,
uh,
the chief came in and he said,
listen,

914
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.510
how many pictures did you move of that story?

915
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:46.090
And I sit in that maybe four or five and he said,
when I see you better,

916
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.230
you better move some will because it's become the number one story in the world.

917
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:55.350
And I think there was over 2000 bodies they discovered at this place.

918
00:56:56.321 --> 00:57:00.040
And of course I then thought cheese.
Okay.
Right.

919
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:03.160
And then I just sort of slightly panicked because I thought,
well,

920
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:05.760
I've just edited my stuff and I've moved five pictures,

921
00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:10.450
what am I now going to find in there?
That's going to improve the file.

922
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:15.010
So I went through my,
you know,
my on my computer screen,

923
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:19.460
just going through the pictures and thinking,
you know,

924
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.200
I really wished that I'd spend a little more time shooting that moment because I

925
00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:28.660
shut it and thought actually do you know I'm going to get something a bit

926
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:31.480
stronger than that in a minute.
So,
and I just,

927
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:35.590
and I sought and then I'd see another image and I work it through anything.
Okay.

928
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:38.200
I think the fourth image in this sequence is going to be the one.

929
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.740
And then I realized there wasn't the fourth image on.
I just kept saying no.

930
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:44.110
So what were you doing?

931
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.420
And of course at the time I had no idea that this was going to be the number one

932
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:52.900
story in the world.
And so I ended up moving,

933
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.130
I think I ended up moving maybe 15 pictures,
maybe more from this.

934
00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.430
And every time I put a picture,
I thought,
you know what?

935
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:05.670
And it just so annoyed me that I hadn't maybe approached the job as in,

936
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.290
in the right manner.

937
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.150
I just had seen the light and I'd shot what I thought would be really strong.

938
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:18.610
And like I say,
you know,
in my career I miss as many pictures as I get.

939
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:19.091
In fact,

940
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:22.660
I miss more than I get and I can tell you about all the great pictures I didn't

941
00:58:22.661 --> 00:58:26.590
take.
Um,
and that would make a great book.
Um,

942
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.680
but so I was just really angry with myself and angry that I'd had this

943
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:35.560
opportunity and I'd maybe blown it,
you know,
and I thought,
well,

944
00:58:35.561 --> 00:58:38.260
this is why I'm here.
I'm here to shoot this.

945
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:42.580
I'm here to show the world that this is why this is what's happening and you

946
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:42.960
know,

947
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.620
and how could I have been so stupid as to not have concentrated a little bit

948
00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:50.890
harder at while I was saying,
and I know we only had half an hour to 40 minutes,

949
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.520
but still I could have shot five times as much in that time.
But I didn't,

950
00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:58.900
I just chose to meticulously walk through,
pick my moments and shoot them.

951
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.070
So we moved these pictures and fortunately the next day I think one of the,

952
00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:08.530
I think it was an image of a woman in an uh,

953
00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:11.980
walking past a skull that was just on,

954
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:14.530
I shot it from really low down on the ground and it was really,

955
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:17.800
it was an upright and that's what suited most of the papers is an upright image

956
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:18.663
of vertical.

957
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:23.510
And that was what got used on all the New York Times,

958
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:26.000
everywhere that just the Washington Post,

959
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:29.690
all the British newspapers everywhere around the world and run with this story.

960
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.930
And although we were the first guy there,

961
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:35.870
there were a couple of other photographers that were there at the time,
um,

962
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.370
with me,
but they didn't work for an international wire agency.

963
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.040
And that's the beauty about working for an international wire agencies that

964
00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:47.510
their reach and their cloud is just phenomenal.

965
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.730
And it doesn't matter whether you're working for a newspaper,

966
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:51.680
but as soon as you work for an international wire agency,

967
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.520
particularly one as good as Reuters,
you,

968
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.760
you then realize,
actually when I've got this picture,

969
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.990
it's really going to get out there.
Everybody is going to see it,
you know,

970
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:08.460
and that's a huge buzz.
Um,
and it did and it made an,

971
01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.760
it made the play was incredible.

972
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:15.500
And then my chief said to me,
okay,
can we,
you know,

973
01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:19.780
where you're going back to tomorrow?
And again,
I thought,
well,
you know,

974
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.530
I've just,
I've just been there and I had pretty much the place to myself.

975
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.570
And I knew going down the next day when I drove there,
it was a zoo.

976
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:35.050
There was just every photographer and every cameraman in Iraq was a hiller and

977
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:41.231
you couldn't shoot anything without getting another photographer or a cameraman

978
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.580
or a sound boom because of the UN.
And there were,

979
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.380
I think I did take a couple of pictures that day,
some very strong,

980
01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.160
a couple of strong pictures of a woman that had just discovered her husband and

981
01:00:52.161 --> 01:00:53.480
she was surrounded by her family.

982
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.860
And the bane of every photographer's life is the sound man's boom.

983
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.500
And this woman was making this,
um,

984
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.040
she was,
it was just dreadful waiting.
I mean,
I still remember it now.

985
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:14.270
It was awful.
The noise she was making,
it was really guttural.

986
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.960
And,
um,
it really went right through you.

987
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:23.170
And I remember being really download and enclose and trying to photograph this.

988
01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:28.440
And the next thing,
this furry boom just comes over at microphone and,
and,

989
01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:32.930
and he's trying to record the sound.
And that's what it was like.

990
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.740
And you're getting annoyed at a sound man who's just stepped in and trying to do

991
01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:38.300
something when you're trying to,
and you think,

992
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:41.780
and I'm getting annoyed with a guy who's trying to record a woman who's,

993
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.810
and the plumbing,
the depth of grief.

994
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.310
And I'm annoyed at him and I'm not thinking,
well,
listen,
what about her?
You know,

995
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:53.330
and in those situations,
you're not thinking about that.
You'll just,
I need to,

996
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:58.280
I need to shoot this picture.
So,
Yep.
Um,
the next day it was a zoo.

997
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.620
And,
uh,
but I was able to stand back and think,
you know,
um,

998
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.500
I got lucky that yesterday and I learned a really valuable lesson,

999
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.000
which is,
um,

1000
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.900
it go into every situation like that as if you're never going to see a situation

1001
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:17.720
like that again.
I mean actually even further back,

1002
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.070
there was a chance that you could have,
I know we can't make

1003
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.390
<v 0>it,
we won't be home before dark,</v>

1004
01:02:21.391 --> 01:02:24.960
so we're just going to head back Baghdad and of course,
but that's right.

1005
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.720
But ultimately in that car that wasn't,

1006
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.390
that probably wasn't going to be my cool.

1007
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.370
So the somebody in the cow on,
I think I was with three or four others,

1008
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:38.410
somebody at the,
maybe the journalists might've been the most senior in the,

1009
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.580
in the,
in the,
in the OMD vehicle at the time.
And she would have made that colon.

1010
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.430
She would have just said,
listen,
if this is what they want,

1011
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.300
we need to go and do it,
you know?
So,
um,
Yep.

1012
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:53.310
It came out okay at the end,
but it was,
that was close.

1013
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.030
And I had a,
when I first,
when I was doing my first seal platoon,

1014
01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.540
my leading petty officer,

1015
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:03.510
who is the senior will not even the senior,

1016
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.740
but the second senior of the enlisted guys.
Anyways,
he had this,

1017
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:12.180
this mantra and the mantra was always go out.

1018
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.000
Now when he said,
always go out.

1019
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:18.360
What he meant was always go out to the bar,

1020
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.350
always go out,
you know,
you could,
you pull in somewhere for night,
go out,

1021
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.890
you know,
that's always go out.
There's always some fun to be had.
And I actually,

1022
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.820
my mind,
I always twisted that mantra from his,

1023
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.900
always go out to go to the bar or go to the club.

1024
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:39.060
I change it to just always go out period.
So if there's an opportunity,

1025
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:41.200
there's an operation coming up,
we'll go out.
If there's a,

1026
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.180
if there's a bar to go to go out.
If there's something to do,
go and do it.

1027
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.600
It's just a little,
you know,
little something to think about.

1028
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.680
I didn't remind when you're sitting there thinking,
you know,

1029
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.640
maybe maybe wouldn't have been your call,
but if it was your call,

1030
01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:55.200
maybe you would have sloughed it off.

1031
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.860
And if you had the attitude of Noah always go out,
okay,
yeah,

1032
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.690
then you would have been their hunting percent.
Yup.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Um,

1033
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:08.480
and,
and
you get,

1034
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.770
I don't want to cut Iraq short,
but at the same time,

1035
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.110
there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about.

1036
01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:16.790
And hear other people talk about,

1037
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:21.791
but you get home from Iraq and um,

1038
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:29.320
you go back to your kind of normal day to day,
you said you were,
you know,

1039
01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:30.081
you saw some stuff,

1040
01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:34.910
but it wasn't like a major psychological effect that you noticed out of the
gate.

1041
01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:38.940
You came home,
Hey,
that was my job.
I did my job.
Um,

1042
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:45.010
next call you get big call is to go to Sri Lanka,

1043
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:50.090
which you mentioned briefly there.
And in Sri Lanka you were going,

1044
01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:55.091
because of the horrible tsunami that hit on boxing day and Americans don't know

1045
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:56.751
a boxing day is,

1046
01:04:56.751 --> 01:05:01.751
it's a day after Christmas and New England hit on boxing day and you get the

1047
01:05:01.881 --> 01:05:06.860
call to go out to Sri Lanka and shoot.

1048
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.420
Yeah,
that was,
um,

1049
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.270
I remember the,
the,
um,

1050
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.070
the desk working on boxing day

1051
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.780
<v 3>called me and I was running up my parents with my kids and we were all just</v>

1052
01:05:22.781 --> 01:05:27.210
about start opening Christmas presents.
And,
um,

1053
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.150
she said,
Karen,
you need to get on a plane.
He needs to go to Colombo.
This leak,

1054
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:37.660
um,
straight away.
And I said,
why?

1055
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:42.640
And she said,
well,
I'd be no hurt.
And I said,
I heard what she said,

1056
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:46.690
turn on the TV.
So I turned on the TV and uh,

1057
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.470
yeah,
it was like a nine 11 moment.
You know,
when you're sitting in,

1058
01:05:50.471 --> 01:05:55.010
you're looking,
you just think
I had no idea.
And,

1059
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:59.190
<v 0>and by the way,
just to,
just to kind of give some basic facts on this,</v>

1060
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:04.670
the tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean had the approximate energy of 23,000

1061
01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:10.320
Hiroshima atomic bombs.

1062
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:16.220
It was a magnitude 9.0 the rupture was 600 miles long.

1063
01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:20.790
It displaced the c four by 10 yards,

1064
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.370
600 miles,
10 yards.
So,
uh,

1065
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:30.370
trillions of trillions of tons of rocks moved.

1066
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.570
It's the largest earthquake and 40 years.
And within hours the,

1067
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:39.040
the killer waves started arriving.
And unfortunately,

1068
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:42.280
because of lack of communication and no warning systems in place,

1069
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.210
people were just not,
they weren't prepared for it throughout Asia.

1070
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.080
And they just got crushed.

1071
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:54.370
Absolutely crushed.
And,
uh,
you know,
you,
you said a nine,
11 moment,

1072
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:59.110
which I understand where you're coming from,
from a psychological standpoint of,

1073
01:06:59.111 --> 01:07:03.180
hey,
well I know what I was doing at this point on September 11th,
well,

1074
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:07.090
September 11th was 4,000,

1075
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.230
maybe 5,000 Americans killed the tsunami,

1076
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:14.590
resulted in almost a quarter million den.
I mean,

1077
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:18.430
just a massive destruction and

1078
01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.690
<v 3>you got the call.
So you got the call.</v>

1079
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:28.030
And it just happened to be because I was the guy on call.
Oh,
okay.
Boxing Day.

1080
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.650
So it could have gone to any photographer in London.
Um,

1081
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.230
so,
and they,
they Reuters had sort of,
there were,

1082
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.660
there were photographers that have gone to panda at j and,

1083
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.680
and other places and they needed somebody to go to Sri Lanka because they,

1084
01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.050
they had an idea that shrank had been pretty badly hit.

1085
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:48.130
And because it was my name on the scared for boxing day,

1086
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.670
that's why I got the call.
And I ended up going out the following,

1087
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.670
I think it was the 27th I flipped out.
And,
uh,
yeah,

1088
01:07:55.671 --> 01:08:00.040
it just one of those stories where you have to hit the ground running.

1089
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.750
So you're off the plane,

1090
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.590
you get through customs and you're straight to a car and you're into the office

1091
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.940
and you're speaking to the bureau chief there and you say,
right,
I'm here.

1092
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.980
So where am I going?

1093
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.810
And they are still trying to figure what's happened and where the,

1094
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:22.410
you know,
the the most severe damages and pretty much,
you know,

1095
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.380
most of the coastlines of Sri Lanka had been hit.

1096
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:28.190
So it didn't really matter where you went.

1097
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:32.780
You were always going to find something.
So they were trying to,
I said,

1098
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:35.540
I really want to get over to the other coast.
I don't want to get over to this,

1099
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:38.720
stay here where all the tourists come.
I want to get over to the other side.

1100
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.010
So we will literally try to find a helicopter that would get me straight over

1101
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:45.440
there.
But in the meantime,
while they were trying to work that out,

1102
01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:47.990
I just got in the car and I just drove down from Columbia,

1103
01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:51.050
just straight down through goal to just see what was going on.

1104
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.550
And again to get something under my belt.
And I just started shooting,
um,

1105
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:00.080
and then came back to the office.
Had you ever been in Sri Lanka before?

1106
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.950
I'd never been.
Srilanka No.
Um,
so,
uh,

1107
01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.890
go back to the office and I said,
listen,
um,
what's happening with the chopper?

1108
01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.180
And they said,
well,
you know,

1109
01:09:11.181 --> 01:09:14.480
it's not really happening but there might be a government minister that's going

1110
01:09:14.481 --> 01:09:15.314
to go across.

1111
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:17.960
So myself and a journalist got in the car and we went to the government

1112
01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:21.040
ministers office and um,

1113
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:25.880
he was going to get an a chopper and get over to the other side.

1114
01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:28.550
They have the coastline.
But before he did that,

1115
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:33.410
we were going to sit down and have lunch.
I was just thinking,
I can't listen.

1116
01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:37.200
Do you know what?
I really didn't want to sit here and have lunch.
Um,

1117
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:42.170
why don't we just get in that chopper and kept going.
But we had this,

1118
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.600
I had to go through this whole rigmarole and um,

1119
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:48.950
and then eventually we got to the chopper and we got up for about three minutes

1120
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:52.220
and a storm front came in,
chopper came back down.

1121
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:56.480
So that was that avenue of getting across and we would have been there in an

1122
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.510
hour.
So we had to work out another way.
So we,
uh,

1123
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:04.970
we drove to candy,
um,
in one of those,
uh,
we,
we,

1124
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.600
we found a car guy who drove us from Columbia,

1125
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.990
drove us all the way through the center of Sri Lanka to candy.

1126
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:16.670
And we got to candy.
And I remember that was New Year's eve when we got there,

1127
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:18.200
myself from the journalist.

1128
01:10:18.201 --> 01:10:20.510
And the coincidentally and the journalists that was with me,

1129
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.340
she was flying back from a holiday and she'd heard about the tsunami and she

1130
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:28.880
stopped off in Sri Lanka.
She was a lobby journalists that worked for Reuters.

1131
01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.100
But,
um,
so she was used to dealing with the politicians.
And,
um,

1132
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.310
she just said,
listen,
I'm a generalist and I need to,

1133
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:41.750
this is a story that I need to cover.
Um,
so she came in and she said,
listen,

1134
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.010
you know,
and I knew her on,
I said,
wow,
what are you doing here?
And she said,
well,

1135
01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:50.450
I,
you know,
can I be of help?
So I said,
let's go,
you know,

1136
01:10:50.451 --> 01:10:52.390
and we got in this car and we went,
um,

1137
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.120
and she had such an amazingly fresh take on a story like that,

1138
01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:05.710
purely because she was used to covering lobby in and,

1139
01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.460
uh,
back in the UK.
And because she wasn't a seasoned sort of,

1140
01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.620
I dunno,
a hostile environment,
journalists,

1141
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.220
<v 2>the way she would write stories and find stories was just like,</v>

1142
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:19.680
you just wouldn't have got it from,
uh,
you know,

1143
01:11:19.681 --> 01:11:21.540
she just had a completely different angle on it.

1144
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:25.800
So it was so refreshing to work with someone who just saw everything from a

1145
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:28.950
completely different viewpoint.
Everything was new to her.

1146
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:32.670
But that meant that her writing and everything was really fresh and vibrant,

1147
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:33.420
you know,

1148
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.020
so she was an absolute pleasure to work with and we sort of just teamed up and

1149
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:40.230
we got to the other side and as soon as we got to the other coast,
it,

1150
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.240
it flooded the whole area flooded,

1151
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:49.350
which meant no one could get in to that side of sure.
Lincoln.

1152
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:53.940
And we had that place to ourselves for over a week and we were staying in a

1153
01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:57.750
hotel where the floors were just two feet high in water.
I mean,

1154
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:02.070
but they still manage to get us rice every night.
I mean,

1155
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:04.290
it was just incredible how these people just manage.

1156
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.210
And of course you get out there and your
[inaudible] right,

1157
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.210
where do we go?
So let's just walk down to the coastline and,

1158
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:16.170
and let's just see what the situation is.
And of course you go down as a,

1159
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.860
um,
as a Westerner and,
and these people just think that your,

1160
01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.040
you can help them.
So they're coming up in there,

1161
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:26.160
showing the documentation in their passports and can you take this to the

1162
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:28.890
American embassy and can we get off the country?
And I have,

1163
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:30.950
I have relatives that live in the UK,

1164
01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:34.780
in relatives that live in America and I can leave.
And,
and,
and he knew you.

1165
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.150
I've never felt so helpless in my life.
Never felt so helpless.

1166
01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.460
<v 0>And I spent a fair amount of time in Sri Lanka back in,
back in the day.</v>

1167
01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:49.370
And the Sri Lankan people are just the nicest.
Yeah,

1168
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:53.730
absolutely.
Hindest Reuben,
hardworking.
I mean,
it just,
it's just a beautiful,

1169
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:57.840
and the countryside itself is absolutely stunningly beautiful.

1170
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.410
And so,
so I can imagine them doing,
going,

1171
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.470
jumping through hoops and doing whatever they had to do to get you a bowl of

1172
01:13:04.471 --> 01:13:06.890
rice when you came home at night and get ahead of them.

1173
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.710
And then you would meet the people

1174
01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:11.380
<v 2>that were living on the beach.
Uh,</v>

1175
01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.060
the homes were on the beach and they'd been hit by the wave and

1176
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:22.360
they would just immediately,
immediately rebuilding.
It was just,
okay,
listen,

1177
01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:23.523
this is what we've got to do.

1178
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.050
And they start rebuilding and I'll never forget wandering round.
Um,

1179
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:33.490
at that point on the,
on the tip on the eastern tip,
and I found,

1180
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:38.830
uh,
just there was a wall,
just a wall left of a house.

1181
01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:41.740
So I imagine it was the wall where there was the door and everything else had

1182
01:13:41.741 --> 01:13:43.540
gone.
It was one brick wall just standing up zone.

1183
01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:47.200
And if you sort of walked through this door,

1184
01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:52.380
you just saw golden sand and palm tree and there was a dresser,

1185
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:56.050
just a one wooden dresser against this back wall.

1186
01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.610
And the young guy came up to me and he'd said,
he said,
hey,
um,

1187
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:05.860
you photographer,
and where are you from?
And the,
you know,
the usual.

1188
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.640
And I sort of got chatting to him and,
and he said,
can I get you a drink?

1189
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.590
And said,
listen,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Seriously,
don't worry about it.
I'm,

1190
01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:17.230
I'm absolutely fine,
but thank you.
He said,
no,
no,
no.
Listen,

1191
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:20.620
I can run to the store,
which was about a mile inland.
Yeah.

1192
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:25.330
And I can get you a diet coke or a coke,
whatever it is.
I said,
please listen,
I'm,

1193
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:29.350
I'm seriously,
I'm absolutely fine.
He said,
okay,
well please sit.

1194
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.790
And he pulled up at crate and we just sat it down and I'm sitting in what used

1195
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:38.791
to be his main room of his house and he puts,

1196
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:42.400
let me get to the crate and lets me sit on it.

1197
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:47.020
And then he just shimmies up the coconut tree and he just pulls a coconut off

1198
01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:50.650
the top of the tree.
Shimmies back down.
And I'm thinking,

1199
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:55.420
and I really don't like coconut milk.
I mean,
cause it really,

1200
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:59.110
it doesn't agree with me.
So I just thought,
oh,
okay,
but you know,

1201
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:01.030
he's going to this effort so he can't down this.

1202
01:15:01.031 --> 01:15:06.031
And he took the top off and then he went to the dresser and he opened the drawer

1203
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:11.460
and he pulled out a tiny silver platter and he put the coconut on the platter.

1204
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.200
And then he handed it to me.
Um,

1205
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:20.320
I need even got a straw and he put a straw in it and he said,
please,
you know,

1206
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:25.321
you're in my home and I'm looking at the one wall is left of his home with his

1207
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:29.350
dresser.
And so I take a sip of this drink.
And I said,

1208
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.170
so tell me what I mean if this is your home,
the Dev,
I mean,

1209
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:39.580
you know,
the water was 25 feet away.
There's the golden sand.
I said,

1210
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.260
what happened?
And he sort of,

1211
01:15:41.261 --> 01:15:46.261
the wave came in and destroyed my house and it took away my parents,

1212
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:52.150
my wife,
my brothers and sisters and my six kids,
they're gone.

1213
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:59.280
And all I can think of is that he has tried to find somewhere for me to sit.

1214
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.900
He's going up a tree to get me a coconut and put on a silver platter.

1215
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.960
The only thing that's left in his house is this chest of drawers or a stressor

1216
01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:12.130
with its silver platter in it.

1217
01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:16.270
And he's more concerned about my welfare at that moment.

1218
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.110
And this is what had happened to him about five days earlier.

1219
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:26.070
And I remember thinking when I got back from Sri Lanka,

1220
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:30.640
I couldn't stop thinking about that conversation.

1221
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:34.000
And I think that was the time when it really hit me.

1222
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:39.330
It really hit me about what had happened and I can't even begin to describe.

1223
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.360
I think I had a numbness similar to their sort of numbness that I'd had in Iraq,

1224
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.960
but this was a different kind of numbness because the thing about the tsunami

1225
01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:57.301
was you were dealing with the living and it was the living that affected you.

1226
01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.640
It wasn't the death and it wasn't the,

1227
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.430
the bodies that have been swept a mile inland and ended up in people's houses

1228
01:17:06.431 --> 01:17:10.040
and stuff like that.
It was,
it wasn't the,
the,
you know,
you

1229
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.270
<v 3>would cover the funerals of all the different religious types there.
You just,</v>

1230
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.840
it's when you're speaking to the people that survived that you,
it's a,

1231
01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:23.340
it was a real,
a real level in a and m

1232
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.660
<v 0>well that just about sums up my,
you know,
that story about that guy.
I mean,</v>

1233
01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:31.940
first of all,
anybody that hears that story

1234
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.780
has to think to themselves,
you know,
oh,

1235
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:40.680
am I really doing the best I can to number one,
have a positive attitude.

1236
01:17:40.681 --> 01:17:45.450
Number two,
put other people before me.
I mean,
what a,
what a what a saint.
I mean,

1237
01:17:45.451 --> 01:17:49.080
that's just unbelievable.
And I remember actually as you were telling that story,

1238
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.970
I remember that when I was in Sri Lanka,
there was guys that,
you know,

1239
01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.200
they'd been fighting a war against the Tamil Tigers for many years.

1240
01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:59.010
And so that's who we were working with these guys.
And they would,

1241
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:03.720
they would be telling these war stories with any,

1242
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.000
it'd be showing you,
you know,
there's a guy that couldn't move his arm,
right?

1243
01:18:06.001 --> 01:18:09.480
He got shot in the arm with an AK 47 so now he was working as well as like a

1244
01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.190
secretary in the,
in the army.

1245
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:15.630
And he's just got this big smile on his face and he's telling me,
yeah,
you know,

1246
01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.790
and,
and I,
I got shot and how my arm doesn't work.
But,
um,
you know,

1247
01:18:20.791 --> 01:18:23.220
being a secretary is a pretty,
a pretty good job too.

1248
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.880
And it's just good to still be in the army and you just have this,
this,
uh,

1249
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.870
this feeling,
it probably the similar feeling that you have.

1250
01:18:30.871 --> 01:18:34.830
We're just looking at these people and you're saying,
how can you be so happy?

1251
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.600
Yeah.
And why can't I be there?
I want to be that happy.
But this is,

1252
01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:44.630
it's just so impressive and it puts everything in so much perspective when we

1253
01:18:45.301 --> 01:18:50.301
hear about somebody that's lost that much that's going to climb that tree that's

1254
01:18:50.941 --> 01:18:53.550
going to climb that tree for somebody else,

1255
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:59.400
even though they've lost everything themselves is a humbling.
So,
so credible.

1256
01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:04.380
Yeah.
So did you,
when you,
when you came home and you,
you know,

1257
01:19:04.381 --> 01:19:06.380
you told me about this earlier,
um,

1258
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:11.340
and you were just kind of getting into it.
I mean,
you felt like after Sri Long,

1259
01:19:11.341 --> 01:19:15.240
you know,
you go to Iraq and you see the war and that's,
that's one thing.

1260
01:19:15.241 --> 01:19:15.841
And like you said,

1261
01:19:15.841 --> 01:19:19.800
you're dealing with the dead and you're seeing people that were killed,

1262
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.870
but now you're dealing with the what's left behind it and you said that that

1263
01:19:24.871 --> 01:19:29.400
really had more of an impact on you then,
then I racked it,

1264
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:34.290
or the Northern Ireland did.
Yeah.
Did you,

1265
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:38.340
how did you,
how did you deal with that?

1266
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:44.310
<v 3>Well,
the Reuters policy is that,</v>

1267
01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:47.760
um,
when,
when you arrived back from a situation like that,

1268
01:19:47.761 --> 01:19:50.790
your line manager hands you a number,
you know,

1269
01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.580
quite discretely and says there's a number there if you need to call it.
Um,

1270
01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.360
and it's a sort of a helpline.

1271
01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:00.420
He knows sort of you've talked to a professional about what you've been through

1272
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:03.210
and it's sort of way of imagining the RTB,
that debrief.

1273
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:04.500
It's sort of a thing that they just sort of,

1274
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:08.040
you get that you start to talk about what it is you,
and I don't know.
I've

1275
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.500
<v 2>never been in a situation like that,
so I don't know what happens,</v>

1276
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:14.730
but I remember thinking,
I'm fine.
I don't need that.
That's cool.

1277
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:20.400
Um,
so,
uh,
again,
I couldn't have been more wrong.

1278
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.710
And,
um,
I ended up,
I had nightmares for,

1279
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.640
I mean,
maybe a couple of years off too.
It's really,

1280
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.810
really bizarre nightmares that involved cameras and involved tidal waves.

1281
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:39.420
I mean,
the,
the,
the sort of the mix that was going on.
I mean,
if,

1282
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.740
I suppose if I was to sit down and talk to professional about it,
they,
they,

1283
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.810
they might find it really interesting what was going on in my head.

1284
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.600
But I had to,
I came back really angry.
I remember coming back really angry,

1285
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.440
um,

1286
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.440
for the main reason being that I was coming back to my comfortable home and

1287
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:06.350
I thought about those millionaires living on the riverbank in London.

1288
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:08.760
And I thought,
well,
what if it happened?

1289
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.960
If the Thames suddenly when they just completely sorted the berries broke and

1290
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:16.920
just water,
just
how would the athlete,
you wouldn't,

1291
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.860
you wouldn't know where to start.
You just wouldn't know what to do.

1292
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.030
And you sit and these people,
you know,

1293
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:27.660
we have lots of floods in England now.
Um,
and what people go through,

1294
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:30.240
I can understand is completely and utterly miserable,

1295
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:34.700
but that the carpets are being ruined and,
and all this sort of stuff.
And um,
Yep.

1296
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.290
I wouldn't want to go through that.
But you know,
when you,

1297
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:43.260
when you compare that to what happens during a tsunami,
it's just night and day.

1298
01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:44.010
It really is.

1299
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:49.010
And so I got angry about coming back to live in a comfortable house and I used

1300
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:55.020
to get angry that my seller flooded in Stratham where I lived.

1301
01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:59.610
I had a big seller where I had my drum kit and it flooded once.
And,
um,

1302
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:04.680
my wife,
Tia,
she was down there with my daughter and she was,

1303
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:09.710
ended up pulling my drum kit out of three or four inches of sewage water that

1304
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:12.510
had come into,
you know,
and,
and,
um,

1305
01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:15.810
I'm responsible for her hurting her back because she should never have done it.

1306
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.950
But she was trying to get my,
all my equipment off the floor.

1307
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.750
And I remember being so angry that my seller had flooded.

1308
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.230
And then you go to someone like Sri Lanka and you think,
actually,
come on,

1309
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:32.260
let's put this in perspective.
Um,
so yeah,
the anger,
I,

1310
01:22:32.261 --> 01:22:37.261
and I think it took a while to maybe if I take in my line manager's advice and

1311
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:39.210
wrong that phone number,

1312
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:42.760
I might've been in a different place and it might have had,
you know,

1313
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:45.540
I might've got to a different place a lot quicker,
but I didn't.

1314
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.270
And I thought I can handle this.
And,
um,

1315
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.120
and even while I wasn't handling it,

1316
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:54.270
I didn't know I wasn't handling it.
You know,

1317
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.500
I just thought this is normal that you come back from these events and just yell

1318
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:05.510
at your wife who's dealing with three really small kids and there's you in one

1319
01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.870
ear.
Uh,
you know,

1320
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:13.230
given all this about your dreams and you know,

1321
01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.310
flooding and this and that.

1322
01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:18.190
And I'm really annoyed and I should have stayed out there longer.

1323
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:21.820
And why did they bring me back so early?
I had so many other stories lined up.

1324
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:26.850
And,
uh,
and of course,
you know,
it then dawned on me,
you know,
that actually,
um,

1325
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:32.530
my wife was my psychiatrist.
And to be fair,

1326
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:34.690
she wasn't actually having to say anything.

1327
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:40.380
She was just listening and it was a case of me needing to just get all this

1328
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:46.180
stuff off my chest and I would just pick the bizarre as moments to do it,

1329
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.870
you know?
Um,
but some of would pop into my head and,
and,
and then,
you know,

1330
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.360
I'd have friends round and something would set me off on Id and another thing,

1331
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:59.830
you know,
and it was a bit like that.
Um,
so yes,

1332
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:04.750
I would say if maybe I'd been sort of clinically diagnosed,
they would have said,

1333
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:08.350
you're suffering from some post traumatic stress.
Um,

1334
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.420
and I didn't experience that after Iraq.

1335
01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.620
And I don't know why.

1336
01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:20.530
I think maybe it was because I thought of war as completely different to what

1337
01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:24.440
you would maybe categorize as an act of God.
So,
um,

1338
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:29.850
that in a way I found quite interesting or was what happened when I got back

1339
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:35.110
from the tsunami,
a culmination of what happened in Iraq.

1340
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:40.140
But I'd been to Iraq and at the end in between Iraq and the tsunami,

1341
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:45.540
I had spent nine weeks in Australia photographing the rugby World Cup and that

1342
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:47.920
was a pretty good gig and I'd had a great time.

1343
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.280
So there was that sort of huge job in between these other two huge jobs.

1344
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.890
And I'm wondering maybe the,
the distraction yeah.
Had,
had,

1345
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:03.790
had helped,
you know,
maybe I was too busy thinking about something else.

1346
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:08.380
I was nine weeks on a tour in Australia and amazing country having a great time

1347
01:25:08.381 --> 01:25:12.520
shooting the Rugby World Cup,
which England and went on to win.
So,

1348
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:17.680
uh,
yeah,
it was um,
I don't know.
I really until this day,
I'll never know.

1349
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.510
But um,
yeah,

1350
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.600
dealing with that and it was interesting cause I was working for the BBC in

1351
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:30.430
Dubai,
uh,
in 2010 and I was working with a producer,

1352
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.940
um,

1353
01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.120
and there was a series called human planet and I was out there shooting stills

1354
01:25:34.121 --> 01:25:36.010
for the book that was going to come out with the series.

1355
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.160
And we were out with this falconer in Dubai,

1356
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:43.980
a South African guy with a f who trained for,

1357
01:25:43.981 --> 01:25:45.040
and that it was the end of the shoot.

1358
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:50.100
And then we were out and we were having a meal and the producer asked me,

1359
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:54.970
he said,
oh,
care.
And you've got some,
you know,
um,
incredible stories.

1360
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.890
Why don't you tell him the story about the tsunami?
I thought,
wow,

1361
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.040
that's a really bizarre thing to start about at the end

1362
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.860
<v 3>of a meal where we're celebrating finishing a shoots.</v>

1363
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:10.730
But I obliged and I met,
I can't even remember.

1364
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.680
I started talking and that just the whole table just went
awesome.

1365
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.300
Silence.
I mean,
they were in thrilled.
But,
uh,

1366
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:24.590
in the end,
the producer came up to me afterwards and he said,

1367
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.210
I'm really sorry the,
I asked you to talk about that because he said,

1368
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:32.510
I can see that every time that you must talk about it,

1369
01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:35.810
you lose a piece of yourself.
You,
you know,

1370
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.950
it's so entrenched in you that when you talk about it,
you know,

1371
01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.070
you're giving part of yourself away.
And he said,

1372
01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:44.720
and I really apologize for putting you in that position.

1373
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:47.450
And that had never occurred to me that was happening.

1374
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:52.190
But he could tell that by watching how I was talking about it,
you know,

1375
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:54.140
I don't know if that's the case now,

1376
01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:59.141
but I don't tend to talk about it purely because it was 2004 and you know,

1377
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.520
a lot has happened between then and now.

1378
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:09.521
And so it's not something that I sit down with on a regular basis and talk to

1379
01:27:09.951 --> 01:27:13.640
people about.
So,
but I can imagine that even now,

1380
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:17.480
probably at some point it's probably just a tiny bit,
maybe similar,

1381
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:20.180
but not like it was closer,

1382
01:27:20.181 --> 01:27:24.920
but that was 2010 that was six years afterwards and he's still spotted that it

1383
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:29.900
was,
you know,
still very high in my sort of psyche.

1384
01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:35.280
Yeah,
I think it's,
I think it's somewhat therapeutic to talk about it.
Yeah.

1385
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.580
<v 0>And,
and I think the more you talk,</v>

1386
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:42.610
if that guy asked you the same question once a week and you told that story once

1387
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:46.010
a week and you got more in depth with it and got her hands wrapped around it,

1388
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:49.960
I think that's good for you.
And you know,
they talk about that too.
Uh,

1389
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:53.300
the though the veterans and World War Two,
when you,

1390
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.770
when you came home from World War II,

1391
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.560
first of all had been at war for three or four years and when you came home you

1392
01:27:57.561 --> 01:28:01.310
got onto a ship with a bunch of other guys that just did what you did.

1393
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.640
And what did you do?
You talked your talk through stuff,
you told stories,

1394
01:28:04.641 --> 01:28:08.480
you're cried,
you let it out.
And by the time they got home,
two weeks later,

1395
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:11.060
they just had this therapeutic session.
Right.

1396
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:15.080
And that's why they said that these guys recovered a lot better.
Well,
in Vietnam,

1397
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.560
you're in the middle of the war and then one day your tourists up of 365 days

1398
01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:26.300
you get on a plane and 24 hours later you're sitting in mainstream USA.

1399
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.030
You didn't debrief anybody,
you didn't talk to anybody in the way home.

1400
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.870
You're just went from that environment to,
to the normal environment.

1401
01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.200
And it has my,
one of my sequel buddies,
you said one time,

1402
01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.690
I can't believe in 24 hours we're going to get inside of an aluminum tube and

1403
01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:45.280
then we're going to be back home.
And,
and that's true.
So,
uh,

1404
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:47.900
I think if you can find your friends are,

1405
01:28:47.901 --> 01:28:50.400
or people that you can talk about these things with,
it helps you.
And,

1406
01:28:50.401 --> 01:28:53.360
and that's what you said too,
when you told Tia,

1407
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.250
lovely wife what was going on.
That's how it,
all she did was listen,

1408
01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:00.230
she didn't have to,
she didn't,
oh,
she,

1409
01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:04.220
all she had to do was listen and let you explain those thoughts.
Yup.

1410
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.270
Um,
rough.

1411
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.370
And then the next big assignment,
and I,
you know,

1412
01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:16.320
we've talked about a bunch of different things that you've done,

1413
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:17.550
but one of the things,

1414
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.880
and I always get drawn to things that I know a little bit about or something

1415
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:25.800
that I've seen.
Um,
and,
and I know that you ended up going to Liberia as well.

1416
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:28.620
And I did.
I was on standby.

1417
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:33.670
I was actually off the coast of Liberia in the late nineties when things were

1418
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:39.141
just going to completely sideways and I pulled up a

1419
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.040
little article that captures some of the madness that was going on in Liberia.

1420
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.810
This is an article from the Guardian by Chris McGreal,
the Guardians,

1421
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.270
a UK site,

1422
01:29:56.790 --> 01:30:00.240
a commander in Charles Taylor's.
Charles Taylor's,

1423
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:05.270
malicious of Charles Taylor was this psychotic dictator of Liberia.

1424
01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:12.650
Militia has told a war crimes trial that the former Liberian president ordered

1425
01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:15.060
his fighters to eat their enemies,

1426
01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:20.610
including UN peacekeepers as a means of terrorizing the population.

1427
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:26.250
Joseph Zig Zag Marza chief of operations for Taylor,

1428
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:31.310
who is on trial at the Hague also testified that he oversaw horrific crimes such

1429
01:30:32.521 --> 01:30:37.500
as cutting the babies out of pregnant women and that the former president told

1430
01:30:37.501 --> 01:30:40.980
his men that their enemies are no longer human beings.

1431
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:46.970
Taylor 59 has pled not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against

1432
01:30:47.071 --> 01:30:51.690
humanity had a special international court over his collaboration with

1433
01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:55.230
antigovernment revels in Sierra Leone,
which borders Liberia.

1434
01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:57.023
Marza.

1435
01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:01.920
This is his chief of operations who led the death squad of group.

1436
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:05.940
Group of killers said many of the victims of cannibalism.

1437
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:10.941
We're members of the chron people of the then Liberian President Samuel Doe,

1438
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.370
who Taylor was attempting to overthrow,

1439
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:20.390
but those Eaton also included soldiers from UN and west African Echo mog

1440
01:31:21.181 --> 01:31:25.110
peacekeeping forces.
He said we should eat them.

1441
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:30.690
Even the UN white people.
He said we could use them as pork to eat.

1442
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:35.670
Marza told the court we ate a few ECAM mog soldiers,
but not many,

1443
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:41.220
but many were executed about 68 he said,
Taylor said,

1444
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:45.210
eating people set an example for the people to be afraid.

1445
01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:51.510
Taylor's defense lawyer asked Marza how the fighters would prepare a human being

1446
01:31:51.511 --> 01:31:52.344
for the pot.

1447
01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:58.290
The former commander described decapitating carving up cleaning and cooking.

1448
01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:03.070
Corpse is with salt and pepper.
We slit your throat,

1449
01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:07.540
butcher you throw away the head,
take the flesh and put it in a pot.

1450
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:10.180
Charles Taylor knows that said Marza.

1451
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:16.280
He told the court how rebel leaders who fell out with Taylor Mehta,

1452
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:20.080
terrible end,
the former commander describe dismembering,

1453
01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:24.400
the body of another rebel leader known as Superman and then taking his hand to

1454
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:26.860
Taylor who gave him cigarette money in return.

1455
01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:28.260
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1456
01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:31.830
<v 0>Marissa said the pair then cooked up an eight Superman's liver.</v>

1457
01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.590
Marissa said that he'd killed so many men,
women and children.
He had lost count.

1458
01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:42.060
He described drowning and bludgeoning babies to death and murdering women with

1459
01:32:42.061 --> 01:32:46.830
pen knives.
He said when he was serving Taylor's rebel,

1460
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:49.350
National Patriotic Front of Liberia,

1461
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.970
he'd established checkpoints on roads using human intestines and severed heads

1462
01:32:54.150 --> 01:32:58.710
mounted on sticks.
Asked whether Taylor knew about this.

1463
01:32:58.890 --> 01:33:00.630
Marza replied,
he was aware.

1464
01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:04.650
He made us understand that you have to play with human blood so that enemies

1465
01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:09.350
would be afraid.
Asked how he felt about these actions.

1466
01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:13.730
Now Marza said,
I regret nothing.

1467
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:26.810
Sorry.
I apologize.
That is,

1468
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.800
that is our lifetime.
That is me.

1469
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.640
This is me sitting off the coast of Liberia.
While this was happening,

1470
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:42.970
heinous.
Just,

1471
01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:44.420
<v 1>okay.</v>

1472
01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:48.860
<v 0>It's just sick.
And,
and,
and I think,</v>

1473
01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:54.110
you know,
Taylor was overthrown in 2003.

1474
01:33:54.111 --> 01:33:57.470
Obviously the country still bears the scars of that kind of

1475
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.220
darkness and evil in.

1476
01:34:02.221 --> 01:34:06.960
And that's something you talked about earlier was the fact that your

1477
01:34:06.961 --> 01:34:07.681
perspective,

1478
01:34:07.681 --> 01:34:11.310
and this is what I think I find very interesting about your perspective,

1479
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.760
is that I'm always talking and exploring and studying the point of war where

1480
01:34:19.261 --> 01:34:22.680
it's happening and you end up in these places.

1481
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.580
Maybe you're a day behind,
maybe you're a week behind,

1482
01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:29.790
maybe you're a foot behind,
maybe you're a mile behind,

1483
01:34:29.791 --> 01:34:34.440
but you're seeing what the after effects of war is.

1484
01:34:35.610 --> 01:34:36.443
<v 1>And</v>

1485
01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.520
<v 0>I think that that perspective for all of us to know is very important.</v>

1486
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:47.880
So,
and I know you were there while you were there.
Again,

1487
01:34:47.881 --> 01:34:52.500
I though you were there and what year?
2012.
Yeah.
So this is,
I mean,

1488
01:34:52.501 --> 01:34:54.840
it was never,
it's never exactly,
uh,
uh,

1489
01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:56.880
going to be the most peaceful place in the world,

1490
01:34:56.881 --> 01:35:01.280
but it was relatively stable compared to when it was under Taylor.
Yup.

1491
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.373
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1492
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.300
<v 0>And I'll tell you what,
this is one thing that,</v>

1493
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:08.260
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1494
01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.190
<v 0>when I,
when we,</v>

1495
01:35:09.191 --> 01:35:14.170
when we were off the coast of Liberia and you're looking at the coast and you

1496
01:35:14.171 --> 01:35:15.040
can see the customer,
we were,

1497
01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:19.180
we were literally maybe a couple of miles off shore looking at the coast and I

1498
01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:22.830
can see that there's waves breaking.
So I'm kind of thinking,
you know,

1499
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.750
I'm a surfer,
I'm thinking,
Hey,
you know,
those look like good waves.

1500
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:29.170
And then you can see there's buildings,
nice big kind of hotel.

1501
01:35:29.171 --> 01:35:31.000
You can see this beautiful white beach.

1502
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:34.690
You can see it looks like a just beautiful place.
I'm thinking to myself,

1503
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:39.250
I need to go here on a,
on a surf trip.
And then eventually,
you know,

1504
01:35:39.251 --> 01:35:40.990
I'm looking at us for a few hours,
we get a little bit closer.

1505
01:35:40.991 --> 01:35:44.350
I'm starting to make out a little bit more what I'm looking at.

1506
01:35:44.710 --> 01:35:48.430
And eventually I get out the big giant optics to,

1507
01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:52.030
to study where we might be landing in,
what's going on there.

1508
01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.010
And when I look through these optics,

1509
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.150
the whole picture changed because now you see all these buildings that look like

1510
01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:03.100
they literally look like big,
beautiful,
you know,
beach.
Um,
what's,

1511
01:36:03.101 --> 01:36:08.100
what's,
what's a big beach hotel called,
uh,
on a Surf Reddit?

1512
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.500
Yeah.
Something like the marijuana surf.
Right.
But these big resorts,

1513
01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:13.240
they looked like these big giant resorts.

1514
01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:18.190
And as I put the big optics on them and sort of looking at all the,

1515
01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.810
they're just completely gutted.
They're destroyed.
It's just a nightmare.

1516
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:24.423
And

1517
01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:31.250
it's so horrible to see such a beautiful place just completely destroyed by us,

1518
01:36:34.351 --> 01:36:38.310
by humans,
by fellow human beings have just completely destroyed it.

1519
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:40.323
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1520
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.480
<v 0>What did you notice or what did you,
what did you,</v>

1521
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:49.310
what was it like when you were there?
Give us a debrief on 2012.

1522
01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.680
<v 2>Um,
I mean,
I,
I just,
when you mentioned those hotels,</v>

1523
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.790
I remember taking a trip out to the beaches and just walking along the beaches

1524
01:36:57.791 --> 01:37:02.140
for a couple of miles and just looking at these places,
thinking was gone here.

1525
01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:07.530
I mean,
my overriding,
eh,

1526
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.880
the country was just eviscerated.
I mean,
and it's still,
um,
I mean,

1527
01:37:12.881 --> 01:37:17.881
I was there working for an Ngo and there were certain areas and certain things

1528
01:37:17.891 --> 01:37:21.670
that they wanted covered.
Um,
and I have the opportunity on a,

1529
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:24.700
on a couple of days to basically just go unilateral on it and just take it a

1530
01:37:24.701 --> 01:37:27.700
fixer and just go and do my own stuff.
And,
um,

1531
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.980
on that particular trip,

1532
01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:33.010
that's when I actually shot the pictures that I thought were really quite

1533
01:37:33.011 --> 01:37:36.700
interesting,
um,
from that.
But that was,
that was looking at,

1534
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:41.670
um,
sort of Liberia as a whole,

1535
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:46.810
but I was only in Monrovia,
but I had this picture of,

1536
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:51.460
I mean,
we traveled down to the river g county and grand ghetto.

1537
01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:56.070
I mean,
just stunningly,
stunningly beautiful parts of the country.

1538
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 3>I mean,
just ridiculously beautiful.</v>

1539
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.840
Um,
and the sort of,

1540
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:10.100
the difference between living in the country and maybe living in Monrovia was,

1541
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:14.680
was,
was so tangible.
I mean,
Monrovia was,
it's the,

1542
01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:16.890
the infrastructure has just completely disappeared.

1543
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:20.040
And I can't remember the figures,

1544
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.160
but I just remember being blown away by the fact that the town was built for

1545
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.080
say,
hypothetically,
a million.

1546
01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.130
And it was something like 5 million living in it.
I mean,

1547
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:33.810
those figures aren't correct,
but it's,

1548
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:38.550
it's that sort of scale that was just mind blowing.
Um,

1549
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:42.510
and it was such a shame because it's such a,

1550
01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.740
it's such a beautiful country.
The,
uh,
uh,

1551
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:51.810
Liberians are such beautiful people and yet you,
you,

1552
01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:55.710
you had this overriding sense that are they ever going to escape this?

1553
01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:59.760
Is this the legacy?
Is it going to stay with Liberia?
Are they,

1554
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.710
are they ever going to be able to pull themselves out?

1555
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:05.310
They are such a poor country.
Um,

1556
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:09.290
and I remember looking at areas where money was being spent on,

1557
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.170
I was asking myself,
why,
why are you spending money here?

1558
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:18.500
Why are you making the roads outside the mayor's office look pristine when the,

1559
01:39:20.161 --> 01:39:23.070
the,
the,
the inside of Monrovia is the state that it is.

1560
01:39:23.071 --> 01:39:27.600
There's the West Point slum,
I think,
which is one of the biggest slums there.
And,

1561
01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:28.434
um,

1562
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.680
and I remember walking through that and I never once felt intimidated.

1563
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:37.890
Um,
these were just incredibly vibrant places,

1564
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.280
but the conditions that the people were living in that version of normality was,

1565
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.823
um,

1566
01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.990
a camera really couldn't tell that picture.
He just couldn't,

1567
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.640
he just couldn't shoot those images to tell that story properly.

1568
01:39:57.090 --> 01:40:00.210
I think,
you know,
it's one of those rare times when I've had a camera in my hand.

1569
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:03.930
I think I,
I,
I,
I can't tell this story with,
with a camera.

1570
01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:07.170
I don't know what I can tell it with,
but I can't tell it with the camera.

1571
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:12.070
It's because the,
the,
the conditions or so,
yeah.
So,

1572
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:16.950
so dreadful.
And I mean,
the way Monrovia is,
there's built,

1573
01:40:16.951 --> 01:40:20.790
it's sort of slightly on a hill and,
and,
and it rains a lot in Liberia.

1574
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.290
And what happens is the rain falls off the concrete and when it rains,

1575
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.150
excuse me,
it really rains and it creates just torrents.

1576
01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:35.180
And these torrents just drop off the roads of Monrovia and they go down into the

1577
01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:41.031
slums and they hit the slums before they hit the c and the s and the slums or,

1578
01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.220
uh,
I mean,
um,

1579
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
that they flood at certain times of the year.

1580
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:53.620
And yet the people are,
they expect it,
they know going to happen.

1581
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.060
So I'm spending some time in,
in west point slum with,
um,

1582
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:02.470
a young man and his family and he is a,

1583
01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:07.670
a health advisor and he has two daughters and they both want to be doctors and

1584
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.840
he is describing the,
the conditions that they're living in,

1585
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.950
um,
and what they have to go through every day.
And I mean,
you can,

1586
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.070
especially if you're walking through Monrovia,

1587
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:24.880
you can see the sanitary conditions in the laboratories.
There is just,
it's,

1588
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:29.400
it's beyond belief.
It really is.
And,
uh,
you know,
there are,
there are,

1589
01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:34.420
there are latrines that go straight into the river and that just corrugated

1590
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:37.530
latrines with a door and you just go in and,
and,

1591
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:42.190
and the sewage goes straight into the river and it's three feet away.

1592
01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:44.560
The kids are just playing around in that river,

1593
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.930
the way our kids would play around in a swimming pool,

1594
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:52.080
no idea of what is going through their systems.
Um,

1595
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:53.020
and,

1596
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.020
and of course when you catch something like dysentery or typhoid or that they're

1597
01:41:57.070 --> 01:42:01.030
one of the biggest killers of kids in Africa,
um,
and,
and,

1598
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.630
and you look at it and you think,
how this is such a vicious circle,

1599
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:06.220
how are they going to,
are going to come out of this?

1600
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:11.080
How are they ever going to find a way to lift themselves up because it's such a

1601
01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:11.914
poor country,

1602
01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.240
but they sort of make do with the situation that they're in.

1603
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:20.860
And then the slum floods and they say,

1604
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:22.150
oh yeah,
it's gonna Flood.

1605
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.380
And although wis were four feet off the ground and we've got steps coming up to

1606
01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:28.720
our,
you know,
it's going to flood and it's going to come in.

1607
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:33.820
So we have to just put what we sleep on.
Little stilts,
you know,

1608
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:36.580
but they're getting up in the morning and stepping into it and coming out.

1609
01:42:36.581 --> 01:42:38.230
And then,
you know,
they don't have Wellington's,

1610
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:42.920
they just wade their way through it.
And this goes on for,
and he said,
uh,

1611
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:45.700
I was there in August and he said,
well,
you should be here in September.

1612
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.730
This is nothing.
Um,

1613
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.350
and so I was away from,

1614
01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.270
I'd sort of detach himself from the NGO at the time and I just went,

1615
01:42:55.271 --> 01:42:56.980
so gene Latin and I just wanted to photograph.

1616
01:42:57.070 --> 01:43:00.910
I just wanted to try in some way to explain what it was I was looking at and I

1617
01:43:00.911 --> 01:43:04.270
wasn't shooting it for anyone in mind.
I mean,

1618
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.990
the Ngo take all my images.
Um,
they,
they have,

1619
01:43:07.991 --> 01:43:09.700
they have access to all my imagery that I shoot,

1620
01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:12.070
whether I'm shooting it for them or whether I've just gone off piece,

1621
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.760
so to speak,
to shoot.
So they get absolutely everything.
Um,

1622
01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:20.890
and I was trying to find a way to document what it was that you could see.
And,

1623
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:23.263
um,

1624
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:28.530
I was really struggling until there was one moment when

1625
01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:33.100
I was wandering through the slum,
the flooded slum,

1626
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:36.850
and I was up to my knees and sewage as we're walking through between the

1627
01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:41.380
corrugated huts.
And there was a little flash of pink in front of me.

1628
01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:42.250
Um,

1629
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:46.630
and I saw this young girl sort of just go between two buildings and she was

1630
01:43:46.631 --> 01:43:49.090
carrying a pink umbrella.
And I remember thinking

1631
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:55.850
there's another picture of mist.
So,
um,

1632
01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:59.900
I asked the young doctor who was accompanying me through this time,
I said,

1633
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.430
you know,
what's the deal?
And he said,
oh,

1634
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:04.760
she's probably off to church or something,
you know,

1635
01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:08.830
cause she's in her Sunday best effectively with a perfect little shoes and had

1636
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.900
skirt and her pink umbrella.
Um,

1637
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:16.790
so I thought nothing of it carried on shots and more pictures.
And I thought,

1638
01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.030
actually,
I've got it.
I've got quite a lot of stuff here.
None of it.

1639
01:44:20.031 --> 01:44:24.470
I was really thinking this is really strong,
you know.

1640
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.780
And then on the way back to the car,

1641
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.940
I saw the little flash of pink again in front of me and it disappeared.

1642
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:35.240
And I thought,
well,
this time I'm not,
I thought giving up.

1643
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.630
So I just started to run through this.
You know,

1644
01:44:38.631 --> 01:44:41.690
and you can imagine if you're running through two foot of sewage,

1645
01:44:41.691 --> 01:44:46.280
well it's not the greatest site in the world and you're trying to stop your

1646
01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:48.140
cameras from going in and you're trying to it.

1647
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.420
And there's a couple of times I nearly went headfirst in,

1648
01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:52.910
but I was so desperate to try and take a picture of this.

1649
01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:54.820
And my image I had in my head was when,

1650
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:58.550
when she comes back through that corridor and comes back into this main corridor

1651
01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.690
that I mean of water,

1652
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:04.970
I'm going to just shoot her from behind like a Mary Poppins type of picture.

1653
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:10.750
And the contrast for me was this beautiful little girl in this situation,

1654
01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:16.240
in this with a pink umbrella in this horrendous slumps situation.

1655
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:21.530
And there she was.
And by the time she disappeared again,
I just thought,

1656
01:45:21.531 --> 01:45:23.090
this is just really not my day.

1657
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:28.370
And then she'd obviously heard me running and she sort of popped out again and

1658
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:29.330
just turned around.

1659
01:45:29.331 --> 01:45:34.070
And it was almost like a little bank of sand that she was standing on between

1660
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:39.670
two huts and there was about a foot and a half of water in front of her.

1661
01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.020
And she just turned around and looked at me as if,
yes,

1662
01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.670
w w what do you want?

1663
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:52.570
And I just took one picture and click and that was it.

1664
01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:54.450
And the second I took the picture,

1665
01:45:54.451 --> 01:45:57.950
she just turned on our heels and just walked off and tip toeing her way.

1666
01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:01.130
There was me in the middle of this,
you know,
so,

1667
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:05.900
but she was finding these delicate way around just like Mary Poppins with,

1668
01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:08.930
you know,
um,
and I didn't really,
so I thought,
okay,

1669
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:13.160
I hope that sharp because I'm shooting on a manual focus lenses.

1670
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:16.490
And you know,
when you've got one shot at it,

1671
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:21.680
you just really hope that you got it sharp,
you know?
Um,
uh,

1672
01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:24.440
because I had been in that situation when I've had one shot at it before,

1673
01:46:24.441 --> 01:46:29.240
I'm not going to sharp.
Um,
and those images haunt me.
So,
um,

1674
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:34.810
I got back to the hotel at the NGO was still working on their TV film that they

1675
01:46:35.811 --> 01:46:38.180
were doing and I put it into the laptop and scan it up.

1676
01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.520
And I looked at it and I just thought,
wow.
Yeah,

1677
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:46.030
that is how I want to remember Liberia.

1678
01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:50.850
I don't want to remember it as this place that has been incarcerated.

1679
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:51.690
Um,

1680
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:56.690
I want to remember it for the beauty that it has within its,

1681
01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:00.360
you know,
the humor,
the beauty of the humanity there.

1682
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:04.290
That's what I wanted to show because I don't want to come away from places and

1683
01:47:04.291 --> 01:47:08.250
shoot images of people at their expense.
I'm just,

1684
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:13.080
that's not me.
I'm,
I think the human race is a majestic species.

1685
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.240
And if I'm out there and I want to shoot this,

1686
01:47:15.241 --> 01:47:18.990
I want to show it cause it's there,
it's everywhere and you just have to see it.

1687
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:23.510
You just see it and you go,
that's what a human should look like.
And,

1688
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:28.620
and even in the worst,
the worst conditions imaginable,

1689
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:34.050
it's there.
And that picture was it for me from Liberia.
And that's,

1690
01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:36.390
you know,
I have pictures from Liberia that I keep,

1691
01:47:36.391 --> 01:47:40.290
but that's the one that I'm really proud of because,
uh,

1692
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:44.460
it was sharp.
Thank God.
Um,
but it just,

1693
01:47:44.461 --> 01:47:48.600
her beauty in that mess was what I wanted to remember.

1694
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:51.900
And it just shows you that there,
you look for it.
It's,
it's everywhere.

1695
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:54.840
You just have to,
you have to want to find it.

1696
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.550
It's easy to just go in there and shoot what's obvious.

1697
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:02.370
You know,
it's like sometimes you're going to situation like that.

1698
01:48:02.371 --> 01:48:05.430
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
It's that point your camera at shoot,

1699
01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:10.650
but you just got to,
you know,
if you're looking for it,
you'll find it,
you know,

1700
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:16.600
<v 0>keep your eyes peeled.
Yeah.
And you from there</v>

1701
01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.820
you ended up also going to South Sudan and again,

1702
01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.950
just just to a place of complete darkness

1703
01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:36.880
for those either,
don't know anything about Sudan.
Pulled a little clip

1704
01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:42.190
from the independent.
A guy named,
this is 2014.

1705
01:48:42.191 --> 01:48:44.500
See Oban Fenton wrote this,

1706
01:48:45.730 --> 01:48:48.850
more than a hundred children had been killed in South Sudan,

1707
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:53.170
whilst many others have been raped and castrated.

1708
01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.810
According to UNICEF,

1709
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:59.940
UNICEF says at 129 children had been burned in the last three weeks alone while

1710
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:02.590
surviving.
Boys were castrated in girls were raped.

1711
01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:09.370
They say that some children were even thrown into burning buildings.

1712
01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:15.070
The executive director of UNICEF,
Anthony Lake,

1713
01:49:15.071 --> 01:49:19.570
said the violence against children in South Sudan has reached a new level of

1714
01:49:19.571 --> 01:49:20.470
brutality.

1715
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:27.030
The details of the worsening violence against children are unspeakable,

1716
01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.220
but we must speak of them.

1717
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:35.350
Survivors report that boys had been castrated and left to bleed to death.

1718
01:49:35.351 --> 01:49:40.351
Girls as young as eight had been gang raped and murdered children had been tied

1719
01:49:40.391 --> 01:49:43.120
together before their attackers slit their throats.

1720
01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:47.080
Others have been thrown into burning buildings.

1721
01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.480
Just a nightmare scenario.
Yup.

1722
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:04.900
Any in you and want to clarify one thing.
You're working for an NGO.

1723
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:08.770
For those of you who don't know what that is,
it's a non government organization.

1724
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.020
Generally you're talking about some kind of a benevolent organization that is

1725
01:50:14.021 --> 01:50:18.280
trying to do good in the world such as the Red Cross is up is probably the

1726
01:50:18.281 --> 01:50:22.390
premier example.
Yeah.
I know you weren't specifically working for the Red Cross,

1727
01:50:22.391 --> 01:50:26.860
but you were working for another benevolent organization when they called you up

1728
01:50:26.861 --> 01:50:31.200
and brought you down to
South Sudan.

1729
01:50:31.890 --> 01:50:35.220
And again,
you're not,
for the most part,

1730
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:40.020
going to the front lines and capturing the action of the war.

1731
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.360
What you're capturing is the results of the war.
Sure.

1732
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:49.110
In what did you see when you got to,
when you got to sit down?

1733
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:51.573
Um,

1734
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:56.610
<v 3>well we flew into Juba.
Um,
and what,</v>

1735
01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.520
what we were looking at where the UN camps,

1736
01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:04.440
so the situation in South Sudan was that the two tribes,

1737
01:51:04.441 --> 01:51:05.191
the Dinka tribe,

1738
01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:10.191
and they knew her tribe where I'm at war with each other and there was a lot of

1739
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.150
fighting and killing going on and what the UN was trying to do,

1740
01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:16.463
um,

1741
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:23.030
was segregate the tribes from each other in certain areas so that they just stop

1742
01:51:23.251 --> 01:51:24.560
killing each other.
Um,

1743
01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:28.290
because until the killing stopped then really that politically they were never

1744
01:51:28.291 --> 01:51:32.630
going to come to a,
um,
and,
and you had the president and the vice president were,

1745
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:36.360
one was a Dinka and one was in Newark and whatever was happening between them

1746
01:51:36.361 --> 01:51:40.740
was being married,
you know,
on the street,
so to speak.
So,

1747
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.510
and there was never any trust between those two men.

1748
01:51:42.511 --> 01:51:47.040
They have a lot of history and there was never too much trust.
So,
uh,

1749
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:50.700
it was,
uh,
you know,
when they got their independence,
I think sit down,

1750
01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.590
it was only three years had been independent for three years.
I sit down.
Yeah.
So,

1751
01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:58.990
um,
we were visiting,
uh,

1752
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.610
camps that were,
you know,

1753
01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:05.910
had segregated the tribes and Juba was probably the most,

1754
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:10.740
uh,
aggressive camp in that,

1755
01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:15.470
uh,
the only time we ever had any trouble was,
uh,

1756
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.560
maybe if some,

1757
01:52:16.561 --> 01:52:19.970
a couple of guys had got ahold of some alcohol and they wanted to know,
hey,

1758
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:24.600
what are you doing here?
You know,
in this place,

1759
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.090
why are you here?
Why are you taking,

1760
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:31.530
and what you have to remember is these people don't want to be photographed in

1761
01:52:31.531 --> 01:52:34.770
this situation.
This is not a good situation for them.

1762
01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:37.710
And it's very easy as it,
as it,

1763
01:52:37.890 --> 01:52:40.710
as a journalist is going into a situation.
So yes,

1764
01:52:40.711 --> 01:52:42.960
I have to document this and I have to show what's going on.

1765
01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:46.220
But you have to understand that the dignity of these people needs to be taken

1766
01:52:46.221 --> 01:52:49.640
into consideration.
And you know,
some people are fine,

1767
01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:53.540
they're fine to let you photograph and they go,
yeah,

1768
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:57.770
well this is where I am at the moment.
And so yeah,
I'm quite happy for you to,

1769
01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.450
to photograph me in.
And others quite playing the [inaudible].
So,

1770
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.550
um,
apart from the,
uh,
the sort of criteria that the,

1771
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:12.530
the,
the NGO was looking for and the NGO was effectively providing water

1772
01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.870
for these camps because,
uh,
and they would,

1773
01:53:16.871 --> 01:53:19.850
they'd worked out some sort of desalination process and they were able to

1774
01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:23.810
produce water on a regular basis,
uh,
for the camps.

1775
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:27.350
But the situation in the camps was incredible.
They were just so overcrowded.

1776
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:28.213
And again,
you know,

1777
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:33.250
back to that sort of scenario of people being cramped on top of each other and

1778
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:38.180
then,
you know,
that's how diseases spread and you know,
so on.
So,

1779
01:53:38.181 --> 01:53:41.930
um,
uh,
we,
then I,

1780
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:46.040
there were obviously certain parts of South Sudan that I wanted to travel to

1781
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:51.041
because I knew that the situation up in those parts of the country was,

1782
01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:54.580
it was even worse than,
uh,
you know,

1783
01:53:55.310 --> 01:54:00.010
Juba was relatively stable compared to other parts of Sudan.

1784
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:00.440
There was a,

1785
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.830
there was a place called Ben to you that I wanted to get to and there's a lot of

1786
01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:06.780
oil up there and both trying to try and they can try to control the,

1787
01:54:06.781 --> 01:54:10.760
or that's what they need to get hold of.
And,
um,
and as we were sort of,
I'd say,

1788
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:13.580
listen,
let's go there.
And the NGO security,
we say,

1789
01:54:13.581 --> 01:54:16.460
you can't because there's fighting and we don't,

1790
01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:19.700
we're not allowing staff to fly in.
And the only,

1791
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:23.150
the only time aid is getting to these places is there is helicopter drops,

1792
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:25.970
but no one's touching the ground.
And,
you know,

1793
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:29.960
the Ngo,
um,

1794
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:34.570
are very hot on security.
Uh,

1795
01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:35.763
I mean it's Oxfam.

1796
01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:40.390
The NGO was Oxfam and they're incredibly professional organization and they're

1797
01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.260
very hot on security.
Um,
and anywhere you go,

1798
01:54:45.261 --> 01:54:47.600
if you go to any country working for Oxfam,

1799
01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:49.550
the first thing you get is a security briefing.

1800
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:53.240
And they tell you what the situation is,
what you can and can't do,

1801
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:54.770
where they advise that we don't go.

1802
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.710
And these are the regulations and the stipulations that they make and you have

1803
01:54:57.711 --> 01:55:02.000
to adhere to them because you're there as a member of staff with,

1804
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.650
even though I'm a freelancer and I can technically do what I like,

1805
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:08.810
you have to really sort of bear in mind that you are out there working with

1806
01:55:08.811 --> 01:55:13.160
Oxfam staff and Oxfam staff.
I've traveled out from the UK with you.

1807
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.940
So you really can't just go off and start doing what you like because you could

1808
01:55:20.241 --> 01:55:24.950
put other people's lives in jeopardy.
So everywhere,

1809
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:29.000
um,
we want it to go,
I particularly wanted to go,
we couldn't,

1810
01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:32.780
and it was just always the case.
I wanted to go here.
No,
you can't go there,

1811
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:36.530
but you can go here.
So we ended up traveling to areas that weren't where they,

1812
01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:40.130
the risk,
the security risk was pretty low.
Um,

1813
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:45.360
and these were camps,
UN camps,
a UN mission camps that,

1814
01:55:45.361 --> 01:55:46.890
um,
uh,

1815
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:50.730
we're created to where the fighting was at his worst and they were trying to

1816
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:54.000
stop the tribes and killing each other.
Um,

1817
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.420
and one of the places we went to,

1818
01:55:57.421 --> 01:56:00.920
which I will never forget as a place called ball and,
uh,

1819
01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:05.920
we sort of flew in,
um,
in a small plane and we got,
uh,

1820
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.220
I think it was a helicopter then a small plane.

1821
01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.480
And fortunately we didn't have to drive,
um,

1822
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:16.260
because I've been on a few journeys through Africa,
you know,
maybe 10,

1823
01:56:16.261 --> 01:56:19.710
14 hours in a car where there's no road.
Um,

1824
01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:22.820
so we were grateful to be able to fly in and you couldn't always flying.

1825
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:26.460
We'd always get in that maybe a UN helicopter that was dropping something and we

1826
01:56:26.461 --> 01:56:28.500
just get in there and,
and fly it with them.

1827
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.720
And we got to this place and Oxfam were working there and they were providing

1828
01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:36.930
water and they had this situation where w where the camp was,

1829
01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:38.290
the camp was being run by the current,

1830
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:40.720
the South Koreans and they were sort of the,

1831
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:44.970
they were physically building the camp and they were in charge of it at the
time.

1832
01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:47.400
Um,
and they had created this space,

1833
01:56:47.401 --> 01:56:51.600
maybe the size of two British football pictures or maybe a couple of American

1834
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:55.230
football pitchers,
similar sort of thing,
uh,
for the,
for,
for people to live on.

1835
01:56:55.231 --> 01:56:58.550
And in this you had south Sudanese,
uh,
they were the,
um,

1836
01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.750
new or tribe living in here.
And uh,
you had,

1837
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:06.900
you had wealthy,
um,

1838
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.960
you had middle class and you had very poor living alongside each other in the

1839
01:57:12.241 --> 01:57:12.481
camp.

1840
01:57:12.481 --> 01:57:17.481
So there was a real mix of people in the camp and Oxfam work providing water.

1841
01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:23.340
And uh,
there was a huge reservoir,
but it wasn't a reservoir.

1842
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:25.890
It was just a huge pit of water that had gone stagnant.

1843
01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.520
And every time it rained it would flood and flood into the camp.

1844
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:31.380
So they were having to control that.

1845
01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:33.870
And keep making sure that that never got flooded.

1846
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:37.620
And at the same time they were producing water with this filtration system and

1847
01:57:37.621 --> 01:57:40.950
providing pumps that people could,
you know,
and then basically sent them,
listen,

1848
01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.780
if you want to come to the pump and take water,

1849
01:57:42.781 --> 01:57:45.420
you got to learn how to clean your bucket so they wouldn't,

1850
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:50.130
so they would in installing discipline into them.
Uh,
so,
you know,

1851
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.030
and we support that.
Absolutely.
And,
um,
so,

1852
01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:58.350
but it wasn't as simple as US turning up with,

1853
01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.340
I was able to filmmaker a journalist and myself,
the three of us,

1854
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.790
and it wasn't as simple as just marching into the camp and saying,
hey,

1855
01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:11.190
we're oxfam and we're here to take some pictures and shoot some film even though

1856
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.690
Oxfam working there in that capacity.

1857
01:58:12.691 --> 01:58:14.820
So we had to go through the route of talking to the elder.

1858
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:18.300
And the elder was a doctor who worked in Canada who'd come all the way back from

1859
01:58:18.301 --> 01:58:18.960
Canada.

1860
01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.960
And he described his journey to me of how he got to ball in South Sudan from

1861
01:58:24.631 --> 01:58:26.910
Canada.
And I thought it was bad enough,

1862
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:31.740
me coming from London Heathrow to get to South Sudan.
It was just,

1863
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:36.570
I think it took him 11 days of pure travel to get from yeah,
it was,

1864
01:58:36.630 --> 01:58:40.800
it was unbelievable.
And planning about that traffic on the forums.
Yeah,
totally.

1865
01:58:40.801 --> 01:58:41.830
It was,
it was just,

1866
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.030
it was humbling and he was there to rescue his mother and get her say,

1867
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.250
and uh,
this was a camp,

1868
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:51.340
so we had to talk to him and he wanted to know a little bit about us and he
said,

1869
01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:54.250
you're fine.
You can come in when we don't let any journalists in here,

1870
01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:58.600
the journalists just come here and they do their story and they leave at our

1871
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:03.580
expense.
We don't have that,
but you,
you're providing water,
you guys can come in.

1872
01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:07.640
And so we had carte blanche to wander through the camp and do it well.

1873
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:12.250
And everybody knew the elder has granted these,
these guys are cool.

1874
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:14.950
They're fine duty.
Like,
so,
um,

1875
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:20.340
this was a camp that had been attacked by the Dinka tribe a month earlier.

1876
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:26.740
And in order to try and build you a picture,

1877
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:31.420
if you can imagine the two football pictures.
Um,
you had the,

1878
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:36.421
you had the UN camp and then within the UN camp there was this other camp that

1879
01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:39.970
they were living in and it had a perimeter around it.

1880
01:59:39.971 --> 01:59:42.700
It was just barbed wire and a perimeter and it was about the size of two

1881
01:59:42.701 --> 01:59:44.500
football pitches.
And they were wanting,

1882
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:48.640
the Koreans were meant to be building another space because their latrines had

1883
01:59:48.641 --> 01:59:52.180
collapsed because of the rain.
And they,
you know,
it was just,
it was,
it was,

1884
01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:54.730
the conditions were,
uh,
were abominable.

1885
01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:00.120
But this perimeter was on the outside of the perimeter was dinker land and the

1886
02:00:00.971 --> 02:00:05.140
dinkiest had come in and they had attacked one night.
They had just stood on the,

1887
02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.420
on the outside,
over the fence and with machine guns just shot away.

1888
02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:15.010
And they killed a hundred of the tribe.
Women,
children,
kids.
I mean,

1889
02:00:15.011 --> 02:00:17.170
we were talking to kids were bullets were coming through.
I mean,

1890
02:00:17.171 --> 02:00:18.004
they just live in it.

1891
02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:21.520
It's literally a couple of bamboo poles and some just white material.

1892
02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:23.380
That's what these people were living in.

1893
02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:26.950
But if you went into these homes that they've created,

1894
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:31.840
they were just spotless inside.
And then you realize,

1895
02:00:31.841 --> 02:00:34.180
again,
the dignity that,
you know,
you have to be,

1896
02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:38.650
you just have to be so careful as you just don't wander around Gungho.
Just,

1897
02:00:38.651 --> 02:00:40.510
you know,
these,
there are very,
very,

1898
02:00:40.511 --> 02:00:42.670
these are very proud people and they're in this situation they want to be.

1899
02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:43.630
And what's more,

1900
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:49.060
they can't get out because if they try and leave this camp,
they'll just,

1901
02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:54.700
they'll just be shot dead,
you know,
um,
by the opposing tribe.

1902
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:57.580
And it was like that throughout Sudan.
So it didn't,

1903
02:00:57.581 --> 02:00:59.560
it wasn't necessarily just one try being protected.

1904
02:00:59.561 --> 02:01:00.970
It was the dinker in one campy.

1905
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:04.840
It was newer than the other and there've been protection.
I was.
And um,
they were,

1906
02:01:06.450 --> 02:01:09.010
I remember you saying old age Ahca.
Did you ever notice the,

1907
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:14.830
the state of their lives or their fear ever being etched on their faces,

1908
02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.240
wherever you've traveled.
And if this was one place that I saw it,

1909
02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:21.570
it was in this camp,
um,

1910
02:01:21.610 --> 02:01:25.870
and they were petrified that this was going to happen again.
Um,
because the,

1911
02:01:25.871 --> 02:01:30.220
the UN hadn't reacted in time when the first attack happened.
Um,

1912
02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.040
and so they just thought this is just going to happen again and who's going to

1913
02:01:33.041 --> 02:01:36.160
protect us.
And uh,
that is a,
again,

1914
02:01:36.161 --> 02:01:41.161
a situation where you're thinking when I leave this I'm getting on my plane and

1915
02:01:41.421 --> 02:01:42.260
I'm going to fly home.

1916
02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.440
And yet they are still going to be in that camp and they are still not going to

1917
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:49.190
be able to leave.

1918
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.760
And in this camp you will talking to young guys that were professionals working

1919
02:01:55.881 --> 02:02:00.260
in Juba and you know,
you're,
it's,
yeah.

1920
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.320
That was the closest I had as an experience to Sri Lanka was South Sudan.

1921
02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.720
<v 0>And you brought that attitude hole and your next as usual.</v>

1922
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:19.020
Yeah.
Your next assignment that you shot,

1923
02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.640
oddly enough was something that you had scheduled the six months prior.
You said,

1924
02:02:23.641 --> 02:02:26.850
you know what,
I'm going to go and just take a breather.

1925
02:02:26.851 --> 02:02:30.250
I'm going to go and shoot Wimbleton the tennis tournament in England on the

1926
02:02:30.251 --> 02:02:35.040
grass courts.
You'd schedule that in the meantime you,
you go to Sudan,

1927
02:02:35.310 --> 02:02:38.340
you experienced this when you get home.
And this was just on your own,

1928
02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:40.920
you just schedule it for yourself to choose you when we'll show.
Yeah.

1929
02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:45.940
Noncommissioned and you brought this back with you and what did that do to your,

1930
02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.750
your Wimbleton shoot?
Uh,
well originally I,

1931
02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:56.790
<v 3>um,
I think it was a couple of weeks before Wimbledon started and,
um,</v>

1932
02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.840
I was not in the slightest bit interested in going to shoot the story and I'd

1933
02:03:03.601 --> 02:03:07.200
gone to all this trouble to get this accreditation.
And the,

1934
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:11.890
the,
the photographer that runs,
uh,

1935
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:15.210
the Wimbledon is also a very,
very,

1936
02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.090
how to respect to sports photographer who also runs the photography of the

1937
02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:21.860
Olympics.
And he'd said,
Karen,
listen,
um,

1938
02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.240
I'd be happy to come in and shoot whatever it is you want to shoot.
Uh,

1939
02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:30.150
and I'd gone to all that trouble to get that and he'd given it his blessing and

1940
02:03:30.151 --> 02:03:31.780
I thought,
you know what,
I'm just going to turn.

1941
02:03:31.781 --> 02:03:33.930
And I said to Bob died that really fancy this,

1942
02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:36.690
cause I've just been in South Sudan living in with,

1943
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:40.290
with these people in these camps.
And the idea of going to England,

1944
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:41.430
shooting people,
eating,

1945
02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:46.070
drinking champagne and eating strawberries and cream it really fast.

1946
02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:50.820
I'm just that,
that's what echo and I like to call a rough transients.
Yeah.
Um,

1947
02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:54.870
and,
and on top of that,
it was a self commission.
So in as a freelancer,

1948
02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.450
self commissioning and not only any money,

1949
02:03:57.451 --> 02:04:02.400
it's not really the greatest idea in the world,
but,
um,
but over time,

1950
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.510
as we got closer,
I just thought,
hey,
do you know what,
hey white.
Yeah,
okay.

1951
02:04:07.230 --> 02:04:11.930
Maybe I'll,
I'll go and do this.
So I went for the first couple of days and,
uh,

1952
02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:15.960
I just,
I'd had an idea,

1953
02:04:15.961 --> 02:04:18.480
I wanted to see if Wimbledon still had any charm,

1954
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:22.920
because I went with my dad when I was 10 years old and I never forgot it.

1955
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:27.540
I got to see John Mcenroe and Peter,
Peter Fleming.
Uh,
yeah.
Peter Fleming,

1956
02:04:27.541 --> 02:04:32.150
not Ian Fleming,
p play doubles.
Um,
I bumped into John Lloyd,

1957
02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.980
a British tennis player at the time.
Uh,
just,

1958
02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.690
and I just remember thinking that was a magical afternoon I had with my dad for

1959
02:04:39.691 --> 02:04:42.740
my birthday when I was 10 years old.
Um,

1960
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:47.840
let's see if Wimbledon still has that magic at bearing in mind that I had shot

1961
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.670
15 Wimbledon's previously in my career as a professional sitting on court

1962
02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:57.600
shooting the tennis.
You know,
I was there when Venus,
when I first,

1963
02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.270
I was there when Roger Federer beat Sampras,
you know,
seminal moments in sport.

1964
02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.870
So I just wanted to see if at any time,
no,

1965
02:05:06.871 --> 02:05:11.370
that was my original intention when I got the press quotation six myzone that

1966
02:05:11.371 --> 02:05:12.420
completely went out the window.

1967
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:16.980
I wasn't interested in one of them that in each arm or not.
Uh,

1968
02:05:16.981 --> 02:05:17.910
I just thought,

1969
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:21.720
I'm going to go up and I'm going to photograph those people that can't,

1970
02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:23.430
that just get,

1971
02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.020
can get the cheapest ticket and get in and just wander around the outside
courts.

1972
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:29.400
I don't want to see a tennis player.

1973
02:05:29.850 --> 02:05:31.610
I don't want to go anywhere near the show courts.

1974
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:36.360
I just want to see what it's like to be a punter.
Because when I came up,

1975
02:05:36.361 --> 02:05:38.550
when I was 10 years old,
that's all I was with my dad.

1976
02:05:38.551 --> 02:05:42.810
We were just two punches that managed to sneak two tickets to get into show

1977
02:05:42.811 --> 02:05:47.240
court to see Mcenroe and Fleming play doubles.
So,
uh,

1978
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.030
in a way I was,
I may be trying to see if you did have a bit charm.
I think so,

1979
02:05:51.031 --> 02:05:52.910
but I that had really gone out of my head.
So I,

1980
02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:57.840
I turned up and I just started walking around and,
uh,
the,

1981
02:05:59.070 --> 02:06:01.410
my attitude was,
well,
do you know what I,

1982
02:06:01.411 --> 02:06:05.070
it doesn't matter if I don't get a picture and because who's going to shout at

1983
02:06:05.071 --> 02:06:09.690
me?
Who's going to say,
Kieran,
what have you got today?
No one,
only me.

1984
02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.700
So I just might,

1985
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:15.690
my mindset changed dramatically and I just started wandering around and I

1986
02:06:15.691 --> 02:06:18.740
remember I used to hang around in the attic,
cause a precipice.

1987
02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:22.990
I just go into the,
uh,
media,
uh,
haul with where my,

1988
02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:27.140
all my mates were working,
you know,
slugging their guts out,

1989
02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:31.110
covering the tennis because it sounds really glamorous.
Uh,
but it's,

1990
02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:36.410
it's full on shooting tennis at Wimbledon.
It really is full on.
And um,

1991
02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:41.190
they just,
you say a kid hanging around in the CAF a lot.
I was like,
yeah,

1992
02:06:41.191 --> 02:06:44.880
I know because I'm just waiting for the lights and just go out and see what

1993
02:06:44.881 --> 02:06:47.160
there is,
you know?
Um,
and then,
Oh God,

1994
02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:50.580
I've got to go and sit on center court for another four hours and then Andy

1995
02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:51.361
Murray is going to come on a play in,

1996
02:06:51.361 --> 02:06:53.490
the roof's going to come over and aren't going to get out of here till 10

1997
02:06:53.491 --> 02:06:57.090
o'clock.
And I really,
yeah,
I'll be gone by six,
you know,

1998
02:06:57.091 --> 02:07:00.120
cause the light will have gone then and there'll be no need for me to be here.

1999
02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:03.180
And then I'd have another cup of coffee and wander out and just wander around.

2000
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.370
And I just had one camera and one Lens,
just a small liker and a 35 mil.

2001
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:11.610
And um,
I'd wander and wander and wander.

2002
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:15.540
And first couple of days I didn't get anything I thought,
hmm,
okay.

2003
02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:18.510
So I decided,
okay,
let's go on day three.

2004
02:07:18.511 --> 02:07:21.860
And I went on day three and I remember walking around and what had happened at

2005
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:25.080
this Wimbledon is that occasionally they build a new court and when they build a

2006
02:07:25.081 --> 02:07:29.820
new court it means the dynamics of that area since last year have changed.

2007
02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.560
So,
um,
walls have gone up and,
and in a Wimbledon,

2008
02:07:34.590 --> 02:07:38.260
they're not walls,
they put sort of green sheeting,
very thick,

2009
02:07:38.261 --> 02:07:42.010
heavy sheeting across to sort of delineate this is a new court.

2010
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:46.210
Well what that means is that the security guards who are employed,

2011
02:07:46.211 --> 02:07:50.230
who are just young guys looking for so much gel,
you know,
they're employed,

2012
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:53.620
they haven't got a clue what the dynamics are of this court because this is

2013
02:07:53.621 --> 02:07:57.070
caught only existed this year.
And all these new things have been put in place.

2014
02:07:57.071 --> 02:08:02.071
And so I remember just coming around the corner and I saw this guy standing with

2015
02:08:03.941 --> 02:08:08.410
his face right up to the Green Bay's like this.

2016
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:13.990
And I thought it's as if he'd been sent to the naughty step is,

2017
02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:17.560
you know,
face the wall son.
I thought,
what is going on here?

2018
02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:21.040
So I was sort of watching and I took a few pictures and I thought,
okay,

2019
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:23.710
and he's getting a little bit closer here.
And as I did that,

2020
02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:27.370
somebody else walked past me and just went straight up to the wall and put there

2021
02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.070
like this.
I thought,
God,

2022
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:35.071
there must be a pinpricks in the material that allows them to put their eye

2023
02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:41.550
right up to it and they can see the whole court.
And you know,

2024
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:46.720
I thought that that's what they're doing.
Okay,
right.
I get it now.
So I thought,

2025
02:08:46.721 --> 02:08:50.200
well all I need is for 10 people to just do this.
And Oh,
I've got a picture.

2026
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.330
So as I'm doing this,

2027
02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:56.350
as I'm waiting for this moment to evolve,

2028
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:58.120
I'm thinking,

2029
02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.420
I haven't got a picture yet at Wimbledon and this could be my first.

2030
02:09:01.450 --> 02:09:06.070
So I'm going to,
I'm going to let this one mature and see what happens.

2031
02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:09.730
And as I did that,
this guy turns up,

2032
02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.080
young guy turns up with a pram and he takes his kid out of the Pram and his kid

2033
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:18.280
has this shock of red hair and he's maybe eight months old.

2034
02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:21.460
No,
maybe a year old.
A bit older than that.
Yeah.
But a year old,

2035
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:26.550
still a really tiny baby and his wife walks past and his wife goes to join the

2036
02:09:27.371 --> 02:09:31.460
three other people that are peering through like this.
And I thought,
okay,
right,

2037
02:09:31.461 --> 02:09:33.170
I've got us and there's four people there and like this.

2038
02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:36.190
And then I don't know what this guy's doing with this baby.
I mean,
what,
you know,

2039
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:39.010
this baby's got such an amazing shock of red hair.

2040
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:42.650
It looked fantastic against the green.
So I've got to this,

2041
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:43.653
what's going to happen?

2042
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:48.660
And this guy just pick the baby up and shoved the baby's head over the top of

2043
02:09:49.841 --> 02:09:54.280
the base.
And before I took a picture,
I thought,

2044
02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:58.900
why are you doing that?
Because the baby can't see anything.

2045
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:00.670
And you certainly,

2046
02:10:00.671 --> 02:10:04.210
and I think in his mind he thought if I shoved the baby's head over the top,

2047
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.690
I'll be able to see something as if it was like a periscope,

2048
02:10:08.070 --> 02:10:11.680
which is what I mean.
And it was so bizarre and he kept it there and I thought,

2049
02:10:11.890 --> 02:10:13.060
all right,
time to take a picture.

2050
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.820
So I took this picture and as I took the picture,

2051
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.980
there was an old boy standing behind me selling programs and he went,
hmm,

2052
02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:24.430
that's a hell of a picture you've got there.
And I thought,
yeah,
it is and let's,

2053
02:10:24.431 --> 02:10:27.310
I'm just going to see if something else happens with the baby.
You know,

2054
02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:31.030
I don't know what's going on,
but it didn't.
And I had my picture.

2055
02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:34.820
But what I really wanted was to have been on the other side of that court and

2056
02:10:34.821 --> 02:10:38.000
just seeing that baby's head appear over the top.

2057
02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.560
So that was my first picture and I thought,
okay,
this has,

2058
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:45.620
and that's how I normally work.
Get one under your belt and build on it.

2059
02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.550
And I thought that's a very funny picture.

2060
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:54.230
That is how I'm going to look at this story.

2061
02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:59.260
I'm going to find the humorous elements of being upon Sir in Wimbledon and I

2062
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:03.920
want to shoot it as if you were.

2063
02:11:03.930 --> 02:11:06.590
So when you look at the pictures,
you think,

2064
02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.570
why has he shot that picture with those two heads in the way?

2065
02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:16.250
And I can only just see that tennis player and I might,
my point is the,
well,

2066
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:19.010
if you're a punter at Wimbledon Das,
exactly how you see it.

2067
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:23.690
You don't the cheap seats.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Um,
so,
and,

2068
02:11:23.691 --> 02:11:26.840
and most of these seats,
or you just walk around and stand.

2069
02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:31.720
So you're always crouching and trying to see.
And I just thought,
and of course,
I,

2070
02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.110
I very rarely look through the camera.
I'd see a situation and just go,

2071
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:36.920
there you go.
Because I didn't care.

2072
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:41.180
I actually didn't care whether I got anything that was any good.
Uh,

2073
02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.380
I just thought,
you know,

2074
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:47.060
this is a nice feeling to just wander around and just click away.

2075
02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:50.330
Um,
and I wasn't framing anything.
I was framing,

2076
02:11:50.331 --> 02:11:53.940
but framing in a way for a purpose,
but I didn't care.
And it,

2077
02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:57.380
and if somebody said to me,
is that the result of two weeks at Wimbledon,

2078
02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:01.790
I would have said,
yeah,
you know,
I don't care.
And I,
I,
I really,

2079
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:06.290
really don't care.
So that was,
that was the attitude with which,

2080
02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:10.820
um,
I shot it.
And,
um,
yeah.

2081
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:15.560
So to finish this story,
so come,

2082
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:19.520
that was June,
2014

2083
02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:23.510
and come January,

2084
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:26.650
2015 are the big in the world of photojournalism,

2085
02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:31.190
the world press photo through awards and I the world.
And those are like the uh,

2086
02:12:31.230 --> 02:12:35.510
the Oscars yeah.
Of A for photojournalism.
Yeah,
they're the big ones.
And um,

2087
02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.720
and I remember when I was a young kid,
I always used to print my stuff up,

2088
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:41.870
you know,
when I was starting in,
send it in and then look at the stuff and go,

2089
02:12:41.871 --> 02:12:45.950
why didn't I win anything?
Well that's because,
you know,
my stuff was just crap.

2090
02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:47.930
Uh,
and that's why I didn't win anything.

2091
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:52.940
So I sort of stopped entering competitions when I resigned from Reuters in 2008.

2092
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.440
It just didn't really interest me anymore.

2093
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:57.110
But a friend of mine rang me up and he said,

2094
02:12:57.530 --> 02:13:01.760
you have entered those woman pictures into wordpress road.
And I said,

2095
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:04.710
no.
And he said,
okay,
and you've got to,

2096
02:13:04.711 --> 02:13:06.710
you've got to do their amazing pictures of you.
And I thought,
well,

2097
02:13:06.711 --> 02:13:10.790
you're the only one that thinks that they're amazing pictures.

2098
02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:15.380
I was happy with them,
but you know,
and he said,
no,
no,
no,

2099
02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.040
do it.

2100
02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:21.040
So I did and I had to submit 10 pictures and I found 14 images that were

2101
02:13:21.501 --> 02:13:25.310
potential and I got down to seven and I then I called [inaudible] and I said to

2102
02:13:25.311 --> 02:13:28.070
tear,
listen,
you've got to find another three pictures out of this,

2103
02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:32.050
these five or six,
which three do you think she'd go into the sentence

2104
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.300
<v 0>and Tsa,
that one,
that one and that one is it great.
That was it.
And then it went</v>

2105
02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.250
and lo and behold it won.
Southern won an Oscar.

2106
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:46.260
So yeah.
Uh,
and,

2107
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:50.220
and the irony of the story was a self commissioned yourself and earn no money

2108
02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.180
and you win a big award.

2109
02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:58.350
I want to cover one more thing before we wrap this up and one more series of,

2110
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:01.110
of images that you took and I'll start this off with a poem.

2111
02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:07.940
The poem is called repatriation.
Then I'm just going to do an excerpt from it.

2112
02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:11.690
The coffin draped in union.

2113
02:14:11.691 --> 02:14:16.691
Jack is slowly carried out the back out of the dark and into the light,

2114
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:23.150
slowly down the ramp.
And to the right,
the six approach,

2115
02:14:23.151 --> 02:14:28.010
the hearse all black and place the hero gently in the back.

2116
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:31.460
The sixth then turn and March away.

2117
02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:34.820
Their duty has been done this day.

2118
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:39.310
Politicians usually have much to say,

2119
02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:45.060
no sign of them near here this day they hide away and out of danger much easier.

2120
02:14:48.910 --> 02:14:51.130
If the hero is a stranger.

2121
02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:57.420
The hearse with its precious load move slowly out onto the road.

2122
02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:01.030
The floral tributes line the route.

2123
02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:04.900
While comrade snap a smart salute

2124
02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:10.180
at the edge of wheelchair town.

2125
02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:15.760
The court judge slows it's pace right down.
The streets are packed.
Many deep,

2126
02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:19.930
some throw flowers.
Most just weep.

2127
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.940
The crowd have come to say farewell.

2128
02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.710
The church bell rings a low death knell.

2129
02:15:29.610 --> 02:15:32.430
Regimental standards are lower down.

2130
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.730
As the hero passed through the town,

2131
02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.470
the court did stops and silence rains.

2132
02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:44.190
The town's folk feel the family's pain.

2133
02:15:45.450 --> 02:15:48.540
The nation's flag lowered to half mast.

2134
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.340
Our brave hero is home at last.

2135
02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:02.380
That was written by Sergeant Andrew Macfarlane in 2009 about a place in England

2136
02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:09.520
called Wootton Bassett,

2137
02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:15.540
which is where all British soldiers and service members that were killed in

2138
02:16:17.381 --> 02:16:21.460
action or brought back home to England.

2139
02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:24.260
And you shot some

2140
02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.820
amazing photographs of that.
And this is

2141
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.840
<v 3>when I,
when I first got to know you,</v>

2142
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.280
this was the first thing I found out was that you'd shot these photos and

2143
02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:42.080
<v 1>okay,</v>

2144
02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.220
<v 3>they're,
they're just incredible and they represent</v>

2145
02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:48.570
really to me just a

2146
02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:56.640
and incredible a view of England and what England is in the world.

2147
02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.390
And how did you

2148
02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:12.490
end up there once again with your camera in your hand?

2149
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.550
I was assigned the first,
the first time I ever went to it and pass it,

2150
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:23.610
it was on an assignment and I turned up and I was told at the only,

2151
02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:29.890
the only information I was given was bring a really tall ladder,
um,

2152
02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:34.730
because you'll need it.
And I didn't understand the dynamics and of,

2153
02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:39.520
of what was happening on the streets.
So it was my first time and I,
I,
you know,

2154
02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:41.370
I got there and the traffic was awful in the,

2155
02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:46.780
and I literally arrived maybe 20 minutes before the Cortez came through.

2156
02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:50.160
So I was running down the street with my [inaudible] okay,

2157
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:52.620
here with the other photographers,
this is what we do.
Put a ladder up here and,

2158
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:57.280
and the latter became clear because you need to go to the top of the ladder.

2159
02:17:57.580 --> 02:18:01.990
So when the hearse has come down the street and stop and the family members put

2160
02:18:01.991 --> 02:18:03.880
their roses on the hearse,

2161
02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:07.160
you need to be able to see over the top of the hearse to be able to see the

2162
02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:11.090
grieving widows and relatives.
Um,

2163
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:16.570
and you know,
you're standing on top of a six step ladder,
you know,

2164
02:18:16.571 --> 02:18:19.390
you're probably about 15 or 16 feet in the air and you'll really quite

2165
02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:22.390
conspicuous with a long lens.
Um,

2166
02:18:22.450 --> 02:18:27.450
and it wasn't something that I was really comfortable doing it because the click

2167
02:18:28.090 --> 02:18:32.720
of a camera in that silence was deafening.
Um,

2168
02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:38.170
and it was one of those things that wouldn't,
the,

2169
02:18:38.171 --> 02:18:42.100
the repatriations had been happening before for a while.

2170
02:18:42.101 --> 02:18:46.630
I think before I got there,
um,
and I mean years,
I may be 2008,

2171
02:18:46.631 --> 02:18:50.590
2007,
but before I,
you know,
I had actually turned up to um,

2172
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:51.910
to shoot my first one.

2173
02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:56.740
So there had been a pattern that had developed over time and the pattern was

2174
02:18:56.741 --> 02:18:59.270
photography.
Sign up,
they sign up a ladder,
they shoot the pictures,
uh,

2175
02:18:59.470 --> 02:19:02.110
the event finishes it and everybody goes home and the pictures are wired.

2176
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:04.690
And my first time I was there,
I ended up,

2177
02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:09.280
the best image I shot was from the floor of a younger holding red roses.
Wait,

2178
02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:12.340
looking down the street,
waiting for the,
the courthouse to pass.

2179
02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:17.770
And I was really aware of the ladders and the noise of the cameras and I
thought,

2180
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:22.270
I can't,
I stopped myself from shooting because it was so loud and I thought,

2181
02:19:22.271 --> 02:19:24.640
I can't be the one.
And you would see something happening.

2182
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:29.390
And you would see a moment when maybe a wife came out and she touched the back

2183
02:19:29.391 --> 02:19:32.450
of the hearse with our hand,
you know,

2184
02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.060
and put her head against the glass and you,

2185
02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.360
your instinct instinct is to shoot that.

2186
02:19:38.361 --> 02:19:39.980
And shoot as many frames as that as possible.

2187
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:44.700
But I had my camera on single shots,
so I was click,
Click,
oh,

2188
02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:48.620
you could hear it was like machine guns of cameras.
And it was,

2189
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:51.200
and it was so invasive.
And I thought,
well this is,

2190
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:54.080
this is how the photographers got their pictures.
This is what they had to do.

2191
02:19:54.081 --> 02:19:58.280
There was no way around it.
And I decided that's fine,

2192
02:19:58.550 --> 02:20:02.030
I understand that.
That's what,
that's what we have to do to get the pictures,

2193
02:20:02.031 --> 02:20:03.920
but I'm not going to do that anymore.
I don't,

2194
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:08.150
I really don't want to get involved in this anymore.
I found it too stressful.

2195
02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:12.650
And what I ended up doing was not shooting when I should have shot stopping

2196
02:20:12.651 --> 02:20:17.651
myself because I didn't want my click to be the click that everybody had.

2197
02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:22.670
And even though everybody had accepted that this is what happens,
I thought,
well,

2198
02:20:22.671 --> 02:20:23.650
I'm just not comfortable with this.

2199
02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:28.280
So I decided then that this was an amazing event and that I needed to look at

2200
02:20:28.281 --> 02:20:29.150
this properly.

2201
02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:33.440
And bearing in mind that I had been late for relatively,

2202
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:39.050
um,
I hadn't seen what had happened before.
The hearse came.
I had no idea what,

2203
02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:42.710
what happened.
So the next time I went down,

2204
02:20:42.890 --> 02:20:46.460
I got down there really early and I there was known on the streets and I watched

2205
02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:49.490
the buildup and for those of that,
don't know

2206
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:55.000
what the whole story but wouldn't bass it was,
it the bodies of,
um,

2207
02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:00.620
service personnel killed in action in Afghanistan,
uh,

2208
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:05.650
were being repatriated to an air base and the only route out of the air base,

2209
02:21:06.501 --> 02:21:10.240
it was through this tiny village market town called the wooden back cold within

2210
02:21:10.241 --> 02:21:14.780
basad.
Uh,
as the,
uh,
the bodies were taken to the coroner's office in Oxford.

2211
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:18.190
And it was the first time this happened,
the,
the,

2212
02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:23.330
the horses came through and I think the town mayor spotted it and he just

2213
02:21:23.331 --> 02:21:26.300
stopped and doffed his cap as they went past.

2214
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:31.930
And then that just exponentially grew into,

2215
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:34.850
you'd have thousands on the street over the years.

2216
02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:38.000
It just grew into thousands and,
and then the families change their routine.

2217
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:42.920
The families would just go to the base in Lineman and pay their final respects.

2218
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:44.570
Uh,
and then they would leave.

2219
02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:47.510
But what happened was that the families would then pay their final respects and

2220
02:21:47.511 --> 02:21:51.290
then everybody would wait for the families to come to the street and stand on

2221
02:21:51.291 --> 02:21:52.124
the street.

2222
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:56.600
And so that you could see how the whole thing was evolving into this sort of

2223
02:21:56.750 --> 02:22:01.400
incredible 10 minutes.
And it started with,

2224
02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:05.870
people would turn up on the street and you'd find people that hadn't seen each

2225
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:09.020
other for years and they were just,
um,
hey,
how's it going?

2226
02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:10.730
Do you fancy going to the pub for a pint?

2227
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:13.160
And they'd go and they'd have a drink and there would be this,

2228
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:15.470
it was almost like a party atmosphere.

2229
02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:19.100
People were already pleased to see each other and there was this lively,

2230
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:23.630
bubbly noise going on and people were laughing and joking.

2231
02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:29.260
Then the families would turn up and everything would sort of calmed down just a

2232
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:34.710
little bit.
And then the bells would toll in the church.

2233
02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.690
And there was complete silence.

2234
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:42.570
And then the Cortez would come through and it would stop and it would be led by

2235
02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.710
a lead sort of pull bear and it would stop and it would give five minutes with

2236
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:50.850
the families.
And then sometimes it was just one horse.
Sometimes it was,

2237
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:56.220
I did one occasion,
there was six,
six verses.
It came in.
Um,

2238
02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:00.000
and,
and then it would leave and then everybody would disperse and then it would

2239
02:23:00.001 --> 02:23:03.600
happen again.
And then again.
And it would,
could be two,
could be twice a week,

2240
02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:07.470
it might be once a month.
But I'd said every time it happens,

2241
02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:12.240
I'm going to go down and shoot the story in a linear fashion because I just

2242
02:23:12.241 --> 02:23:14.880
wanted to show everything from start to finish.

2243
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:17.340
So when you look at the essay of 50 pictures,

2244
02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:22.820
it starts at the beginning with the street empty and then it works up to the

2245
02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:24.270
last thing you see on the street.

2246
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:27.810
And the roses as the horses have driven off and the rest of the form of the

2247
02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.270
hoses.
Um,

2248
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:33.240
but I couldn't do it as a press photographer would do it.

2249
02:23:33.330 --> 02:23:37.320
I had to find a way of doing it and because I would just want it to get those

2250
02:23:37.321 --> 02:23:38.010
moments.

2251
02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:41.040
I was looking for something completely different to what may be the newspapers

2252
02:23:41.041 --> 02:23:42.420
and the wire agencies were looking for.

2253
02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:48.350
So I decided to shoot on film and I have to Leica m six is and I had a 28 mil

2254
02:23:48.361 --> 02:23:49.930
and the 50 mil and I put film in a,

2255
02:23:49.970 --> 02:23:53.370
because I could operate and you just can't hear those cameras.
That's just uh,

2256
02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:00.100
um,
as opposed to the digital,
which was really loud.
Um,

2257
02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:03.060
and I started shooting it on film and it was really hit and miss.

2258
02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:09.170
I'd get stuff and I go down there on some occasions and I'd get nothing,

2259
02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:15.420
but every time I went down as I was building the story,
I knew,
okay,

2260
02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:18.750
I'll look at the situation and work out what I'm going to get from this today

2261
02:24:18.751 --> 02:24:22.260
and concentrate on one thing.
And invariably you would construe it in one thing,

2262
02:24:22.261 --> 02:24:26.760
but what you would get was something that would happen somewhere else.
Um,

2263
02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:31.940
and so it meant getting into positions that the press we're not supposed to be

2264
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:36.540
getting into.
So I would want to go onto the other side of the street,

2265
02:24:36.541 --> 02:24:39.770
which was reserved for family.
I mean anyone could stand them,

2266
02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:43.920
but the unwritten rule was this is for family and I didn't want to intrude on

2267
02:24:43.921 --> 02:24:48.870
the family and their grief and I wasn't there to photograph their grief from my

2268
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:51.240
position up close.

2269
02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:56.300
I just wanted to see the reaction of people around there that I couldn't see

2270
02:24:56.581 --> 02:24:57.600
from the other side of the road.

2271
02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:02.100
So I was taking pictures and I felt so conspicuous and I was there with these

2272
02:25:02.101 --> 02:25:04.020
two tiny cameras,
but I felt so conspicuous,

2273
02:25:04.021 --> 02:25:07.470
but no one was looking at me and I was able to just turn the camera around and

2274
02:25:07.471 --> 02:25:10.710
just prefocused and shooting.
I don't put it to my,
I just turn around,

2275
02:25:10.830 --> 02:25:14.820
click shoot.
Um,
so everything was sort of one,
one frame.

2276
02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:18.120
Um,
and yeah,

2277
02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:22.980
I sort of gradually sort of built the story up and I knew that it had an ending

2278
02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:24.980
because it,

2279
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.090
the Ebay they were coming into originally before it came to wooden Bassett had

2280
02:25:31.091 --> 02:25:36.010
been rebuilt and all the bodies were going to be repatriated back to the other

2281
02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:39.600
air base.
So I knew at some point,
uh,

2282
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:44.110
in August,
2011,
there would be the last repatriation.
So,

2283
02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:46.600
um,
the,
the,

2284
02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:51.310
the fights you have with yourself when you're looking at the story and you're

2285
02:25:51.311 --> 02:25:53.790
sitting there thinking,
okay,
I think I need these,

2286
02:25:54.430 --> 02:25:56.320
I need an image here to fill this gap.

2287
02:25:56.321 --> 02:26:01.321
Is that your waiting for a soldier to die in order for you to finish your story?

2288
02:26:05.350 --> 02:26:08.050
And it's not that you're waiting for a soldier to die,

2289
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:12.730
but a soldier dies and you or you know,

2290
02:26:12.731 --> 02:26:13.810
in order for you to finish it yet,

2291
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:18.830
this isn't that I'm not even articulate enough to explain what I mean by that.

2292
02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:24.580
But the idea that you hear on the news,
two soldiers had been killed.

2293
02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:26.290
Um,
and you think,
okay,

2294
02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:28.840
that's me going back down to wouldn't pass it to finish this story.

2295
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:34.530
So the idea that I had a purpose of going down to a place like that was really

2296
02:26:35.741 --> 02:26:38.380
hard to deal with because people,

2297
02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:44.420
w everyone else down there was there because they were involved in or directly

2298
02:26:45.431 --> 02:26:49.690
involved with the soldier or they were people that just went to pay their

2299
02:26:49.691 --> 02:26:53.230
respects.
And so you could say,
in a way,

2300
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:54.850
if I wanted to justify it to myself,

2301
02:26:54.851 --> 02:26:58.240
you are paying your respects in a way because I wanted to,

2302
02:26:58.810 --> 02:27:02.110
I wanted this story to be shot from start to finish because I think it deserved

2303
02:27:02.111 --> 02:27:02.291
that.

2304
02:27:02.291 --> 02:27:07.291
It wasn't just about grieving family members on the other side of a hearse,

2305
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:12.460
you know,
weeping.
It,
there was so much more to that story than that.

2306
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.390
And so gradually the story began to sort of fill itself out.
And,
um,

2307
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.270
and then in the end,
the,
uh,

2308
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:24.070
I was there for the final repatriation and,
um,

2309
02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:27.670
the town was then awarded royal status,

2310
02:27:28.270 --> 02:27:30.790
which is the first time that happened,
I don't know,

2311
02:27:30.791 --> 02:27:35.791
I think over a hundred years because it was the way I think that they,

2312
02:27:36.470 --> 02:27:40.150
they were the town,
the way that it conducted itself,
um,

2313
02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.160
was recognized

2314
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:48.130
by the royal family and they just sort of said,
listen,
the,
what you've done,

2315
02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:50.740
you've,
you've not just put work and pass it on the map,

2316
02:27:50.741 --> 02:27:55.741
but you've shown how much dignity the British show when you know that those that

2317
02:27:57.101 --> 02:28:00.040
are fighting for their country or coming back and,
and the way,

2318
02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:02.950
the whole thing and,
and wouldn't pass it.
They didn't want the adulation.

2319
02:28:02.951 --> 02:28:07.810
They didn't want to be known as this place.
They just thought the,

2320
02:28:07.811 --> 02:28:11.950
we need to do this.
Um,
and yep,
it's from the heart.

2321
02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:14.020
Like we were saying earlier,
there's no,

2322
02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:17.290
there was no ulterior motive from that town to do what they did.

2323
02:28:17.291 --> 02:28:21.560
It just happened.
It was organic and I wanted to show that story.
Um,

2324
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:24.560
and so,
yeah,
that was it,
that it took,

2325
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:28.820
I think it was 19 months of going down and I'm

2326
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:35.630
photographing it in every,
you know,
from,
from every conceivable angle.

2327
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:38.960
And I was really proud of the finished set of pictures.

2328
02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:41.350
I thought that tells the story,
um,

2329
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:45.920
from how I saw it from start to finish.
Um,

2330
02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:49.550
and yeah,
it was,
um,
and when it,
when it,

2331
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:56.000
when it finished,
I didn't know how I felt because I thought,

2332
02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:59.570
you know,
when you get so used to doing something and you know,

2333
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.760
I don't want soldiers to die so that I can go down and finish the story,

2334
02:29:05.810 --> 02:29:08.990
but he try and work out how to,
how do I,

2335
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:13.250
how do I mentally get my head around what's happening here,
you know?

2336
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:18.230
But the,
the thing that's come out of it is that,

2337
02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:23.090
um,
on the final
repatriation,

2338
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:29.110
I wanted the pictures to be exhibited down that I wanted to show wouldn't acid

2339
02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.180
while I spent 18 months doing,

2340
02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:37.610
but I didn't want to stick prince in a room and I didn't want,
you know,

2341
02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:40.940
I just thought these pictures,
I,
this is,
I shot this on the streets.

2342
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:43.760
These pictures need to be on the street.

2343
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:50.230
So I went down and I found a bank that said to me,

2344
02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:56.831
you can have both double fronted windows of our bank and you can put your images

2345
02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:05.420
up during the final repatriation because they thought we would love people to

2346
02:30:05.421 --> 02:30:09.920
see this imagery.
And the reaction it got,

2347
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:14.330
I was really quite nervous because there were 50 images going up,

2348
02:30:14.331 --> 02:30:19.331
printed on a one size in a bank's shot,

2349
02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:23.200
went in,
in,
in the glass and the window.
Uh,

2350
02:30:23.350 --> 02:30:25.640
and I was really quite nervous as to how people would look at it.

2351
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:29.240
I thought would,
you know,
would,
would people appreciate this?
And they loved it.

2352
02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:32.870
They loved the fact that this had been done.

2353
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:37.780
And when I went back down to collect the images,
um,

2354
02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:39.080
I would say half of them,

2355
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:44.230
I just gave away to the pub where you have the pictures of the soldiers saluting

2356
02:30:44.511 --> 02:30:46.160
outside the pub that everybody went to.

2357
02:30:46.161 --> 02:30:48.620
There was the old lady standing in the glass window.

2358
02:30:48.621 --> 02:30:51.950
There was the kid wearing the Chelsea shirt.
All these pictures just went.

2359
02:30:51.951 --> 02:30:52.880
And I just said,
listen,

2360
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:56.960
just put some money in the charity box and just take the prints.

2361
02:30:57.170 --> 02:31:00.500
Because if all of them had gone,

2362
02:31:00.530 --> 02:31:03.290
I would have thought that was fantastic because I didn't want to keep them.

2363
02:31:03.291 --> 02:31:06.170
I just wondered if somebody,
I thought,
if somebody wants that and they want it,

2364
02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:09.890
that's amazing.
And a lot of them went.
Um,

2365
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:14.780
and that to me was indication of having spent that time and done it,
you know?

2366
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:17.900
Um,
and during that time,
as a photographer,

2367
02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:21.600
I grew because I sort of come out of that

2368
02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:26.550
way of shooting for the y,
which is all about a single image.

2369
02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.670
Tell a story in the single image,
in a,
an eye,

2370
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.310
I suppose ever from ever since the beginning,
I've always been a photography,

2371
02:31:33.330 --> 02:31:36.960
wanted to tell a story,
but with a series of images,
not just,

2372
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:40.840
and there's a skill to doing what the why guys do.
And,
and,

2373
02:31:41.010 --> 02:31:43.410
and I had that skill and I did it,

2374
02:31:43.411 --> 02:31:48.411
but I wanted to just expand my palate as a photographer.

2375
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:50.460
And that meant

2376
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:56.460
spending time on stories and trying to tell it as you know,
as a complete,

2377
02:31:56.461 --> 02:32:00.390
so you could take one picture out of there and go,
well,
what does that mean?

2378
02:32:00.391 --> 02:32:04.770
That picture?
But if you put it into the set,
you go,
oh,
okay,

2379
02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.730
now I know what it means.

2380
02:32:05.731 --> 02:32:08.370
So you'll not shooting standalone images that you're shooting images.

2381
02:32:08.371 --> 02:32:12.420
That means something when they're put together as a,
as a package.

2382
02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:17.250
Um,
yeah.
And that was,
yeah,
I was very proud of those pictures.

2383
02:32:19.250 --> 02:32:23.210
<v 0>Well,
like I said,
those pictures are,
are amazing.
And,</v>

2384
02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.820
and I think they did exactly what,

2385
02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:30.860
why Wootton Bassett was,
what was it named?
A royal town boy wouldn't mess it.

2386
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:34.430
Royal wouldn't pass it.
I think it reflected exactly what that,

2387
02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:38.900
what that put forth in that as the,
the pride of England,
the honor of England,

2388
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:42.290
the respect of England.

2389
02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:46.010
And I think that was all captured not only in the town but of the images that

2390
02:32:46.011 --> 02:32:46.844
you took.

2391
02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:51.110
And I think we've been going for a long time right now and

2392
02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:57.770
I think that's about all we've got for tonight.
I know,
I do want to say,

2393
02:32:58.580 --> 02:33:02.720
obviously,
thanks for coming on.

2394
02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:05.840
I know I worked with,
uh,
some photographers overseas.

2395
02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:10.100
Some of them just took incredible risks to get the capture,

2396
02:33:10.101 --> 02:33:13.460
to capture the moments that they captured,
you know,
uh,
the book of life.

2397
02:33:13.461 --> 02:33:18.050
And I wrote guide named Todd Pittman,
who is their combat.
He was,

2398
02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:22.100
he was a photographer and just took some incredible images.
And we,

2399
02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:25.610
we were honored to,
to be able to take those images and putting them in the book.

2400
02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:26.740
<v 1>But I know there's</v>

2401
02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:29.290
<v 0>many,
many,
obviously many photographers,</v>

2402
02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:34.620
journalists around the world that take great risks to report and capture the

2403
02:33:34.991 --> 02:33:38.260
stories and get them spread around and,
and a lot of them were killed.

2404
02:33:38.261 --> 02:33:39.760
And you mentioned one at the beginning,
but a lot of,

2405
02:33:39.761 --> 02:33:42.880
there's a lot of reporters and photographers,

2406
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:47.290
journalists that are out there in the world that they take huge risks and

2407
02:33:47.291 --> 02:33:49.810
sometimes they pay the ultimate price for their job.

2408
02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:56.393
This was a,

2409
02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:00.020
I know I've said a couple of things on the podcast that were pretty rough.

2410
02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:03.860
I appreciate everyone for sticking through those,
those tough moments.

2411
02:34:04.730 --> 02:34:08.000
Appreciate you traveling to those places and sticking through those tough

2412
02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:12.250
moments yourself,
Karen,
and thanks for everybody for,

2413
02:34:12.251 --> 02:34:16.880
for listening to the podcast.
If you do want to support the podcast

2414
02:34:18.450 --> 02:34:22.390
<v 4>that go
tell him how to support it.
My brother,</v>

2415
02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:27.490
well we didn't really talk much about working out or anything that would

2416
02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:30.520
constitute much supplementation,

2417
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:35.110
but what about Alpha brain out for brain?
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

2418
02:34:35.170 --> 02:34:36.200
that's true.
Yeah.

2419
02:34:36.270 --> 02:34:39.730
Cause you gotta be quick with your finger on the trigger of your,

2420
02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.620
of your camera.

2421
02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:45.880
In some cases you might want to get some of that Alpha brain I was talking to

2422
02:34:47.050 --> 02:34:50.500
was just,
I was talking to somebody,
this is like yesterday,

2423
02:34:50.501 --> 02:34:53.620
the day before about photography and

2424
02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.030
you know how people,
they'll see like a real good picture and they'll be like,

2425
02:34:58.031 --> 02:35:01.180
hey,
that's a good,
that's a cool picture.
What camera did you use?

2426
02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:05.530
Do you ever find that insulting?
Uh,

2427
02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:11.860
I've heard it.
I've heard it compared to like
this girl.

2428
02:35:11.861 --> 02:35:14.980
I know Holly,
she's active enough and a photographer and uh,

2429
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:20.490
she said it like this once when someone asked her what kind of camera she is.

2430
02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:23.580
Like that's a great picture of what kind of camera did you use tsheets lake

2431
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:26.770
saying,
hey,
that's a great meal.
What kind of stove did you use?

2432
02:35:27.490 --> 02:35:31.630
Something like that.
Yeah,
I know.
I get that meeting you at the archer.

2433
02:35:31.631 --> 02:35:34.960
It was the bow and the Arrow that made it a good shot.
Right,
exactly.

2434
02:35:34.961 --> 02:35:37.660
I think I've had it the other way around.
I've had people say,
wow,

2435
02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.440
that's a lovely looking camera.
You must have shot some great pictures with that,

2436
02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:46.260
you know,
so yeah,
that's probably enlite but in reverse know.

2437
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:51.250
Um,
but uh,
but you keep it traditional too.

2438
02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:52.661
I mean,

2439
02:35:52.661 --> 02:35:57.661
I mean obviously you're doing manual focus on film a lot of times digital.

2440
02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.410
This is,
this is the,
yeah.
Manual manual focus on digital as well.
Yeah.

2441
02:36:02.430 --> 02:36:05.290
But I've been using them so for 20 odd years.

2442
02:36:05.291 --> 02:36:08.890
So not the like is they're not everybody's cup of tea.

2443
02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:12.410
I know a lot of professional photographers,
they're not,
you know,

2444
02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:17.650
it's not their cup of tea,
but,
and,
and also,
you know,
it's a particular type of,

2445
02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:20.830
for the journalists I think that uses a camera like this.

2446
02:36:20.831 --> 02:36:21.850
And when I say particular,

2447
02:36:21.851 --> 02:36:25.570
I mean they shoot particular stories and a particular way.

2448
02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:28.840
It's not that you know,
they're any better than anybody else.

2449
02:36:28.841 --> 02:36:29.650
They certainly aren't.

2450
02:36:29.650 --> 02:36:32.560
They just choose to use a camera that doesn't have long lenses.

2451
02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:36.730
And I like to use a cabinet,
doesn't,
my longest lens is a 50 mil.

2452
02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:39.610
You got to stock your target.
Yeah.

2453
02:36:40.810 --> 02:36:45.580
I like to use these are quiet and you're getting close.
Yeah.
Even that,
that's

2454
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:50.370
so much detailed to the art,
you know,

2455
02:36:50.371 --> 02:36:54.400
we're of course equipment is something sure.
Like distinct part of it.

2456
02:36:54.401 --> 02:36:59.320
And I think it's,
I think photography gets it the most,
I think because it's like,

2457
02:36:59.350 --> 02:37:01.720
like I said,
I want the photographer now.
Absolutely.
There we good.

2458
02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:02.710
I can take a picture.

2459
02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:05.170
You mean a good camera Mike and look like that and everybody can,

2460
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:07.150
everybody has it in them to shoot a beautiful picture.

2461
02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:12.220
I firmly believe everybody can shoot a great picture.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2462
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:14.860
But yeah,
so I'll put rain,
boom picks him alpha.

2463
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:19.780
Take better pictures of tension of the day.
There you go.
Fuck.

2464
02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:22.010
Gotta Lug heavy camera equipment around.

2465
02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:26.820
You know there's some shooting tech for tech for that one.
Yeah.

2466
02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.220
Running TV as sewage.
That could have helped you in the later.

2467
02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:35.600
Yeah,
that's right.
Um,

One of the laws of combat.

2518
02:40:52.310 --> 02:40:56.130
So check that out.
It is pomegranate white tea.
It's obviously,

2519
02:40:56.131 --> 02:40:58.080
I talked about that on the first,

2520
02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:03.510
my introduction to the world was when Tim Ferriss said I mixed up some,

2521
02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:06.030
some pomegranate white tea and you know Tim,
he's a,

2522
02:41:06.270 --> 02:41:10.120
he's an affection auto of t did that could shadow yeah,

2523
02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:11.890
that that too.
Yeah.

2524
02:41:12.330 --> 02:41:15.510
He has a special um,

2525
02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:19.710
kettle where you press what kind of tea you're drinking and it's going to bring

2526
02:41:19.711 --> 02:41:23.910
it to the appropriate temperature for that type of tea.
Green tea,
white tea,

2527
02:41:23.911 --> 02:41:26.940
black tea.
It's,
it's going to do it right.
He's got that thing,

2528
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.370
he's got like a little shelf.
He's into his tea,

2529
02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:32.850
but he never had the white pomegranate tea before.

2530
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:34.980
So when I showed up and I said,
hey,
you want some of this?

2531
02:41:34.981 --> 02:41:36.930
And so I mixed it up for him and he's drinking it in,
in,

2532
02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:41.720
we were starting to podcast in,
you know,
like 20 minutes in,

2533
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.960
12 minutes later he starts going,
yeah,
that went well,
kind of.
He was that,

2534
02:41:45.961 --> 02:41:47.020
he was all kinds of fire.

2535
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:51.810
So then the next thing that happened was on Amazon.

2536
02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:57.300
I would see people would order extreme ownership and then it would be like,
oh,

2537
02:41:57.301 --> 02:42:00.750
people that brought extreme ownership also bought pomegranate white tea.

2538
02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:05.730
And then finally one of the t people said,
hey,
do you need to have your own tea?

2539
02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:10.170
And I said,
okay,
start.
I'll make my own tea,
but it's going to be good,

2540
02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.390
real good.
So I went through it,
but it took a while because I kept saying,
no,
no,

2541
02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:17.280
nope.
Do this.
Nope.
A little bit more of that.

2542
02:42:17.310 --> 02:42:20.160
And finally we got to the t that not only tastes good,

2543
02:42:20.161 --> 02:42:22.740
but it gives you the delight,
Pomegranate d power.

2544
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:27.270
So be looking for that.
Uh,
speaking of extreme ownership,

2545
02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:30.360
you can buy that book written by myself and my brother Leif Babin.

2546
02:42:30.690 --> 02:42:34.770
You can get on hardcover where you can make lots of notes and put little tabs in

2547
02:42:34.771 --> 02:42:37.410
there and highlight stuff.
You can buy it on digital.

2548
02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:41.130
I think you could make notes notes on digital too,
but it doesn't look as cool.

2549
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:45.930
Kindle.
Yeah,
you can put notes in kindle.
The kindle APP.

2550
02:42:48.310 --> 02:42:51.630
I don't know what it did without,
well,
I didn't really read before that,

2551
02:42:51.631 --> 02:42:54.120
but I'm just saying that you can go do notes

2552
02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:58.950
all at your finger to the really good.
That's good.
And I'm glad you did that.

2553
02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:03.900
Me Personally,
I need to have physical,
you know?
No,
I got my pen's lined up,

2554
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:07.100
highlighters lined up,
you know,
things with the physical,
I mean,

2555
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:12.040
can I really do the podcasts from a kindle?
Is that going to no,
no.
We

2556
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:13.480
<v 4>would have to shut down the podcast.
Well,</v>

2557
02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:16.300
you'd have to learn how to use a kindle first.
You would,

2558
02:43:16.570 --> 02:43:18.650
<v 0>oh,
I'd have to free my mind a little bit.
Yeah.</v>

2559
02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:24.640
Then also the extreme ownership muster,

2560
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:28.630
which is a little conference we're having out here in San Diego,
California.

2561
02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:34.290
If you want to talk about all this stuff in depth with some real focus myself

2562
02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:38.170
Lafe running this thing out here in San Diego,

2563
02:43:38.171 --> 02:43:41.470
California leadership conference,

2564
02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:44.020
but that's one way of looking at it.

2565
02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:49.500
Another way of looking at is frontal assault on your brain,

2566
02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.930
