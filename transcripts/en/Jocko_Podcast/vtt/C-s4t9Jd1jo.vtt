00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.320
Mikey scared of everything,
finds a book

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.590
that he finds,
it's called the dragon,
the prince.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.070
And he's scared to read it cause the pictures a scary dragons in it.

4
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.920
But then he gets the courage to read it because he sees a little boy in there

5
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.020
too.
That kind of looks like he knows what's going on.

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.420
So he sees that little blankets.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.290
I'm gonna read it and in the book the king is dead

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
and the boy is now the only one that will defend the kingdom from the dragon

9
00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:32.740
center over the hill.

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.760
It's dragging cave and the boys scared cause he only seven years old,

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660
he doesn't know he's going to do it.
Goes and finds its farmers.

12
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:42.460
Your war chest was out,
the shield pulls up the sword,

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.070
they're too big for him and now he's even more scared.

14
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:50.071
But then he sees a note in the bottom of the war chest and he picks up the note

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.070
and here's what it says,
my son,

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.100
our kingdom is now what you must save.
I need to do that.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.540
You have to be brave.
The dragons,

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.760
they aren't really that big at all.

19
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.740
It is only in our minds that we make them so tall inside.

20
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.350
Our brains think he's always get overblown,

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.250
especially things that are completely unknown.

22
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.990
Stand up straight and hold your head high and look your fears right in the eye.

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.900
Don't look away.
Don't try to hide.

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.740
No that you have great strength.
Deep inside

25
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.300
fear is normal for every person on earth.
This is where I hero.
