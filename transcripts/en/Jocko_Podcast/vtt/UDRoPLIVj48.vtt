This is Jocko podcast number one 19 with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.550
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.240
on September 11th 400 miles from the collapse of World Trade Center towers,

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.810
three dozen passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93 remained in airborne

5
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.380
purgatory.

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.930
<v 0>Starting at 9:30 AM for some 30 minutes.</v>

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.330
14 of them manage to telephone,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.390
either loved ones or operators on the ground.

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.390
Public Relations Man,

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.220
Mark Bingham got through to his aunt's home in California.

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.550
<v 0>This is mark.
He began,</v>

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.030
I want to let you guys know that I love you in case I don't see you again.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.060
<v 0>Then I'm on United Airlines flight 93 it's being hijacked.</v>

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.430
Two other callers from the plane,
not only provided information,

18
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.540
but also gleaned vital news from those.
They phoned Tom Burnett,

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.540
chief operating officer for a medical devices from,

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.330
made her number of brief calls to his wife Dina.

21
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.430
<v 0>Speaking quietly.</v>

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
He asked her to contact the authorities and told her that a male passenger had

24
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:25.170
been stabbed.
Later that he had died,

25
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.630
a woman,

26
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.800
perhaps a flight attendant was being held at knife point and the hijackers

27
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.450
claimed they had a bomb.

28
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.500
<v 0>Jeremy Glick.</v>

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
<v 0>A salesman for an Internet services company also managed to phone in a long</v>

32
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.350
conversation with his wife,

33
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.380
Liz Glick said the hijackers had put on these red headbands.

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.350
They said they had a bomb.
They looked Iranian.

35
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.040
<v 0>The bomb was in a red box.
He said,</v>

37
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.710
<v 1>okay.</v>

38
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.410
<v 0>The couple told each other how much they loved each other.</v>

39
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.510
<v 0>Glick said,
I don't want to die,</v>

41
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.230
and his wife are assured him that he would not.

42
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.790
She urged him to keep a picture of her and they're 11 week old daughter in his

43
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.010
head.
To think good thoughts.

44
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.740
Burnett's wife who had been watching the news on television told him that two

45
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:33.340
planes had crashed into the world trade center.
My God,
he responded,

46
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.140
it's a suicide mission.

47
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430
By the time he phoned a third time after news of the crashed into the Pentagon,

48
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.990
she told them about that too.

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
<v 0>Burnett seems to have been seated beside Glick and apparently relayed all this</v>

51
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:50.790
information to him.

52
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.010
Were they to do nothing?

53
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.700
The two men must've agreed they were sure to die anyway.

54
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.310
When the hijackers crashed the plane,

55
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.690
they resolved to fight for their lives.

56
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.100
<v 0>A group of US Burnett told his wife are getting ready to do something.</v>

58
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.580
I'm going to take a vote,
click set on his call.

59
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.390
There's three other guys as big as me and we're thinking of attacking the guy

60
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:22.224
with the bomb.

61
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.020
So began the minutes of brave resistance.

62
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200
The clearly defined act of courage that has lived on in the national memory.

63
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320
Glick and others were equipped in more ways than one to confront the hijackers.

64
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.190
Glick was six foot one and a former college judo champion Burnett at six foot

65
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:51.450
two had played quarterback for his high school football team.

66
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.250
Mark Bingham was a huge man,

67
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:58.251
six foot four and at 31 still playing rugby a few years earlier.

68
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.840
He had fended off a mugger who had a gun.

69
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.030
His mother got the impression as he talked from flight 93 that our son was

70
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:09.000
talking confidently with a fellow passenger.

71
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.700
<v 0>She felt that maybe someone had organized a plan.</v>

73
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.250
At nine 42 a GTE version supervisor based near Chicago began handling a call

74
00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:26.690
from yet another powerfully built flight.
93 passenger.

75
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.860
<v 0>Todd beamer,</v>

77
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.490
a star Oracle software salesman was married with two sons and his wife was

78
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.700
expecting again.

79
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.090
<v 0>He first dialed his home number,</v>

81
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.640
but either failed to get through or thought better of it.

82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.140
Instead explaining it it he'd not want to upset his pregnant wife.

83
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.350
He asked the phone supervisor lead Lisa Jefferson to pass along a loving message

84
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.830
as they talked,
beamer suddenly exclaimed shit.
Oh my God,
we're going down.

85
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.970
Jesus help us.

86
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.100
<v 0>From the passengers around beamer came prolonged shrieks of terror.</v>

88
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.890
Then he said,
no,
wait,
we're coming back up.
I think we're okay now.

89
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.400
<v 0>Shakin beamer ass Jefferson to say the Lord's prayer with him.</v>

91
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.440
Our Father who art in heaven

92
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.160
just before beamer and the operator had begun talking.

93
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:34.810
Cleveland last Cleveland Control last flight,
93 is transponder.

94
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.350
The signal that indicates an airplane's location and altitude.

95
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.540
That nine 55 the hijacker pilots set a navigational aid relating to the plains

96
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:47.260
direction he was heading.
It indicated

97
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.920
<v 1>okay</v>

98
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.210
<v 0>for Washington DC.</v>

99
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.030
Jeremy Glick still on the phone to his wife.
Liz said,
I,

100
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.850
I could take this guy with the bomb.

101
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.380
<v 0>Then joking.
He had mentioned that the hijackers had knives.</v>

103
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.840
I still have my butter knife from breakfast.

104
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.700
<v 0>Todd beamer,
continuing in his conversation with the GTE supervisor,</v>

106
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.701
Jefferson told her that he and a few others were getting together to jump the

107
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:19.850
guy with the bomb.

108
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.480
<v 0>Was He sure that that was what he wanted to do?
Yes.
Came the response,</v>

110
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.690
I'm going to have to go out on faith.

111
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.350
<v 0>I don't have much of a choice.</v>

113
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.200
<v 0>The plane was flying a radically again.</v>

115
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.530
<v 0>Operator Jefferson heard the sounds of an awful commotion,</v>

117
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.610
raised voices,
more screams.
Then are you guys ready?

118
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.900
And Todd beamers voice saying,
let's roll

119
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.440
a phrase that in family life he'd like to use to get his children moving.

120
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.260
Okay.
Jeremy Click cold.
Told his wife,
Liz,
I'm going to do it.

121
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

122
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.740
<v 0>His wife told him he was strong and brave and that she loved him.</v>

123
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.460
Okay.
He said again,
I'm going to put the phone down.

124
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.720
I'm going to leave it here and I'm going to come right back to it.

125
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.800
Liz handed the phone to her father ran to the bathroom and gagged

126
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.830
flight attendant.

127
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.510
Sandra Bradshaw was in the Galley boiling water for the passengers to throw on

128
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:41.070
the hijackers on the phone to her husband.
She signed off quickly.

129
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.130
Everyone's running up to first class.
I've got to go.
Bye.

130
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.690
The cockpit voice recorder registered.

131
00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:53.280
The moment the hijackers realized what was happening at just before nine 58 a

132
00:07:53.281 --> 00:07:56.280
hijacker asks,
is there something,
a fight.

133
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.110
There's a knock on the door followed by the sounds of fighting.
Then an Arabic.

134
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.180
Let's go guys.
Allah is the greatest allies.
Greatest.
Oh guys,

135
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.590
a law greatest.
Oh La la La la.
Oh,
the most gracious.

136
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.250
<v 0>Then loudly stay back.</v>

138
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.610
A male voice and native English speaking voice that Tom Burnett's wife has

139
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:26.810
recognized is that of her husband is heard saying in the cockpit,

140
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.460
in the cockpit,
followed by voice exclaiming an Arabic.
They want to get in here.

141
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.620
Hold,
hold from the inside hold.

142
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.130
<v 0>Then from several English speakers in uniform,</v>

144
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.210
unison hold the door and then from a single English speaker stopped him,

145
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.770
followed repeatedly by sit down,
sit down.
Then again from an English speaker,

146
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.940
let's get them

147
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.350
flight 93 now to 5,000 feet had begun rolling left and right.

148
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.090
Jeremy Glicks father-in-law listening intently on the phone.

149
00:09:04.091 --> 00:09:08.260
His daughter had handed to him.
Now heard screams in the background.

150
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.150
<v 0>On the cockpit voice recorder.
There's the sound of combat continuing.</v>

152
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.540
Then in Arabic there is nothing.

153
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.250
Shall we finish it off?
No,
not yet.

154
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.850
When they all come,
we finish it off.

155
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.830
Then from Tom Burnett,
I am injured.

156
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.650
The flight data recorder indicates that the plane pitched up and down climbed at

157
00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:40.480
10,000 feet turned.

158
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.410
<v 0>Glicks father in law foam clap too.</v>

160
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:48.140
Is your heard more shrieks muffled now?

161
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.380
Like those of people riding on a roller coaster.

162
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.470
<v 0>In Arabic on the voice recorder.
Oh,</v>

164
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:04.580
ah,
Oh,
ah,
oh gracious.

165
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.190
In English.
In the cockpit.
If we don't,
we'll die

166
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.790
in Arabic,
up,
down,
up,
down,
up,

167
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:21.560
down from a distance,

168
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.820
perhaps from Todd beamer roll it

169
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.880
crashing sounds then in Arabic,
uh,

170
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.960
law as the greatest law as the greatest.
Is that it?

171
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.580
I mean,
shall we put it down?
Yes.

172
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.340
Put it in and pull it down.
Cut off the oxygen.

173
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:48.570
Cut off the oxygen.
Cut off the oxygen.
Up,
down,
up,
down,
up,
down.

174
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.240
More violent noises for as long as a minute.

175
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.070
And then apparently from a native English speaker,
shut them off.
Go,
go,
move,

176
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.850
move.
Turn it up.
Then an Arabic down,

177
00:11:00.851 --> 00:11:03.220
down.
Pull it down.
Pull it down.
Down.

178
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.743
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.420
<v 0>Apparently from an English speaker down,
push,
push,
push,
push,</v>

180
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.343
push.

181
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.750
<v 0>In Arabic.
Hey,
hey,
give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.</v>

183
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.240
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

184
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.310
Intermittent loud air noise on the cockpit recorder.

185
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.020
Moments later in Arabic,
uh,
laws,
the greatest,
uh,
laws,

186
00:11:38.021 --> 00:11:42.750
the greatest,
uh,
laws,
the greatest,
uh,
laws,
the greatest,
uh,
laws,

187
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.593
the greatest.

188
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.400
There's sounds of further struggle and the loud shout from a native English

189
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:53.860
speaker,
no

190
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.910
two seconds later in Arabic in a whisper now

191
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:11.530
allows the greatest,
uh,
laws,
the greatest,
uh,
laws,
the greatest,

192
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.690
uh,
laws,
the greatest.

193
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.200
Jeremy Glicks father-in-law still listening on the ground,

194
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.350
heard high pitched screams coming over the line.

195
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.030
Glick had left open when he left the join to join the rush to the cockpit.

196
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Then when the sounds followed by banging noises as though the phone to board the

197
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:41.790
plane was repeatedly being banged on a hard surface.

198
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.680
After that
silence on the phone,

199
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.230
silence on the cockpit voice recorder.

200
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.290
And that is an excerpt.

201
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.440
<v 0>From a book called the 11th Day,
which came out in 2011 by</v>

203
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.520
Anthony Summers and Robyn Swan.

204
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

205
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.520
<v 0>And we all know what that silence meant.
Yeah.</v>

206
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.550
Flight 93 crashed into a field near the diamond t mind and Stony Creek Township,

207
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.190
Somerset County,
Pennsylvania,
killing 33 innocent passengers,

208
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.950
seven innocent crew members

209
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.730
and for demonic hijackers.

210
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.063
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

211
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.510
<v 0>that day changed.</v>

212
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

213
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.420
<v 0>My world,
and it changed our world.</v>

214
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.360
The world as we knew it

215
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.390
turned it commenced to years and years.

216
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.020
<v 0>And years of war that has cost</v>

218
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.430
so many lives.

219
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.970
And at some point on this podcast,

220
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:45.210
I'm sure we'll go into more details about the horrors of September 11th you

221
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:50.800
probably be multiple podcasts,
but for today,

222
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.230
I wanted to focus on one aspect of one part of the life of one man.

223
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.930
On that flight,
the man named Jeremy Glick,

224
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.373
<v 1>who</v>

225
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.900
<v 0>by all accounts was an amazing human being,</v>

226
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.340
a son and a husband and a father.

227
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.670
But for those of us

228
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.650
who fight or who trained martial arts and Gen general,

229
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:33.950
something caught our ears.
When we heard about the heroics on flight 93

230
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.380
we heard that Jeremy Glick was a martial artist,

231
00:15:40.381 --> 00:15:42.610
that he was a wrestler and that he was a judoka.

232
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.060
And as a wrestler,

233
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.870
he wasn't competitive.

234
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:55.871
All state wrestler for Saddle River Day School in northern New Jersey.

235
00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:57.800
If you know anything about New Jersey wrestling,

236
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:02.180
it's an extremely competitive wrestling state.
And beyond that,

237
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.440
as a judo player,

238
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.250
Glick was an American national collegiate judo champion.

239
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.970
While he was a student at the University of Rochester.

240
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.420
And in September of 2008

241
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.140
seven years after the incident,

242
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:27.200
September 11th there was a memorial ceremony

243
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.870
at the crash site in Pennsylvania and the United States Judo Association Place

244
00:16:36.521 --> 00:16:41.521
Day granted stone there as a memorial with an inscription on it.

245
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.970
And the inscription reads,

246
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:52.971
the United States Judo Association promote promoted Jeremy Glick to the highest

247
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:59.421
rank of black belt for living the principle of judo.

248
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.180
<v 0>Mutual welfare and benefit sacrificing his life for our country.</v>

250
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.610
September 11th,
2001

251
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.960
living the principle of judo.
And that's a bold statement.

252
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.350
It indicates something very powerful and very meaningful

253
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.123
<v 1>and</v>

254
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:36.050
<v 0>as a patriot and as a martial artist and specifically as a Jujitsu practitioner,</v>

255
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.350
which is where judo was derived from,

256
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:45.351
I wanted to explore a little deeper into the principles of judo to see what we

257
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:46.524
can learn from it.

258
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.850
And I don't want to go into the full details

259
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.220
<v 1>of explaining the relationships between Jujitsu and judo,</v>

260
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.770
but it is a very close relationship.

261
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.450
It was one of g goro pain owes top students and Kainos the creator of judo.

262
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.860
But my eda that brought Jujitsu to Brazil from Japan and introduced Jujitsu to

263
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.800
Carlos and Eylea Gracie,

264
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.760
and that's the beginning of Brazilian Jujitsu as we know it today.

265
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.590
And my unit even called it Jujitsu,
he didn't call it judo.

266
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.890
And from what I understand at that time,

267
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.580
even Kaino had not been actually calling it judo in Japan.

268
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:36.270
He hadn't renamed it yet.

269
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.680
He was still calling it Jujitsu and some people were calling it Kaino Jujitsu or

270
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:46.980
Kodachrome Jujitsu.
But Jujitsu,

271
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.030
especially Brazilian Jujitsu is without question rooted in judo.

272
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.960
And if you trace it back just a little bit further,

273
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.490
judo is also routed back into Jujitsu.
That's where judo came from.

274
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.380
Judo came from Jujitsu
in

275
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.330
<v 0>mixed in with all that,</v>

276
00:19:05.331 --> 00:19:10.280
there's all kinds of evolution and there's changes and there's politics and

277
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:10.971
there's history,

278
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:15.971
but there's that thread that ties them all together and that thread can be

279
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:18.560
recognized in

280
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.300
many of the principles that are shared both in judo and in Jujitsu,

281
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.760
the same principles that played a role in Jeremy glicks attitude on that

282
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.900
clear,
sunny September day.

283
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.930
And perhaps we can all learn something from those principles.

284
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.310
And to look at those principles,

285
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.900
I thought it would be best to go to the source.

286
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.040
And I have a book called mind over muscle that is,

287
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.540
it's,

288
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.540
it's a compilation of writings from Igor okaynow and Kainoa was uh,

289
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:09.290
a very interesting person.
He was a,
he was an educator,

290
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.100
he was a pioneer in sports.
He worked with the Olympic Committee.

291
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:14.750
He was a Jujitsu practitioner,

292
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.250
eventually founded judo and he founded the most famous judo school,

293
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:23.660
the original judo school,
the Kodo con.
And the book,
like I said,
as,

294
00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:24.980
as you can tell by the title,

295
00:20:24.981 --> 00:20:28.010
it's a compilation of different sources of his writings.

296
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.030
And there's a little bit of overlap and repeat and I'll do a little bit of that.

297
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.300
But what I like about it is it gives a good overall view of the ideas and the

298
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:42.530
vision that Kaino had for Judah.

299
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.940
So I know there's a lot of judo practitioners out there and obviously a lot of

300
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:55.510
Jujitsu practitioners out there that listen to the podcast and everyone knows

301
00:20:55.511 --> 00:21:00.430
that these two are closely related.
And sometimes there's a,

302
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.940
I guess you'd say tension between the two sometimes,

303
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.550
but the fact of the matter is there are so closely related that it's,

304
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.133
it'd be more,

305
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.670
it'd be more intelligent instead of look for the tension between the two to find

306
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:20.260
where the two can compliment each other.

307
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So here we go into the book and once again the book is mind over muscle writings

308
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:33.310
from the founder of judo.
Did you go to Cato?

309
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.380
And here we go to start it off the purpose of Jujitsu.

310
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.950
So interesting that he starts this off.
It's talking about Jujitsu.

311
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.360
He's not even talking about judo yet.

312
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.080
The original purpose of Jujitsu was to practice a method of combat.

313
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.310
Well combat may have been at the core of Jujitsu practice.

314
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.590
It also had the related goals of physical education and mental training.

315
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.540
There was a little dispute that because training to fight involves moving the

316
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:05.350
body in various ways to get to indirectly became a form of physical education.

317
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.550
But for the same reason it also became a method for training the mind.

318
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.960
All Forms of combat require ingenuity and the use of various tricks and devices.

319
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.820
So all forms of combat,
all forms of combat.
This is important

320
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.400
because when you,
if you're,
if you're a soldier,

321
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.420
you're a marine or Europe airman,

322
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.200
right now we're talking about everything that you do.
And I'll tell you what,

323
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:33.360
if you're a business person,

324
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.880
we're talking about what you're doing to all forms of combat,

325
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:40.150
required ingenuity and the use of various tricks and devices.

326
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.650
So in the course of Jujitsu training,
the mind is unconsciously trained.

327
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.580
In many ways,
courage,
composer,
composure,

328
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.270
and other traits that are beneficial in life can also be developed.
Now,

329
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.710
I'll tell you what,
this is important because people ask me a lot like,

330
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.290
uh,
you know,
how'd you figure all this stuff out?
Jocko?
When people ask me that,

331
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.330
and you know,
I,
I always try to explain,
you know,

332
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:10.300
like it was a long course and I was in the military for a long time and I had an

333
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:13.930
open mind and I listened to paid attention to the people that were leading me

334
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:15.940
and I paid attention,
the good ones.
And I paid attention to the bad ones.

335
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.360
But I'll tell you if I didn't,

336
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.830
I jujitsu opened my mind up and did these things,
and again,
unconsciously,

337
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.910
like I started to perceive things the way that I was learning Jujitsu.

338
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.530
And that's why,
and I've got some,
I've got,
you know,

339
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.870
I've got friends that I've gotten into Jujitsu over the years and you can tell,

340
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.540
and I don't know what makes some people get the bug and some people don't get

341
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.374
the bug,

342
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.270
but if you get the bug and you start to think in a Jujitsu mindset,

343
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:48.320
then y'all,
it'll really open up your mind.
Now,

344
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:52.400
that being said,
there's some people that are heavily into Jujitsu,

345
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:55.790
but they don't apply Jiu Jitsu to the f the other aspects of their life,

346
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:59.990
which is a big mistake.
It's a big mistake.
You got to apply it both ways.

347
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:01.760
And I think that's one of the things that,

348
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.870
that Cato was trying to do with judo was to ensure that you did that,

349
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.400
to ensure that his students did that.

350
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.433
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

351
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.570
<v 0>All right.
Back to the book,</v>

352
00:24:12.571 --> 00:24:16.710
it was my belief that with a few improvements,

353
00:24:16.711 --> 00:24:21.630
Jujitsu could become a comprehensive method of physical education.

354
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.000
Intellectual training and moral education.

355
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.350
I therefore spent several years developing my ideas and finally established the

356
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.730
Kodokan judo.

357
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.020
I did this by thoroughly researching the Jujitsu that had existed up until the

358
00:24:34.021 --> 00:24:36.480
time,
up until that time,
as much as possible,

359
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.140
keeping what I felt should be kept discarding what I felt should be discarded,

360
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.670
thoroughly studying the techniques and theories and establishing them in a way

361
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.540
that would be most applicable to today's society.

362
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.950
It's not even talking about just combat.

363
00:24:49.951 --> 00:24:51.420
He's talking about like he's not talking about fighting,

364
00:24:51.421 --> 00:24:53.550
he's like talking about applying these things to society.

365
00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:00.090
So there's a little bit of,
I think he was young when he did this too.

366
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.160
He established the Kodokan at a very young age,

367
00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:04.770
I want to say he was like 22 years old.
He was really young,

368
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.070
so he studied Jujitsu slots and things were good about it.

369
00:25:08.071 --> 00:25:10.560
Thought some things were bad about it and said,
I'm gonna make my own deal.

370
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.840
Now here we talk a little bit here.
There were,

371
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.930
there were various reasons why I chose not to use the term Jujitsu,

372
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:23.910
which described what was ordinarily practiced and instead employee the name
judo.

373
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.450
The main reason was that dough,
the dough part of judo,

374
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.440
judo,
it means way

375
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.280
is the major force is a major focus of what the code econ teachers,

376
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.730
whereas Jitsu skill is incidental.

377
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.600
I also wanted to make it clear that judo was a means of embarking on the way,

378
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.330
so he saw this as like a complete a complete life system,

379
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.920
right?
Not just fighting.

380
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.040
This is the way judo is the way for him and that's why he,

381
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:00.200
instead of calling it Jujitsu,
he called it,
you know,
not,

382
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:02.150
not tick techniques but like the way

383
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.010
back to the book.
When we talk about Jujitsu today,

384
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.270
people often think of a technique in which one does only dangerous things such

385
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.350
as choking and opponent and bending his joints or even in extreme cases killing

386
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:19.240
him.
Essentially we think of something that is harmful to the whole,

387
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.460
to the body while offering no benefits to Jujitsu does not espouse this in

388
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:25.634
particular,

389
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.990
the Kodokan judo I devised never involves doing anything dangerous.

390
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.440
I cannot stress enough that what I advocate is far from a violent or dangerous

391
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:36.374
sport.

392
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.833
<v 1>No,</v>

393
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.210
<v 0>sure.
I understand the principal there,</v>

394
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.880
but just so everyone knows,
judo doesn't play around.

395
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.970
If you've,
if you've gone with a high level,
do judo player,

396
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.420
you are getting thrown hard and aggressively onto your head.

397
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.530
Yeah.
It's a brutal sport.
It's a,
it's very aggressive.

398
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.010
<v 2>Do you think that that's how,
that's what,</v>

399
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.580
because when it comes down to the essence,

400
00:27:07.581 --> 00:27:12.210
it's kind of like in this just me totally guessing where judo,
well,

401
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.250
as it is now,
it's like,
okay.
The goal is basically to put the guy in his back.

402
00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:20.240
That's it.
Put them down in the ground,
not to hit him,
not to knock them down,

403
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.140
put them on the ground.
Right.
Just kind of seems okay.
That's a really violent,

404
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.320
that's kind of the little friendly competition.
Put them on the ground.

405
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.580
Now with any competitive situation,
oh guys,
I'm going to get after it.

406
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.180
And it slowly just evolves into all these crazy things but doesn't evolve.

407
00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:37.760
It escalates.
Escalates even just the whole way.

408
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.140
So even consider like basketball for example,
the goal,

409
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.040
put that ball in that basket.
That's it.
You can go from here,
come close lab,

410
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.160
whatever.
And then you,
you get this competitive drive,
these people,

411
00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:52.370
athletic abilities,
all this stuff.
Now it's turning into weird slam dunks.

412
00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:55.730
Now Brett,
you didn't have to slam dunk that thing,
but it's still the same thing.

413
00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:58.090
Putting the ball in the thing just in this weird aggressive

414
00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.600
<v 0>I guess.
Yeah,
I guess,
yeah.</v>

415
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.040
I guess a lay up compared to a Tomahawk slam dunk.

416
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:08.290
Right.
And if you compare a,
uh,

417
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.910
let's say some sort of a basic takedown compared to like a full,

418
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.870
if Paul and the slams in your head.
Yeah,
I could see your,

419
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.810
I can see your comparison.
See what I'm saying?
There's an escalation.
Yeah.

420
00:28:19.811 --> 00:28:22.300
And then his mind,
he was like,
hey look at,
this is just a takedown.

421
00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.290
You tell that to a 21 year old judo competitor.

422
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.870
That's got you in there just to take down.
Nope.
You're going to pay the band.

423
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.210
Yeah,

424
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.860
<v 2>exactly right.
Just like you know,
a basket.
A basket.
Oh yeah.
He made that basket.</v>

425
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.360
No,
but he slammed on you and you know,
embarrass you in front of it.
You know,

426
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:40.700
like he goes into this whole different realm.

427
00:28:40.701 --> 00:28:42.530
But the essence is still there though.

428
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:47.760
<v 0>Just the basket.
So breast just to take down.
Yup.
Alright.
Here we go.</v>

429
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.100
Back to the book of the Organization of Kodokan.

430
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:54.840
Judo is basically the same today as it was when I established it.

431
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.990
But at that time when explaining judo,
I divided it into three parts.

432
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.340
It's use as a fighting method,
martial art as a training method,

433
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.370
physical education,
and as a method of mental training,

434
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.900
including the development of the intellect and more rules and the application of

435
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:13.680
the principles of judo to everyday life.
See,
this is again,

436
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:16.560
this is what's interesting to me is,
and he said it was subconscious.

437
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:21.170
Like I subconsciously,
especially in the beginning with Jujitsu I,

438
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.781
and I'll tell you,

439
00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:26.781
it was beyond just me applying Jujitsu to like my life and to what I had learned

440
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.101
about combat.

441
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:34.101
I also took what I had learned about combat and applied that into Jujitsu.

442
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.780
Right?
Like I said,
Oh yeah,
you know what this is like when you flank someone,

443
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.010
right?
Yeah.
But even,
even when

444
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.410
<v 3>I first learned,
one of the,</v>

445
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.740
one of the biggest wakeup calls that you get early in Jujitsu is like,
oh,

446
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.100
what I need to do is attack your neck and when you defend your neck,

447
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:54.130
I take your arm.
Right.
That's a flank.
Right?
That's just a straight up flank.

448
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.200
That's,
that's a game changer.

449
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.220
Like that's a complete game changer when you realize that that's a complete game

450
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:01.140
changer.
Well the,

451
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.390
there's a seal buddy of mine that had been training when I first started out.

452
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:07.210
He'd been trained in for like a year.
No,

453
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:11.350
but he'd been trading off and on kind of bits and pieces.

454
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.560
And so then I started training hardcore like every day.

455
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.060
So after like two weeks,
like literally two weeks,

456
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.980
I went and trained with him and I,

457
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:25.180
and I got him like a bunch of times and I was all pumped up and,

458
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.370
and I said to him,
I was like,
hey,
you know what you,

459
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:29.590
the mistake that you're making is you're trying,

460
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.010
you're going from my arm and I know you're going from Ann Arbor and I'd know how

461
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:35.020
to defend that.
It was like you got to go for something else.

462
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:40.410
And then like a week later we rolled again and he got me did what I told them to

463
00:30:40.411 --> 00:30:44.740
do to me and I was like,
Oh Dang.
Oh Dang.

464
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.390
So that was a big wake up call.
It's a big,
not even a waste.

465
00:30:48.391 --> 00:30:50.800
It's a revelation when you realize,
oh you,
you've got to do,

466
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.260
you've got to set that.
You got to fight the person.
That's what you have to do.

467
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.560
Big wakeup call.
It's so crazy when you see two people were rolling in,

468
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:59.470
all they're doing is flanking each other.
Oh,
and your flanking the flooring,

469
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.150
Steve.

470
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.600
But what's interesting is as I started working with like leaders and teaching

471
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:05.081
about leadership,

472
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:09.730
how important the idea of what flanking is from a leadership and it and a human

473
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:13.840
interaction perspective.
On the other side you got a flank,

474
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:18.070
people you want to attack that ego and you know.
All right.

475
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.710
Back to the book,
two methods of instruction are used Kata,

476
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.770
which is form and Ren Dory,
which is free practice.

477
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:31.310
It's what we call him the Jujitsu rolling.
When establishing the Kodokan,

478
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:36.010
I employed a method that emphasized Randori and by which caught on naturally

479
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:38.350
came to be understood during Randori practice.

480
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.070
This is rather so he focused on rolling a lot.

481
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.360
When he established code pay attention.
This is very interesting.

482
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.600
Then Dory [inaudible] rolling.
It's rolling.
It's going to remember that

483
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.360
this is rather like teaching composition without using a grammar book or

484
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:58.420
teaching the basis of grammar while teaching how to write an essay,

485
00:31:58.421 --> 00:31:59.201
so this is like,
hey man,

486
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:01.770
write this down and you got to make some corrections and like that's that's

487
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.660
basically rolling live,
right?
Yeah.

488
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.430
When there are only a few people undergoing the training.
This was not a problem,

489
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.450
but the number of beginners gradually increased and it became impossible to

490
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:15.550
teach caught at the same time as Randori.

491
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.550
So a few years after I established Kodokan judo,

492
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:23.551
I created 15 catia fur throws and 10 quarter for combat called Keema,

493
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.470
no Kata,
which meant forms of self defense.

494
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.820
So he realized he couldn't teach the same way he couldn't teach the masses.

495
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.830
So what,
you know,
that's,
that's a big change,
right?

496
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:39.470
There is a big,
big change for anyone that's not in the martial arts.
A big,

497
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:42.950
big difference between rolling and learning Catia.
And,
and matter of fact,

498
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.850
we make fun of Kata,
right?
I'm not saying that's a good thing.
Yeah.
But we w I,

499
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.790
I shouldn't say we completely make fun of it,
but like,

500
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.260
I'll see dean and let's say he's,

501
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.180
I can tell he's tired,
you know,
he's looking all worn out and I'll see you.

502
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:01.970
And I'm like,
Oh yeah.
Hey,
what's going on man?
You want to train some Catia today?

503
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.830
Meaning,
Hey,
are we just going to go through the motions and not actual drill?

504
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.820
You drink?
No,
no.
We're going to train,
right?
So that when I say make fun of it,

505
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.440
you don't make fun of it because,
because what we call caught a,

506
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:15.620
basically in Jujitsu we call it drilling,
right?
You're going to drill this drill,

507
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:19.010
drill drill,
which drilling is part of winning.
You've got to drill the win,
right?

508
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.160
Andre Galvao drillers to make killers,
drillers make killers.
There.

509
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:24.590
It was all those things.
That being said,

510
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.740
we all know if you do nothing but drill,

511
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.380
you're not going to be able to pull these moves off going live.

512
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.430
And this with the old tradition,
what we now call traditional martial arts,

513
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.930
that was all cotton and all Kata will get you nowhere.

514
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.221
That's when the guys,

515
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:44.210
when you saw that the 90s when the Jujitsu invasion happened,

516
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.130
you know the guy would try his 12 point strike Kata method against a blue belt

517
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:51.980
in Jujitsu.
The Blue Belt,
we'll do a sloppy Duggal double leg,

518
00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:55.730
take them down to the ground and choke them out cause they rolled live.

519
00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.170
They did Randori so you have to have balance,
but you got train,

520
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.840
live Randori and at the same time you got to drill too.

521
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.920
So be careful.
Don't do too much in one.

522
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:14.290
Seems like the drilling helps you get a hold of what you do with your buddy and

523
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:19.610
then the,
the brand dory,
the light,
the rolling.
Yeah.
Gives you,
uh,
you know,

524
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:22.850
control or,
or better skill in dealing with other people for sure.

525
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.820
And that's what Jesus is both,
you know,
and where you can kind of,

526
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:29.390
and you're going to get,
you're going to get

527
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.510
reactions that are different.
Right?
Right.
And this is the same thing.

528
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.830
This is the same thing.
Like when I was training guys in the teams,

529
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.280
like you could teach them the basics of how to enter a Roman and how to move

530
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:44.690
down a hallway.
But as soon as you put,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
another person,

531
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:48.500
they're going against them.
There's like a different things happen.

532
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.360
Different things are going to happen and you gotta be ready for.

533
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.470
So you have to go live.
I tell,
I've told,
I told you this story before,

534
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:59.300
but when I first started playing basketball and my coach,
I had the old school,

535
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.960
you had the old school Hoosiers coach,
right?
You know the old school,

536
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:07.100
you've seen the movie Hoosiers?
No.
Oh Damn.
So in Hoosiers,

537
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:09.410
the guy's old school coach,
like,
Hey,
no,
you're not even allowed to shoot.

538
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.350
We're defense,
defense,
defense,
running drills,
drill,
drill,
drill.

539
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.240
We never scrimmaged.
And the first time I played in a real game,
I,

540
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.050
it was the first time I played real game.

541
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.610
I went down the court and like called the play and expected to be able to

542
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:26.220
execute the play that we had run the little pattern and the,
the uh,

543
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.660
other point guard just pick me off.
I was in seventh or eighth grade.

544
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:32.030
He just picked off every pass I through.
I was just,

545
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.510
because I'd never done Randori on the basketball court.
Never scrimmaged,

546
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.560
never played,
you know,
just got balance.
Those two.
All right.
Uh,

547
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.100
next back to the book.
Next,

548
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:48.090
I would like to briefly discuss free practice involving throwing and grappling

549
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:51.960
techniques,
which I will refer to buy.
They're Japanese names.

550
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.100
So the two Japanese names and he's going to use her cough.

551
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.080
Khatami Waza and Naga Waze.
Now,
now Waza means technique,
right?

552
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.680
And you probably knew that a lot of us,
we are,
a lot of us in Jujitsu,

553
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:09.090
we talk about,
or we we what we know about judo,
we talk about Newaza.
Okay.

554
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.830
And he was Waa z a Nawaz it means of groundwork.

555
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:18.520
That's what it means.
Mat work basically is what I mean.
I think.
I think the end,

556
00:36:18.521 --> 00:36:20.910
he actually means like laying down or sleeping or something like that.

557
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:22.260
So it means you're down on the ground.

558
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:28.380
Khatami Waza is the Khatami was,
it is like the grappling part,

559
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.660
but you're not necessarily,

560
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.130
you're not necessarily laying down in all grappling positions.

561
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.860
So that's why they call it Khatami walls.
But,

562
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.540
but Nagi Waza is the throws.
All right,
so here we go.

563
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.920
Back to the book.
When I was training,
I practiced,
Khatami wasn't quite a bit,

564
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:50.980
but after coming to appreciate Naga Waza,
I came to believe that Nagi was,

565
00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:54.780
he should be in facade,
in the technical training aspects of judo.

566
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.460
This does not mean I considered Khatami Waza to be useless,
of course,

567
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:04.610
but I stress practicing Naga Waza first followed then by Khatami was a,

568
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:07.050
so he focused on the throwing techniques.

569
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.850
This is because doing Khatami was the first hinders progress in Nagi Waza.

570
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.070
While it makes sense that learning Naga Waza first makes it easier to remember,

571
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.780
Khatami was as at a later stage when I established code ICAN,

572
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.800
I encourage the practice of Nagi Gwoza precisely for that reason.

573
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.540
As a result at that time,
a great,

574
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.650
great number of experts in Nagu Aza were fostered in the early years of the code

575
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:38.790
icon as a result of emphasizing Naga Waza.
However,

576
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.180
Khatami Waza gradually became neglected.

577
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.230
That's very interesting.
So anyone that knows anything about judo and Jujitsu,

578
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.080
one of the biggest differences is in Jujitsu we focused a ton on groundwork.

579
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.470
Too much.
Hm.
Well,
you could say too much,
right?
Because there's,

580
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:55.770
there's,

581
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.070
there's Jujitsu people that don't know how to take someone down and that's very

582
00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:02.730
problematic.
So he's saying that,
hey,

583
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:07.080
he focused on that and you can kind of hear what he's saying.
So if you,

584
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.130
it's real easy to ignore the standup when you realize how affected the ground

585
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:13.020
game is.
And you also realize that if you,

586
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.260
if you understand how to take the person down the,

587
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.290
then you're going to get in good positions and all that.

588
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.500
And so he just kind of leaned in that direction and says that it ends up getting

589
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:26.940
a little bit neglected.
And also if you don't know the rules of judo,

590
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.960
emphasize the takedowns because of the rules or judo.
If I take you down,

591
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.780
if I throw you with the Nippon,
which means something,

592
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.630
some other body parts other than your feet touches the ground before your feet

593
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:42.190
do it during a throat.
I when automatically instant win,
it's like a submission.

594
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.940
And so because of that,
they say they practice a lot of standoff.

595
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:50.560
Whereas in Jujitsu you can get thrown 10 times and you can still catch person in

596
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.620
a triangle.
You when you've been on the ground,
doesn't matter.

597
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.640
And you can get pinned in judo too.
If you get held down for 30 seconds,

598
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:01.030
about 30 I think 30 seconds on on your back,
you getting pinned,
you lose.

599
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.620
That doesn't happen in Jiu Jitsu.

600
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.710
You can have someone across side to own you for four,
seven,
eight minutes,

601
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:07.840
just you haven't even moved,

602
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.970
you didn't lose and you sneak out of there and grab a little camera and get the

603
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:17.350
victory.
All right,
back to look at the code icon.

604
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:20.560
We study and practice techniques with the purpose of using mental and physical

605
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:25.540
energy most fit,
most effective Lee in order to achieve one's goal,

606
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:29.380
no matter what the endeavor,
which is the basic principle of judo,

607
00:39:29.381 --> 00:39:31.060
and he's going to talk about this a ton.

608
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:32.950
The basic principles of judo is like efficiency,

609
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.400
so those in training do not merely,
now we'll put this is so important.

610
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.870
Those in training do not merely imitate the actions of the master or practice

611
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:45.100
without understanding the reasons behind what they are doing,

612
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.750
but rather considering the methods and train accordance with detailed
principles.

613
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.003
For that reason,

614
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.190
what once took five or six years to achieve can now be accomplished in three

615
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.470
years.
This is huge in Jujitsu.

616
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:58.770
And I saw this transition take place when I started learning Jujitsu,

617
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.770
we learned moves.
Now everyone teaches concepts.

618
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:05.620
I mean you still teach moves,
but if you don't know the principles of them,

619
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.930
and it's the same thing when I was teaching guys in the teams,

620
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:11.170
like you teach them a maneuver on the battlefield that you can learn the

621
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:14.650
mechanics of the move on the battlefield.
But if you don't understand the why,

622
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:18.070
those mechanics are important than it doesn't make,
you don't even have,

623
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.890
you don't have it.
You don't get it.
Same thing in the business world.

624
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.330
You can tell someone like,
hey,

625
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:27.210
here's what you should tell your subordinates right now.
But that technique you,

626
00:40:27.211 --> 00:40:30.430
they can use it and it'll work.
Okay.
But that's nothing compared to saying,

627
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.030
here's why it's important that you tell your subordinates this thing and here's

628
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:34.864
how you want to lead them.

629
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.610
That's what gives them the game is when they understand the principles,
you know?

630
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.480
Yeah.
That's why those introductory courses are so critical.

631
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.040
And I'm talking about do you do to help see where you get a new guy,

632
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.490
first day guy and he jumps in a class and the class they're teaching,
you know,

633
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:54.280
the mechanics of a certain move.
Meanwhile everyone in the class,

634
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:57.130
they're not first day people,
they know the concepts behind it,

635
00:40:57.131 --> 00:40:59.740
but they come in and it's just,
it's a just a different language.

636
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.960
It doesn't stick.
Yeah.
You could mechanical.
Yeah.
Yeah.

637
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.960
It's like trying to teach someone,
if you,
if you,

638
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.800
if you had a non native English speaker and you walk in and you're going to

639
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:12.500
teach him,
you know,
a vocabulary word.
Yeah.

640
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.050
Which is like,
you know audacious,
right.

641
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.360
He has no context to put that in.
That's not the word to teach him.

642
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.090
He doesn't even know how to say I.
Yeah,

643
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.810
so when you start teaching someone Omoplata and they don't understand what an

644
00:41:25.811 --> 00:41:29.590
arm lock are is they're going to have issues.
Yeah.
That's like the fundamentals.

645
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.950
Do you want ketchup with that?
Teach someone who doesn't know any English,

646
00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:34.070
do you want catch with,
teach them that

647
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.470
<v 2>and then send them out.
He doesn't know when to use that.
You know,</v>

648
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.790
I know how to say it when you're not just going to roll into the post office and

649
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:44.510
be like,
Hey,
do you want ketchup with that?
It doesn't make sense.
No,

650
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:45.530
it doesn't usable.

651
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.061
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

652
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.660
various records and accounts had been passed down over the ages with regard to

653
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:54.980
the true meaning of Jujitsu.
Then he's talking about the actual word Jujitsu,

654
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.260
but few of them are accurate.

655
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.280
It can be said though that the name apparently derived from the expression Jew

656
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:07.220
Yoko go Osha shoe,
which can be trained,
laid,

657
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.120
translated as softness,
controls hardness.

658
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.570
This expression needs closer attention.

659
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.480
Let's assume I have an opponent who possesses power of out to the value of 10

660
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.520
whereas I must face this opponent with power only to the value of seven when my

661
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:28.940
opponent thrusted me with all of his energy,
it follows that if I resist,

662
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:33.470
I will be overcome.
Even if I expend all my power.
If,

663
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:36.080
however,
rather than resist my more powerful opponent,

664
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.480
I adjust and adapt to his energy and pull back.

665
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.240
He will fall forward under the strength of his own attack.

666
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.370
His power of 10 will become merely a power of three and he will stumble and lose

667
00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:49.280
his balance.
I will not be pulled off balance and can pull away,

668
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:52.670
maintain my stance and retained my original power of seven.

669
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.591
In short,

670
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:58.980
resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat whilst adjusting

671
00:42:58.981 --> 00:43:03.350
you to an evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance.

672
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:05.390
His power will be reduced and you will defeat him.

673
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.650
This can apply whatever the relative values of tower,

674
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.360
thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger
ones.

675
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.530
There you go.
Yes sir.
That's the way it works.

676
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.480
Can a level 10 beat a level looking at a level one beat a level 10.

677
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.950
That's tricky.
There's a,
there's a,
there's a point,
right?
Yeah.

678
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.490
There's a point where like,
yeah,

679
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.630
<v 2>yeah.
Cause it's,
there's like even that what he's talking about,</v>

680
00:43:34.631 --> 00:43:37.630
I like how he did it in numbers,
like how he did that.
Um,

681
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:42.340
but the reality is like that it's again,

682
00:43:42.341 --> 00:43:45.280
cool to have the numbers,
but it's not,
they're not absolute numbers.

683
00:43:45.281 --> 00:43:46.660
There's a lot of gray area in there,

684
00:43:46.661 --> 00:43:51.661
so the idea is to take his 10 and use almost like using part of his 10 on top of

685
00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:54.610
your seven cause you're going in the same way,

686
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.210
but it's like how much of that 10 are you going to use?

687
00:43:58.211 --> 00:44:01.780
If you're a one you better,
you'd be using nine you better know master.
Yeah.

688
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.270
You're going to be using a lot of his number.
You know,

689
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.920
<v 0>this is one of those things.</v>

690
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:10.630
This is one of those things that I subconsciously learned from Jujitsu and I

691
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:11.770
applied it all the time,

692
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.130
especially in dealing with relationships and I've talked about on here a million

693
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:18.660
times of like,
Hey,
don't attack the ego.
Don't attack the strong point.
Right?
Yeah.

694
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.570
That's just complete.
Just as to complete Jujitsu mentality,

695
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.980
that's what it is and it works.
If you tack that strong point,

696
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.070
Sun Tzu Art of war,
2,500 years old,

697
00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.960
if you attack the diff heavily defended position,
you're,
you're not going to win.

698
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.450
If you go against a power of 10 and you've only got power seven you're not going

699
00:44:37.451 --> 00:44:38.420
to win.
Not gonna happen.

700
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.140
<v 2>Even if you use full power,
even if you use full power,</v>

701
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.520
in fact it's going to be worse for you,

702
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.190
especially if the other guy knows he's gonna use that seven,

703
00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.460
he's going to use that in addition to his daddy's going to beat you with a 17 to

704
00:44:49.461 --> 00:44:54.461
zero and actually that actually backs up or kind of refers back to your point

705
00:44:54.891 --> 00:44:58.280
where it cannot,
when you say Ken,
a level one beat a level 10 so a level,

706
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.020
if they both know Jujitsu or Judah Ben and you know it's way cause he knows the

707
00:45:03.021 --> 00:45:07.310
same thing as you.
But yeah,
you know,
if you're nine,

708
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.950
if you're better than the guy a fact for sure nine then you know your concerns

709
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.720
start to go up for sure.
No doubt,
no doubt about that.

710
00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:17.930
But I think that's where people,
they get jammed up where they're like,
hey,

711
00:45:17.931 --> 00:45:21.940
what do I thought size didn't matter in Jujitsu.
Oh yeah.
If everyone's doing it,

712
00:45:21.941 --> 00:45:24.550
you did.
Of course,
size matters.
Just like conditions going to matter.

713
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.550
Just like how tall he is.

714
00:45:25.551 --> 00:45:29.030
It matters how strong matters when you all know the Jujitsu.
Yeah.

715
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.330
<v 0>A Dude said the other day.
Um,</v>

716
00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.090
Jujitsu's not important as important in the UFC as it was the guy that just beat

717
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:43.830
for doom,
big,
tall,
bad ass guy from Russia,
calve cough or something.

718
00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.810
Uh,
sorry,
Bro.
Uh,
he,
but he said,
hey,
it's not as important anymore.

719
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.320
And the fact that you're right,
you know,

720
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.670
it's not as important because everybody knows about it.
So yeah,

721
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:56.660
it's not as important as you go.
You roll in there without knowing any Jujitsu,

722
00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.420
you're going to get submitted.
Yeah,
exactly.

723
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.260
All right.
Back to the book,
there's a popular parable that goes,
thus

724
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.940
a Jujitsu CTCA,

725
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.800
which means it Jujitsu practitioner was grabbed by a sumo wrestler.

726
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.790
At that point,
that Jujitsu Qca said,
you're a sumo wrestler,

727
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.600
yet you can't grab any tighter than that.
Angered the sumo wrestler,

728
00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:20.460
attempted to adjust his grip as he did.

729
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:22.740
So he loosened it slightly at that moment that you did.

730
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:26.580
Sukkah quickly load his body and escape from the sumo refs.
Lose grip.

731
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:33.150
All right,
now there's another,

732
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:37.710
we're going to talk about this theory called Su Roco.

733
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:43.250
Shi-Shin cuts to you and I apologize to everyone that speaks Japanese.

734
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.840
I'm sorry,
Tim Ferris.
I'm sorry.

735
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:49.740
I should have waited for you to come and do this with me so you could correct
me,

736
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.420
but here,
here we go.

737
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:56.340
One's mental and physical energy must be used most effectively in order to

738
00:46:56.341 --> 00:46:59.190
achieve a certain goal.
That is to say,

739
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:03.660
one must apply the most effective method or technique for using the mind and

740
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:04.494
body.

741
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.460
If we use the term sear Yoko for one's mental and physical energy,

742
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.270
this should be expressed to Yoko then cuts to you,

743
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.640
which means best use of one's energy.

744
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:22.200
We can shorten this simply to sear Yoko Zinio,

745
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.970
which means maximum efficiency,
maximum efficiency.

746
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.950
This means that no matter what the goal,

747
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.650
<v 3>no matter what the goal,
in order to achieve it,</v>

748
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.880
you must put your mental and physical energy to work in the most effective

749
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:41.260
manner.
This is like common sense,
right?
But how often are we wasting energy?

750
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.310
How often are we wasting energy?
We're wasting energy all the time.

751
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.150
Back to the book.
When I was a child,
I learned the Jujitsu of the past.
However,

752
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.390
the Jujitsu had no basic principle.

753
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.730
I learned various methods from one teacher.

754
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.510
He taught me how to place my hips and pull to throw an opponent and how to choke

755
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.080
someone,

756
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.160
but he did not teach me anything about what principals were involved or how to

757
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:09.350
apply those principles.
That's,

758
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.960
I think that's the same that as Jujitsu hit America,

759
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.940
I think everyone was learning like that.

760
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.450
Like here's how you choke someone but you weren't learning the system.

761
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.410
As I studied further,

762
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:27.790
I found that one one teacher taught differed from a what another taught.

763
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.270
There was no basis upon which to decide which one was correct.

764
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.660
That was the reason I began to make a thorough study of Jujitsu.

765
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.700
Now what I would say about that is you don't need to decide which one is
correct.

766
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:42.230
Like when you learn an arm bar from one person,

767
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.990
he would learn a long arm bar from someone else.

768
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.310
You're going to learn good things from both of them.

769
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.250
Neither one of them is correct and one of them might be correct in this

770
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:54.490
situation or with this body style and the other one's correct in different

771
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:55.480
situation with a different body style.

772
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.720
I think if we looked at Kainos personality traits,

773
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:05.560
like he's a guy that's real orderly and I think that's,
yeah,
that's,

774
00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:08.740
he's a real guy like Jordan Peterson when people would put them in the high

775
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:13.630
conscientious and hi,
hi.
An orderly as a very orderly person.
And so for him,

776
00:49:13.631 --> 00:49:15.040
like there's a right answer and there's a wrong answer.

777
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.540
And I think you see that in judo and that's why judo is much more disciplined,

778
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.420
highly disciplined.
Like go to a judo competition.

779
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.320
There are no yelling it's gonna go to,
did you get to competition?
It's may have.

780
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:30.910
Yeah.
Right.
And they've tried to tighten that up.

781
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.610
They try and make it less crazy,

782
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.750
but they haven't succeeded to just use crazy competitions are crazy.

783
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.290
Judo competitions are not like that.
Yeah Bro.
Did you see there's a clip,

784
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.520
a doodle clip on online,
wherever I saw it,
but it's a clip.

785
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.970
So this guy wins.
Right?
The real dramatic.

786
00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:51.760
When like maybe he wasn't supposed to win or I don't know,
maybe it an upset,

787
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.440
maybe not.
Or maybe it was the finals,
I don't know.

788
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.170
But it was a real dramatic way and he wins and he's like,

789
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.680
you know how the yell and they'd be all happy what he did that any kind of stood

790
00:49:59.681 --> 00:50:04.530
over that guy.
Oh,
just for a second.
Like a split pretty short DQ.

791
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:08.090
Dq?
Yeah.
Just like that man in Jujitsu.
Mm.

792
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.800
And we see that all day.
That's,
see that's,
that's the,

793
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.860
that's one of the reasons I wanted to talk about this.

794
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:17.590
It's like that is a quality thing.
You know,
it's too,

795
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:22.270
and I guess this is different on the east coast or west coast.
The east coast.

796
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.290
Like one of my buddies,
Joe,

797
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:26.260
he came and watched some wrestling with maybe some high school wrestling and

798
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.100
they pass the,
I forget what that they penalize

799
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.950
<v 4>people like,
oh no,
you're allowed to do that.
Like they're strict.</v>

800
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:35.390
When you get done,
when you get done,
uh,
wrestling,
you just got pinned.
You get up,

801
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:37.490
you get to sending them out,
you put your hand out,
shake hands.
That's it.

802
00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.430
No complaining to the ref.
There's all this other crap.
No,

803
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.000
you do what you're supposed to do and that's awesome because that,

804
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.410
you know what that teaches?
People teach people how to control their emotions.

805
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.460
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
I remember him Pop Warner,
you know,

806
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:54.110
my only frame of reference was watching football on TV,
NFL,
spiking the ball,

807
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:57.990
doing the icky shuffle.
Back in my day.
[inaudible] woods.
Anyway,
back did it,

808
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.960
and so,
you know,
we played Pop Warner football my first year.

809
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.770
I knew that our coach was super disciplined,
like the kind where you had to,

810
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.990
everyone had to wear high white socks,
white shoe.
Like,
Hey,

811
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:09.860
there's a real discipline.

812
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.350
And I'd see other teams then they different color shoes,
all this stuff.

813
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.040
That's all I knew though.
So it was clear you couldn't spike the ball,

814
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.190
you couldn't do any dance or whatever.
You give the ball to the ref.
That's,

815
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:20.720
that's it.
When you make a touchdown.

816
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:26.240
So we played this team that will remain nameless and they go,

817
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:30.260
they do.
You don't want to bring up the old rivalries.
It's going to happen.

818
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.140
They make a,
actually it was a team from out of town and they,

819
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.380
he spiked the ball.
A little kids spike the ball and does the thing or whatever.

820
00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:42.620
Straight up flag.
It's a,
it's a penalty.
You could actually,
even in college,

821
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:45.470
it's like that.
Oh Great.
I don't know.
Yeah.
In College football,

822
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:50.120
it's like that you can do,
you can do more for sure.
Um,
but yeah,
pop Warner,

823
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.120
anything.
If you do anything,
you throw the ball,

824
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:55.340
you put your hands up for too long.

825
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.510
If you put your hands up for too long after you make it on,
that's a penalty.

826
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.890
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
That's legit.
Right?
I think so.
Especially as little kids.

827
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:08.240
I think so.
Especially even as big kids.
Yeah.
My Dad used to say stuff.

828
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.290
When you're on your emotion,
you're a professional.
Um,
this is what he said.

829
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:15.590
When you're a professional football player,
you can,
and you make a touchdown.
Uh,

830
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.830
something about like,
that's your job or whatever.
So yeah,

831
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.350
you have the right to be happy about it.
That was kind of,

832
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:24.290
but when I think about it now,
it's like,
shoot,
if you're a professional,

833
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:27.050
you focus on your profession.
Do you think so?

834
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.270
I guess it's whatever your philosophy is and you can say like UFC,

835
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.880
I mean it's really cool.

836
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:39.320
It's so much cooler when someone wins and they'd just start like,

837
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.030
check.
Yeah.
It's like,
yeah,

838
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.760
there and just destroy someone and they're just like,
yeah,
thanks.
Good match.

839
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.900
That is true.
I know we all want to see the high,
that's the thing I,

840
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:53.090
and jumping on top of the case that sells tickets and blah,
blah,
blah,

841
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.440
but there's nothing better than just a cold blooded killer that just comes out.

842
00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.630
And,
and you know what's interesting is sometimes fighters do it.
Um,

843
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.840
I think I was watching cowboy Serona the other day.
He's like,

844
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:05.600
knock some grounds and walked away like it was nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

845
00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:08.410
I do this every single day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like,
yeah,

846
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.920
but they don't show that clip or like Mark Hunt.
Yeah.

847
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.600
Mark Hunt just does those walkaway knockout,
just knocks dude out.

848
00:53:14.601 --> 00:53:18.800
Just walks away again.
Yeah.
Can I get my piece of chicken now?

849
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.330
I'm hungry.
But the,
the reason that those are so cool,

850
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.820
like fate or that's great example,
the way where he's just,
no,

851
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.080
he's not getting hyped up for the fight,
that hyped up afterwards,
you know,

852
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.540
no emotions,
cold know that that gets,

853
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.140
that seems more appealing because it's in contrast to all the hype,

854
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:39.060
all the High Lord,
this guy getting hyped up and whatever.

855
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.980
So if everyone was like that,
he would be less,
it was still would be cool.

856
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:47.400
But even then,
I'm probably just comparing it to like how I know it now.

857
00:53:47.401 --> 00:53:51.300
You can't not go hyper and Conor McGregor gets pumped out.
Exactly right.
So,

858
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:55.590
you know,
it's,
there's a,
there's a dichotomy there.
There's a dichotomy.

859
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:59.880
I think the preferred method though is cold blooded.
Yeah.
But when you,

860
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:04.060
and this is really what it is and this goes for the NFL to bed.
Yeah.
For sure.
Um,

861
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.700
it's,
it's a show.
Got to remember that gets it.

862
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.930
Exactly right.
So,

863
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:14.190
and that makes sense too for the NFL where just go sit around and watch old

864
00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:15.210
fight or flight.
So,
you know,

865
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:18.550
soccer was kind of like the soccer Robert didn't celebrate without soccer.

866
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:23.130
Sakharov yes,
of course.
Yes.
Soccer Robos.
Pretty cool.
Yeah,

867
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.620
totally cold blooded.
Yeah.
But just how you say,
man,

868
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:28.440
like Connor and like these guys who,
who do put on a show,

869
00:54:28.441 --> 00:54:33.040
that's kind of cool to see what I'm saying.
All right.

870
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.330
Back to the book.
In the end I learned from various teachers in various schools,

871
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:38.850
but when one method of instruction different from another,

872
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:41.370
I had difficulty determining how to resolve those differences.

873
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:44.640
As I studied further,
I came up with the principals I've described.

874
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:48.270
In order to achieve your goals,
you must put your energy to use most effectively.

875
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.260
Again.
Um,
I'll just say that you don't have to choose like,
this one's right in,

876
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:53.010
this one's wrong.

877
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:56.690
You need to absorb both those methodologies and have them both in your toolkit

878
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:00.720
because you might need them.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

879
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:05.890
It's kind of like having the metric ranch sockets and the,

880
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.100
you know,
Oh yeah,
yeah.
And the other one.

881
00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.040
Then you've got the other one's got a need.
We've got the one,
the other one,

882
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:15.590
you come across a bolt.
That's metric,
right?

883
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.550
It'd be ready for that.
Uh,
here's,
here's some stuff that's interesting.

884
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.860
Calisthenics are generally based on physiology and anatomy,

885
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.340
so they do not result in the development of unbalanced body,

886
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.570
nor are they harmful to the internal organs,
but they are not without,

887
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:37.950
without drawbacks because each individual movement has no meaning.

888
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:41.520
And because calisthenics have no secondary benefits,

889
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.960
they are uninteresting calisthenics or widely used in Japan and abroad.

890
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:49.650
But few students continue to do them after grade,
graduating from school.

891
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:53.970
This is because they are a meaningless form of exercise and not have any

892
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:56.640
practical use.
No matter how much they are taught in schools,

893
00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:58.980
if people would not continue to practice them,
there is video,

894
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.870
very little value in teaching them

895
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.610
cold blooded his vehicle,
but in a dig it.

896
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.030
So what should be done?

897
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:13.260
We need to adopt the strong points of calisthenics and compensate for their

898
00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:16.140
shortcomings.
Of course,
there are various possibilities,

899
00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:18.690
but for now I've come up with these two ideas.
First.

900
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:22.020
The first is calisthenics that incorporate training for the defense for the

901
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:23.020
defense against.

902
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:28.620
So the first one is like you come up with calisthenics that represent movements

903
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:33.480
that are from fighting.
Right.
So like a classic is a sprawl sprawl.
Yeah.

904
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.560
Go do some sprawls you want to get in good shape.
Yeah.

905
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.200
Go do some sprawls incorporate that.

906
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.780
One of the workouts I used to do with my kids when they were little is they'd

907
00:56:40.781 --> 00:56:45.580
have to do five sprawls and Max pullups every minute on the minute for five

908
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:48.370
minutes.
Just five minutes.
See how many popes they could get sued you.

909
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:52.330
Five sprawls and you use many poets as you can to see how many.

910
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.690
This is a brutal workout.
Go try that one.
Yeah,
you don't,

911
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.230
you don't even need to be,
uh,
an eight year old kid.
You can be a 46 year old man.

912
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:02.800
Go hit that for five minutes.
Five sprawls Max pullups go.

913
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.440
But he's a good workout for kids.
Yeah,
but legit.
But anyway,

914
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:12.250
sprawls that's an exercise where it debt reflects exactly the movement that you

915
00:57:12.251 --> 00:57:15.040
would do on the mat.
Now here we go back to the book.

916
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:20.220
My other idea could be called dance style and I'm not going to get into what he

917
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.900
talks about it.
He's basically saying like,
hey,

918
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:27.160
you come up with dance moves that are fun,
that work your body.

919
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.010
And what I thought of immediately when I,

920
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:34.300
when I thought when I read that I was like thinking about all the,
all the uh,

921
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.290
I guess is bboys and break dancing.

922
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:41.770
The same thing be bullies do break dancing.
So it's like judo and judo,

923
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:45.760
so bboys breakdown.
So like the 10th planet guys,

924
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.290
a bunch of the 10 finding guys came from the break dancing background and they

925
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:53.710
have the physical attributes,
the flexibility,
the strength from that.

926
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.730
And it turns out to be awesome for Jujitsu.
So there's a good,

927
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.330
and you can find that with gymnastics.
People to like,
yeah,
like gymnastics,

928
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:02.164
here's a skill.

929
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:08.430
But I guess his point is in his mind that's now fun somehow see in my mind like

930
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.560
it's not fun what the break tenancy like to me doing a break dance move compared

931
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:19.360
to doing a pushup.
Yeah.
You'd rather do the pushup?
Well,
I mean there's,

932
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:23.170
there's not a huge difference,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
Breakdown.
It's pretty fun.

933
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.680
I used to do that when I was young.
Did you have a parachute pants?
Yeah.

934
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.320
Richie Martinez and Martinez.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
the main guys.
Yeah.

935
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:36.370
Well they're,
they're,
they're bad estrogens.
You guys and there be boys.
Yeah.

936
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.060
And that,
that is what they attribute their skills,

937
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:44.110
their skills developing so quickly,
so quickly.
And when you,

938
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.240
when you think about it,
man,

939
00:58:46.241 --> 00:58:48.460
it's absolutely true because you think of break dancing moves,

940
00:58:48.461 --> 00:58:50.250
like how you can spend on your back and do it.

941
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.850
Like all this stuff like to spin on your back.
You know,

942
00:58:52.851 --> 00:58:55.540
these guys who go inverted and do all this stuff where they have really good

943
00:58:55.541 --> 00:58:58.390
control of it.
They're like spacial workers in their buddy.
Yeah.
You know,

944
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:02.660
so these breakdancing guys,
they come in with level 10 of that,
you know,

945
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:06.960
and well,
wrestlers obviously come in at a high level gymnast.

946
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.880
Anyone that's really good at gymnastics has that same kind of awareness in the

947
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:14.770
handsome,
crazy strength,
you know?
So yeah,
maybe that is a good thing for the,

948
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:19.870
for the judo players come up with some kind of a good dance.
A dance.

949
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:23.210
Well,
what about Cap Wetta cut boy.
Cause capital letter was,

950
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.560
it was fighting disguised as dancing.
Yes sir.
Yeah,
you knew it was,

951
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:32.600
it was the African slaves in Brazil.
And if you notice,

952
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:35.960
I know this because they did a whole,
it's not a thesis,
what do you call it?

953
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.520
Like a,
anyway,
I think in college,

954
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:42.521
but they did a thing on college and capital [inaudible] and so I don't want to

955
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:47.510
go into a whole long thing,
but good.
If you go early copywriter was only legs.

956
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.590
You know why?
Because they,
a lot of the time they'd be tied up,

957
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.330
hands behind their back so that,
yeah,

958
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:57.240
so they came up with is fighting system desta disguise it as dancing to use

959
00:59:57.241 --> 01:00:01.190
against their captors.
It's very interesting.
That is interesting.

960
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:05.060
B Boys,
people sweater.
A couple of other guys.

961
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.140
Jeff Higgs went from Jujitsu to cap wet.
Fabio,

962
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:11.440
Fabio Santos or old teacher was like Higgs.

963
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.090
You're the only person that's ever gone from Jujitsu.

964
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:19.110
He kept training Jujitsu Incorporated Kappa Wetta.
Yeah.

965
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:22.730
Even the Katrina,
Katrina does same thing.
I think he had none at all.

966
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:26.370
I think he kept that most,
most people would find cap wedding gall.

967
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.640
That seems cool.
But then you get choked out.
You're like,
I'm gonna learn to just,

968
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:33.050
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That goes,
man.
You ever seen like a cop would at like,
uh,
um,
uh,

969
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.170
performance or whatever?
Men,
there's this,

970
01:00:35.171 --> 01:00:38.540
it's gymnastics and whenever you want to call it.
Yeah,
man,

971
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.930
it's really impressive.
It's the yield.

972
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:45.800
And I'm referring to this guy that you said he'd put on a couple at a show every

973
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:47.750
Wednesday at this club I worked at in Hawaii.

974
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.340
And so he do these like flips and somersaults and stuff like that and it looks

975
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:55.310
like,
oh,
he messed up that somersault,
but that was part of the move.

976
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:58.100
See what I'm saying?
So he,
instead of sticking the landing,

977
01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:01.160
he doesn't stick the landing.
He rolls into the next move,
you know?

978
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:05.210
So it's this big string of just real fluid,
Numa Elis.
It's kind of captivating.

979
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:09.670
I can see how that would benefit you.
Okay.
No.
Did

980
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:15.050
keep that in mind.
All right.
Back to the book.

981
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.750
There's no need to reject traditional form of exercise.

982
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:20.270
Those who enjoy them should do them.
My doctrine is very simple,

983
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:24.500
highly recommend what is best without rejecting things of the past.

984
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:29.450
So I do not particularly opposed Japan's conventional methods of physical

985
01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:33.030
education,
but I would like to devise the best form of physical education,

986
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.670
recommend as many people as possible,

987
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:39.671
take it up thus resulting in a form of physical education that at the same time

988
01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:43.820
achieves worthwhile goals.
That is cool,
right?

989
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:47.720
Like that's one of the coolest things about Jujitsu is you are getting in shape

990
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:51.530
and you are learning how to choke people out,
which is really beneficial fig.

991
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.080
And that's for all the people that say,
well,

992
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:57.500
I want to start Jujitsu but I need to get in shape first.
No,
you don't.

993
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.140
You just need to start Jujitsu and you'll get in shape along the way.

994
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.530
Back to the book.

995
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:08.531
The prosperity of a nation can be hope for only with an energized populace.

996
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.853
That

997
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.920
vitality and that vitality depends on the mental and physical training of the

998
01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:16.754
people.

999
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.520
The powerful nations of the world have explored every avenue in order to build

1000
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:23.970
their national strength and they are paying particular attention to physical

1001
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:28.080
education and endeavoring to promote vitality of their citizens through their

1002
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:29.250
own unique methods.

1003
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.660
Well that sounds good and it was true at one time,

1004
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.440
but in America right now we're getting pretty weak on physical education.

1005
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.560
Need to step it up,
step it up,
step it up.

1006
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.050
You ever seen that video of the old school,

1007
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:48.051
they did some experimental gym class somewhere in California and like the crazy

1008
01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:51.530
obstacle where this is like in the,

1009
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.830
maybe the forties or the fifties and they had crazy obstacle courses and they

1010
01:02:55.831 --> 01:03:00.690
had this and like every kid looked like a complete beast and you're like,
yeah,

1011
01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:01.830
why wouldn't you do that?

1012
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:06.950
Why wouldn't gym class at school be an hour long of hardcore physical putting

1013
01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:12.090
out why would it not be that way?
Right?
Yeah.
You know why?

1014
01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.570
Because people don't have it that that's insulting to my child because he's not

1015
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:16.140
a great athlete.

1016
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.900
Well your kid's not going to be a better athlete if they don't start training

1017
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:23.630
hard.
Right.
The lake wasn't get in the game.
Yeah,
I agree.
So what,

1018
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:27.270
what is it though?
The kid,
the kid like okay,
we're going to do pushups today.

1019
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:31.320
Right.
And you know,
Johnny did a hundred pushups.
Meanwhile I can only do two.

1020
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.750
So I feel bad that this is not my self esteem.

1021
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.210
I don't want to put you on the spot and you know what?

1022
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:38.250
We're just going to not do pushups.
In fact,

1023
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:41.750
you know what we're going to do for PE?
Weave baskets.
Basket weaving.
Yeah,

1024
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.760
but even isn't the eight isn't the whole grading system.

1025
01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.140
I know we're going to use a little different things,

1026
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:48.750
but isn't the whole grading system in school like that anyway?

1027
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:53.100
Hey Johnny over there got a yeah,
it is right now.

1028
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:57.420
But you know,
there's the universities for sure that have like,

1029
01:03:57.421 --> 01:04:01.170
well there's no grades here.
Yeah.
Because we don't,
this isn't about a grade.
Yeah.

1030
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:05.870
Actually the like no actually becoming,
you know what?
We don't,
you know,

1031
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.380
it makes my kids mad.
My kids will be like,
I got to,

1032
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:13.170
I got a 96 on the math test and I'm like,
what was the class average?

1033
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:18.550
Or who did you lose to anyone?
And they're like,
well,
it's just,

1034
01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.610
you know,
if everyone got a 96 I don't care.

1035
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.060
Your average,
I don't know.
Maybe you should care.
Maybe you should.

1036
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.790
Maybe you should be impressed with the teacher.

1037
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.990
The teacher is so good at teepees.
They,
when they test these kids,

1038
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:37.230
these kids score almost perfect on the test,
on the material that they taught.

1039
01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:39.510
Dang.
That's one good teacher right there.
Yeah.

1040
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:40.500
Well I'd be impressed with a teacher,

1041
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:43.050
but I wouldn't be impressed with my kid if they just got the same as everyone

1042
01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:46.710
else.
They need to step it up.
What if they all got hung up it up?

1043
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.620
What if they all got hundreds?
Okay,
they got a hundred okay.

1044
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:53.430
Like still not impressed.
Well,
it's,
it's a good job,
but I'm not impressed.

1045
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:58.920
I'm impressed.
Hundred perfect.
Score on a test.
My Edit,

1046
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.420
my what?
My little daughter will come home and she'll be like,
Dad,

1047
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:06.900
I got a 94 on the math test it.
I'll be like,

1048
01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:11.090
which one did you miss your,
my wife would be like,
teller.

1049
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.540
She did a great job.
I'm not going to lie to her,
whatever.

1050
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:20.260
That is a good job.
All right.
Okay,
cool.
We'll leave it at that.

1051
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:22.750
You know it's funny as I know you're really not like that because I see.

1052
01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:27.430
You know it's funny is I do say that to my kids with this joking.

1053
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.170
It is fun.
Yeah.
Like you're like at our peak when we were at my house,
the pool,

1054
01:05:32.171 --> 01:05:34.840
everyone's jumping in the pool doing their dives.
Then you're like,

1055
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.670
it's like joking Jocko.
You can totally tell.
You're like,
good dive,

1056
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:43.540
but I want to see improvement in this area and this is like over it.
It's good.

1057
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.080
I see what you're doing there.
We've got to have fun with it.
Sure.

1058
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.120
Back to the book,
intellectual training I was talking about intellectual train.

1059
01:05:51.121 --> 01:05:54.010
Intellectual training involves both the acquisition of knowledge and the

1060
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:56.920
cultivation of mental power and where I was.

1061
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.280
One can not discuss these entirely as entirely separate things.

1062
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:04.390
It is nevertheless true that people with a great deal of knowledge do not

1063
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:08.800
necessarily have exceptional powers of reasoning or judgment.

1064
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:10.893
That's important.

1065
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.800
Just because you went to some course doesn't mean that you know,

1066
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.420
doesn't mean you have good judgment,

1067
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.750
so you can have people that are well read and well educated,

1068
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:24.520
but they don't have any common sense that that's what,

1069
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:26.230
that's how I translate this thing here.

1070
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.520
The cultivation of these powers does not in itself entailed becoming

1071
01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:34.420
knowledgeable,
so in fact these two things can be looked at separately,

1072
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:38.440
so there's a big difference between having information and having,

1073
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:43.450
I guess we'd say wisdom.
What does he call it?
Reasoning and judgment.

1074
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:46.960
I'd call reasoning and judgment combined together.
I'd call that wisdom

1075
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.610
and now he talks about moral education back to the book.

1076
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.750
In one respect,
moral education must be carried out from the aspect of knowledge.

1077
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.830
That is to say it is necessary to know intellectually what is good and what is

1078
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:03.664
evil.

1079
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.890
It was also necessary to develop the intelligence to distinguish right from

1080
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:11.140
wrong in various complex situations.

1081
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.560
Thus it is necessary to teach the ability to determine good from bad to

1082
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:19.270
discriminate what is right from what is wrong.

1083
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.100
This is something that I think we're getting away from like,
Hey,

1084
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:27.730
you know what that's actually wrong.
Like the whole idea you've,
you've,
you've,

1085
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:29.350
you hear people and I think it's,

1086
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:33.370
I think they wrap this around a political conversation or a political viewpoint

1087
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.460
of there's some people that say like no evil actually exists and some people

1088
01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:40.871
just say,

1089
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:43.330
well know people are different and people are raised differently and all that.

1090
01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:43.531
I'm,

1091
01:07:43.531 --> 01:07:48.531
I'm one of the people that like I believe evil exists and I think you can teach

1092
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:52.240
and you have to teach people how to tell the difference between right and wrong.

1093
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.500
There's some things that are wrong.
Yeah.

1094
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.730
For some things in the world that are wrong and you shouldn't do them.

1095
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.160
Strangely it was talking to jade pretty in depth about that idea applies to a

1096
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:08.800
bunch of things were
even saying,
okay,

1097
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.210
things are right and things are wrong.
That's,
that's like one way of La.

1098
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.950
You know what the,
okay,
so these people that that say,

1099
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.040
<v 2>well people are different.
There's no real absolute right or wrong.</v>

1100
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:22.730
The thing is there,
they have a point with that.
But here's the thing,

1101
01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.450
they're not talking about the same thing you're talking about like the,

1102
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.600
we have a societal standard,
so and see it got super complex.

1103
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:32.030
So obviously it's not the time,
but think about this.

1104
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.700
Let's say a fat person right

1105
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.823
<v 1>there</v>

1106
01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.910
<v 2>fat.
Everyone can see that they're fat,
they know they're fat kind of thing.
Right?</v>

1107
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.540
And some people would say it's wrong to indicate or to point out that that

1108
01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:53.010
person's fat in front of people,
even though the fact is that they are okay,

1109
01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.140
is it right or wrong to point that out?
It's rude.
It's rude.

1110
01:08:58.170 --> 01:09:02.430
Exactly right.
So and so is it right to be rude?
You're was it right or wrong?

1111
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.740
Total scenario dependent thing.
Who is the person?
Right?
So the point is,
yeah,

1112
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.000
the point is there's a societal standard and usually it's established just like

1113
01:09:12.001 --> 01:09:12.271
beat,

1114
01:09:12.271 --> 01:09:16.230
like beating your kids in certain societies is right in certain societies is

1115
01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:20.190
wrong.
So sure.
The more extreme the behavior,

1116
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.640
the easier it is to discern.
Okay.
That's for all that.
I think there's a,

1117
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.390
there's a line that I take is,
and it can call.
Yeah.

1118
01:09:27.391 --> 01:09:31.070
And it goes all the way down to like almost like a human nature,

1119
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.870
like understanding of of heat,

1120
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.540
like basic human needs and Sam Harris,

1121
01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:41.550
he'll say he talks about suffering like suffering and wellbeing.

1122
01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:42.540
That's the two things.

1123
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:47.430
If something promotes or or advocate suffering for like no reason why,
you know,

1124
01:09:47.431 --> 01:09:51.930
he goes into it,
then that's how you can discern good and evil.
Okay.
So,

1125
01:09:51.931 --> 01:09:56.520
but at the end of the day it goes down to a standard,
like a specific standard.

1126
01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:58.740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1127
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.860
<v 0>But I what I,
I guess you're saying the same thing.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.</v>

1128
01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.920
Which is like you need to teach people and,

1129
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:07.810
and explain what the value system is too young to people.

1130
01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.003
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1131
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:11.100
<v 0>back to the book.
In another sense,</v>

1132
01:10:11.101 --> 01:10:15.000
moral education must be carried out from the aspect of the emotions.

1133
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.510
Even if you can distinguish right from wrong intellectually.

1134
01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:22.860
If you are not trained emotionally to like what is good and dislike,

1135
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:27.720
what is evil,
your ability to do good and reject evil will be lacking.

1136
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:34.890
So if morals are not cultivated both intellectually and emotionally,

1137
01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.320
good results cannot be achieved.

1138
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.710
This is big stuff.
Yeah.
This is heavy stuff

1139
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.520
back to the book.
Furthermore,

1140
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:51.800
even if you do try to do good and reject evil,

1141
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:56.420
if your willpower is weak,
the opposite result will often occur.

1142
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:57.403
Therefore,

1143
01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.500
training of the will must also be an element of moral education.

1144
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:07.540
A weak willpower can result in the inability to do what you know is right or the

1145
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:11.480
inability to prevent doing what you know is wrong.
Boom.

1146
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.990
<v 3>This is the very important stuff
a week.</v>

1147
01:11:17.991 --> 01:11:20.150
Willpower will,
you'll allow bad things to happen.

1148
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.733
<v 1>Yup.</v>

1149
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.910
<v 3>Choosing the short term pay off over the long term.
Another good example,</v>

1150
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:31.910
back to the book,
it is also important not to look the over,

1151
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.710
not to overlook the element of habit.

1152
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.440
Even if you intend to do good.

1153
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:41.430
If you have not developed the habit of doing so,

1154
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:46.550
your best intentions will easily be corrupted and even the best intentions of

1155
01:11:46.891 --> 01:11:50.940
rejecting evil can fail.
Have you have not developed the habit of doing so.

1156
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.560
For that reason,
you must endeavor to cultivate good habits,

1157
01:11:55.830 --> 01:12:00.600
love what is good and reject what is evil on a daily basis.
You know what?

1158
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:04.640
This supports,
this supports that whole,
you know when,

1159
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:07.260
when I talk about the fact that like if you make good decisions,

1160
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:11.760
like if you wake up early,
that goes,
that's a habit and that helps you,

1161
01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.340
that strengthens your ability to reject weakness.

1162
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.300
Whereas if you sleep in your lazy,
you hit the snooze button,

1163
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:21.300
you're double fist and donuts into your mouth,
guess what?

1164
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.790
You're going to be weak.
Then I'll tell you something else.

1165
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.900
At a and R I had been talking about this or I've been thinking about this,

1166
01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:30.090
I've been talking about it,
but I've been thinking about this,
right?

1167
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1168
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:35.790
<v 3>The way,
the,
the way that you live,
every little thing that you do,</v>

1169
01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:38.190
like those actions that you take on a daily basis,

1170
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:42.540
that's who you are and if you don't train correctly,

1171
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:45.060
if you don't live correctly,
when the moment of truth comes,

1172
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.330
you won't be able to execute correctly.
Yeah.
The way you,

1173
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:51.510
it's like it's a classic of the way you treat you,
the way you train.

1174
01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:53.670
Is it how you fight,
right?
Yeah.
If you don't train hard,

1175
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:54.720
you're not going to fight hard.

1176
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.110
If you push yourself mentally when the time comes you will to push yourself.

1177
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.470
You'll be able to push yourself mentally.
If your weekend training,

1178
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.370
you'll be weekend war.
That's the way it is.
Yeah.

1179
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:08.800
Those very well put sir.
Yes

1180
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:12.000
<v 2>we are.
I was talking to Jay last night,
like I said,</v>

1181
01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:13.260
and that's what we were talking about too.

1182
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:16.620
That's what I brought up cause he was really excited about learning all these

1183
01:13:16.621 --> 01:13:18.750
new things about calculus and all this stuff.
Right?

1184
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:22.170
Because he's into AI or machine learning and whatnot.

1185
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:25.380
So I was like,
okay,
you know,
you're,

1186
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:29.490
you're really excited about learning this stuff,
which is good by the way.

1187
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:32.280
And we're just,
I was,
I wasn't necessarily talking about him,
but um,

1188
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:35.490
but he just used him as the example.
So he,
I was like,
okay,
so what is,

1189
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.510
what is it like your,

1190
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:40.260
so are you applying this to like your work now or your life or whatever or are

1191
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:44.520
you just fired up about learning it?
So it's like you can learn about

1192
01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:45.920
<v 1>okay.</v>

1193
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.500
<v 2>Everything in the whole wide universe,
right?
But if you don't put it into action,</v>

1194
01:13:50.501 --> 01:13:54.850
whenever it's like your habits,
like what you do that that's who you are.
Like it,

1195
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:57.140
let's say you're,
you're,
you,
I dunno.

1196
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.530
<v 3>Well actually I think you're saying something different.</v>

1197
01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:01.990
I know what you're saying.
What you're saying is absolutely true too.

1198
01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:07.810
I'm saying little,
I'm saying little,
the little things matter is what I'm saying.

1199
01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:11.870
The way you live is the way you live is what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

1200
01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:16.120
What you're saying is also important.
Like,
Hey,
you got this.

1201
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.000
What are you going to do with it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's where you're saying,

1202
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:22.270
and that also is important.
Like,
okay,
well you worked for this,

1203
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:24.790
but now what are you going to do with it?
You got this gift.

1204
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.220
What are you gonna do with this gift?
You've got this talent.

1205
01:14:27.221 --> 01:14:28.960
What are you gonna do with his talent?
You got this education.

1206
01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:31.730
What do you do with his education?
Those are also important.
Yeah,

1207
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.400
and what I'm saying is if you don't develop the habit of putting things into

1208
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:39.790
place and being efficient at working hard,
you can take those gifts,

1209
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:44.020
those talents and that education.
You can piss it away.
That's what I'm saying.

1210
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:49.030
Yeah.
If you're used to taking the easy road,
you get that knowledge.

1211
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.990
You don't do anything with it.
Yeah.
So live your life with intent.

1212
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:57.070
That's what I'm saying.
Every day,
every little decision you make matters.

1213
01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.780
It matters.
Matters what you do.

1214
01:14:59.050 --> 01:14:59.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:05.410
<v 3>Expanding this out a little bit.
Back to the book.</v>

1216
01:15:05.411 --> 01:15:09.490
If each member of a group helps others in ax selflessly,

1217
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.060
the group can be harmonious and act as one.
Accordingly,

1218
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.570
the group can make the best use of its energy just like an individual.

1219
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.290
This principle remains true even in the case of a complex society with a

1220
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:24.670
population of millions.
Yeah,
yeah.
Help each other out.

1221
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:28.210
This is very,
this is what this is.
You know this is like a seal team,
right?

1222
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.060
This is like a seal platoon.
You help each other.
You support each other.

1223
01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:31.980
That's what makes you good.

1224
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:33.223
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1225
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:34.730
<v 3>That's what makes you good.</v>

1226
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.060
Here's another one.

1227
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.410
Let's say someone draws a sword on you and this is getting back into training

1228
01:15:43.411 --> 01:15:45.420
global.
Let's say someone draws a sword on you.

1229
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.590
Any hesitations in your actions will result in you being injured or killed.

1230
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:54.050
You must react automatically.
Instinctively justice.

1231
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:58.170
When you blink impulsively,
when a fly approaches your eye,

1232
01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:02.820
you must dodger attacker an instant.
In order to do this,
you must practice.

1233
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:07.200
Practice this as physical education and train on a regular basis to build up

1234
01:16:07.201 --> 01:16:09.900
your body while also undergoing martial arts training.

1235
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.040
So I like this idea of a fly getting in your eye,
right?

1236
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.780
The flight doesn't hate your eye.
You Blink.
That's what happens.

1237
01:16:15.781 --> 01:16:18.630
You have the instinct and what's cool,
I see this with extreme ownership.

1238
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:23.670
When people first hear about the concept like it's foreign to them.
At Utah,

1239
01:16:23.671 --> 01:16:26.040
you've talked about this,
how once you started thinking about it,

1240
01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:28.800
you'd see like Amy excuse that someone makes,
you're like,
Oh man,

1241
01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:29.850
this guy's not taking ownership.

1242
01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:33.360
That's just an excuse and then you see it in yourself and when that becomes your

1243
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:35.970
instinct because you're living that way,
well then it's very easy to spot.

1244
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.260
It's also easier to maintain.
Yeah.
That's why the little things matter.

1245
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.720
Echo.
Yes,
sir.
Back to the book,

1246
01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:50.140
judo began with a study of martial arts and then it gradually became clear that

1247
01:16:50.141 --> 01:16:53.470
it could be applied to physical education,
intellectual training,
moral education,

1248
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:56.410
social engagement management,
and people's everyday lives.

1249
01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.370
Some people believe that judo means simply practicing at the Dojo.

1250
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.600
This is applying the principle of judo at the Dojo when practicing defense

1251
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:11.150
against attack and though it certainly one aspect of judo is only a small part

1252
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.100
of it.
With judo in every endeavor,

1253
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:17.240
you must imagine the best goal and use your mental and physical energy the most

1254
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:20.240
effective manner in order to accomplish that goal.
For that reason.

1255
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:22.490
Judo is not merely a martial art,

1256
01:17:22.491 --> 01:17:25.910
but rather the basic principle of human behavior.

1257
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:29.600
It is wrong to assume judo ends in the Dojo,

1258
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.850
so he's saying,
apply this everywhere.
I'm saying you should do that.

1259
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:36.560
You can do it with Jujitsu.

1260
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.033
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1261
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:45.500
<v 3>Now we're going back into this sphere.
Yoko Zenu.</v>

1262
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.000
Certain teachings have a long tradition,
so most people accept them,

1263
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:54.830
but when people do not understand why they are taught a certain way,

1264
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.950
conflicts,
conflicts can sometimes arrive,

1265
01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:03.230
arise to give example.
Virtually no one doubts that diligence is a good thing,

1266
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.350
right?
No one doubts.
The diligence is a good thing.

1267
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.930
If diligence is always a good thing it falls at.

1268
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:11.630
There can be no situation in which being diligent is bad,

1269
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.100
but if you are diligent in an irresponsible manner,

1270
01:18:16.101 --> 01:18:19.490
you will spend a great deal of effort on something that is not very useful and

1271
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.160
expand the energy required to do something good.

1272
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.380
Wastefully you must carefully choose something for which diligence is suited.

1273
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:32.540
Even when we do what we believe to be best over doing something can be harmful.

1274
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.090
When students stay up late reading a book because they're teachers,

1275
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:37.460
parents or society has deemed at best that they should read it.

1276
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.500
This is certainly diligence,

1277
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.220
but it's also detrimental to their health to read for so long.

1278
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:48.840
Conversely,
you cannot do things halfheartedly or randomly,

1279
01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:53.670
so
you got to stay balanced.

1280
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:59.490
Let us turn to the into an annoying yet pervasive habit.

1281
01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.520
People all too often display complaining.

1282
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.280
What is the point of complaining?

1283
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.760
It is certainly no fun for those who have to listen to the complaints.

1284
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.530
The energy use to make an unpleasant complaints can certainly not be considered

1285
01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.930
Siri Yoku Zinio.

1286
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1287
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.471
<v 3>Rather,</v>

1288
01:19:18.471 --> 01:19:22.580
all the energy used to complain or grumble should be expended more usefully.

1289
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.990
This means ridding oneself of unpleasant feelings and refraining from harboring

1290
01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:30.470
ill will towards others in this end,
in the end,

1291
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:33.470
this will result in putting one's energy to the best use,

1292
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:36.980
not only for oneself but also for the betterment of society.

1293
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:39.770
This principle should be applied every day at all times,

1294
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.903
<v 1>okay?</v>

1295
01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:46.480
<v 3>Don't waste your energy on stuff that doesn't matter.
Back to the book.</v>

1296
01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:50.080
If people are always aware of their current situation and set a standard for

1297
01:19:50.081 --> 01:19:53.650
their future based on doing what will benefit themselves in society and

1298
01:19:53.651 --> 01:19:55.480
continually regulate their behavior,

1299
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.630
they can be satisfied with their lives at all times.

1300
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:02.730
When you try to do this,

1301
01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:05.550
you will find that your future prospects are always bright.

1302
01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:10.410
That is because you are doing is best.
How,
how common sense is this?

1303
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.670
Right?
And it's so common sense,
but how,

1304
01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.320
how many people do you know that follow this path?
That's the question.

1305
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.500
<v 2>Yeah.
That goes back to</v>

1306
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:21.890
how you say that idea of being detached.

1307
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.330
When you detached it's common sense but when you're in the game it's not common

1308
01:20:26.331 --> 01:20:28.430
sense because of how you,
just like how it said,

1309
01:20:28.431 --> 01:20:32.870
how you feel like you know like even complaining for example,

1310
01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.040
like you could ask,
I don't say literally everyone,

1311
01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:40.520
but you get out of several one and be like,
hey complaining.
Is that useful?

1312
01:20:40.521 --> 01:20:44.090
Is that good to do?
Is that fine to do complain?

1313
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:48.560
Yes or no?
Everyone's all no,
no,
no,
no.
Why does everyone complain then?

1314
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:51.410
Cause when you're in the gang complaining if you can feel better or whatever

1315
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:54.680
<v 3>you picked up on it very well because he says if people are always aware of</v>

1316
01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:55.840
their current situation,

1317
01:20:55.990 --> 01:21:00.990
meaning they need to be detached and then set a standard for the future based on

1318
01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.000
doing things that just think it's the same thing thick.

1319
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:09.860
Is it smart to do things that will benefit themselves and society continually

1320
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:12.950
continue to regulate your behavior so that you're satisfied with your life?

1321
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.890
And I'll think of course that makes sense.
Sure.
Why don't we do it?

1322
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.530
We get off the path.
We get on the slip

1323
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:22.070
<v 2>free slope.
We start losing our awareness of our,</v>

1324
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.830
what are the current state will have?
Yeah.

1325
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.570
<v 3>Uh,
current situation,
current situation.
I don't understand it.
Yeah.</v>

1326
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.010
This is interesting.

1327
01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:34.060
Through judo we are teaching a principle that can work together with the highest

1328
01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:38.800
principles of Buddhism and Christianity and the exhaustive studies of

1329
01:21:38.801 --> 01:21:39.850
philosophers.

1330
01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:45.900
One which like other great philosophies and religions can be put into action.

1331
01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:51.550
This principle of judo offers a basic principle that can provide a sound answer

1332
01:21:51.551 --> 01:21:53.470
for every situation and every question.

1333
01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.390
The easiest way to master this basic principle is to practice the Waza of judo

1334
01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:03.750
and to embark on the dough the way that is because through practice that

1335
01:22:04.421 --> 01:22:06.970
incorporates both a martial art and physical education.

1336
01:22:06.971 --> 01:22:10.270
One can learn a method for making the most effective use of one's mental and

1337
01:22:10.271 --> 01:22:11.104
physical energy.

1338
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.690
Then one naturally learns how to apply this method to every aspect of human

1339
01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:16.803
affairs.

1340
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:22.120
I believe that this basic principle is the most appropriate method for resolving

1341
01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:26.290
various moral issues.
Man,

1342
01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:30.580
he puts a lot of weight on the judo.
A lot of weight on the judo.

1343
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:35.260
Yeah.
With regard to our daily activities and social interaction,

1344
01:22:35.261 --> 01:22:40.261
the teaching of serial [inaudible] Zinio means bringing about maximum results

1345
01:22:40.841 --> 01:22:44.620
through the use of every sort of energy.
For this reason,

1346
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:49.750
human faults like anger,
for example,
violate this principle.

1347
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:54.970
Becoming angry consumes mental energy.
How does anger benefit you or anyone else?

1348
01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.680
The result of anger are invariably a depletion of mental energy and being looked

1349
01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.960
down on or disliked by others.

1350
01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.250
By following the principle of cereal code Zinio.

1351
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:09.220
People will not be able to get angry.

1352
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.290
Being disappointed or troubled by failures or setbacks or harboring grievances

1353
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:19.330
are also ways in which mental energy is consumed.
Arguments,
fights.

1354
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:22.960
All of these are violations of Siri,
Oco,
Zeniah,

1355
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.920
those who practice judo must take great care to follow this teaching,

1356
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:31.210
no matter what the situation,
there is only one path that people must follow.

1357
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.540
In every case,
the only courses to consider.

1358
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:37.930
What is the right thing to do and proceed in that direction.

1359
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.810
What is the right thing to do and do that you know

1360
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.910
what does the right thing to do and do that that's what you should do regardless

1361
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:50.830
of how you feel.
Yes,

1362
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.540
I have coined a phrase that I regularly say to people,

1363
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.280
there is only one path in life.

1364
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:02.110
Conducting yourself in accordance with this principal on a daily basis is

1365
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:06.670
vitally important.
Though human beings may reach the pinnacle of success,

1366
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.060
there is only one path down which to proceed.

1367
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:15.010
That is to say because complacency gives rise to the cause of failure,

1368
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.670
you must always consider things carefully until you find the appropriate course

1369
01:24:18.671 --> 01:24:21.880
of action and proceed that way.
Even when you fail,

1370
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:24.550
there's only one path down which to proceed.

1371
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:27.850
Even if once you fail and lose heart,

1372
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.410
if you regain your courage and find your way along the highest path,

1373
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.370
the highest path circumstances will gradually improve.

1374
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:40.900
That's like Jordan Peterson talking,
right?
Hey,
you know,
like get on,

1375
01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:44.200
do the right thing to pick a little thing and start improving that thing.

1376
01:24:44.201 --> 01:24:47.020
Clean your room because they find their own paths.

1377
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:50.260
Those who practiced judo and who followed the principle of serial cuisine,

1378
01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:54.430
you always have a calm spirit.
Enjoy life and our enterprising,

1379
01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.040
the most advanced mental life can only be achieved when people thoroughly

1380
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:03.730
absorbed this principle.
Sudoku,

1381
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:06.670
Zenu maximum efficiency.

1382
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:11.050
What are you doing that is taking away your energy?

1383
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.150
What are you wasting your energy on?

1384
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:20.200
Back to the book a true a person's true value is determined by how much he or

1385
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:24.520
she contributes to society during his or her life and because these very

1386
01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:28.360
contributions enable those who strive to protect themselves to achieve this,

1387
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:33.370
the purpose of judo is to perfect yourself so that you can contribute to
society.

1388
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.480
This applies to ordinary people as well.
Again,
this is very,

1389
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:41.410
very similar to what Jordan Peterson socks about.
You're like you,
you need to,

1390
01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.490
if you,
if you fix your world well,
you're impacting everyone's world around you.

1391
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.720
This applies to ordinary people as well,

1392
01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:53.620
but in particular those who specialize in judo must be expected to act in a way

1393
01:25:53.621 --> 01:25:57.220
consistent with the purposes of judo.
When you practiced judo,

1394
01:25:57.221 --> 01:26:01.360
you must try to perfect yourself and contribute to society through this practice

1395
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.330
and you must emphasize the importance of this during your teachings to others.

1396
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:11.500
Something that seems good because it is near at hand,

1397
01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:13.450
may be useless in the future,

1398
01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.680
whereas in some cases a bit of patients is highly effective in furthering your

1399
01:26:17.681 --> 01:26:21.280
lot in the future,
right?
Delayed gratification.

1400
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:29.050
The basis of happiness in life is found not in the pursuit of material gains or

1401
01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:34.331
temporary pleasure and true kindness towards one's friends means giving them

1402
01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:40.160
serious advice when needed selflessly without fear of offending them.

1403
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:44.700
That one's interesting because I deal with this one a lot,
right?

1404
01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:48.370
I deal list with a lot because you got your,

1405
01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:52.710
your subordinate that's not doing what they're supposed to do and I just was

1406
01:26:52.711 --> 01:26:57.711
having this conversation with a group I was working with and they were real big

1407
01:26:57.931 --> 01:27:00.780
on the word transparency of life and I talked about it on the podcast and,

1408
01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.400
and if here's the question,

1409
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.640
like I'm going to be transparent with you,
like,
hey,

1410
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.410
echo your videos.
You know they're not good right now.

1411
01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.710
Like your videos aren't good.
You need to tighten up your videos.

1412
01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.620
Like does that make,
does that improve our relationship?

1413
01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.690
Does that make you want to do a good job for me?

1414
01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:26.250
Does that make you want to do like get out there and really crush it?
No,

1415
01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.880
not at all.
So even though I'm being transparent,
does it help our situation?

1416
01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.880
Does it help?
What we're trying to do.
No it doesn't.

1417
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:36.390
So I need to figure out a way to tell you something.

1418
01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:38.850
And normally the best way to do that,

1419
01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:40.800
and here's a big hint for everyone that's out there,

1420
01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:45.690
if you want to give someone critique that they know that you know they need,

1421
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:51.950
one of the best ways to give them critique is to take ownership of it,

1422
01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:55.890
take ownership of the problem.
So I say Echo,
hey,

1423
01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:59.730
I feel like I'm not really giving you good guidance on,

1424
01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.260
on the videos and the way they're coming out.

1425
01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:05.420
I want to sit down and talk to you and actually go through like what,

1426
01:28:05.421 --> 01:28:08.040
what will the impact that we're trying to have and that I want to have?

1427
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:10.410
And I mean I know you're working hard,

1428
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.920
but I feel like I'm not giving you good enough guy.

1429
01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.200
And so I to sit down with you and try and see if I can be more clear.
Right.

1430
01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:22.060
Does that offend you?
No.
Well I know what you're doing now,
but yeah,
no,

1431
01:28:22.061 --> 01:28:24.960
no,
I get it.
Yeah,
you're right.
So you take,

1432
01:28:24.961 --> 01:28:28.950
if you take ownership of the problem and then you talk about the problem with

1433
01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:31.080
the person,
it puts,
it doesn't,

1434
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:35.910
it makes it makes them not have a defensive posture,
which is what you,

1435
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.810
which is what you want.
You want.
Don't want them to have a defensive posture.

1436
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:44.010
I actually want to have them have an open mind and be able to listen to what I

1437
01:28:44.011 --> 01:28:47.630
say.
They won't listen if you're pointing the finger at them.
Yeah,

1438
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.370
they won't listen as well.
They might listen for a little while,

1439
01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:52.110
but it won't be a lasting thing.

1440
01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.520
Maybe years later maybe or something like that won't help the relationship.

1441
01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.480
We know that and I'm sure

1442
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.980
you must remember

1443
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.970
<v 4>that the purpose of expanding a great deal of effort to build a strong body as</v>

1444
01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:10.890
to enable you to undertake jobs that you might otherwise be unable to endure.

1445
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:12.180
So when he's talking about there,
he's talking about,

1446
01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:16.680
he basically goes on this whole thing about like being big and buff.
Sure.

1447
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:21.240
He's not pro not down for that.
It's not down for the cause.
Like Echo Charles.

1448
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.840
He would look at you and think you're wasting too much time on your,

1449
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:29.670
on your bicep curls
might be right.
Yeah.

1450
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:33.240
So that's what he's saying is that he's,
he's all about the functional strength.

1451
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:36.750
You want to be strong so that you can do jobs that you might not be able to

1452
01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:40.050
endure if you didn't work hard.
He didn't work out hard.
Hey,

1453
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:44.220
that's a balancing act too.
I know you're going to defend them.

1454
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:46.150
The biceps curls wrong,

1455
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:50.520
but you know how like they say it's even like,
like kind of like,

1456
01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.840
cause it's bad example,
but you,

1457
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:57.930
he said you want to save your energy essentially for jobs that are like

1458
01:29:58.111 --> 01:29:59.310
important.
Right?
So if you know,

1459
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:03.360
he says the reason that you're trying to get strong isn't so you can look big

1460
01:30:03.361 --> 01:30:03.900
and buff.

1461
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:07.200
It's so that you can do jobs that you can endure jobs that you wouldn't have

1462
01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:10.920
bailed too.
Gotcha.
So that,
that should be the focus of your training.

1463
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:13.350
Functional strength.
That's what he's our,

1464
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:18.351
he's down with the functional strength is this guy I need to super funny bro.

1465
01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:20.370
Science,
I think I told this deep bro.

1466
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:23.520
Science life or something like that so that that grows so funny.

1467
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.050
And he's talking about functional strength.
He's did,
he said,
so,
you know,

1468
01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:28.980
it's jokes or whatever.
And he's like,
yeah,
so good luck.

1469
01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:33.060
You can compare your functional strength with my actual strength.
So funny.

1470
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:36.760
But in his mind,
actual strength.
It's like how much you can bench and you know,

1471
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:40.070
you know how it is.
But yeah,
that's the not every time I hear it,

1472
01:30:40.071 --> 01:30:45.071
like when a guy starts to like heavily advocating functional strength over like

1473
01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:48.150
a,
some,
some lip weightlifter guy or whatever.
I think about that.

1474
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.940
That's even though I'm sure this book came out a lot,
you know,

1475
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:57.840
earlier than Bro,
science life,
Shaq,

1476
01:30:58.810 --> 01:30:59.970
all right,
back to the book.

1477
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:04.980
Some who practiced judo become overconfident of their health and inevitably fail

1478
01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:09.750
to look after themselves.
We must not be careless about where we live,

1479
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:11.760
our clothing or our hygiene.

1480
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:15.390
We should pay great attention to what we eat and drink.

1481
01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:19.860
There was a time when people did not deem it a problem to eat and drink to

1482
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:23.460
excess,
but rather we're proud of a prolific,
uh,

1483
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:26.400
proud of being a prolific eater or a heavy drinker.

1484
01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:29.070
That way of thinking still persists

1485
01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.610
and is obviously detrimental to health if you do not take care in regard to

1486
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:38.280
matters of health,
there is no benefit in practicing judo.

1487
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.770
Those who practice judo must not only keep this in mind but must also consider

1488
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:45.600
it their duty to remind others

1489
01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:52.670
that's bolded it there their duty to remind [inaudible] star next to that little

1490
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:54.810
ass.
This guy again,

1491
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:59.260
this guy is like super orderly and he's,
you know,

1492
01:31:59.261 --> 01:32:02.100
just going to tighten people up.
You know,
he's out there going,

1493
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:07.020
don't eat that donut.
Yeah,
well it's one thing to but to the nth degree.
Yeah.

1494
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:10.840
That's like your duty.
Come on Bro.
Yeah,
he,
you know,
it's my duty.
I'm going to go,

1495
01:32:10.841 --> 01:32:11.290
you know,

1496
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:14.670
I'm going to go to the mall and buy the food court and you know what's the

1497
01:32:14.671 --> 01:32:14.941
funniest,

1498
01:32:14.941 --> 01:32:19.941
this is the only thing in the whole book that he says like judo won't help.

1499
01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:25.600
Like if you,
if you're not healthy,
it's not,
you don't even train.
He has a thing.

1500
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.230
He has a thing like that.
Yeah.
It's a little thing.

1501
01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:34.810
What's that called?
A pick a hang up.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1502
01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:35.653
This is hangup

1503
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:40.540
because judo derives from the martial arts of the past.

1504
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:44.590
It must perpetuate the spirit of other martial arts,
loyalty,
faith,
honor,

1505
01:32:44.591 --> 01:32:47.830
and various other virtues were emphasized in the martial arts of the past.

1506
01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.430
But I can,
we feel their importance even today,

1507
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:56.610
the deterioration of society's morals today is primarily the result of a failure

1508
01:32:56.831 --> 01:32:58.870
to emphasize these virtues.

1509
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:04.690
So I believe that those who practice judo in particular must apply themselves to

1510
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:08.740
these matters and restore today's neglected public morals.

1511
01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.060
He's got another little hang up.
Hang Up.
He's,
but I mean,

1512
01:33:17.061 --> 01:33:20.660
obviously I'm pointing this out because we could clearly look at society today

1513
01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:25.040
and be like,
yeah,
well guess what?
We were on a slippery slope.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1514
01:33:25.041 --> 01:33:26.930
You can tell he feels strongly about that one though,

1515
01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:31.370
right there who meet or heal him.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
What about me?

1516
01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.730
Yeah,
it did.
Just,
you had to look on your face indicated that for sure.

1517
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:37.020
That's a whole nother thing.
It's,

1518
01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.840
it's weird because you go around different pockets of the world in different

1519
01:33:41.841 --> 01:33:44.060
pockets of the country and you see various,

1520
01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.650
various positions on the slippery slope.
Some people hanging on,

1521
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.140
but some people are not and they're just slipping and we gotta be careful.

1522
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:58.910
Yeah.
And you get an,
obviously that's a whole nother topic,
but the,

1523
01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:02.390
you know,
and you have so many huge,
major,

1524
01:34:02.391 --> 01:34:04.760
major forces kind of working against it,
you know,

1525
01:34:04.761 --> 01:34:08.240
pushing us down the slippery slope like marketing,
right.
You know,

1526
01:34:08.241 --> 01:34:13.241
how like marketing most marketing is to appeal to your most immediate of wants

1527
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:18.510
base delicious,
a double whatever,
you know,

1528
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:23.100
and it's the girl that's showing the delicious burger like,
yeah.
And guess what,

1529
01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.980
it doesn't even cost that much.
Dang.
You know,
so gratification for cheap.

1530
01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:28.641
Yeah,
man.

1531
01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:33.230
So you can get it and sex thrown on top of that just to make you feel good,

1532
01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.740
you know,
whatever,
you know,
and that's everything.
So,
you know,
again,

1533
01:34:36.741 --> 01:34:40.870
if you're not,
what is it conscious of your situation or whatever it

1534
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:43.243
is.

1535
01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.140
I think people lose concentration this because most people,

1536
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.610
in my opinion,
most people are like,
they kind of know,
you know,
we were like,

1537
01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:57.980
we go back to the theory of right and wrong and what's right.
I think most people

1538
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.670
<v 3>are pretty good with it.</v>

1539
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.090
Like most people feel pretty like they know what's bay like no,
that's wrong.

1540
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.180
Right.
And they know that,
hey,
you know what?
That's a good thing to do.
Right.

1541
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:10.210
I think most people kind of like broadly kind of kind of a would agree with

1542
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.040
those things.
Yeah.
The problem is,

1543
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:15.830
and so that's why I think we don't emphasize as much because we think,

1544
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:17.780
you know what,
my,
hey man,
most people pretty much agree with me.

1545
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:21.320
Like it's like the center people of the country right now.
Like,

1546
01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:24.960
and the extreme right now,
the extreme left now,
okay,
where are you at?
It's like,

1547
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.190
okay,
well those people that are in the middle,
it's like,
yeah,
we,

1548
01:35:27.210 --> 01:35:29.000
we kind of figured like,
okay,
pretty much.

1549
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:33.530
And so what happens is once we don't talk about it as much,

1550
01:35:33.531 --> 01:35:36.590
well then the people that are on the fringes,
mentally,

1551
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:39.350
they ended up without a compass.
Right.

1552
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.220
They just don't even know what's right and what's wrong anymore because people

1553
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:45.710
aren't talking about as much because it doesn't seem like we need to.

1554
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:50.810
I think we might need to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And why it's right.

1555
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.600
Then it comes down to your approach and like all this stuff,

1556
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:55.370
cause you know when you have opposing views,

1557
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:57.410
it's like if you don't do it with the right approach,
you just,

1558
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.430
it becomes more about the fight more.
For sure.
So yeah,

1559
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:03.930
I think you're right about that.
I think are,

1560
01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.320
and are you talking about what people,

1561
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:09.260
most people know right and wrong because there's a difference between like,

1562
01:36:09.261 --> 01:36:13.880
just like how you were saying where people know right and wrong,

1563
01:36:13.881 --> 01:36:16.460
but they don't always do what's right kind of thing.
Totally.

1564
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:19.940
So is that what you're talking about?
Like when most people,
no,
no,
I'm saying,

1565
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:24.590
I'm saying if you don't teach a kid like,
hey,

1566
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:29.030
when you see someone that needs help you go help them.
Right,

1567
01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:33.830
like little old lady crossing the street.
Right,
right.
That seems obvious.

1568
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:37.850
Little Old lady cross the street,
she's got a grocery bag.
You,
you go,
okay,
Hey,

1569
01:36:37.851 --> 01:36:40.580
can I help you with that grocery bag and you know,
help you put it in your car.

1570
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:43.750
Maybe for you,
you get a little pump while you're at it with that grocery bag.

1571
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:46.610
Hope she has a bunch.
Yeah.
So like that's,

1572
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:48.980
that seems like a real common sense thing to do.

1573
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.180
And that's like the most basic example I can think of off the top of my head.

1574
01:36:53.181 --> 01:36:57.380
Like,
okay,
so that,
that would be a good thing to train a kid to do.
Hey,

1575
01:36:57.590 --> 01:37:00.290
if you see someone that needs some help,
you give him some help,

1576
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:05.610
especially in elderly person that's having some trouble.
That's what you do.
Yeah.

1577
01:37:05.890 --> 01:37:09.260
It seems real obvious.
But what I'm saying and,
and I think even,

1578
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:13.910
I think most people,
most kids would be like,
oh yeah,

1579
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:16.550
they'd see that.
And they would tend to go,
okay,
I'll help out.

1580
01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.660
But because most people would tend to do that,

1581
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:23.890
we think we don't need to teach them.
And that's where we're losing it.
Yeah.

1582
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:27.080
Like because the people on the fringes,
they're not helping that person.

1583
01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:28.640
There's someone on the fringe that's going to like,
oh,

1584
01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:30.680
they dropped it back and we'll steal it from him.
Right.

1585
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:34.040
So that's where we end up with a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.

1586
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:37.580
And that's why these things probably need to come up as part of a conversation

1587
01:37:37.581 --> 01:37:37.851
as a,

1588
01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:42.820
as like a national or universal conversations to be had of like,

1589
01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.130
okay,
what is right and wrong?
Who's given those guidances now?
Yeah.

1590
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:49.820
Where are they coming from?
[inaudible] people.

1591
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:53.390
Three people aren't reading the Bible anymore to look for their guidance.

1592
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:56.100
They're not following Buddhism to

1593
01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:00.240
<v 4>get their guidance from,
right.
They're just,
they're just kind of going around.</v>

1594
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:03.720
Yeah.
So where's that coming from?
Yeah,
that's true.

1595
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:06.240
They're going like going around and they're seeing like,
what?
Okay.

1596
01:38:06.241 --> 01:38:08.310
They're looking around me like,
okay,
what are we doing?
How are we doing this?

1597
01:38:08.311 --> 01:38:10.100
Is this right?
Is this wrong now?
And you do.

1598
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.500
And what are they looking at to get to measure to,
to establish that from,

1599
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:16.560
you know what they're looking at Instagram.
Yeah.
Whatever's around,

1600
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.230
whatever's around,
but Instagram's around me,
youtube around them.

1601
01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.400
That's what's around them,
and they're looking at it going,
okay,
well this is,

1602
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.210
you know,
that seems like that's what we're doing.
All right,
cool.

1603
01:38:27.211 --> 01:38:30.060
That's what we're doing.
Yeah.
It's okay to soccer punched this.
You know this,

1604
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:33.110
this old dude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
I,
you know,

1605
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:35.880
I feel a little uncomfortable about it,
but you know what seems normal?

1606
01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:40.270
People are doing it.
Fun.
Yeah.
Laughing.
It got a lot of use.
Yeah.

1607
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:43.370
So maybe that's what's cool.
Yeah.
That's where we need to watch out for,

1608
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.720
and obviously I know that's an extreme case,

1609
01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.620
but really that that's true.
Where especially,

1610
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:52.170
okay in these extreme cases will happen.
By the way,

1611
01:38:52.171 --> 01:38:54.960
if you don't have any other presence of influence,
for sure.

1612
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:59.160
You know how I'm like,
oh,
I was kind of saying this.

1613
01:38:59.161 --> 01:39:03.810
I thought it made sense where Kate,
your kids or whatever,

1614
01:39:03.811 --> 01:39:05.340
they're going to learn how to behave.

1615
01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:10.700
Whether they learn it from you or your neighbor or the TV or the guy at the club

1616
01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:13.200
or the guy at the park,
whatever that part is up to you.

1617
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:14.280
Like if you don't want to be there,

1618
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:18.450
they're going to learn it from somebody else kind of thing.
So that idea where,

1619
01:39:18.451 --> 01:39:21.810
okay,
what do we,
you know,
this is a society like,
okay,
what are we doing that,

1620
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:24.060
how are we doing this?
What's right?
What's wrong?
Is this wrong now?

1621
01:39:24.061 --> 01:39:26.160
Whatever that we're going to get that does.
Like I said,

1622
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.310
like we're looking around,
we're trying to see what up,
you know,

1623
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.930
and if there's no specific things,
sane or Courtney court necessarily a course,

1624
01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.850
even though of course it'd be cool if there's nothing present there to

1625
01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:41.250
demonstrate it,
then they're going to be like,
all right,

1626
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:42.840
well what is here to demonstrate it?

1627
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:47.070
And what I'm saying is we've gotten away from things that in the past would have

1628
01:39:47.071 --> 01:39:50.460
guided us,
at least someone,
and we'll,

1629
01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:55.461
you'd had this sort of sort of fundamental universal understanding of like,

1630
01:39:57.090 --> 01:40:00.990
thou shalt not kill.
Right?
Sure.
Well,
okay,
that,
that,

1631
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.230
that's a biblical thing.
And well,
you know,

1632
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:09.290
maybe when a kid is 15 years old and he's feeling angry about something and he's

1633
01:40:10.531 --> 01:40:11.580
thinking,
you know what,

1634
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:15.600
I play a video game all day where I shoot like people in this video game and

1635
01:40:15.601 --> 01:40:17.220
that makes me feel better.
Well,

1636
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:21.580
maybe it may make me feel better to go out and do that in a school.
Right.
That's,

1637
01:40:21.581 --> 01:40:26.310
that's,
that's what happens.
Yeah.
So if we don't have,

1638
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.500
if we don't lay out these things for people,

1639
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.560
even though most people don't need them,
there are some people that need them.

1640
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:35.010
That's my point,
is that we've gotten to a point where we think,
you know what?

1641
01:40:35.011 --> 01:40:37.980
Pretty much everyone kind of gets it.
And if everyone kind of gets it,

1642
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.630
I don't need to emphasize it that much.
Yeah.

1643
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.700
And so I'm not going to emphasize it.
Well,
there's some people that need it.
Yeah.

1644
01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:48.020
And even if you don't quote unquote need,
it's kind of like exercising,
you know,

1645
01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.650
I'm in great shape.
I don't got exercise will yet.
You kind of do,
you know?
Yeah.

1646
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.340
It's a interesting

1647
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.173
<v 3>times.</v>

1648
01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:56.533
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.800
<v 3>This is interesting.
Speaking of interesting,</v>

1650
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.400
instructive talks on morals presented in the classroom often become abstract or

1651
01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:09.280
involve stories if people from the distant past.

1652
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:12.370
So they're not likely to inspire the listener,

1653
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.320
but moral lessons that can be acquired through judo is Randori are based on

1654
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:22.150
facts and are much more likely to make an impression.

1655
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.170
And it can be said that the habit of observation,

1656
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:30.850
the ability to make decisions quickly and the ability to remain calm and

1657
01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:35.851
resolute that are cultivated through fighting are also valuable outcomes of the

1658
01:41:35.861 --> 01:41:38.170
practice of judo.
These abilities,
however,

1659
01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:42.790
will not be developed merely by doing catia and Randori training without any

1660
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:43.624
thought.

1661
01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:48.550
These abilities will naturally develop when one takes care and fought and

1662
01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:51.670
practicing them on a daily basis.
So this is,

1663
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:55.000
this is something very interesting thing about.
So I thought that was great.
Like,

1664
01:41:55.001 --> 01:41:58.540
Hey,
you learn about some,
you know,
you,
you read the Bible,
I,
you know,
it's like,

1665
01:41:58.541 --> 01:41:59.620
oh,
that doesn't really make sense to me.

1666
01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.070
It's some guy that lived thousands of years ago and well,

1667
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.040
I don't really get that.

1668
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.820
I don't really get why I should be humble because it says you should be humble.

1669
01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:11.770
We'll get on the mat now you get humbled and you feel,
you get humbled.
Right?

1670
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.400
So there's that.
That's,
that's like the perfect example of how hey,

1671
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:20.140
what you learn on the mat
is,
is truly understood.

1672
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:23.440
But if you don't get exp,
if no one,
if no,

1673
01:42:23.441 --> 01:42:26.620
if you don't think about the fact that hey,
that reflects life too,
by the way,

1674
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.270
that reflects life,
by the way,
if no one makes that connection for you,

1675
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:35.410
that's problematic.
And I mean,
clearly a Jujitsu,

1676
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:38.150
this is a big difference between Jujitsu and judo.

1677
01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:39.730
Like we talked about what the competitions are like.

1678
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:42.000
Can you talk about how you get disqualified Jujitsu?

1679
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:45.640
You have people in Jujitsu that have bad attitudes,
right?
And they don't,

1680
01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:49.990
they don't apply what they learn in Jujitsu.
One of the things that,
you know,

1681
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.920
my attitude always is with Jujitsu is like if I get,

1682
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:56.110
if I beat someone in Jujitsu,

1683
01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:02.970
if you,
if you understand Jujitsu,
if you beat someone in Jujitsu,

1684
01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:06.480
you realize that doesn't make you a better person than the person that you beat.

1685
01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:09.000
What it means is you've trained more than them.
That's what it means.

1686
01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:12.320
Or it means you caught him that time means you got lucky with a move.
I mean,

1687
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:15.060
they made a mistake and you had trained enough to be able to capitalize on it.

1688
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:19.410
It doesn't mean you're a better human being than they are.
And they're,

1689
01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.210
there are people in Jujitsu that think,
oh,

1690
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:24.540
I am a better human being than that person's cause I've tapped them out.

1691
01:43:24.541 --> 01:43:26.370
It's like actually no,
not true at all.

1692
01:43:26.970 --> 01:43:31.020
So if you're not connecting these bigger,

1693
01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:36.021
broader lessons and connecting Jujitsu to life than what you have is just,

1694
01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.780
just this isolated sport,
which,
which is,
uh,
which is,
uh,

1695
01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:47.220
it's not even a sport.
It's an,
it's an isolated might,

1696
01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:51.230
makes right attitude on the map,
which is not a good thing.

1697
01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.580
It's not a good thing.
At all.

1698
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:57.170
Jujitsu should be making you humble because you should recognize like,
Oh yeah,

1699
01:43:57.171 --> 01:43:59.960
well I've been training longer than this guy and that's why I can beat him.

1700
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:03.230
And one day if they keep training more than me,
they'll be able to beat me.

1701
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.030
So hopefully I'll keep training and,

1702
01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.910
and we'll have a relationship and we'll be able to support each other.

1703
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:09.440
And that's the attitude.

1704
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.480
So I think that's one of the things where you know,
you've got,

1705
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:16.700
in my mind you've got judo on one side,

1706
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:21.230
which is really strict and controlled and,

1707
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:27.260
and less evolutionary cause it doesn't evolve as much and you have Jujitsu on

1708
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:31.700
the other hand,
which is wildly evolutionary,
it's incredibly creative.

1709
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:33.800
Like there's,
there's less creativity in judo.

1710
01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.750
There's way more creativity in Jujitsu.

1711
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.770
And I think in the middle,

1712
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.460
especially on the attitude part is where Jujitsu now is like you need to like

1713
01:44:45.771 --> 01:44:47.870
you go to Jujitsu competition,
like little kids that are,

1714
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:50.990
they have their bad sports right there,
bad sports,

1715
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:52.970
they did not learn sportsmanship.

1716
01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.820
And that's an important thing because what a sportsmanship mean.

1717
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:59.300
Sportsmanship doesn't just mean like you're a good sport on the mat.
No.

1718
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:02.810
It means that in life you can handle getting beaten and you're going to get back

1719
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:05.630
up and you're going to have a good attitude.
That's what sportsmanship is.

1720
01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:08.450
That's why you're trying to teach that to your kids.
Right.

1721
01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.450
And there's a million little things like that and Jujitsu that you learned,

1722
01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.800
like just the hard training.
Well you,
you know what,

1723
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:20.150
in Jujitsu sometimes you work hard and you still get beat.
Yeah.

1724
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:23.810
That's the way life is.
Yes sir.
That's the way life is.
You work hard,

1725
01:45:23.811 --> 01:45:25.790
you put give it everything you got and you still gonna get beat.

1726
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:30.410
Well guess what do you learn from that?
You learn about life from that,
you know,

1727
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.520
the creativity part.
If you're stuck in a box on something and,

1728
01:45:35.521 --> 01:45:37.550
and he talked about that earlier,
like,
oh yeah.

1729
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.220
When he's talking about there's only one path.
Again,

1730
01:45:40.221 --> 01:45:44.840
I talk about him as being a very,
uh,
I won't see,
not creative,

1731
01:45:44.841 --> 01:45:47.360
but he's,
he's got an orderly brain.
Right.

1732
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:50.810
Cause I never look at something that's there's one path.
Yeah.
Like,

1733
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:55.130
and by the way,
if I fail in business,
he's like,
hey,
there's only one path.

1734
01:45:55.131 --> 01:45:57.170
Know if I fail in business,
I'm actually going to look and see like,
well,
okay,

1735
01:45:57.171 --> 01:46:00.330
what other path could I take?
Now he's talking about the path of like,

1736
01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.330
like I'm not saying Hell No,

1737
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:03.470
the hell with discipline and I'm just gonna do whatever I want.

1738
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.720
So he's staying stay on that path and that makes sense.

1739
01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.080
But there is a certain lack of creativity.
They're like,
okay,

1740
01:46:09.081 --> 01:46:10.730
well if I make a mistake,
I'm going to assess.

1741
01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.980
I don't want to see what I can do differently.
And again,

1742
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:16.220
I'm not arguing that that's that he was saying,
no,
don't ever try anything else.

1743
01:46:16.221 --> 01:46:20.300
But that is an important piece that you learned from Jujitsu.
Like,
Oh,

1744
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:24.320
if I can't pass the guard,
this person's guard this particular way,

1745
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.060
I need to take a different approach.

1746
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.300
You learn that from Jujitsu and you can apply it to life.

1747
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:34.010
So all of these lessons that if you don't pay attention to what you're learning

1748
01:46:34.011 --> 01:46:37.310
in Jujitsu and you don't reflect on it and put it back on your life,

1749
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.800
well then all you're learning is how to fight people and beat him up.

1750
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:41.960
Or then Jujitsu is not doing what it should.

1751
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.520
It's not doing what it could be doing for you.
Yeah.

1752
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:47.990
So you need to be careful of that.
Yeah.
I think his thing,

1753
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:52.720
his one path is it's this really broad and general kind of dirt.

1754
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.140
It's more of a direction than it is.
It is.
And I,

1755
01:46:55.141 --> 01:46:58.770
that's a bad example for me to use.
Um,
but at the same time,

1756
01:46:58.771 --> 01:47:00.690
I want to make sure people aren't like,
well,
you know,

1757
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:03.870
I'm going to stay on the path.
I'm going to stay the course,
stay the course.

1758
01:47:03.871 --> 01:47:05.160
You know what,
we failed at time,
but it's okay.

1759
01:47:05.161 --> 01:47:07.890
I'm going to stay the course and to keep going.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'll assess,

1760
01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:09.450
see what you can do differently.

1761
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:18.190
All right.
Um,
effective use of mental and physical energy.
Again,
he's,

1762
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:23.250
he's talking about this Si Sikiru Zinio an integral,

1763
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:26.150
which is integral to the teachings of judo.

1764
01:47:26.151 --> 01:47:28.160
Competition can be applied to many aspects of life.

1765
01:47:28.161 --> 01:47:31.100
Those who practiced judo must measure their behavior by this principle on a

1766
01:47:31.101 --> 01:47:33.140
daily basis and make corrections when appropriate.

1767
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:36.770
If you actually apply this standard to every aspect of your life from food,

1768
01:47:36.771 --> 01:47:38.960
clothing,
and shelter to your work in relationships,

1769
01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.980
you'll find that you often have to correct your own mistakes.
Those who do this,

1770
01:47:42.981 --> 01:47:45.350
we'll make progress day by day and advanced in life.

1771
01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:50.560
Those who fail to do so will never progress and in many cases will regress.

1772
01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:54.320
So keep an eye on those little things.

1773
01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:56.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:00.330
<v 3>With regard to memory,
in the early stages of practices of judo,</v>

1775
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.360
you must do what you have been taught in order to do this.

1776
01:48:03.361 --> 01:48:06.660
You must remember thinking as well as practice progresses,
you must eat.

1777
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.910
You must remember not only what you have been taught,

1778
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:10.290
but also what you have observed.

1779
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:13.590
So there are many situations in which memory is vital.

1780
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:18.030
You will develop that ability naturally to come up with ways to remember things

1781
01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:20.850
he's talking about.
Some of the benefits of learning judo.
So one of us,

1782
01:48:20.851 --> 01:48:24.150
you learn to remember things next week,
come to the area of imagination.

1783
01:48:24.151 --> 01:48:27.720
This is not particularly necessary during the early stages of the practice of

1784
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:30.030
judo,
but becomes quite necessary later.

1785
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.730
You may experience experiment with various outcomes,

1786
01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:34.770
carefully anticipating how your opponent will react,

1787
01:48:34.771 --> 01:48:38.340
but if there is a limit to the ideas you can come up with and if the range is

1788
01:48:38.341 --> 01:48:42.120
narrow,
no good ideas will come to you no matter how much time passes.

1789
01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:46.740
On the other hand,
if you come up with a variety of ideas one after another,

1790
01:48:46.741 --> 01:48:50.910
and if your thoughts extend to things quite different from your original idea,

1791
01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:54.030
you can come up with a perfect solution among those ideas.

1792
01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:58.820
So he talks about creativity
and this is interesting.

1793
01:48:58.821 --> 01:49:00.500
Next couple language.

1794
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:04.160
This is very important to the practice of judo.

1795
01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:09.290
The reason is it is the reason is that in Randori as well as in Catia,

1796
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:12.650
if you try and explain a particular method in words,

1797
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.520
unless you explain it exceptionally logically and clearly,

1798
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:18.830
your listener will not understand what you mean.

1799
01:49:20.590 --> 01:49:23.320
There are some things that can be demonstrated in detail using Catia while

1800
01:49:23.321 --> 01:49:25.090
others do not lend themselves to this method.

1801
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.070
In some cases you must explain things in writing or verbally when teaching,

1802
01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:33.880
whether you demonstrate things through Catia only or by giving a verbal

1803
01:49:33.881 --> 01:49:37.720
explanation while demonstrating the Kata makes a big difference to the listener.

1804
01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.410
This is a truism when you ask something,

1805
01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:45.520
when you ask someone about something you do not understand or discuss something

1806
01:49:45.521 --> 01:49:48.010
in depth,
it is beneficial.

1807
01:49:48.011 --> 01:49:51.070
If you could talk about it clearly Voss it is.

1808
01:49:51.071 --> 01:49:54.350
So in the practice of judo,
take care of,

1809
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.390
take care to discuss things logically and clearly.

1810
01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.440
So even he talks about the importance of being able to express yourself and

1811
01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:05.950
having good command of the language.
It applies to judo.

1812
01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.700
Is that reaching maybe a little bit,
but we'll give it to him.

1813
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:13.590
I'm gonna give it to the,
yeah,
no,
yeah.
The way I see it as like,
you know,

1814
01:50:13.591 --> 01:50:17.560
the what is the laws of combat?
Simple,
right?
Yeah.
That's,
that's what simple.

1815
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:22.150
Clear.
Concise.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
you're right.
Good call.
I like it.

1816
01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.550
Next.
I would like to discuss the need for broad mindedness.

1817
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:32.650
Broad mindedness means open to new ideas as well as the ability to organize

1818
01:50:32.651 --> 01:50:36.940
various kinds of ideas at the same time without mixing them up.

1819
01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:41.380
The reason this is important to the practice of judo is that when there is no

1820
01:50:41.381 --> 01:50:42.490
broad mindedness,

1821
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.260
people often become overly confident in their own beliefs such that if there are

1822
01:50:47.261 --> 01:50:51.100
new ideas that are superior,
not only do they not accept these new ideas,

1823
01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:51.911
but in doing so,

1824
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:54.850
they failed to determine their value and whether they are good or bad.

1825
01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.330
This is something you see all the time with people with ego.
It closed mind.

1826
01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:01.600
They don't listen to anybody else.
They don't come up with any new ideas.
It's

1827
01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:04.023
horrible.

1828
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:09.630
So keep an open mind my way or the highway or is that a different thing?

1829
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:11.840
You don't want none of that.
None of the highway.
Yeah.

1830
01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:14.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1831
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:16.190
<v 3>Speaking of simple,</v>

1832
01:51:16.191 --> 01:51:19.700
the theory of judo fighting includes some quite complicated ideas.

1833
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:22.880
When we consider the relationship between the body and the four limbs,

1834
01:51:22.881 --> 01:51:25.790
their positions,
how to use them,
how to handle the mental aspects.

1835
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:27.800
One theory gets mixed up with many others,

1836
01:51:27.801 --> 01:51:30.290
so it becomes difficult to reach an overall conclusion.

1837
01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:35.180
Even if we link these complicated theories to look at them separately,

1838
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:40.160
the ability to unify them in the end must be the second requirement for broad

1839
01:51:40.161 --> 01:51:42.350
mindedness.
Going to be able to connect things.

1840
01:51:42.351 --> 01:51:43.520
You gotta be able to simplify things.

1841
01:51:47.210 --> 01:51:48.200
This is interesting.

1842
01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.160
There is a teaching in judo competition that says one must look at the

1843
01:51:52.161 --> 01:51:57.161
relationship between oneself and others and one's surroundings.

1844
01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:02.150
So you have to Orient is,
is this his Ooda loop?
Yeah,
the loop.
So you have to,

1845
01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.940
you have to orient yourself to what's happening.

1846
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.040
You have to look around and see what's going on.

1847
01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1848
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:13.530
<v 3>Another one in judo fighting.
There is a teaching Saki,
oh Torah,</v>

1849
01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:16.410
which means anticipate.
Simply put,

1850
01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:21.530
this means using your Waza on your opponent before he can use his Waza on you.

1851
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.390
Boom.
Be Aggressive.
Default aggressive.

1852
01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:28.170
Don't wait for the enemy to do something you do.
At first

1853
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.400
there is another teaching in judo fighting your Cuto Danko and this translates

1854
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:40.540
to decisive action after careful consideration.

1855
01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:44.650
Do Keto means carefully considering the situation before attempting to use a

1856
01:52:44.651 --> 01:52:49.580
Waza.
DANCO means acting without delay.
Once you have made a decision,

1857
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:54.740
when this teaching is applied to the path people take in life,

1858
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:58.460
it can indeed be relevant in many situations.
This is a good one.

1859
01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.540
What do you consider what you're gonna do?
But then once you make a decision,

1860
01:53:02.541 --> 01:53:07.310
you go,
yeah,
you go full speed,
you go full speed.
You always reassess.

1861
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:11.150
You always keep your mind open.
Even when I'm like,
I made a section like,
hey,

1862
01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:12.800
are you know what?
We've debated this enough.
Let's go.

1863
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:15.620
Even when I say that and I'm meeting,
I'm still just making sure.

1864
01:53:15.621 --> 01:53:19.100
I always make sure I'm always reassessing.
Yeah,
and they run to my death.

1865
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:22.520
It seems like he's more talking about like,
don't,
don't,
don't,

1866
01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:25.340
don't make a decision.
Go and then hesitate the whole time.

1867
01:53:25.341 --> 01:53:27.830
That's definitely true.
And also don't sit there and wait to make a decision.

1868
01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:29.413
Make a decision.

1869
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:32.540
But this is what's interesting here is that here's a conscience back to the book

1870
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:34.850
of further teaching,
which seems to be somewhat contrary.

1871
01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.120
Contradictory to Danco is known as toe tomorrow to Koro or Sheider and that

1872
01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:44.900
translates know when to stop.

1873
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:49.490
This means that when you venture to use a Waza up to a certain point,

1874
01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.600
but when you reach that point you might stop again.

1875
01:53:53.601 --> 01:53:58.601
This rule has universal applicant applicability to many aspects of life as well.

1876
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:03.290
So there you go.
You got those two opposing forces.

1877
01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:08.330
One is like go and the other one's like no,
wouldn't to stop.
Yeah,

1878
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.840
so those are,
let's just say very important.

1879
01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:17.450
One of the most important concepts in judo fighting says if you win,

1880
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.450
do not boast of your victory.
If you lose,

1881
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:25.550
do not be discouraged when it is safe.
Do not be careless.
When it is dangerous,

1882
01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:29.090
do not fear simply continued down the path ahead.

1883
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:32.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1884
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.540
<v 3>Right.
Those are normal face,
normal face.
Yes.
Affirmative.</v>

1885
01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:43.060
When encountering social pressures such as those such as those we experienced

1886
01:54:43.061 --> 01:54:43.450
today,

1887
01:54:43.450 --> 01:54:47.500
even an incredibly strong willed person can lose spirit and experience great

1888
01:54:47.501 --> 01:54:49.870
adversity.
This is when we must,

1889
01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:53.170
this is when he must show true character at times like these.

1890
01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:55.780
The ability to overcome difficulties in Durham,

1891
01:54:55.781 --> 01:55:00.610
be patient preserved ones honor and maintain a spirit of integrity are truly

1892
01:55:00.611 --> 01:55:03.310
valuable above all else.

1893
01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:09.150
In order to do this first,

1894
01:55:09.151 --> 01:55:13.000
you must develop good daily habits.
Hmm.

1895
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:17.010
These good habits include simplicity and moderation.

1896
01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:18.420
And while thinking of yourself,

1897
01:55:18.421 --> 01:55:21.900
always keep other people and society as a whole in mind as well.

1898
01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:25.710
You must not trouble others for your own convenience.
And if you can,

1899
01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:29.640
you must try to benefit others while benefiting yourself.
In other words,

1900
01:55:29.641 --> 01:55:31.890
you must protect yourself and contribute to society,

1901
01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.290
which is the ultimate purpose of the study of judo

1902
01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:38.490
and judo is a lot bigger than you thought it was,
is.
Yes,
it is.
Yes sir.

1903
01:55:38.491 --> 01:55:42.030
He's trying to take it to the distance.
Well,

1904
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:48.170
those who want to do something to benefit society must first make sure they can

1905
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:53.310
easily take care of their own business.
Yeah,

1906
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.600
you clean your room.
Yeah.
As Jordan says,

1907
01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.090
take care of your own business.

1908
01:56:00.190 --> 01:56:03.960
Know then you can worry about the rest of society,
like the Oxygen Mask,
right?

1909
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:06.720
You gotta you gotta put it on yourself first,
then you put it on,

1910
01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:08.580
you can handle your kids.
If you're suffocating,

1911
01:56:08.581 --> 01:56:11.400
how are you going to help your kid?
You're not,
you can't hear.

1912
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:12.810
We get a little controversy.

1913
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:16.950
Professional wrestlers and boxers are generally people have low character.

1914
01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.440
Uh,
I dunno if I can say,
oh definitely don't sign on with that.

1915
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.060
And no matter how superior their skills,

1916
01:56:24.061 --> 01:56:27.300
they are mostly looked down on by society.

1917
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.750
I guess we'd have to do some research as to what the boxers and wrestlers were

1918
01:56:30.751 --> 01:56:34.800
like back in his time in Japan.

1919
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:38.370
Some Code Acom members have gained popularity,
popularity,

1920
01:56:38.371 --> 01:56:41.160
performing on tour with them.
But I don't believe this behavior is too,

1921
01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:43.560
is in accord with the aim of judo.

1922
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:48.590
True judo practitioners must not be performers.
So that's there.

1923
01:56:48.591 --> 01:56:52.150
He's going to write that.
Explained to the that he wouldn't like Mcgregor.
No,
no,

1924
01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:56.360
no.
Down upon for sure.
Mcgregor don't care.
No.

1925
01:56:57.170 --> 01:57:00.910
All right.
And this is,
this is again,
I,

1926
01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:04.390
I had to call these things out because obviously I don't agree with Bob

1927
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:06.780
wrestlers and boxers being people with low character.
In fact,

1928
01:57:06.781 --> 01:57:11.040
I believe the opposite of that.
But here's a good one.
In the future,

1929
01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:14.370
when asked to compete against wrestlers or boxers,

1930
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:18.930
the competitors must decide whether the judo practitioners will complete under

1931
01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:21.330
the rules of boxing arrest,
wrestling,

1932
01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:26.550
or whether the opponent will compete under the rules of judo.
However,

1933
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:29.250
those contest must never be commercialized.

1934
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.620
They must be merely trials between volunteers for the purpose of research.

1935
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:39.480
If for some reason showman should get involved,

1936
01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:43.500
people get charged admission and it becomes a spectator sport,

1937
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:48.620
you must recognize that this is in complete violation of the spirit of Kodokan

1938
01:57:49.171 --> 01:57:53.700
judo.
So what about Olympic judo then?
That's,
that's a violation.

1939
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:57.510
Yeah.
I mean,
there's a lot of things you call,
but actually,
you know,
judo,

1940
01:57:57.511 --> 01:58:02.250
gene Lavelle,
he fought,
he fought against a boxer.

1941
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:05.010
My low savage,
1963

1942
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:11.100
and I think it was Denver,
I forget where it was,
but yeah,

1943
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:11.963
that was like,

1944
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:17.060
that's kind of noted as sort of the beginning of like whatever popular MMA,

1945
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:21.960
right?
Boxer versus judoka and judo gene.

1946
01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:25.600
The bell is a American,
um,

1947
01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:30.210
icon.
He's an icon of grappling.
If you don't know who Judith Jean Labella is,

1948
01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:33.510
look him up.
He's awesome.
And he actually,

1949
01:58:33.511 --> 01:58:37.800
so he did this back in the day back in 1963 what do you think the outcome was?

1950
01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:42.400
Boxer versus judo in a fight fight.
They fought.
They fought.

1951
01:58:42.401 --> 01:58:46.150
They fought like in an MMA fight.
I mean it was,
it was,
it was,

1952
01:58:46.151 --> 01:58:49.810
you fight each other.
Let's gene labelle then.
Yeah.
That's doing the bell all day,

1953
01:58:49.811 --> 01:58:53.690
right?
Yeah.
Take down rear naked choke.
That's what he got.
Yeah.

1954
01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:58.360
That's what he got.
That's how it went.
So yeah,

1955
01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:04.480
that's,
you know,
it's just interesting how completely commercialized.

1956
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:07.900
Yeah,
this is,
and it's also interesting that again,

1957
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:11.880
close mindedness or I don't know if you'd call it closed mindedness,
but he,

1958
01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:14.980
he has a very orderly brain.
Yeah.
And he was like,
look,

1959
01:59:14.981 --> 01:59:18.400
it's either going to be those rules or these roles.

1960
01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.470
He didn't think to himself like,
Hey,
you know what?

1961
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:24.040
What if you just mix it up and do it all together?
All rules.
All rules.

1962
01:59:24.130 --> 01:59:25.090
Why wouldn't we do that?

1963
01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.710
Which is interesting because in judo they do cover striking and you don't hear

1964
01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:32.240
about it much,
but they have,
those are part of it.
Hmm.

1965
01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.580
So it's interesting that in his mind he's like,
no,

1966
01:59:34.581 --> 01:59:39.460
it's either of those rules for these roles.
Fairly rigid,
very rigid thinker.

1967
01:59:39.490 --> 01:59:43.780
Yeah.
That's a good point.
Back to the book into everyday Randori practice,

1968
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:47.770
fighting against another person is not the real purpose of the practice of judo,

1969
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:52.600
because fighting to see who will win is interesting.
It is done on a daily basis.

1970
01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:53.770
Yes,
it is.

1971
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:58.810
It goes without saying that becoming able to beat someone is one of the ultimate

1972
01:59:58.811 --> 02:00:00.970
goals of the practice of Randori.
However,

1973
02:00:00.971 --> 02:00:04.210
there's clearly a difference between becoming able to beat someone at a future

1974
02:00:04.211 --> 02:00:07.120
time and becoming obsessed at beating someone now.

1975
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.193
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1976
02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:10.400
<v 3>In order to beat someone now,</v>

1977
02:00:10.401 --> 02:00:14.360
it is best for those who are strong to use that strength to overcome the other

1978
02:00:14.361 --> 02:00:16.520
person's strength.
However,
with that method,

1979
02:00:16.521 --> 02:00:19.640
if you encounter opponent who is much stronger than you are,

1980
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:23.540
you will naturally lose.
So even if you lose for a while,

1981
02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:28.220
the correct practice of Rent Dory is to slip dexterously away from your

1982
02:00:28.221 --> 02:00:30.170
opponent,
adapt to his strength,

1983
02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:32.780
caused him to lose his balance while stepping back and then take advantage of

1984
02:00:32.781 --> 02:00:36.890
the opportunity to perform a Waza.
If you do this kind of training,

1985
02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.930
you will for a while,

1986
02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:43.520
often be twisted by the arm and held down or pushed down by your opponent.

1987
02:00:43.730 --> 02:00:46.430
But if you do not frequently engage in this kind of training,

1988
02:00:46.431 --> 02:00:48.770
you will never learn how to beat a stronger in Ponant.

1989
02:00:48.771 --> 02:00:53.480
So this is what we talk about all the time when we talk about relaxing and

1990
02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:55.700
trying to relax and

1991
02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.190
putting yourself in bad positions and not using your strength.

1992
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:04.660
That's what we're talking about.
And again,
that applies to life as well.

1993
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.040
That applies to

1994
02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:11.140
not staying in your comfort zone,

1995
02:01:11.690 --> 02:01:16.180
not continuing to concentrate on what you're good at.

1996
02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:20.740
Focus on your weaknesses.
That's what that talks about.

1997
02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:23.980
That's interesting.
His how he said don't,

1998
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:28.360
don't be focused on beating the other guy.
You know,

1999
02:01:28.361 --> 02:01:33.070
it's almost like holding or talked about that real briefly when I first met him,

2000
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.820
where he was like,
like,

2001
02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.070
it's not like you're not looking how big the guy is,
how tough he,

2002
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:40.310
what belty

2003
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:44.180
<v 2>has and all this stuff.
It's like you're focusing on,
on your Jujitsu,</v>

2004
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:46.940
what's lacking,
what I know and don't know.
You know,

2005
02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:50.750
if I'm focusing on the other guy and I'm going to beat him and all this stuff,

2006
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:53.670
that's not what,
what the Jujitsu is.
Yeah.
And

2007
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.230
<v 3>I'll go ahead and say this like this is,
this sounds good,</v>

2008
02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.080
but we all,
I mean at least every single person I trained with,

2009
02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.880
like we're trying to,
we're trying to win a voucher.
That being said,
now of the,

2010
02:02:08.881 --> 02:02:12.990
actually I'm going to go in and correct myself,
like we train,
we want to win,

2011
02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:16.500
but like you take way more risks training with our,

2012
02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:19.620
with our training team.
Then you would take,

2013
02:02:19.621 --> 02:02:22.290
if you were training with someone else.
Yeah.
Right.
You take it,
you know,

2014
02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.510
you take rescue,
try new things.
You put yourself in bad positions.

2015
02:02:24.511 --> 02:02:26.160
I'm going to try this.
I'm gonna try this arm lock.

2016
02:02:26.161 --> 02:02:28.110
I'm gonna try this choke even though I might end up on the bottom.

2017
02:02:28.111 --> 02:02:30.240
But that's okay.
Well,
you know what I mean?
So I guess that's true.

2018
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:34.440
I don't focus completely on just trying to beat the other person.
Yeah.
So that's,

2019
02:02:34.441 --> 02:02:39.240
that's actually very accurate.
And I think as you are,
as you start this game,

2020
02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:45.330
that's the best attitude to have is like,
hey,
you got to relax.

2021
02:02:45.331 --> 02:02:48.630
And I was talking to a buddy of mine that's just starting Jujitsu out and he's

2022
02:02:48.631 --> 02:02:53.340
like my age and yeah,
he's like,
man,
I'm trying to relax harder.
She's like,

2023
02:02:53.341 --> 02:02:55.930
I'm trying to relax harder.
And actually what I teach I,

2024
02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.310
I sent him a text and I was like,
it's like rock climbing.

2025
02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:01.380
Have you ever done any rock climbing before?
Yes.

2026
02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:03.540
So there's technique in rock climbing.

2027
02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:08.260
Like there's legit technique obviously.
Well it's not obvious if you,

2028
02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.300
if you've never rock climbed before,

2029
02:03:09.301 --> 02:03:11.220
there's a massive amount of technique and rock climbing.

2030
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.520
It's the way you position your fingers to way position your hands,

2031
02:03:14.521 --> 02:03:15.690
the way you use your legs.
You,

2032
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:18.600
you don't hang the weight on your muscles and you hang it on your,

2033
02:03:18.730 --> 02:03:22.050
your bones and your ligaments so you're not getting tired.

2034
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.960
Your muscles aren't getting tired out because you're using the technique.

2035
02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:28.170
If you don't know rock climbing,
guess what you do.

2036
02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:31.500
You hang on to the freaking rock with all your muscle and as long as you can.

2037
02:03:31.501 --> 02:03:34.800
And that's exactly what happens in Jujitsu when your technique is good,

2038
02:03:34.801 --> 02:03:37.740
you're just going to hang on.
Yeah,
hang on.

2039
02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:39.830
<v 2>That he,
the whole thing about do,</v>

2040
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:44.831
you just didn't winning and he and he used the word obsessed like little bit of

2041
02:03:45.821 --> 02:03:49.540
a different scenario.
And really when you really look at it,
I mean in the moment,

2042
02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:51.060
yeah,
you want to beat the guy like that.

2043
02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:54.490
That's when you train with someone in Jujitsu or especially when you compete in

2044
02:03:54.491 --> 02:03:57.040
Jiu Jitsu.
That's actually where the shift kinda occurs.

2045
02:03:57.220 --> 02:04:01.150
He mentioned competition as not a spectator sport.

2046
02:04:01.151 --> 02:04:05.140
This is just for experimental purposes or did he research research and research

2047
02:04:05.141 --> 02:04:08.510
purposes,
which is essentially just training really.
So say sure.

2048
02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:09.760
It's kind of like,
um,

2049
02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.690
kind of how when they started the first of UFC that was what they are kind of

2050
02:04:13.691 --> 02:04:16.060
pushing to.
They're like,
we're going to see how,

2051
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:20.020
what martial art style exactly right.
And,
but really,
you know the,

2052
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:23.290
the thing that people came to see was that for sure,

2053
02:04:23.770 --> 02:04:27.580
but it was a show like who's going to win and all this stuff and when you really

2054
02:04:27.581 --> 02:04:31.060
look at it,
so you'll see one,
two,
all these things.
It was,

2055
02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.500
I don't want to say rare,
but it was almost rare when,
aside from hoists,

2056
02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:38.400
Gracie of course,
and you Ken shamrock and stuff like this,

2057
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.420
it was really rare to see the style get maintained.

2058
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:45.850
It was like these crazy guys and they had their stents and the fight with cross

2059
02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.850
street fight.
Yeah,
exactly right.
So,

2060
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.820
and that was part of the research kind of kind of thing.
But you know,

2061
02:04:50.821 --> 02:04:52.770
people were there to see who's going to kick his ass.

2062
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:58.140
But in Jiu Jitsu when you really,
when you really think about it,

2063
02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:02.750
we are kind of maintaining that.
Like we want to say like we're,

2064
02:05:02.770 --> 02:05:06.640
we're researching all the time.
Yeah.
And use and you can,

2065
02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.320
you can fall back and forth.

2066
02:05:08.321 --> 02:05:11.890
Like sometimes you can get sucked into being obsessed with beating that guy and

2067
02:05:11.891 --> 02:05:15.550
maybe if you kind of use it,
you know,
it's like using anger to help you,

2068
02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.400
I don't know,
get more strength of something just for a moment or whatever they,

2069
02:05:18.401 --> 02:05:19.870
I,
I kind of think that's okay.

2070
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:21.610
And I think we all kind of do it in one way or another.

2071
02:05:21.611 --> 02:05:25.240
Not the anger thing necessarily,
but that I'm going to like me and you,

2072
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:28.780
for example,
I might incorporate a little bit today,

2073
02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:32.530
so I'm going to get Jocko today.
That's what I'm kind of focused on for a second.

2074
02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.600
Yeah,
yeah.
For a second to help me get better.

2075
02:05:34.601 --> 02:05:37.480
Maybe even give me pass a mental barrier or something like that and you know,

2076
02:05:37.481 --> 02:05:40.390
you can do it,
but the big picture is just what he's talking about.

2077
02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:42.580
I just want to get better at my job to kind of thing.

2078
02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:47.240
<v 3>I will say this too.
I Ego wise,</v>

2079
02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:52.920
I think it's very positive to be like,
yeah,
I don't want to lose and,

2080
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:56.020
and the only way you're not going to lose is to train all the time.
Yeah.

2081
02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:59.900
So the days,
the days that you're like,
well,
you know,
I don't,

2082
02:05:59.901 --> 02:06:04.460
like yesterday I was on a different time zone came back.
It was,

2083
02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:08.300
I got back in the day.
I had work to do.
As soon as I hit the ground,

2084
02:06:08.630 --> 02:06:12.260
I got done with that.
I hit a quick workout and now it's like,
oh,

2085
02:06:12.261 --> 02:06:15.900
it's guess what time it is.
Just through time.
And I'm like,
well,
you know,

2086
02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:19.430
I was like,
oh well,
you know,
maybe it's been a long day.

2087
02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:24.090
My shoulder kind of hurts right now,
so maybe I'll just,
you know,
breath.

2088
02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:28.550
Then I was like,
no,
can we go to train?
Because,

2089
02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:30.980
because what I know is not training,

2090
02:06:32.650 --> 02:06:36.410
this is not training.
One day might not make a difference,

2091
02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.170
but that one day does make a difference.
You might not,

2092
02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.820
you might tell yourself it doesn't make a difference,
but there's,

2093
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:44.390
there's something in there.
It was every day of training you can get matters.

2094
02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.200
Everyday counts.
You can't get it back and if you miss it,
you miss it.

2095
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:51.380
Especially like right now,
I've been traveling a lot lately,

2096
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:56.330
weigh more than normal,
so I know like if I got to get there,

2097
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:59.270
you want to get my rounds in gotta get my rounds it.

2098
02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:03.700
That's the way it's got to be.
And part of that is my ego,
but others,

2099
02:07:03.710 --> 02:07:07.250
my ego saying,
look,
I gotta I got to fight,

2100
02:07:07.251 --> 02:07:08.780
I got to struggle to be stay on top.

2101
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:11.220
We've got to stay on top of the mountain as high as I can.

2102
02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:16.520
Hungry young bucks are out there.
They're coming after me.
Yes,
I appreciate that.

2103
02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:20.690
But that keeps me in check my ego.

2104
02:07:20.691 --> 02:07:22.880
The positive part of ego is that I do.

2105
02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:27.620
I do want to win and I don't want to get beat.
Now that being said,

2106
02:07:27.621 --> 02:07:28.460
guess who I trained with?

2107
02:07:28.461 --> 02:07:31.070
I trained with all the guys that are most likely to beat me.
That's what I want.

2108
02:07:31.071 --> 02:07:33.830
I want to have that happen.
So there's a balance.
There's a good balance there.

2109
02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:36.100
<v 2>And at the end of the,
there's really no</v>

2110
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.340
<v 3>escape it.
And I think it's real prevalent like for you and dean and the,</v>

2111
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:44.260
it's really prevalent where sure you have all that,
you have all those thoughts,

2112
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:45.610
you know,
in your head or whatever.

2113
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:48.850
But it all comes to the whole reason you have that thought is to get better at

2114
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:52.810
at judiciary for sure.
It's,
yeah,
cause when you start Jujitsu you like,

2115
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:54.970
some people see me like,
well you know,
I'll just,

2116
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:58.210
I just want to get good enough to like,
you know,
be able to defend myself.
Well,

2117
02:07:58.211 --> 02:08:02.290
after six months,
man,
you're good.
So what am I doing here?
25 years later,

2118
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:05.830
we're still during the same there.
Cause like there's a couple of guys that I,

2119
02:08:05.890 --> 02:08:10.690
well I,
you know,
I want to keep ahead of or even with or catch,
you know,

2120
02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:12.340
like that's what's driving this.
So there's,

2121
02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:15.820
there's a definite ego thing involved.
Uh,
but

2122
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:21.190
I think the,
where that goes too far,
the ego goes too far.

2123
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:24.220
This is obvious answer is like,
oh,
I don't really,
you don't want me to,

2124
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:27.370
I'm not going to train with that guy cause he might catch me right then.

2125
02:08:27.371 --> 02:08:28.990
Now you're not,
you're not progressing.

2126
02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.520
Now you're in this thing that he's talking about.

2127
02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:32.410
Like you're not going to progress because you're not going to train with that

2128
02:08:32.411 --> 02:08:34.840
person or you're not going to take any risks whatsoever.

2129
02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:36.880
So you're just going to defend,
defend,
and you like,
oh,

2130
02:08:36.881 --> 02:08:39.450
I survived the round and I'm out of here.
Yeah.
So you gotta,

2131
02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:44.650
you gotta keep that attitude of like,
Hey,
I'm going to get beat.
And you know,

2132
02:08:44.651 --> 02:08:47.200
that's a thing.
Jiu Jitsu works,
man.
Yeah.
Did you do it works.

2133
02:08:47.201 --> 02:08:50.680
And if somebody catches you,
doesn't matter who they are,
if they catch you,

2134
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:53.260
Jujitsu works your tap out,
you go again.

2135
02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:55.960
That's the beautiful thing about Jujitsu.
That's the beautiful thing about life.

2136
02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:59.080
Because in life,
you're not going to win every time you're going to call it.

2137
02:08:59.081 --> 02:09:01.240
You're gonna make mistakes.
Someone's going to capitalize on them.

2138
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:03.220
So what are you going to do?
You're going to give up.

2139
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:06.730
And even more important than that you can lose,

2140
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.550
you can lose is whatever thing you're trying to do,

2141
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:11.440
you can lose your trying to start a new business.

2142
02:09:11.441 --> 02:09:16.000
You can lose your trying to get a new job,
you can lose,
you can lose in life.

2143
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:19.870
So are you going to prevent that from even getting let that prevent you from

2144
02:09:19.871 --> 02:09:21.370
even getting on the mat in the first place?

2145
02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.440
Aren't even trying to start a new business.
Even trying to,

2146
02:09:23.770 --> 02:09:28.300
trying to do something that's outside your comfort zone.
That's what this,

2147
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:32.380
that's what this is saying is get outside of your comfort zone.
Don't sit there.

2148
02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:36.400
It's not going to help you.
Yeah,
and you can see it with,

2149
02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.360
with the guys who you can tell are just focused on like being the guy who beat

2150
02:09:40.361 --> 02:09:43.150
the other guy and kind of thing.
Then they'll do those kinds of things.

2151
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:47.360
They'll roll and then when they,
after two,
three rounds,
when they're,

2152
02:09:47.361 --> 02:09:49.090
they feel their steam kind of going down.

2153
02:09:49.091 --> 02:09:52.000
They'll leave or they'll sit on the side and talk to me like I'm not rolling

2154
02:09:52.001 --> 02:09:55.180
anymore.
Or the only rule of small guys did that to Andy yesterday.

2155
02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:59.560
What we did like six rounds and I was like,
Brian,
he's a backup cause you know,

2156
02:09:59.561 --> 02:10:04.000
he's training for events.
You know,
like I,
I'm,
I'm going to give a,
I was like,
hey,

2157
02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:08.380
I called Doctor Luke,
I'm like,
Doctor Luke,
give me some help over here.

2158
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:12.840
I need some backup.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,
cause got to,

2159
02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:14.170
got to get him to step it up.

2160
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:19.550
But what's interesting or what's the reality is when I have the time or when I'm

2161
02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:24.310
not,
when I at the time,
but like I always get my rounds to like we're doing,

2162
02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:27.700
if we've got two guys that are competing and we're doing two in one out,

2163
02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.430
like I put them through it and then I go through it too.

2164
02:10:30.490 --> 02:10:32.590
Cause I want to get my training cause I'm trying to get better too.

2165
02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:34.070
To your point.
Yeah.
You're

2166
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:38.030
<v 2>not in there trying to be dandy drinking.
I'm trying to get better.
Yeah.</v>

2167
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:42.880
And that's exactly what I mean.
And it's obvious,
you know.
Uh,
but you know,

2168
02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:45.860
you know,
it's a big symptom of someone who's,

2169
02:10:45.861 --> 02:10:49.940
who's focusing on the wrong thing is like if they don't do well or whatever,

2170
02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:53.690
and they say stuff like,
Oh,
you're lucky this isn't MMA or something like that.

2171
02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:58.130
They're like,
they're unhappy about the fact that they got by,
you know,

2172
02:10:58.730 --> 02:11:02.470
like I used to train with sky will remain nameless,
uh,
long time ago.

2173
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:06.410
And that's what he'd always say.
Like,
Oh yeah,
if there was strikes,

2174
02:11:06.411 --> 02:11:09.260
I would have one kind of thing.
He'd say that kind of stuff all the time.

2175
02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:11.690
I was like,
Bro,
focusing on the wrong thing right now.

2176
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:15.470
The fact that you quote unquote got beat or I beat you and this is how you would

2177
02:11:15.471 --> 02:11:17.270
have beat me.
You know,
you're focusing on the wrong thing.

2178
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:19.930
<v 0>Why do you think I do?
Cause I do this.</v>

2179
02:11:20.410 --> 02:11:25.150
How do the opposite when I roll with someone and I'll be like,
hey,

2180
02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:28.540
you know,
like I'll catch him or whatever.
I'll be like,
yeah,
you know,
hey,

2181
02:11:28.541 --> 02:11:29.320
if this was MMA,

2182
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.120
like let's say I'm going to their member of harder to catch them,
I'll be like,

2183
02:11:31.121 --> 02:11:33.320
hey,
you know,
if this is MMA,
you know,
you're on top for a while.
You'd been,

2184
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:34.870
you'd have been pounded me in the face.
I would have been good.

2185
02:11:34.871 --> 02:11:35.830
You would have one more.

2186
02:11:35.831 --> 02:11:38.050
If I'm going against [inaudible] guy and to catch him or something,
I'll be like,

2187
02:11:38.051 --> 02:11:39.800
yeah,
you know though,
if that was points though,
you were up

2188
02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.540
<v 2>like eight points,
you probably would have beat me.
And that was uh,</v>

2189
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:46.190
that took me 15 minutes to get.
So you would have won.
Yeah.
And See,
I obviously,

2190
02:11:46.191 --> 02:11:47.480
I don't know exactly what's going on in your head,

2191
02:11:47.481 --> 02:11:51.590
but it seems like that would be something you'd say to someone to make them kind

2192
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:55.610
of feel better.
Cause you know,
it's a little mini competition in there for real.

2193
02:11:55.611 --> 02:11:58.430
I mean that's essentially what makes it so good because he's giving you an

2194
02:11:58.431 --> 02:12:03.260
accurate look how in a motivated opponent attack or whatever would look like

2195
02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.210
when he's going full speed again too.

2196
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:08.450
So there is that element of like we're competing against each other and when you

2197
02:12:08.451 --> 02:12:10.040
lose this kind of like,
oh,
I lost to this guy,

2198
02:12:10.041 --> 02:12:13.670
especially if you're not that used to training or,
or so I'm just being nice.

2199
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:17.990
You're being nice I think.
And at the same time if you're saying stuff like,
hey,

2200
02:12:17.991 --> 02:12:20.480
if this was MMA,
you'd be pounding me,
or something like that,

2201
02:12:20.481 --> 02:12:23.030
that there could be a little element of your own training.

2202
02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:27.710
Kind of like you're just voicing your thoughts.
I kept that in mind where,

2203
02:12:27.711 --> 02:12:28.544
you know,

2204
02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:31.850
I have got hit there and you're just kind of voicing it maybe for the benefit of

2205
02:12:31.851 --> 02:12:35.880
yourself as well as the guy.
I don't know that that's what it seems like.
Um,

2206
02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:38.000
what happened if someone was thinking those things,

2207
02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:42.960
<v 0>check,
well,
you know,
that's,
we could go on this book for a long time.</v>

2208
02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:46.980
I think that's a good place to,
um,
reflect and say,
look,

2209
02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:50.670
there's a lot of principles that you can apply.
Judo and Jujitsu.

2210
02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:54.150
There's things that Jujitsu should,

2211
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:57.510
you should take from Jujitsu and things that you should take from judo

2212
02:12:57.690 --> 02:13:00.570
principles.
And if you mix those two together,

2213
02:13:00.571 --> 02:13:01.950
you start get something that's really powerful,

2214
02:13:01.951 --> 02:13:06.330
not just on the mat but something that's really powerful to apply to your life.

2215
02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:11.130
Again,
is everything in this theories?
Perfect.
No.

2216
02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:13.260
Somebody asked me that the other day.

2217
02:13:13.261 --> 02:13:18.120
I was with a group of young leaders and someone,

2218
02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:20.610
cause I was talking about how it's beneficial to read about history and

2219
02:13:20.611 --> 02:13:21.990
understand warfare and understanding.

2220
02:13:21.991 --> 02:13:24.450
It gives you an insight into human nature and gives you an insight into people,

2221
02:13:24.451 --> 02:13:26.640
the way people think and all the stuff.
And this guy says,
Hey,

2222
02:13:26.641 --> 02:13:30.750
do you ever think that maybe what you read was,

2223
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:34.980
and if you apply what,
what was you read?

2224
02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:39.030
You'll actually end up making a mistake or do you just follow what you know,

2225
02:13:39.031 --> 02:13:42.780
history?
And I'm like,
no.
That's the whole reason I go.
Because the more you read,

2226
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.580
the more you understand the more different angles you see.

2227
02:13:44.581 --> 02:13:46.200
And I'm questioning every decision I make.

2228
02:13:46.201 --> 02:13:49.590
I'm questioning all these things all the time and I'm using all these different

2229
02:13:49.591 --> 02:13:54.300
information that I have in my head as sounding boards to check off of like what

2230
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:57.420
it will.
At least let me shed some light on it.
Gather some intelligence.

2231
02:13:57.870 --> 02:14:00.930
That's what,
that's what I'm trying to do.
So yeah,

2232
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:03.360
question yourself and question these theories.

2233
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:05.760
That's what I think that's one of the best things about,

2234
02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:12.090
it's one of the best things about MMA in Jujitsu and fighting right now is that

2235
02:14:12.091 --> 02:14:16.680
it's evolving so fast and,
and it's open for it.

2236
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:20.520
And if you're not down for that right now,
you're going to be left in the dust.

2237
02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:21.780
You're going to be left in the dust.

2238
02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:26.010
Does this mean that every fancy new movie that comes out should be applied to

2239
02:14:26.011 --> 02:14:27.810
your game?
No.
It doesn't mean that at all.

2240
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:31.950
Does it mean that every fancy guid Jujitsu move that you saw in worlds would be

2241
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:35.490
super effective in a fist fight?
No.
It doesn't mean that at all.

2242
02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:39.000
But should you have an open mind to understand that some of those things could

2243
02:14:39.001 --> 02:14:42.540
be absolutely beneficial and yes,
you definitely should.

2244
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:46.500
So keep an open mind with everything that you're doing.
You know,

2245
02:14:46.501 --> 02:14:48.060
that idea of broad mindedness,

2246
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:50.990
sometimes I wish Canaan would've had a little bit more broad mindedness.
Yeah.

2247
02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:54.200
Cause that w you know,
it would have been beneficial.
You know,

2248
02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:56.220
that's one of the sad things about judo as they,

2249
02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.540
they outlawed the double leg take down in judo,
you can't do it.

2250
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:04.650
You can do it after you've done another take down attempt.

2251
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:09.450
So it can be like a follow on.
Gotcha.
But that's not cool.
That's not cool.

2252
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:11.970
And it's the same thing with,
with Jujitsu,
right?

2253
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.200
When they outlaw certain submissions like uh,
the,

2254
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:19.530
the heel hook with Gi Jujitsu.
Yeah.
Right.
Like the heel hook is still there.

2255
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:23.550
The heel hook itself is still there in the,

2256
02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.330
in the the motion of,
yeah,
it's there.
You shouldn't,

2257
02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:30.870
I'll lock it should be part of it because then you have people ending up in

2258
02:15:30.871 --> 02:15:33.330
positions where they're not effective fighting positions.

2259
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:35.340
They're not because you can get healed,
he'll come to you,

2260
02:15:35.341 --> 02:15:36.720
get your knee rip torn apart.

2261
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:40.800
So why would you outlaw something that's very effective?
It's,
it's,

2262
02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:45.060
I understand there is some danger in the heel hook for those of you that don't

2263
02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:45.151
know,

2264
02:15:45.151 --> 02:15:48.510
the danger of the heel hook is that it doesn't create pain before it creates

2265
02:15:48.511 --> 02:15:49.980
industry in injury.
Well,

2266
02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:53.880
it doesn't create a lot of pain before it creates industry in injury.

2267
02:15:54.150 --> 02:15:56.850
So you can fee,
you can have a heel hook on you and it can be like,

2268
02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:00.030
oh I can get out of this and the person starts applying pressure and you like,

2269
02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:02.660
oh that doesn't really hurt.
And then pop your,
get your,

2270
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:05.940
you have to go get surgery.
Now that's the problem with heel hooks.

2271
02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.900
But if you and your training partners understand that and if competitors

2272
02:16:09.901 --> 02:16:11.730
understood like,
hey,
if I get caught here,

2273
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:16.180
I'm going to end up in surgery if I don't tap.
So that's the,

2274
02:16:16.190 --> 02:16:17.160
if you understand that,

2275
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:20.190
then you won't go in these positions that where you're exposed to heal hook.

2276
02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:24.810
So that's what you should do.
Not only with Jujitsu,

2277
02:16:24.811 --> 02:16:27.540
but you should do with life to like understand what really works.

2278
02:16:27.541 --> 02:16:30.220
Don't outlaw things,
don't things just because

2279
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:32.860
<v 4>you're not good at them.
Yeah,
open yourself up to them.</v>

2280
02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:35.770
Do you know why they don't?

2281
02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:40.150
They really don't allow heel hooks and geek competition.
Do you know?

2282
02:16:40.151 --> 02:16:43.150
Why are you asking me that question now?
The reason that they say,

2283
02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.670
I think it's because the,
the possibility of injury.
Yeah.

2284
02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.020
Then no Nogi they let it lie cause you can slide more than,
I don't know.

2285
02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:54.520
I think that's,
I think that might be just tradition.
But hopefully,
you know,

2286
02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:56.650
they should allow double leg take downs and judo.

2287
02:16:56.651 --> 02:17:00.670
They should allow heel hooks and Jujitsu and engage you Jitsu.

2288
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.210
Now this doesn't mean if you were all with me and we're rolling,
Gee,

2289
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:09.270
you just slap a heal hook on me because I won't be expecting that and I'll be

2290
02:17:09.491 --> 02:17:14.350
pissed or that should be part of your training.
Yeah.
And so congratulations.

2291
02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:17.620
It is,
but yeah,
I guess you're right.
I need to tighten it up.
Yeah,

2292
02:17:17.621 --> 02:17:19.110
I would say that is one of those things.

2293
02:17:19.111 --> 02:17:22.050
Here's what it is with the hill with Geek,
like if someone busts,

2294
02:17:22.170 --> 02:17:26.610
cause it's so widely known as,
as uh,
uh,
district loud.
Yeah.

2295
02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:30.160
It's like if you get a guy,
especially let's say extreme scenario,

2296
02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:34.360
a new guy comes in,
he's a purple belt,
hungry blue belt.

2297
02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.380
He comes in,
he rolls with,
you know,
one of the instructors,

2298
02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:39.040
black belt or whatever it [inaudible],
you know,

2299
02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.700
they're rolling and he's going super hard and he goes for a heel hook.

2300
02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.710
Pause right there.
Technically,

2301
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:51.100
the Wa as far as what we're talking about,
that should be okay.

2302
02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:53.800
We're all here training,
we're all getting better.
He's going hard.

2303
02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:57.110
Thank thanks for the good training kind of thing he did.

2304
02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:02.340
But we're essentially trained to see heel hooks with the is as disrespectful.

2305
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:05.530
It's against the rules.
It's so embedded in,

2306
02:18:05.531 --> 02:18:07.270
it's like it's embedded in the culture really.

2307
02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:12.310
But really as far as what we're talking about,
like it's really okay,

2308
02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:17.020
you know?
Yeah,
he's muscle.
I'll look,
I'll say no,
that's not okay.

2309
02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:21.770
And the reason I'm saying that
trajectory for me because,

2310
02:18:22.090 --> 02:18:25.120
but this is the similar thing,
right?
If you,

2311
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:30.010
if you came into the gym and like you went for,
he'll hook on me.

2312
02:18:30.011 --> 02:18:34.060
We were trying to g and I started punching in the face,
right?
That like,

2313
02:18:34.061 --> 02:18:36.250
like you weren't expecting that,
but you should be prepared for it.

2314
02:18:36.610 --> 02:18:41.260
So there is fires.
If you understand that that's what you're training like,
oh,

2315
02:18:41.261 --> 02:18:45.060
are we street rules,
punches legal allowed to what I'm saying?
There's,

2316
02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:49.150
there's certain things that are universally,
as far as I,

2317
02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.720
I have not been anywhere and I talked to a lot of district people and I wrote a

2318
02:18:52.721 --> 02:18:55.450
lot of different genes to places where it's like you're wearing a geek.
You're,

2319
02:18:55.451 --> 02:18:57.560
it's,
you're,
you're cleared hot to do heal hooks.
Yeah.

2320
02:18:57.610 --> 02:19:01.210
I have not seen that anywhere.
Me Neither.
And it should be that way.
Well,

2321
02:19:01.211 --> 02:19:05.070
I mean tech,
the thing is I'm with you and they,
you know,

2322
02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.310
there's exceptions of course.

2323
02:19:06.311 --> 02:19:10.960
And just because I happened is Craig Craig Baker will allow,
I didn't even say,

2324
02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:14.470
yeah,
you can heal hook.
It doesn't come up because just like you were saying,

2325
02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:17.320
it's so widely known and understood from the beginning.

2326
02:19:17.590 --> 02:19:20.680
You don't do heal hooks with the geek.
It's just,
but why is that?

2327
02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:23.060
We don't really think about why is that and does it.

2328
02:19:23.090 --> 02:19:27.760
We won't miss those are the thinker recognized sanctioned rules.
Right.

2329
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:28.100
Just

2330
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.740
<v 2>like the recognized sanction rules say that if we're grappling,</v>

2331
02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.310
I'm not going to start punching you in the face.
No,
but no,

2332
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.530
because that's punching in the face and not grappling.

2333
02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:40.970
Like if he it punching in the face does deviate from when you,

2334
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.140
when you start learning did you to,

2335
02:19:42.170 --> 02:19:45.260
unless it's understood that that's the kind of training you're going to get.

2336
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:48.020
So here's the thing.
Okay.
When I put on the geese,
these rules,

2337
02:19:48.050 --> 02:19:51.590
these moves are not allowed,
right?
There's no,

2338
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:56.810
I don't know.
There's no rules.
I mean,
sure Ibj JF,
but you know,
months.

2339
02:19:57.130 --> 02:20:00.490
This is probably bigger percentage of people that did.

2340
02:20:00.491 --> 02:20:03.950
You do to have never competed in IBG DF tournament.
Probably the majority,

2341
02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.790
the people,
yet we're following.
I'd be GGF rules in training sometimes.

2342
02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.520
Even though actually the geek competitions,

2343
02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:14.110
I've never heard of a competition that allows heel hooks even at Pacific bell.

2344
02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.410
But that's not the point.
The point isn't that they're not allowed,

2345
02:20:18.411 --> 02:20:21.020
so don't do them.
That's not the point.
The point is why are they not allowed?

2346
02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:24.560
Given what we're just talking about there,
in my opinion,

2347
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:29.550
they're not allowed because of the propensity or possibility of an injury or I

2348
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:33.620
people think that there's a high possibility buddy you could get injured.

2349
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:34.130
They're,

2350
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:39.050
they're somewhat accurate because it is a different kind of pain or it was a

2351
02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:41.990
lack of pain and so there's a little bit accuracy.
Yeah,

2352
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:47.050
I dig it and I see if I split specially if that is true as far as why they want

2353
02:20:47.721 --> 02:20:47.900
it.

2354
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:52.760
Because some people might say they'd want it because Jiu Jitsu was,

2355
02:20:52.970 --> 02:20:55.970
was always looked at as this linear thing.
Like Don,
Don,

2356
02:20:55.971 --> 02:20:59.090
her mentioned kind of mentioned part of this where you know,

2357
02:20:59.110 --> 02:21:02.960
you get past the legs and you work your way up his body to tap them out and you

2358
02:21:02.961 --> 02:21:07.400
can start tapping them out when you get up to the upper body and the legs were

2359
02:21:07.401 --> 02:21:10.350
just something you had to get past because they're going to try to kick you and

2360
02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:13.310
you know,
they have leverage on their own body and all this stuff and that's it.

2361
02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:15.890
That's traditionally how we look at Jujitsu and that's the effectiveness.

2362
02:21:15.891 --> 02:21:19.880
Did you just do this?
This is the best in all this stuff.
Now you get,
you know,

2363
02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:23.900
a new person or someone from sambal or whatever.
We'll come in and be like,

2364
02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:28.580
oh that's Jujitsu or let me go ahead and kind of flip it upside down a little

2365
02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:30.890
bit and change what this Jujitsu and they're like,

2366
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:32.840
we don't like that kind of thing.
Yeah.

2367
02:21:32.841 --> 02:21:36.440
That could be why I'm just saying that's what it could be.
Why,

2368
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:38.270
let me ask you this.
I have,

2369
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:42.530
I have heard like that people's initial reaction,

2370
02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:45.350
I think I've heard dean say this,
like if your reaction is like,

2371
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:49.730
oh that's not good for my game,
we'll just outlawed.
Yeah.

2372
02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:54.190
That's what it resulted in.
Cause all Jujitsu guys are training.
This was,

2373
02:21:55.220 --> 02:21:57.260
hey do a double leg,

2374
02:21:57.261 --> 02:22:00.300
take downs are not good for judo against the rest.

2375
02:22:00.301 --> 02:22:04.220
Or you've got someone that's been wrestling for 27 years and they come and do a

2376
02:22:04.221 --> 02:22:07.460
new judo competition.
They hit a double leg.
It's not good for the judo player.

2377
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:11.000
Yeah.
There's two guys.
What kind of thing?
And so guess what outlaw.
Yeah.

2378
02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:14.540
Which is a bummer.
Right?
And so yeah,
I'm not,
I'm not pro outlawing.

2379
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:18.500
It was the ultimate point there.
That's what I heard of.
So let me ask you this.

2380
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:21.390
Do you think in training who hooks with the gate?

2381
02:22:21.391 --> 02:22:26.100
Just you personally you think they should be allowed?
He looks with

2382
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.730
<v 4>the key.
I think they should be allowed every time.
All the time.
Everywhere,</v>

2383
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:32.670
but they are not right now.

2384
02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:36.300
And therefore in my mentality is like okay,

2385
02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:40.680
because I'm not going to put myself a new position that a heel hook is available

2386
02:22:40.681 --> 02:22:43.500
to you unless I know that they're not available.
Exactly.
Yeah I did.

2387
02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:45.990
And I dig it and actually I agree that's the same thing.
Like,

2388
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:50.370
like if we were going to roll and I just did it,
no good.
But if I said hey,

2389
02:22:50.430 --> 02:22:53.580
before we rolled like one,
we're walking there or even right before we kind of,

2390
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.730
you know,
shook hands whenever they said,
hey,
heel hooks are a go,

2391
02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:01.020
that would change the game.
Yeah,
we change the game for sure.
Okay.
So,
same thing,

2392
02:23:01.021 --> 02:23:03.990
like if you're doing Nogi and you know guys like they just don't know or

2393
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:06.810
whatever and they'll grab your shorts,
they'll grab your shirt,

2394
02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:10.170
rash guard or whatever,
they'll grab it,
you know,
cause they just don't know.

2395
02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.470
Even if it's the same deal,
less dangerous of course,

2396
02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:15.090
but same deal where it's like when you start doing that,

2397
02:23:15.091 --> 02:23:18.210
then they'll stop and be like,
Hey,
you can't do that kind of thing.

2398
02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:22.680
But if you say before you roll,
hey yeah,
you can grab shorts,
whatever up to you,

2399
02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:24.420
just don't pull him off or something like that.

2400
02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:26.850
It's kind of one of those deals you could I guess,

2401
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:30.810
make some ad hoc rules before you start rolling.
But yeah,

2402
02:23:31.350 --> 02:23:33.870
we're just go with what's universally accepted at this time.

2403
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:37.950
Slaps in the face or illegal.
Sometimes it's cool,
whatever.

2404
02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:41.340
All right.
Well like I said,

2405
02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:44.010
a lot of stuff to learn from

2406
02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:51.800
judo and Jujitsu to make yourself better in those sports and in life.

2407
02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:57.870
So good.
Yeah,
the I,

2408
02:23:58.530 --> 02:24:01.950
I was actually pretty,
I don't want to say impressed,

2409
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:05.090
but pretty impressed with the whole book.
Yeah.

2410
02:24:05.250 --> 02:24:08.820
Except for the part about telling people how to eat,
telling people how to eat,

2411
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:13.950
uh,
the calisthenics or no good.
Yeah.
Be In buff is a waste of time.

2412
02:24:14.170 --> 02:24:16.810
There's definitely some,
and I used some truth to that.

2413
02:24:17.250 --> 02:24:19.680
It's weird because as I'm preparing the podcast,
I'm like,
okay,

2414
02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:24.450
do I just say the things in here that I agree with?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2415
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:26.310
Cause that's one way I could do it.
Do I?

2416
02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:30.930
Because one thing that's I was thinking about when I read a quote from a book,

2417
02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:34.800
people do,
they kind of think like,
well I agree with that.

2418
02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:39.900
Like I support this unless I outwardly just reject it.

2419
02:24:40.650 --> 02:24:43.350
And I kind of did half of the book where I was like,
well,
you know,

2420
02:24:43.351 --> 02:24:46.350
I don't really talk about that because I see where he's coming from,

2421
02:24:46.351 --> 02:24:49.860
but that's not really my gig.
And then I got to other parts of,
I was like,

2422
02:24:49.861 --> 02:24:52.680
I have to talk about the fact that he thinks that this stuff is,
you know,

2423
02:24:52.681 --> 02:24:56.280
this is a completely different than what I think,
you know.
So,
yeah,

2424
02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:59.190
I guess I try to explain myself as I talk about it.
But yeah,
there's,

2425
02:24:59.191 --> 02:25:02.100
there's definitely some things that,
that I don't agree with.

2426
02:25:02.101 --> 02:25:04.200
There's some things that I don't agree with about,
about judo.

2427
02:25:04.201 --> 02:25:07.470
Like do you know there's things that I don't agree with about Jujitsu.

2428
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:10.920
I think that's why I think there's a good mixture of the two that would be very

2429
02:25:10.921 --> 02:25:15.490
powerful.
We need to bring Dave camera on,
you know,

2430
02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.590
some of these other guys that have grown up in judo and are savage at Jujitsu.

2431
02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:24.620
Okay.
So anyway.
Cool.
Well speaking of,
you know,

2432
02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.510
getting better in Jujitsu and getting better in life.
Sure.

2433
02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:33.910
Any suggestions on how people could get better?
So when you get,

2434
02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:37.480
when you start doing Jujitsu,
okay.
And g you're going to get,

2435
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:39.340
that's probably one of the one,
two,

2436
02:25:39.341 --> 02:25:43.900
three maybe four questions you're going to have the first four we'll kind of get

2437
02:25:43.901 --> 02:25:48.170
your,
get you get,
that's going to be one of them.
That's my guess.
That's my uh,

2438
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.840
prediction.
Um,
shoot,
you can be in Jujitsu and still say,

2439
02:25:52.841 --> 02:25:57.690
hey gee,
should I get,
you know,
new Geek,
whatever.
Anyway.
Cause the answer origin,

2440
02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:58.690
you get an origin geek.

2441
02:25:58.810 --> 02:26:03.810
That's what you do because they are factually factually see how rigid and being

2442
02:26:05.561 --> 02:26:09.160
right there factually the best.
Gies they're all made in America by the way.

2443
02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:12.490
Different types of bees there.
They got some new stuff.
By the way,

2444
02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.460
Pete just sent me some new stuff.
It's not that new.

2445
02:26:15.461 --> 02:26:19.870
They're just different styles.
It's not geese.
It's what I get some sweats.

2446
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:22.060
Oh,
okay.
Which happened to them.

2447
02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:26.900
Happened to be the most comfortable sweats in my experience.

2448
02:26:26.930 --> 02:26:28.870
You new stuff and he sent it to me.
Sorry Bro.

2449
02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:33.300
You know something must be joggers told me are and they're,
you know,

2450
02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:36.820
they're really good.
But nonetheless back to the geese.
Um,
yeah.

2451
02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.800
Get them@originmain.com.
That's a good one.
To support yourself.
Support this huge,

2452
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:46.360
it's support life support America.
America.

2453
02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.020
Because they're made in America.
Yup.
From the dirt to this shirt,

2454
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:55.210
which means a shirt that cotton that is grown in America gets turns into ag

2455
02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.000
somehow.
Pete does that part.
Isn't it?

2456
02:26:58.001 --> 02:27:02.960
Kind of cool to think that when you put on a g,
like there's that that back,

2457
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:06.280
he came from a factory in Maine,
came from a,

2458
02:27:06.370 --> 02:27:11.370
from a factory in Maine that was built specifically to make Jujitsu gies and

2459
02:27:11.921 --> 02:27:15.370
that there's people up there,
the workers up there,

2460
02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:18.610
craftsman up there that are in that gate for you.

2461
02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:22.420
And then it gets put from Maine into a bag and sent to you.
Right?

2462
02:27:22.421 --> 02:27:24.450
Isn't that kind of right?
It is,
yeah.

2463
02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:28.240
It's not like can Ughi a Geeky have soul?

2464
02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:31.600
I'm going to ask you that question.
Can have soul.

2465
02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:35.620
We don't know the answer to that.
Metaphorically speaking,
I guess.
Yeah.

2466
02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.680
But we can make it on assessment from the outside if Ughi has soul than you'd

2467
02:27:41.741 --> 02:27:46.120
want that soul,
but come from Maine.
Right.

2468
02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:50.560
And if certain gies had souls and some geese didn't have souls,

2469
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:53.230
you would for sure want to get with the soul.
Yes.

2470
02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:56.530
100% and if geese do indeed have souls,

2471
02:27:56.830 --> 02:28:01.090
which I tend to believe they do,
they could.
Then you'd want the good souls,

2472
02:28:01.690 --> 02:28:05.410
the American soul from man.
Yup.
Well,

2473
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:09.820
if Pete starts making shoes,
you'll know that they'll have souls.
Wow.

2474
02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:15.700
I have made a funny nonetheless.
Or do you mean.com?
That's where you get,

2475
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:20.080
I'm also in Jujitsu.
Okay.
We've got to be honest here in Jujitsu,

2476
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:22.100
it's physical.
You twist your

2477
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.660
<v 2>arms,
your neck and your body not twists like injure it,
but you,
you know,</v>

2478
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:31.070
it gets some work and with work needs recovery with recovery comes

2479
02:28:31.071 --> 02:28:34.070
supplementation,
good supplementation,
Krill oil.

2480
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.830
I feel like I've said the word Krill oil probably more than I've said any other

2481
02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:43.040
food item or dietary supplement meant in my whole life.
Good.

2482
02:28:43.770 --> 02:28:46.850
That's high to happy about it because of how beneficial has got it.

2483
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:50.060
Got More Krill oil too,
by the way.
From Pete with the Joggers,

2484
02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.160
which are nice by the way.
Um,
also another one called joint where friends,

2485
02:28:55.161 --> 02:28:58.640
these are all Jocko supplements by the way.
If he didn't know Super Krill,

2486
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:01.820
not just regular super chocolate Supergirl,
joint warfare,

2487
02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:07.280
which is another formula for joint maintenance reconstruction.

2488
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:10.430
Someone said,
hey,
I got knee surgery.
Is this going to help me?

2489
02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:15.080
Yes.
Yes.
It will help your knee recover.

2490
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:20.160
Especially the meniscus situation too.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Anything where,
okay,

2491
02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:22.220
I'm not gonna go too deep into it,

2492
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:27.320
but anything involving cartilage like these that don't get a bunch of blood

2493
02:29:27.321 --> 02:29:31.560
flow,
they tend to degenerate over well,

2494
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:36.080
everything degenerate,
but over time it's not for everyone.

2495
02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:43.640
No complacency,
right?
No backing off.
Nonetheless,
joint warfare.
That's a good one.

2496
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:46.550
Maintained the joints and this goes for any kind of physical activity.

2497
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:50.240
Your joints will thank you are you will thank your joints.

2498
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:55.490
You'll think Jocko for Jocko Krill oil n joint warfare.
Also discipline,

2499
02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.290
not just regular discipline as a supplement.
Discipline's a pre mission

2500
02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:08.900
<v 4>native enhancing because people were making stuff that helped you physically</v>

2501
02:30:08.901 --> 02:30:11.340
like a pre workout and then they were making nootropics.

2502
02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:16.280
I would help you mentally like your cognition and well in my job,

2503
02:30:16.730 --> 02:30:19.600
especially my old job,
guess what?
I needed both.

2504
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:24.260
I needed to be mentally sharp and I needed to be physically sharp.
Yeah,

2505
02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:29.000
so I wanted everything in the same like mix.
Sure blend.

2506
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:32.890
That's why she made the discipline and you didn't want to do the pre work on and

2507
02:30:32.891 --> 02:30:35.620
then boom.
And then,
okay,
let me go ahead and take the other one right here.
Okay.

2508
02:30:35.621 --> 02:30:39.740
The home and then you know you went to get them both.
Get them both one time.

2509
02:30:39.741 --> 02:30:44.150
One hit,
one win and you feel it and it feels good.

2510
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:48.080
Yeah.
That's what yesterday I was talking about the rounds I did,

2511
02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:49.790
cause I knew I was coming at us.

2512
02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:53.070
I was going to pay the man so I just hit the discipline.
Yeah,
yeah.

2513
02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:56.720
Tastes good too by the way.
It tastes amazingly good.

2514
02:30:56.990 --> 02:31:00.360
What's interesting about it is cause that's monk fruit.
Yeah,
it's monk fruit.

2515
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:02.450
You know what about monk fruit?
No.

2516
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:07.130
Monk Fruit is the sweetener that's used in discipline.
It's like whatever,

2517
02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:09.860
87,000 times sweeter than sugar,

2518
02:31:09.861 --> 02:31:11.740
but it's just all they do put a little bit in the,

2519
02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:15.950
only a little tiny bit in there.
Low glycemic index.

2520
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.771
Slow on,

2521
02:31:16.771 --> 02:31:21.771
let Lacey low on the glycemic index so it doesn't give you the insulin spike

2522
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:28.320
and we'll just say that's good.
Just so people know there's caffeine in it,

2523
02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:33.060
but there's only 15 milligrams of caffeine,
so you're not going to get jittery,

2524
02:31:33.061 --> 02:31:37.500
but you get a little,
a little micro dose of gets a little help,

2525
02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:42.480
a little little catalog,
but monkfruit also they like helps an eight.

2526
02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:45.940
It's,
it's legit.
Yeah.
Other thoughts on that one?

2527
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:51.210
It's called discipline.
Tastes good because Jack wants it to taste good.
Yeah.

2528
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:54.060
That kind of freaked you out.
He had threw me off for sure.

2529
02:31:54.090 --> 02:31:56.490
He thought maybe I just want things to taste horrible so it takes more

2530
02:31:56.491 --> 02:31:59.160
discipline to drinking a black and white like that.
I was like,
hmm.

2531
02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:02.580
Interesting that that was part of the focus,
but hey,
good.
I say good.

2532
02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:06.960
Well you're going to be really happy that I have this attitude when the,

2533
02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:12.120
when the protein comes out.
Sure.
Yeah.
The mint chocolate chip,
you know,
um,

2534
02:32:12.330 --> 02:32:13.290
just Fyi,

2535
02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:19.080
it's not normal and it's got the monk crude in it,
so that's the sweetener.

2536
02:32:19.081 --> 02:32:24.081
So it tastes delish and it doesn't taste like anything else.

2537
02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:30.720
There's no way that it could taste this good and,
and be what it is.
Gotcha.
Yeah.

2538
02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:36.020
Sorry,
I just made up.
I had to make up my own name for it.
Yeah,
yeah,
it dig it.

2539
02:32:36.270 --> 02:32:39.390
You did the right thing.
Do the right thing.
It's called a Moke,

2540
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:43.920
m o l k with the UHMM lot over the,
Oh,

2541
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:47.880
you know why tribute to Motorhead layers.
Layers.

2542
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:51.270
Good man.
I think that's good.
So yeah,

2543
02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:54.960
pretty soon people are going to be on the mole.
Quinn is that a couple of weeks?

2544
02:32:54.990 --> 02:32:59.580
We've got it.
We went through the final testing.
It's so,
it's so,
it tastes good.

2545
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.440
It's easy to digest,
easy,

2546
02:33:01.441 --> 02:33:05.790
all the good things and they still remember back in the diversity.
It's more

2547
02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:12.090
kind of sounds like I need,
this is like,
I don't even know what to say.

2548
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:16.050
This isn't,
it's not like a chocolate milkshake.
It's not like a protein shake.

2549
02:33:16.051 --> 02:33:18.610
It's like,
it's like,
it's like milk

2550
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:23.130
mega mass.

2551
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:27.530
I think it was 5,000 and three million five thousand five thousand probably.
No,

2552
02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.850
it was 0002000500 it might've been.
Okay.

2553
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:36.070
I think that was that South Park.
That was 5,000 right?
Double Super Colostrum,

2554
02:33:36.090 --> 02:33:40.440
seven fever phrase we used to make fun of us.

2555
02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:42.690
Nonetheless.
It was super delicious.

2556
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:47.090
It was like a big like dog food bag full of mega mass.
What?

2557
02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:49.950
500 or whatever it was,
chocolate.

2558
02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:53.670
You drink it and it tastes straight up like a chocolate milkshake and guess
what?

2559
02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:57.380
It probably was just going to say that's the thing that's easy.

2560
02:33:57.690 --> 02:34:01.350
All kind of like quote health foods nowadays they're like,
oh,
this is pro.

2561
02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:04.530
You look at the look of the thing on a protein bar and then compare the protein

2562
02:34:04.531 --> 02:34:08.850
bar to a snickers bar and it's like the same content inside of it.

2563
02:34:09.570 --> 02:34:12.000
Whatever.
Yes.
Be careful.
I saw a hell.

2564
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:16.140
That's what was cool about discovering the monk fruit is being able to make

2565
02:34:16.141 --> 02:34:18.280
stuff tastes really without having the crap

2566
02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:20.910
<v 2>artificial sweeteners in it.
Yeah.</v>

2567
02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:23.860
In a way that's kind of going back to your roots,
right?
Where where it's like,

2568
02:34:23.861 --> 02:34:27.640
okay,
we got sweetness.
Sweetness is a thing.
It's a natural thing.
We'd like it,

2569
02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:29.710
you know,
for a reason.
All of this stuff,
cool man.

2570
02:34:29.711 --> 02:34:31.210
Don't do away with the sweetness,

2571
02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:34.840
but you know when you start engineering foods to like to,

2572
02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.300
to kind of like the advertising I was talking about,

2573
02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:40.720
maybe I should come up with something that just tastes horrible and you just

2574
02:34:40.721 --> 02:34:44.070
have to gut check to taste it.
Just to test yourself mentally.
Yeah.

2575
02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:48.850
See how good that does.
Yeah.
Man,
I'm sure everyone will get this.
Really.
Yeah.

2576
02:34:48.851 --> 02:34:52.840
The mall.
Who made that word up?
You Oh yeah.
Motor.
Yeah.
Gotcha.

2577
02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:54.393
Nonetheless,

2578
02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:59.380
that's going to be available if the milk is going to be available in a few weeks

2579
02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:01.050
apparently.
Yeah.
Uh,

2580
02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:04.210
for the joint work for and Super Krill and this is a good idea,
by the way,

2581
02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:05.710
do the subscription,

2582
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:09.280
they're recurring where it gets so you don't gotta remember you can get down to

2583
02:35:09.281 --> 02:35:12.460
your last three pills cause you don't know if you have like six pills.

2584
02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:15.040
That's two days.
In my case,
I don't know how many you take,

2585
02:35:15.041 --> 02:35:18.280
but I mean I know how many you take,
but I don't know how many other people take.

2586
02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:21.490
You get six fields in there.
You don't know how many pills in there.

2587
02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.950
You get one pill.
Okay.
I know there's only one by that time too late,

2588
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:26.470
even six bills.
Technically it's almost too late.

2589
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:29.560
Pretty much he goes subscription.
Don't worry about that stuff.
Boom.

2590
02:35:29.650 --> 02:35:34.090
Get the subscription.
I'm also,
like we said,
Geez,
rash guards,
compression gear,

2591
02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:38.950
joggers,
most comfortable ones in the world.

2592
02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:42.340
In my experience.
I don't know.
Maybe there's a more comfortable one.
Maybe not.

2593
02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:45.430
If there is,
I've never seen it through the charters.
Have a soul.

2594
02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:51.190
Probably not like it.
They touched your soul.
That's important.

2595
02:35:51.191 --> 02:35:55.120
The comfort in it for sure.
A hundred percent hundred percent origin,

2596
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:57.250
main.com good way to support.

2597
02:35:57.790 --> 02:36:00.580
Also in Maine,

2598
02:36:01.390 --> 02:36:06.100
the Jujitsu immersion camp,
immerse yourself in Jujitsu for half a week.

2599
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:08.500
Write half a week and a half a week cause there's like two sessions.

2600
02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:12.900
Can you do both sessions?
Yes,
you can.
I mean,
is that like a thing?
Of course,
yeah.

2601
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:17.710
Okay,
so this is an option for that boom.
One Week.
Immersion into Jujitsu.

2602
02:36:17.770 --> 02:36:22.270
Just learning.
You know,
it's not like bootcamp where it like,
you know,

2603
02:36:22.271 --> 02:36:24.580
you're going to be forced to do a bunch of calisthenics,

2604
02:36:24.581 --> 02:36:28.540
which we don't advocate apparently anymore,
but we still,

2605
02:36:28.570 --> 02:36:30.940
we still advocate counselor.
I had to keep cows,

2606
02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:35.290
especially like a burpee situation,
which I think is advocate all kinds of cows.

2607
02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.980
All Cal Sachs.
Actually you can't show me a calisthenic that I don't advocate.

2608
02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:41.290
Even though people like are like suit ups are no good.

2609
02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:44.140
They work your psoas muscle,
they don't even work.
No,
I advocate them too.

2610
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:48.200
I like strong PSOAS muscles.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Show me.
They're like,
well,

2611
02:36:48.201 --> 02:36:50.410
they're just need to work.
Your abs works your psoas muscle muscles like,
cool.

2612
02:36:50.411 --> 02:36:54.270
I'm strong.
PSOAS muscles.
Next question.
First off.
Yes,
they do work at ABS.
Trey,

2613
02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:56.170
Trey,
don't do sit ups for one year.

2614
02:36:56.470 --> 02:36:59.950
Do all your other stuff and then do five sets of burnout.

2615
02:36:59.951 --> 02:37:02.820
Sit ups and then see if your abs are so in the next day.

2616
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:06.680
Don't see it that it doesn't sit up till failure.
Oh,
okay.
That's a burn.

2617
02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:09.430
Can you even do sit out sit ups to failure?
Oh yeah.

2618
02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:12.280
It's hard and it's going to burn how much time you got to have.

2619
02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:16.010
You have the whole day.
Here's the,
okay.
The point isn't how

2620
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.680
<v 4>many sit ups you can do or don't.
Can't do.</v>

2621
02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:23.760
The point is people saying sit ups don't do your ab muscles hip flexor and so

2622
02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:28.310
they do that too,
but they do have muscles nonetheless.
I agree with you.

2623
02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:32.900
Do you do jumping jacks?
Yeah,
I do.
Jumping Jacks to,

2624
02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:35.360
actually I did jumping jacks last week.
It was part of a metcon,

2625
02:37:35.390 --> 02:37:38.530
but still there was an old old team guy workout or

2626
02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:41.690
jumping jacks.
Pullups are sorry,

2627
02:37:41.691 --> 02:37:45.200
jumping jacks pushups and just do jumping jacks and push ups and you think it's

2628
02:37:45.201 --> 02:37:47.830
no big deal and then like your 45 minutes into it,
you're like,

2629
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:50.390
I hate jumping jacks and push ups.
Yeah.

2630
02:37:50.391 --> 02:37:53.690
I don't know if I'd ever do something continuously for 45 minutes.
Yeah.

2631
02:37:53.691 --> 02:37:58.110
Well that will be the first half of that workout.
That's stupid.
Yeah.

2632
02:37:58.820 --> 02:37:59.720
Yeah.
That one would get,

2633
02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:04.370
especially after getting to get any exercise and you can make it soc after 45

2634
02:38:04.371 --> 02:38:07.010
minutes.
Yeah.
Like there's,
I can't even think of an exercise.

2635
02:38:07.011 --> 02:38:10.490
It doesn't suck after 45 but you're just doing buds,
neck rotations.

2636
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:13.880
Just do that in the teams too.
You're just laying down.
You're like,
okay,

2637
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:16.280
I'm just gonna lay down and move my head around.
Oh,
laying down here.

2638
02:38:16.281 --> 02:38:20.760
I never even laid down neck rotations one to do that for 45 minutes.

2639
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:24.230
You're like,
this is the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life,

2640
02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:27.820
but I'm glad we're doing it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you're right about that.

2641
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:31.700
Well,
I figured that key would be,

2642
02:38:31.850 --> 02:38:34.700
if you don't like the whole 45 minutes thing is you do something that's hard

2643
02:38:34.701 --> 02:38:37.800
enough of a movement that you don't have to do 45 minutes.
Yeah,
that's,

2644
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.240
that's good.
If you don't want to just do something that sucks for 45 minutes.

2645
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.991
I did a metcon,

2646
02:38:41.991 --> 02:38:46.670
like just kind of representative of what you were talking about earlier where it

2647
02:38:46.671 --> 02:38:49.520
was,
um,
it was like how many of this,

2648
02:38:49.521 --> 02:38:52.220
these two movements you can do within a certain amount of time,

2649
02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:57.020
which was different.
Usually I set my rest time to a certain time and I do.

2650
02:38:57.021 --> 02:39:01.970
I'm in boom and yeah,
that was a good,
good little change up.
Yeah,
do that.

2651
02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:06.590
Or you can do jumping jacks and pull ups for 45 minutes at a time when you

2652
02:39:06.591 --> 02:39:07.630
wouldn't even have pull up bars.

2653
02:39:07.631 --> 02:39:12.260
So we're like straight up in the ship or something.
Jumping Jacks,
pushups.

2654
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:17.180
Everyone just goes,
oh God.
Pouring workup.

2655
02:39:17.430 --> 02:39:21.650
Nonetheless,
back to origin,
Jujitsu camp,
you won't be doing jumping jacks,

2656
02:39:21.651 --> 02:39:25.500
pushups 100% unless he wants to you then you can,
you know.
Uh,

2657
02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:28.670
but it's more learning,
Jujitsu,
practicing.
Did you too?

2658
02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:33.890
No pressure.
Unless you put some pressure on yourself,
which I recommend.

2659
02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:37.820
Do that and roll with everybody,
you know.
Do some,
what's the word?

2660
02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:41.810
What's the rolling Randori Randori we'll be doing some Randori and some nausea.

2661
02:39:42.030 --> 02:39:45.710
Some cut up.
A lot of practice,
by the way.
That's true.
Yeah.
Good.

2662
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:49.220
Let a good install base.
You'll be there.
It will be there.

2663
02:39:49.250 --> 02:39:53.950
Dave Burke is going to be the big toe.
He's got the bug.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2664
02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:58.550
That's something I haven't talked to JP and or Lafe.

2665
02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:03.590
See if they're going to roll up and roll.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It makes sense,
but yeah.

2666
02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:04.520
Nonetheless,

2667
02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:09.520
it is August 26 through September 2nd of this year.

2668
02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:14.970
Also,
speaking of Boring Jocko

2669
02:40:14.970 --> 02:40:19.920
<v 2>work doing 45 minutes,
the jumping jacks and push ups.
I don't think so,</v>

2670
02:40:20.610 --> 02:40:23.670
but if you want to,
interesting.
We're actually,
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't give you,

2671
02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:27.060
give you crap about it because I did look on your Instagram and you had like

2672
02:40:27.061 --> 02:40:31.010
some Bulgarian bag on there,
so you gotta you vary your workouts.

2673
02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:34.290
Your workout gets interesting.
Yeah.
Okay.
I take it credit,

2674
02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:37.980
so if you want to make your workout interesting,
gets some new movements,

2675
02:40:37.981 --> 02:40:41.830
new equipment in there.
Go to audit.com/jocko/jock.

2676
02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:46.570
Go in there,
get you some good kettlebells.
Even though Kettlebells,

2677
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:51.440
I guess ultimately could be viewed as boring.
You can make them boring.
Yeah.

2678
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:54.240
Yeah.
That's kind of boring.
Yeah.
You know what?

2679
02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:58.800
Ultimately that's really what it is because even me doing the same metcon that I

2680
02:40:58.801 --> 02:41:03.630
do all the time,
all I did was switch up like one teeny tiny thing,

2681
02:41:04.350 --> 02:41:08.200
so it was more about me than the workout or it was a workout,

2682
02:41:08.201 --> 02:41:12.600
but about the equipment,
less about the equipment,
more about me.
Nonetheless,

2683
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:16.500
if you want to make it about the equipment on it has the equipment may says

2684
02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:19.680
steel bells.
See I haven't even done that.

2685
02:41:19.681 --> 02:41:23.610
That's like some advanced creativity stuff,
you know,
battle ropes,

2686
02:41:23.611 --> 02:41:27.990
all this stuff that'll get you functional strength and actual strength.

2687
02:41:29.010 --> 02:41:33.870
Just jokin boner.
That's it.
Anyway on it.com/jacket good spot.

2688
02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:36.390
Let a good info on there as well.
Also,

2689
02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:41.280
when you get this book called mind over muscle,

2690
02:41:43.890 --> 02:41:46.080
I'm going to list it or can you get it on Amazon?
Yep.
Okay.

2691
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:49.260
I'm going to listen on the website talk dot stock come down to me through the

2692
02:41:49.261 --> 02:41:50.690
ancient traditional route,

2693
02:41:50.691 --> 02:41:54.450
whatever you had a book before that wasn't available and they look kind of like

2694
02:41:54.451 --> 02:41:59.070
that.
One of these old school old style books.
Nonetheless,

2695
02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:00.990
not this one.
When you get it,
don't worry.

2696
02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:05.700
Go to Jocko podcast.com I'll put it in the book section with all the books.

2699
02:42:14.011 --> 02:42:16.870
It's about to be actually is going to be summer before fall,
Huh?
So,

2700
02:42:16.871 --> 02:42:20.460
so maybe get a weed whacker,

subscribe to our Youtube Channel if you want.

2711
02:43:01.890 --> 02:43:06.620
If you care even a little bit about the video version of this podcast and with

2712
02:43:06.621 --> 02:43:10.920
chocolate looks like an,
I don't care if you care about what I look like,

2713
02:43:10.930 --> 02:43:13.750
but again,
and I still get this by the way,

2714
02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:16.930
I guess apparently I don't look how I sound.

2715
02:43:18.330 --> 02:43:23.110
Is there like can you match up a voice to a face?
You kind of can't,
Huh?

2716
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:27.640
Yeah.
Like you for sure.
But it's not like a one to one.
It's kind of like,
uh,
uh,

2717
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:31.060
like you hear the voice and then there's this ambiguous kind of group of faces

2718
02:43:31.061 --> 02:43:33.070
that might go with it.
You know,
it's one of those deals.

2719
02:43:33.071 --> 02:43:36.520
It's not just one face comes to mind and that's Kinda,
it's not that,

2720
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:37.780
but it's like,

2721
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:42.780
I guess my face falls way outside of the group of faces that practically

2722
02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:49.040
practically,
but that,
that seed normally probably match my voice.
I guess.

2723
02:43:49.290 --> 02:43:53.020
That's what I hear too.
Apparently I still hear it.
So if you care,

2724
02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.340
subscribe to the Youtube Channel or I guess technically you wouldn't have to

2725
02:43:57.341 --> 02:44:00.820
subscribe to it.
You just look at it.
But if you want to support at the same time,

2726
02:44:00.821 --> 02:44:04.780
if you want subscribe to the podcast on Youtube.
Also have excerpts on that,

2727
02:44:04.781 --> 02:44:06.160
so that's another reason.
By the way,

2728
02:44:07.210 --> 02:44:10.480
you know you want to share these shorter excerpts with people have watched them,

2729
02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:13.930
boom.
Youtube is the place to do it.
Also,

2730
02:44:13.931 --> 02:44:17.020
some enhanced excerpts that some calling him today enhance.

2731
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:20.380
Put some music on there,
make you feel good about it.
Here's the thing,

2732
02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:24.160
you advocate discipline like the way you feel doesn't matter.
I would say this,

2733
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:26.050
it matters less than discipline.

2734
02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:29.720
It still does matter when you're fired up to go do a workout,

2735
02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:36.130
when you're fired up to go do a workout versus a day when you really don't want

2736
02:44:36.131 --> 02:44:36.670
to do a work

2737
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:39.130
<v 4>guys,
it then all the time people are like,
oh,
I didn't want to work out today,</v>

2738
02:44:39.131 --> 02:44:42.340
but I did anyways and I set a PR in my whatever.
Yeah.
Why does that happen?

2739
02:44:42.370 --> 02:44:43.450
That happens sometimes.

2740
02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:48.220
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no.
Look it up.
Get Out.
The one that it wasn't done with the theory.</v>

2741
02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.130
If you feel like working out and you're fired up to go work out,

2742
02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:57.310
that's going to be a good workout.
Chances are not all the time I get it.

2743
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:02.410
If you really don't feel like working out,
you're dragging ass dragging.

2744
02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:06.430
You got 5.5 hours of sleep and you're not Jocko by the way,

2745
02:45:06.970 --> 02:45:09.220
and you're,

2746
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:13.270
you ate some snickers or something like this and you're like,
Dang,

2747
02:45:13.271 --> 02:45:15.190
I still got to work out.
You really don't feel like an end.

2748
02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:19.030
You have a bunch of other stuff to do and you go work out would say about

2749
02:45:19.090 --> 02:45:22.430
snickerdoodle.
No,
I mean I know what us,

2750
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:26.380
<v 4>no,
no.
Is this guy in the teams whose name happened to be nick?
Sure,</v>

2751
02:45:26.530 --> 02:45:29.370
and we were in like new guys and we went on a compass course.

2752
02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:31.470
The only food that he brought out in the field was,

2753
02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:36.010
was snickers like you know like the 12 pack of snickers.

2754
02:45:36.890 --> 02:45:38.520
Sure.
Yeah.
I assume.
Yeah.
He brought,

2755
02:45:38.521 --> 02:45:41.730
he bought like three 12 packs of stickers and though that's all he brought for

2756
02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:45.450
five days.
It didn't go down well,
no,
I wouldn't think so.

2757
02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:47.790
He got a mega diarrhea cases,

2758
02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:51.310
so the whole marketing,

2759
02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:56.320
his nickname was snickerdoodle after that snicker doodle stay pretty funny.

2760
02:45:58.380 --> 02:45:59.900
Pretty bummed out.
Actually after that one.

2761
02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:05.550
It's good that we had a guy named snickers on our football team at Uah snickers.

2762
02:46:05.551 --> 02:46:07.950
He was like that.
He's the center.
Oh,
that was his last name.
No,

2763
02:46:08.210 --> 02:46:09.950
it was his nickname on,
but

2764
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.680
<v 2>I did.
That's how you know how certain guys have,</v>

2765
02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:17.870
their nickname is so strong you don't like you.
It was like that.

2766
02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:21.680
Nonetheless,
back to the point,
if you're fired up to go work out,

2767
02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:23.750
chances are you going to have a better workout.

2768
02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.020
Same thing with the jock was message.
If you're fired up to listen to it,

2769
02:46:27.470 --> 02:46:31.310
it might sink in better.
Might you put some good music on it?
Boom.

2770
02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:35.390
Might see get better.
It might,
I don't know why it's enhanced,
you know,

2771
02:46:35.391 --> 02:46:37.490
special messages.
Nonetheless.

2772
02:46:37.610 --> 02:46:39.800
The point there is subscribe to the Youtube Channel if you want.

2773
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:44.640
Good way to support.
Also,
Jocko was a store.
It's called Jocko store.
Jocko.

2774
02:46:44.641 --> 02:46:48.050
store.com patches are in because it's been hitting me up.

2775
02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:52.490
I haven't seen beanies on there.
Yeah.
You know it's a process.
Well,

2776
02:46:52.491 --> 02:46:55.040
here's the thing.
I got to July,

2777
02:46:56.530 --> 02:46:59.870
so we've got that going for us.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm just a job.
Hey man,

2778
02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:01.250
you know better late than never.

2779
02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:04.690
I guess with those in the meantime is and apply when it's summertime and you're

2780
02:47:04.691 --> 02:47:08.060
going to beat it does not apply.
Well maybe I'll get the thin ones.

2781
02:47:08.061 --> 02:47:12.130
The straight may do it for a little bit better about it.

2782
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.410
No doubt about it.
They look,

2783
02:47:15.411 --> 02:47:18.470
you're right and we're still going to work hard on the beanies and get them,

2784
02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:22.120
get them out quality.
Can't rush.

2785
02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:26.920
Great greatness.
Quality Dude.
You know what,
a nine months for me,

2786
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:32.210
not about Russia could have come with you with all kinds of quality,

2787
02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.070
like mega quality.
Those things could have been admitted from cash

2788
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:42.020
grown.
The cocktail on the phone.
Right.
All right,

2789
02:47:42.021 --> 02:47:44.090
well I'm going to continue to work and you know when they're out,

2790
02:47:44.091 --> 02:47:47.300
they're going to be out there going to be fantastic.
They better be right.

2791
02:47:47.301 --> 02:47:52.130
There you go.
In the meantime,
maybe it takes a lot to get to a soul into a BB.

2792
02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.040
Yup.
It could be dot.
It would be in the meantime.

2793
02:47:55.450 --> 02:47:57.170
There's some cool shirts on there.
I think they're cool.

2794
02:47:57.230 --> 02:48:01.700
Does winning equals freedom?
Get after it?
That's a good one.
Simple to the point.

2795
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:06.470
Back to the book.
That's a new one.
I think you put on another titles.

2796
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:09.130
All of them on the back.
Well,
yeah,

2797
02:48:09.290 --> 02:48:13.270
all the book titles up until the point until what?
Podcasts.

2798
02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:15.760
I should figure that out.
That's like a layer.
Well,

2799
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:20.840
she'll be the first hundred but you probably didn't do that I think.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2800
02:48:20.841 --> 02:48:22.880
It was like hundred something right here.
It's been missed.

2801
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.480
That's fine because then we can put it on another back to the book at 200 yeah,

2802
02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:30.350
like the updated list.
Vista Layer.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe not.

2803
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:34.610
Or maybe I'll add a layer because layers are Annabelle edible.

2804
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:37.940
Maybe you can add layers.
You see what I'm saying?
Anyway,

2805
02:48:37.950 --> 02:48:42.080
so I'm sure it's on there.
Some rash guards on there,
some patches there.

2806
02:48:42.081 --> 02:48:46.640
Like I said,
some women's stuff on their hoodies.
Also decals,

2807
02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:50.330
you know,
a decal is Jesse's decals.
Jesse's decal.

2808
02:48:50.331 --> 02:48:55.010
Here's the thing with decals where they're,
they're essentially a sticker,

2809
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:57.320
right?
And we all know when he comes,
I,
and I understand,

2810
02:48:57.321 --> 02:49:02.321
but he uses like this stuff like the material for this decal is like supposed to

2811
02:49:03.171 --> 02:49:07.610
survive the apocalypse.
No decals.
Okay.
Yeah.

2812
02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:11.190
<v 3>Good way to support us.
He didn't play around?</v>

2813
02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:14.720
<v 2>No,
not at all.
And this guy like he was getting it all.</v>

2814
02:49:14.721 --> 02:49:17.180
We go back and forth and he's like,
yeah,
I make decals.
I was like,
yeah,

2815
02:49:17.181 --> 02:49:21.230
that's a good idea.
Whatever.
And then another company called,

2816
02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:23.390
I think it was called echelon front,
something like this.

2817
02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:28.160
They got some decals and I was like Dang these decals and obviously prompted me

2818
02:49:28.161 --> 02:49:30.980
to,
okay,
we need our decals.
They're legit,
they are legit.

2819
02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:34.310
And they're on Jocko store.com chipped away.
Good way to support.

2820
02:49:34.970 --> 02:49:37.970
If you want something,
get something.
Also psychological warfare,

2821
02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:40.520
if you don't know what that is,
this is what it is.

2822
02:49:40.730 --> 02:49:45.170
It's an album with tracks of Jocko helping you through.

2823
02:49:45.171 --> 02:49:49.790
This is what the track is.
It's,
it's not a music track.
Jocko on there,

2824
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:54.680
every track helping you get through your moment of weakness.
And we have them,

2825
02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:59.880
I have Jocko has him even though he,
you know,

2826
02:50:00.110 --> 02:50:02.450
is reluctant to admit that from time to time.

2827
02:50:04.310 --> 02:50:07.190
And what it does is let's say you're gonna skip the workout.

2828
02:50:07.191 --> 02:50:11.150
I think skipping work out,
this is my opinion,
just keep work,
workout and cheat,

2829
02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:15.980
not cheating on a diet.
Can you cheat on a diet?
Technically yes.
Yeah.

2830
02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:18.580
It's like you're cheating.
You are cheating yourself.
You did it anyway.

2831
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:21.290
You betrayed your,
your yourself.
You know,

2832
02:50:21.291 --> 02:50:26.291
cause you have a future self seem saying like your self of right now we'll make

2833
02:50:26.331 --> 02:50:31.050
like a a protocol.
Right.
And then your future self essentially cheats on your

2834
02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:31.570
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2835
02:50:31.570 --> 02:50:36.570
I saw some meme of homer Simpson saying like all this guy's future's not looking

2836
02:50:37.121 --> 02:50:41.850
good.
He's eating like or whatever.
Yeah,
exactly right.
Yup.

2837
02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:46.950
<v 2>So yeah,
technically it is.
If you're cheating on your past self on the Diet,</v>

2838
02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:50.330
don't worry about that.
You start feeling that feeling coming along,

2839
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:53.780
come along and you got to track for that.
You just listened to it and it's in,

2840
02:50:53.781 --> 02:50:57.090
it's essentially like chocolate telling you why you shouldn't slip,

2841
02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:59.980
why you shouldn't slip down that slippery slope in whatever activity.

2842
02:50:59.981 --> 02:51:03.630
Some good ones on there,
procrastination,
all that stuff.
Yeah,
checked out.

2843
02:51:03.631 --> 02:51:05.820
Went out.
Good way to support.
Very effective too.

2844
02:51:06.450 --> 02:51:10.920
<v 3>That's all iTunes,
apple music,
no Amazon,</v>

2845
02:51:10.980 --> 02:51:14.450
Amazon music,
Google play,
apple,
iTunes,

2846
02:51:14.460 --> 02:51:17.730
wherever you can get mp3s.
That's where you can get it.

2847
02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.270
Also you can get from Amazon,
you can get Jocko white tea.

2848
02:51:22.470 --> 02:51:26.160
It tastes really good.
It does have 15 grams of caffeine,

2849
02:51:26.161 --> 02:51:27.460
so that's a little micro dose.

2850
02:51:27.780 --> 02:51:32.670
That's why I put 15 grams of caffeine inside the discipline because that was the

2851
02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:36.030
dose that I like.
It has,

2852
02:51:36.270 --> 02:51:38.190
but it's only 15 milligrams so you don't get jittery.

2853
02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:41.760
It also has a high level of antioxidants.
That's what the pomegranate does.

2854
02:51:42.210 --> 02:51:46.890
That's why it's pomegranate white tea.
And of course in addition to those things,

2855
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:51.000
it is the only white tea that comes,
the guaranteed 8,000 pound deadlift.

2856
02:51:53.070 --> 02:51:56.580
So that's good.
You've got that going for you.
Um,
even Jordan Peterson now,

2857
02:51:56.730 --> 02:52:01.730
you know I got a text from him and he's up to 8,000 or so cause he was plateaued

2858
02:52:01.741 --> 02:52:03.900
at 7,000 pounds.
Is he admitted on a,

2859
02:52:04.410 --> 02:52:06.040
he doesn't like to admit his weaknesses either,
but

2860
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:10.540
<v 0>there was 7,000 pounds,
you know,
pretty,
pretty sad.</v>

2861
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:15.400
But now he's a to 8,000 so good for him.
Oh good.
Yeah.

2862
02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:18.640
All it took was a little Jocko white tea also.
We got some books,

2863
02:52:18.940 --> 02:52:21.430
I got some books I got to,
I got a book called way of the Warrior Kid.

2864
02:52:21.610 --> 02:52:25.570
The principles of being a warrior and really of being a good human being.

2865
02:52:25.571 --> 02:52:29.710
And they're in there and they are simple and they're clear enough for a six year

2866
02:52:29.711 --> 02:52:29.921
old,

2867
02:52:29.921 --> 02:52:34.660
a seven year old and eight year olds and 80 year old to understand them and it

2868
02:52:34.661 --> 02:52:38.560
gets better because the story continues in the book way of the warrior kid to

2869
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:40.390
Mark's mission.

2870
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:41.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2871
02:52:41.730 --> 02:52:44.760
<v 0>In this book starts to hit on some other principles in life.</v>

2872
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:49.200
Keeping your emotions under control,
working hard,

2873
02:52:49.380 --> 02:52:52.170
being frugal,
saving money,

2874
02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:55.200
and also dealing with Nathan James.

2875
02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:01.170
Nathan James knew bullied psychological bullying a little bit different.

2876
02:53:01.171 --> 02:53:04.550
Mark wants to fight him.
Mark figures have been training Jujitsu.

2877
02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:08.100
I'm gonna fight this guy,
but instead,
uncle g uncle Jake says,
no,

2878
02:53:08.130 --> 02:53:10.860
you can find him first.
You have to gather intelligence on them.

2879
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:15.960
You have to figure out what's going on with

2880
02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:18.280
Nathan James,

2881
02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:21.850
understand why he's your enemy and see if there's another way to solve this

2882
02:53:21.851 --> 02:53:25.330
problem before besides fighting turns out to be very good.
Also,

2883
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:28.480
mark has a Jujitsu tournament coming up and guess what?

2884
02:53:28.481 --> 02:53:29.320
He doesn't want to compete in it.

2885
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:33.670
He doesn't want to do is first Jiu Jitsu tournament.
Why?
Because he's afraid.

2886
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:39.010
He's afraid of losing.
He's afraid of failing.
Fear of failure.
That's bad.

2887
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:42.070
So he's got all these problems.
How did you overcome them?
Well,

2888
02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:46.270
luckily uncle Jake's in the house or go,
Jake is out for the summertime,

2889
02:53:46.330 --> 02:53:49.690
gives him a hand order.
That book is going to be available.

2890
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:54.750
April 24th same thing with all the other books for the last two books that have

2891
02:53:56.181 --> 02:53:59.200
come out.
It's going to sell out.

2892
02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:02.320
The publisher doesn't understand how many books to make.

2893
02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:06.880
They want to hedge their bets,
so they're just going to make a certain amount.

2894
02:54:08.110 --> 02:54:12.820
So the more people order.
Now,
first of all,
you'll get it when it comes out.

2895
02:54:12.821 --> 02:54:13.391
And second of all,

2896
02:54:13.391 --> 02:54:17.410
they'll know that they need to make more and order it from wherever.

2897
02:54:17.411 --> 02:54:19.750
Order it from Amazon,
order it from Barnes,
noble.

2898
02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:23.530
But going to your local bookstore,
this is a mission.

2899
02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:26.830
Go to your local bookstore and tell them you want the book marks,
mission way,

2900
02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:28.600
the warrior kid to tell him,
do you want that?

2901
02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:30.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2902
02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:31.460
<v 0>That will help spread the word.</v>

2903
02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:33.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2904
02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:36.370
<v 0>And also while you're helping out warrior kids,</v>

2905
02:54:36.371 --> 02:54:41.371
check out Irish oaks ranch.com where you can get soap made by young Aiden who

2906
02:54:43.570 --> 02:54:44.440
was only 12 years old.

2907
02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:48.550
He's got his own business and the soap isn't just any soap.
It's good.

2908
02:54:48.551 --> 02:54:53.551
So then he actually called the Jocko soap and the jock was soap motto that I

2909
02:54:55.061 --> 02:54:58.420
made up.
Yup.
Aiden gets no credit for this.

2910
02:54:58.810 --> 02:55:03.810
The motto is stay clean and someone said there's a layer in stake.

2911
02:55:05.650 --> 02:55:09.390
Lean,
lean,

2912
02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:13.490
stay clean layers.
No big deal.
Yeah.

2913
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:16.880
I also don't forget about the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2914
02:55:17.810 --> 02:55:21.980
This is the manual for getting after it faults and actions that will keep you

2915
02:55:21.981 --> 02:55:25.790
off the slippery slope and to keep you on the path,

2916
02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:31.670
the path of discipline and thereby as the title says,
the path of freedom.

2917
02:55:31.850 --> 02:55:34.700
If you want the audio version of that,
it's not on audible.

2918
02:55:35.210 --> 02:55:37.250
It's an album with tracks.

2954
02:58:05.851 --> 02:58:09.810
at Jocko Willink and thanks to you all for listening to the podcast,

2955
02:58:09.811 --> 02:58:14.811
especially those of you in uniform who took an oath to protect this country and

2956
02:58:16.831 --> 02:58:21.831
you stand by that oath literally around the world on the front lines and to the

2957
02:58:22.831 --> 02:58:27.750
police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and all the first

2958
02:58:27.751 --> 02:58:32.751
responders that are always on call to help us when the chips are down and that

2959
02:58:33.421 --> 02:58:38.421
are ready to make that sacrifice like so many did on September 11th thank you

2960
02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:45.200
for what you do and let's remember and give thanks to the people every day like

2961
02:58:48.961 --> 02:58:51.810
Jeremy Glick who stood up.

2962
02:58:53.020 --> 02:58:53.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:58.570
<v 0>Along with the other members of flight 93 they stood up and fought when the time</v>

2964
02:58:59.751 --> 02:59:00.584
called for it.

2965
02:59:02.660 --> 02:59:05.990
They let us all be prepared to do the same.

2966
02:59:05.991 --> 02:59:08.300
To stand up and fight if we need to,

2967
02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:12.650
to be prepared to face evil by staying on the path,

2968
02:59:12.651 --> 02:59:16.670
by knowing what your principles are and sticking to them.

2969
02:59:18.470 --> 02:59:21.800
Be Vigilant.
Pay Attention.

2970
02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:25.910
Pay attention to the little things,
the little decisions,

2971
02:59:26.210 --> 02:59:31.210
the decisions that pull you off the path and onto that slippery slope with bad

2972
02:59:33.141 --> 02:59:37.700
habits that will let you down at the moment of truth.

2973
02:59:39.780 --> 02:59:40.613
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2974
02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:45.580
<v 0>Watch out for those little decisions.
Instead,
stay on the path,</v>

2975
02:59:45.850 --> 02:59:47.140
the path of discipline,

2976
02:59:47.141 --> 02:59:50.980
the path that leads to security and strength,

2977
02:59:51.250 --> 02:59:53.140
and of course to freedom.

2978
02:59:55.270 --> 02:59:58.330
And that's the path of getting after it.

2979
03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:05.130
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2980
03:00:06.390 --> 03:00:06.650
<v 1>out.</v>
