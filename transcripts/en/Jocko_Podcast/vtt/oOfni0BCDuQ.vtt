This is Jocko podcast number one 65 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.250
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.
Good evening.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.870
I've
said that war is the ultimate teacher

4
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.450
and I think it's also true to say that war is the ultimate revealer.

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.880
<v 0>It reveals a side of people that would not normally be allowed to come out</v>

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.580
cause in war there's so much happening.
There's so much pressure,

8
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.010
there's so much emotion

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.340
and it's all so intense and I saw people,

10
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.210
<v 1>okay,</v>

11
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.200
<v 0>change.</v>

12
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.020
<v 0>And I don't want them to make this overly dramatic and in most cases,</v>

14
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:03.680
I'm not talking about some big dramatic transformation that a person goes

15
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:04.514
through,

16
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.060
but I am talking about changes and the changes were often visible,

17
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
visible things that would be out of character for someone.

18
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.950
They'd start acting a different way,
sometimes negative,

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.380
and sometimes positive.

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.750
<v 0>There might be someone who's temper gets quick,
starts to flare up.</v>

22
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.250
There might be someone that becomes more understanding,
more forgiving.

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.060
<v 0>Some people were happier in combat and some were just absolutely stressed to the</v>

25
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.634
core.

26
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.100
And when I look back now,

27
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.350
it becomes very clear that there were some,

28
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.590
<v 1>okay,</v>

29
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 0>I'll call them oscillations in my own attitude.</v>

30
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.600
<v 0>There were some times when I had to reel myself in.</v>

32
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.380
I definitely try and stay professional at all times.

33
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:12.460
That's kind of what I do.

34
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.000
I try to play the game.

35
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.910
I try not to get emotional.

36
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.100
That's just how I try and role.

37
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.503
<v 0>But</v>

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.720
<v 1>okay.</v>

40
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720
<v 0>I could feel it sometimes starting to come apart a little bit and I would have</v>

41
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:33.804
to breathe

42
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.960
mentally,
mentally breathe,

43
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.000
consciously pull the pieces back together

44
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.900
so
I don't lose my temper.

45
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.710
<v 0>I don't lose my composure.</v>

47
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.860
I and I,
I know that that's good quality.

48
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.861
It's one that I saw other leaders in act and I thought that that was a positive

49
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:12.361
quality and it's one that I tried to emulate and I got pretty good at emulating

50
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.890
that quality,
but

51
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.610
sometimes on deployment,

52
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.160
<v 1>okay.</v>

53
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.010
<v 0>I really had to focus on that.</v>

54
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.800
I had to focus on keeping my composure.

55
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:29.070
I had to focus on not getting emotional.

56
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.350
I had to detach and tell myself to settle down and keep it together.

57
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:35.550
And it's not easy to do.

58
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.850
Then some people have a hard time doing that and they get short fused and they

59
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.400
lose their temper at the drop of a hat.

60
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.520
Once they're under the stress of

61
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.040
sustained combat,
others will not do that.

62
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:58.041
Others will go numb and they'll just kind of turn off and I tried to stay

63
00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:59.364
balanced,

64
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.260
not to completely turn off my emotions but at the same time not get emotional,

65
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.750
but I had to think about that,

66
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.330
had to consciously think about that and there were other things that I noticed

67
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.930
about myself,
especially when I look back.

68
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.350
One thing I noticed is that the little things they do,

69
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:23.070
they really didn't matter anymore.

70
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.290
They lost things of little importance,
pretty much lost all importance.

71
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.980
If no one was dead and no one was wounded that things were going to be okay.

72
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.480
That's how it was for me.
And some people go in the opposite direction,

73
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.590
they start to lose their mind over little meaningless things and what they're

74
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:46.110
doing when they lash out in those situations is there.

75
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.040
That's how they're letting out the CV,

76
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.940
all encompassing stress that they're feeling.

77
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.100
Another thing I noticed is that I'm normally very tactful when I communicate

78
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.560
with people up and down the chain of command and it's pretty natural for me.

79
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.600
I've been doing it for so long.
I'm thinking about what I'm saying.

80
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:17.380
I'm making sure I'm saying the right things and that they're being understood

81
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.214
correctly.

82
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.570
I understand the importance of communicating from a leadership perspective,

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.080
but during combat deployments,
I can tell you I had to think a little bit more.

84
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:31.081
I had to put a little bit more fought into what I was saying because the urge I

85
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.520
was fighting against often was this urge just to be

86
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.170
offensively blunt,

87
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.830
just blunt and really even condescending or sarcastic or patronizing or snide or

88
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:51.780
mocking or cutting

89
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.100
because there is some level of madness in war.

90
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:00.900
There just is.
I mean,
let's face it,

91
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.020
you're going to go out and you're trying to kill people and they're trying to

92
00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:07.500
kill you and your friends are trying to kill their friends and their friends are

93
00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:11.280
trying to kill your friends.
That's not normal.

94
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.860
<v 1>Okay?</v>

95
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.190
<v 0>That's,
if you take that out of context,</v>

96
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.200
that's just madness.

97
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

98
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.060
<v 0>And that madness in war.</v>

99
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.020
<v 0>It can creep into your head and then very easily it can creep out of your mouth</v>

101
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.333
if you let it.

102
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.710
And these were

103
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.620
<v 1>okay,</v>

104
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.520
<v 0>all these types of things,
they,
they,
they happen to me,</v>

105
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.480
they happen to everyone.
I think I had a pretty good handle on it

106
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.360
and some people handle it better.

107
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:52.750
Some people handle it worse that the combat situations I was in,

108
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.200
there's people that have gone through infinitely harder combat scenarios for all

109
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:01.840
of mankind,
from the history of mankind.

110
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.680
Everyone in these situations is going to have to react to them in some way.

111
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.510
Everyone's going to be impacted by that madness of war.

112
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.740
<v 0>And like I said,</v>

114
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.530
they're going to react in different ways depending on who they are,

115
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:20.930
depending on their background,
depending on their personality.

116
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.470
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

117
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.590
<v 0>but the war itself is going to reveal,</v>

118
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.480
<v 1>okay.</v>

119
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.640
<v 0>It's going to reveal strengths and weaknesses.</v>

120
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:31.800
It's going to reveal fears and regrets.

121
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:34.860
It's going to reveal ego and selflessness.

122
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.420
And when we see deaf,

123
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.370
when we face death,

124
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:50.371
and when our friends and our comrades are wounded and maimed and killed,

125
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.550
that has an effect.

126
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.140
And you might think,

127
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:07.410
how hard do I have to pull in on the reins of my own fury and hatred in a

128
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.440
murderous FOBTs?

129
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.223
<v 1>Okay?</v>

130
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.270
<v 0>When young man after young man is sent home in a flag draped coffin,</v>

131
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.930
I can tell you I had to pull in those rains hard

132
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.190
and I wasn't alone.

133
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.300
I was surrounded by men with the same vengeful farts.

134
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.470
But those thoughts have to be tempered and they have to be controlled or else

135
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.810
everything falls apart.

136
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.920
But those and

137
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.170
<v 1>get revealed because of war</v>

138
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.510
<v 0>in war reveals things about us that otherwise might slip by.</v>

139
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.913
<v 1>Okay?</v>

140
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.700
<v 0>Thing is we might not want to share,</v>

141
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.470
fought that we might not even know are a part of us,

142
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.543
<v 1>okay?</v>

143
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.430
<v 0>But they are a part of us.</v>

144
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

145
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.870
<v 0>And in the end,
war ultimately reveals who we are.</v>

146
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.840
It reveals our nature and thereby reveals human nature itself.

147
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.780
It reveals our psychology.

148
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.480
And you can imagine that understanding all these different actions and reactions

149
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:58.730
from,
from your subordinate leaders,
from your commanders,

150
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.730
from your troops,
from yourself,

151
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.880
there's no way to effectively lead without some understanding of all these

152
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:13.910
people and their nature,

153
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760
people that you must work with in order to accomplish the mission in order to

154
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.633
win.

155
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.260
And while that is crystal clear in a war,

156
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.410
it applies to every undertaking

157
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.900
replies to everything that you try and do.

158
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.180
Knowing the people you work with,

159
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.250
understanding the people you work with,
knowing and understanding your enemy,

160
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.460
knowing and understanding yourself,

161
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.650
knowing and understanding psychology and human nature.

162
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.450
And the better you can do that,

163
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.603
<v 1>yeah,</v>

164
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.890
<v 0>the better you will perform as a team and as an individual</v>

165
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.340
then,
especially as a leader.

166
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.160
<v 0>Andrew,</v>

168
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.810
we spent the last podcast talking about the first part of a book called

169
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.060
psychology for the fighting man.

170
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.830
What you should know about yourself and others.

171
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.170
It's a very straight forward book

172
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:39.030
written in 1942 right as world war two was kicking off.

173
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.920
And on the last podcast we covered the early sections in the book

174
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.810
about things like putting the right people in the right jobs about the

175
00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:50.770
importance of training,

176
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:53.950
about the best ways to teach and learn how to more efficient.

177
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.300
And today we're gonna dive into the second half of the same book,

178
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.700
which gets into some incredibly insightful

179
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.173
<v 1>yeah,</v>

180
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.910
<v 0>and some incredibly revealing topics.</v>

181
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.600
So let's

182
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.200
go back to the book
kicking off with this section.

183
00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:20.200
And it's actually not the,

184
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.820
this isn't actually the second half of the book is probably the last third of

185
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:26.040
the book that we're getting into

186
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.550
and starts off with this section that's about morale.
Here we go.

187
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.170
Morale depends on the incentives to human action on men's motives,

188
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.660
on their emotions and how they react to their emotions.

189
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.080
It can be developed in a military unit by the control of those psychological

190
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:45.871
conditions,

191
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:50.871
which determine men's desires and conduct and affect their attitudes toward one

192
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:54.720
another and toward the great undertaking of winning a war.

193
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.420
And then it rolls into talk about incentives.

194
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.490
Some of these are pretty obvious starting off with hunger.
Hunger is a mess.

195
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.280
Call most sure to be heard.

196
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.590
Pain is an alert.

197
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.800
Seldom missed the most primitive incentives for action,

198
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.760
which man shares with other animals are his bodily needs.
Hunger,
thirst,

199
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.970
sex,
the need for rest when he is tired.

200
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.320
The need for activity when rested,
the desire to escape from pain,

201
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.550
extreme heat,
extreme cold and other intolerable conditions.

202
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:31.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.800
<v 0>It might be possible to control men are animals by the use of these incentives.</v>

204
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.610
You might make a man go hungry until his work is done and then let him eat as a

205
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:42.340
reward.

206
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.340
You might make a man fight by lashing him and then letting up on him as a reward

207
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.663
for fighting,

208
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.730
but that isn't the way that our army works.
Whenever possible,

209
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:58.480
it supplies enough food and rest to its soldiers and makes other provisions for

210
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:02.050
their comfort so that they stay in good spirits and can do their work well,

211
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.440
but in areas,
but in fighting areas,

212
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:10.300
it's not always possible to provide these physical comforts when food or water

213
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:13.090
is short.
When the weather is too hot or too cold,

214
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.700
when it becomes impossible to bathe and shave,

215
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.230
when bombs and shells drive sleep away and fatigue makes a man,

216
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.770
it makes effort,
uh,
torture problems,

217
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:25.600
combat morale arise,

218
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.080
<v 1>okay?</v>

219
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.800
<v 0>And then some other incentive is required beyond,</v>

220
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.860
beyond their animal need to keep men going to make them determined to keep

221
00:14:35.931 --> 00:14:38.060
fighting on two deaf

222
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.880
when the primitive needs are no longer enough.

223
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.940
It is the social incentives which help a fighting man do his utmost.

224
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.650
There are many social needs here are some of them.
So

225
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.330
interesting way to kick it off.
And those are so obvious.

226
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:03.340
We all know those things.
We all know that we,
if we're hungry,
we all know we,
we,

227
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.130
we try and escape from pain.
We all know,
we try and find comfort.

228
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.280
If there's discomfort,

229
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.850
I know you especially know that sure a little bit.
But when those things,

230
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:20.060
you can't always provide those things and it's,

231
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.740
you know what's really interesting?
We're talking about it's just words,
right?

232
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:25.880
It's just words in a book.

233
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.180
Talking about to make them determined to keep on fighting unto death.

234
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.730
Just words.
In a book right now.
But if you think about,
well,

235
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.790
this is world war two,

236
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:39.791
we're getting ready to go and hundreds of thousands of men are going to go and

237
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:41.600
fight and to the death,

238
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.250
and these primitive needs aren't going to be enough to drive.

239
00:15:47.251 --> 00:15:51.270
So here's some social needs that people have.

240
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.380
Number one,
desire for social approval,
admiration,

241
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.390
recognition and appreciation.

242
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.780
<v 0>To desire for security,
safety,</v>

244
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:07.670
escape from danger and disapproval or fears of all kinds.

245
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

246
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.360
<v 0>Number three,
the desire for power,
mastery,
domination,</v>

247
00:16:13.361 --> 00:16:15.730
superiority and self assertion.

248
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.440
Number four,
desire for adventure,
new experience,
freedom.
Escape from futility.

249
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.380
Humdrum.
Number five,

250
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:30.250
desire for personal response,
companionship,
friendship,
love.

251
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.510
Number six,
desire to help and protect others,

252
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.850
especially the weak and helpless such as children.

253
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

254
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.620
<v 0>Number seven,
desire for a successful achievement.
Completeness.
Effectiveness,</v>

255
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.220
the desire to do a good job.
Number eight,

256
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.080
desire to destroy interference with other desires,
aggression,

257
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.750
and rage.
That's uh,
that's,
uh,

258
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.810
it's when you hear,
when I'm reading that list,

259
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.220
I can think of little people that I've known and you know what was driving them.

260
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.170
Yes.
I remember thinking this.

261
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.580
So you think of,

262
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.160
you think of the military as a group of people even I do.

263
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.700
It's a group you think of,
Oh,
it's an army.
It's a battalion.
It's a brigade.

264
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.810
It's a company.
You think of it as a,
as a unit that's working together.

265
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.560
But what I will tell you is these,

266
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.650
these desires right here are so important for the conduct of warfare.

267
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.730
Because when you get down to a battalion level,
a company level,

268
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.690
platoon level,

269
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.700
there's an individual human beings that are driving that thing forward.

270
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.940
And if you didn't have a leader in charge,

271
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560
or it doesn't necessarily have to be the platoon leader,

272
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:51.330
but if you didn't have a platoon sergeant,

273
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:56.250
if you didn't have someone in that organization that was going to drive this

274
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.130
thing forward,
it wouldn't go anywhere.
When,

275
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:02.640
when we do operations overseas and we'd work with the conventional forces

276
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:03.030
overseas,

277
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.030
there was a guy that was making these things happen that had,

278
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.350
that was driven by these types of things,
whether the weather,

279
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.990
some guy wanted to shine and,
and get,

280
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.790
get noticed and he's gonna take his platoon out.
Or whether he realized,
Hey,

281
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:24.270
the best thing I can do for survivability is to get aggressive and go take the

282
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:29.010
fight to the enemy.
All these,
all these things,

283
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:33.690
you can see where they come into play.
And you see the same thing in,
uh,

284
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.860
in civilian organizations when you see what's driving me.
You know,

285
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.250
you ever hear the question of like a rich person,

286
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.210
whatever that means.
But how much is enough?
Right?

287
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.750
There's very few people that become financially successful that go,

288
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:56.520
okay,
you know what?
I'm good.
Okay,
I've got two houses,

289
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.700
three houses,
I've got a bunch of really nice cars.

290
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.410
I've got a bunch of money in the bank,
I'm good,
I'm fine,

291
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.590
I'm done.
That doesn't happen very often.

292
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.080
The folks that they,
they achieve there and then they look up and go,
wait,

293
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.580
I can do some more.
And whether that's,
you know,
just completing a job,

294
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:22.581
like it says the desire to do a good job or the desire to help other people,

295
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.640
hey,
the more money I get,
the more I can give to other people.

296
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.670
Like these things are real and they really drive.

297
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.720
And so when you see a uh,
organization gets stagnant,

298
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.860
you got to look and say to yourself,
which,
how can we fuel this desire?

299
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:42.861
How can we allow this mission to answer some of these desires?

300
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.381
Going back to the book,

301
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:50.070
when a military leader calls a man by name and gives him a simple word of

302
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:52.440
commendation for some task well performed,

303
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:55.800
he's appealing to at least two or three natural incentives.

304
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.940
Calling a man by name shows personal interest,
which almost every soldier likes.

305
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.860
The combination is social approval.
If the soldier has been feeling insecure,

306
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.420
not quite sure of things than perhaps his sense of security is established by

307
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:11.820
the event of his leaders approval.

308
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.260
He also has assurance that he has accomplished a job well done.

309
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.540
That's the thing about that.
All it is,

310
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.240
and I've talked about that a bunch on here where I say,
you know,

311
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.920
sometimes leaders don't realize how powerful it is to say,
hey,
echo,

312
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.580
really good work on that last video.
Pete,
people don't realize her.
Hey,
echo,

313
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:34.581
really good job holding security last night on that position and I've said it's

314
00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:38.100
powerful now it's here's why.

315
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.980
Here's some of the things that that feeds that person,

316
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.870
these desires that they want satisfied get fed when a leader steps down and

317
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.640
gives a combination that back to the book,

318
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:52.390
social approval is a strong motive in human affairs and in general.

319
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.460
Praise is much more effective than blame.

320
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.590
Combination can get results when bollings out fail.
By bowling's out,

321
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:04.030
they mean yelling at people.
Reproof tends to leave resentment.

322
00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.720
It's just so smart.
Blame is often,

323
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:12.670
however effective when used in private and in moderation against a man whose

324
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:16.810
quality performances high for he will work hard to avoid such criticism.

325
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.543
I've always,

326
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.120
I had the luxury of oftentimes we're working with people where if they mess

327
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:25.810
something up,
if they got in trouble,
whatever,
you didn't need it.

328
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.560
I didn't need to do anything I could.
I could just basically say,

329
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.420
I heard what happened and that was enough.
Like they were just never,

330
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.460
they were never going to stop until they corrected that in my eyes.
Yeah.

331
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.283
Yeah.
I could see that

332
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:48.220
a man wants to count to amount to something to feel that he is worth while and

333
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:49.540
appreciated promotion,

334
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.960
citations and distinctions of all kinds of help serve this purpose.

335
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.390
Fear of the disapproval of others or some other form of punishment.

336
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:02.320
Works isn't an an incentive but is not as good as a steady thing.

337
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.640
<v 0>Troops coerced into action by a snapping Martin net become anxious.</v>

339
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:10.120
Disgruntle jittery.

340
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.520
There is a loss and morale and initiative in judgment even in skill.

341
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:16.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

342
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.300
<v 0>Men Do better in groups whether fighting are working and one thing that's</v>

343
00:22:20.301 --> 00:22:21.470
interesting and we're going to get to,

344
00:22:21.471 --> 00:22:25.580
there's a section in this part of the book called leadership and there's a

345
00:22:25.581 --> 00:22:29.600
definite dichotomy and you can,
you can hear it here,

346
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.950
starting to talk about how [inaudible] sometimes it leans towards the

347
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.970
stereotypical military idea of like if I tell you what to do,
you do it.

348
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.770
But every time it leans towards that,
it counters it.

349
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.770
It counters it and says,
look,
if people don't respect you,
look,

350
00:22:45.771 --> 00:22:46.520
if you're not under,

351
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.540
people don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.
Like eat.

352
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.070
It always comes back to the true leadership.

353
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.520
Even though it it brushes up and it converses about some of the stereotypical

354
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.240
military leadership,

355
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.740
if it's certainly every time counters them with real,

356
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.800
true leadership back to the book of soldiers desire to do a good job.

357
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.210
His sense of workmanship has helped whenever he can be allowed to understand the

358
00:23:14.211 --> 00:23:16.340
nature of the whole undertaking,

359
00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:18.500
which he is contributing to which he is contributing.

360
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

361
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.780
<v 0>A successful leader never signs tasks blindly when he can reveal their larger</v>

362
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.673
purpose.

363
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.630
By allowing his men to see the significance of their own smaller jobs,

364
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.340
he dignifies the lesser tasks by relating them to the large one.

365
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.960
This is always make sure your people understand why they're doing what they're

366
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:41.850
doing.
That's what it is.

367
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.100
<v 0>It's a successful</v>

369
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.740
<v 1>leader.
Never assigned tasks blindly.</v>

370
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.920
He mourns to make sure that the subordinates understand the nature of the whole

371
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.890
undertaking to which he's contributing.
This stuff is so important.

372
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.710
Continuing on morale is the capacity to stay on the job,
especially a long,

373
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:06.320
hard job with determination and zest.

374
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.840
It is the opposite of apathy.
Morale needs good health,
physical and mental.

375
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.820
Unless the body is well and vigorous,

376
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:18.050
it is pretty hard to endure hardship and keep up enthusiasm,

377
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.540
fatigue and illness,
PSAP,
mental vigor and more moral strength.

378
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.440
The body does influence the mind.
You,

379
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:30.710
everyone here that the body does influence the mind,

380
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.210
yet there is more to morale than that men can carry on with strong
determination,

381
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.090
sometimes even with zest through injury,

382
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.490
disease and physical privation

383
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.710
<v 0>for that sort of morale.</v>

384
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.950
A man needs self confidence and conviction.

385
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.940
He needs to feel sure of himself and emotionally secure.

386
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.410
While there are no simple rules for obtaining this sense of security and

387
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:58.620
confidence when the world is blowing up around your ears,

388
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.170
some of the conditions that bring it are known.

389
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

390
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.280
<v 0>It helps to have grown up in a home where there was no coralling or jealousy.</v>

391
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:12.281
It helps to have friends and to be working or fighting in a group.

392
00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:16.790
It is essential for the job to seem important for can be related to some of the

393
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:18.650
incentives to cumin action,
uh,

394
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:23.120
fought full man may need to see the job in its larger relations to fit into a

395
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.410
philosophy of life.

396
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.940
To make it a means of satisfying his own code of what is good and desirable.

397
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.710
He may need to take a long range view that extends beyond his own lifetime and

398
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:38.600
perhaps into another world.
All incentives to human action,

399
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.820
our potential morale builders.

400
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.720
There's a back and forth relation between work and morale.

401
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.310
Not only does morale make soldiers work in fight,
working in fighting,

402
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.080
keep up their morale.
Somebody in the last,
the last podcast,

403
00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:00.110
somebody on Twitter just just hammered out quotes from this book and I was

404
00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:04.780
reading them,
rereading them,
cause I'm reading this whole book and immerse.

405
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.800
We reading these quotes and there's so many awesome quotes in this book.

406
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.200
You could just make a book of quotes from just this book.

407
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.930
That's one of them though,
right?

408
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.070
Not only does morale make soldiers work and fight,
working in fighting,

409
00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:23.640
keep up their morale.
It's 100% true,

410
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.920
especially in times of emotional stress as in battle.

411
00:26:26.921 --> 00:26:30.450
Does a man need to to be doing things?

412
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.440
As for work alone,
men are not naturally lazy.

413
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.310
People like to work in forced idleness is a cruel punishment.

414
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.770
It has been shown again and again.
That person's with useful jobs to do in air.

415
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:46.470
Raids are unlikely to be afraid of bombs.

416
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.830
They are busy and the morale is good.

417
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.580
They carry on because they have important and useful work to do.
Actually,

418
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.050
they feel secure.
Even an air raid,
which is a strange place to feel secure,

419
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.950
it is the same with trained soldier in the midst of combat.

420
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.530
That stuff,
his brilliance right there.
That's brilliance.

421
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.030
That's why you have standard operating procedures.

422
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:13.920
That's why you have an immediate action drills when when you get attacked by the

423
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:14.490
enemy,

424
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.900
everyone knows what their job is supposed to be and it doesn't even allow them

425
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.840
time to be scared.
I have one

426
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.940
parachute failure where I pulled my reserve parachute and I got to the ground

427
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:33.090
and people,
oh you,
you know,

428
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.820
because all my buddies that I was jumping with at the time,

429
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:39.870
we were all kind of the same level except for maybe one guy that had a ton of

430
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:44.820
jumps,
but all my friends,
all my platoon mates were all,

431
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.780
bro,
you pulled your reserve.
And I was like,
yeah,
yeah.
And they were like,
Bro,

432
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.620
was it sketchy?
And I was,
you know,
I said,

433
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.210
I thought about it and said,
no,
I did what we trained to do.
You know,
arts look,

434
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:00.660
Grab Luke Rockhold pole check,
check.
I did what the procedure says to do.

435
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:04.530
That's what I was thinking about.
That's what I was focused on.
That's what I did.

436
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.880
So when you have something,
if I didn't have a protocol to follow,

437
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.520
it's like my bears are going to fail.

438
00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:15.000
I'm going to die in 12 seconds or whatever it is.
Like you're dead in 12 seconds.

439
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:18.000
If something good doesn't happen real quick,
Brad,

440
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:22.170
it's not even 12 seconds cause you're at 2000 feet and you're fallen.
Yeah.

441
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.130
It's not very much time.
You're going to be dead pretty quick is what I'm saying.

442
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.210
And I didn't even think about it and I got to the ground and it wasn't my,

443
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.020
it's like my adrenaline didn't even move because you're doing what you're

444
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:37.950
supposed to do.
Yeah.
Like you and in you.

445
00:28:37.951 --> 00:28:40.170
And obviously we're thinking about it,

446
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.820
<v 2>not in the situation.
So yeah,
it's all scary.
I mean you pull one shoot,</v>

447
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.530
it doesn't work.
And I'm saying outside of the,
the procedure,

448
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.270
the,
I'm seeing the facts of the reality of the situation you pull once you,

449
00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:59.230
it doesn't work proof that parachutes don't work to you right then and there

450
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.620
proof,
oh,

451
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.230
if you want to start digging up your head real deep down thought but about

452
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.200
though and then now guess how many shoots you only have left one.

453
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.390
You already witnessed firsthand one shoot failed foreign,
this parachute jump,

454
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:17.860
you're 100% fail rate and you only got one more chance.
Yeah.

455
00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:20.640
Within 10 seconds or whatever,
you know.

456
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.390
So really your brain is like,
yeah,
this is it.
You know,
if,

457
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.240
if you think of it that way,
but yeah,
if your mind is occupied with okay,

458
00:29:28.241 --> 00:29:30.970
procedure,
procedure,
procedure and then you just do,
do,
do,
do.

459
00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:34.780
And then it's like you don't have time to be scared about anything unless

460
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.750
they're,
you know,
if the second one fails then it's different obviously.
But,
um,

461
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.710
you know,
you,
you,
yeah.

462
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.750
Your doesn't have room to start making all these,
uh,

463
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.620
these fearful assessments,
you know,
action

464
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.810
<v 0>taking action is a real positive thing in so many situations.</v>

465
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:56.380
When you start the feeling fear,
you got it,

466
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.900
<v 2>do something,
you've got to step up and do something that's like,
you know,
in,</v>

467
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:04.660
in like a Jujitsu tournament or w or whatever,
like a competition situation.
Um,

468
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:09.830
I would imagine it'd be like the CV if you're talking publicly or whatever

469
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.580
before you do it.
Like,
okay.

470
00:30:11.581 --> 00:30:14.730
Before when I used to compete a lot in Jujitsu before I'm like,
oh my gosh,

471
00:30:14.731 --> 00:30:16.350
like you're anxious and you just like,

472
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.150
the feeling beforehand is like way different than when was right when he says

473
00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:24.380
start.
Once it started you don't,
we're just anymore.
Yeah,

474
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.720
which you do every day anyway and kind of thing and cause you know what to do

475
00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:29.550
and that's what your mind is not and you're not feeling like,

476
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.580
even though you don't even know this guy,
he never even seen this guy before.

477
00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.280
So you didn't know what mystery this guy holds.
You know?

478
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.910
I'm just saying that's kind of what you're thinking before you go on,
but once,

479
00:30:38.911 --> 00:30:41.400
once you,
yeah,
for sure.
Hesitation is the,

480
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.120
is the moment that you have to overcome for fear and action.

481
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.780
<v 0>We'll help you do that.
Back to the book.</v>

482
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.050
If an officer wants to assess the morale of his own unit,

483
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:55.360
there are at least two things for him to do.

484
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

485
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.450
<v 0>He can listen.</v>

486
00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:58.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

487
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.770
<v 0>Men will talk when permitted or encouraged to and they will some times speak</v>

488
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:04.210
freely.
When they do,

489
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.910
they give their leader information that will enable him to answer these

490
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:11.440
questions.
Do the troops feel like they are being well trained,
well led?

491
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.160
Do they think their weapons are adequate?
Do they want to try and get the enemy?

492
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.180
Are they proud of their unit?
Do they have suggestions for improvement?

493
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:22.030
Do they have,
do they think they'd get fair treatment?

494
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:23.350
Fair chances for advancement?

495
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:26.080
Are they worrying about anything back home or what about what will happen when

496
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:30.460
the war's over from the answers to questions like these and officer can usually

497
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.590
estimate accurately the morale of his unit.

498
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.230
He can also study the behavior of his men.

499
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.880
Are they ready to volunteer for special duty?
Are they frequent?

500
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.810
Are there frequent violations of discipline?
How many are a wall?

501
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.520
How many in the guard house?
What is the rate of venereal disease?

502
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.650
How do they receive bad rumors?

503
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.100
Are there many fights and are the flights based on religious or racial

504
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:54.970
differences?

505
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.750
Morale building is the primary task of leadership.

506
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:06.220
Actually it says a primary task.
Morale building is a primary task of leadership.

507
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.700
The leader,
any leader trying to improve the morale of his unit,

508
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.860
we'll find these rules helpful.

509
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.570
So one of the main things you have to do as a leader is keep morale up.

510
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.680
No doubt about that.
If your morale falls apart inside of a team,

511
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.200
you're in a bad situation.

512
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.550
And here's some things to help you improve.
Morale.
One,

513
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:35.230
make each man feel he is needed by US unit that his job as important.

514
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.650
Two,

515
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:41.840
never let a man forget he is a soldier and that a soldier of the United States

516
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.950
army is an important and respected person.
Three,

517
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:51.070
make it very clear that the unit has its own important function in winning the

518
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:56.201
war for encourage the expression of pride in the achievements of the unit.

519
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.130
<v 1>Okay,</v>

520
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.820
<v 0>five give commendation and encouragement when it consent,</v>

521
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.300
when it can sincerely and appropriately be given for fair appreciation usually

522
00:33:08.581 --> 00:33:10.650
works better than calm condemnation.

523
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:16.970
Six never belittle or humiliate a man in front of others except when a military

524
00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:22.011
emergency as in battle may require quick correction when rebuke is necessary.

525
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.810
Do it in private and make clear,

526
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.520
make it clear that it is the act that is punished,

527
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.510
not the man.

528
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:37.410
Seven keep idleness at a minimum but make recreation possible little dichotomy.

529
00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:44.650
You have to balance their train each man in every useful task and action that

530
00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:48.790
actual combat will require and teach him that these habits will reduce his fear

531
00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:53.110
when combat comms as well as make him a trained and able fighter.

532
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:59.350
Nine let men work together in groups whenever possible because the social

533
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:04.351
relation increases effectiveness and 10 but the soldier on isolated duty feel

534
00:34:04.841 --> 00:34:07.990
that he isn't an indispensable man,
not a forgotten one.

535
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.910
Great advice there.
How often,

536
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.190
and this is something I've talked about,
I always,

537
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.830
the way I used to say this is ice.

538
00:34:19.831 --> 00:34:22.570
I would say I want every person in my platoon think that their job was the most

539
00:34:22.571 --> 00:34:25.180
important job in the scope too,
right?
I want the point man to think,

540
00:34:25.181 --> 00:34:28.810
hey point man.
If you,
if you don't know where you're going,
everyone's lost.

541
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.110
You got the most important job and the platoon commander,
Hey,

542
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.900
this is your patrol.
You're the guy in charge.
You're,

543
00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:37.690
they've got the most important job and the radio man.
Hey radiomen.

544
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.590
If something goes sideways out there,

545
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.740
it's you with your ability to communicate with air assets and other support

546
00:34:47.201 --> 00:34:48.640
elements that are going to save everyone.

547
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.360
You're the most important guy and in the medic,
hey,

548
00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:55.150
if someone gets shot year of the guide,
it's like I go right on down the line.

549
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.360
Everyone thinks and what's what's,

550
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.530
I'm not,
I'm not lying to them.
I'm actually telling them the truth.

551
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.830
I'm actually telling the truth.
In critical situations,

552
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.170
someone in that platoon is going to be the most important person.

553
00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:14.590
It's not the same all the time.
I'm telling them the truth.
The truth is,

554
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.820
if you're the radio men and you're getting overwhelming enemy fire,

555
00:35:18.821 --> 00:35:22.900
and that radio man can reach out and drop bombs on the enemy keys,

556
00:35:22.901 --> 00:35:24.940
the most important guy in the platoon without question,

557
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.700
if you're trying to get to an extract point,

558
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.920
who's going to get to get your platoon out of there?

559
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.070
Then the point man is the one that knows where he's going and no one else knows

560
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.940
that point man is most important.
The person,
when you're in a machine gun fight,

561
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.790
when you're in a gun fight,
it's the machine gunners.

562
00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:42.750
They go to lay down fire and allow you to cover and move and close with and

563
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:44.970
destroy the enemy.
It's the machine gunners most important.

564
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.860
You take away the machine guns and a soup,

565
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.800
then you've got a real problem on your hands.
So I'm not lying to anyone.

566
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.150
I'm telling him the truth.

567
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.120
The truth is that you have the most important job in this platoon.

568
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.420
<v 1>Okay?</v>

569
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.253
<v 0>That's the truth.</v>

570
00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:01.590
And when people hear that man date's important to,
oh yeah,

571
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.610
<v 1>okay,</v>

572
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.570
<v 0>and he goes back.</v>

573
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.070
The book goes back in making sure that everyone understands how important,

574
00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.773
what the,

575
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.900
what the unit is doing to the strategic victory and talking about pride in

576
00:36:20.361 --> 00:36:21.650
unique expression that the,

577
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:26.570
we were overseas and like army units would have their battle streamers that they

578
00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:27.410
bring from.

579
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.010
They bring historical documents and hang them up on the wall and they're in

580
00:36:31.011 --> 00:36:32.990
their make makeshift op center

581
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.570
from World War II and hanging them up poster or paid newspaper clippings from a

582
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:42.980
world war two and they're hanging them up.
This is our unit.

583
00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.810
This is what we've done.
We are upholding tradition.
We have pride in what we do.

584
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.830
So awesome.
Yeah.
It's a real thing.
Yeah.

585
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.770
Next little section is about zest.

586
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.700
Zested the fabric from which morale is made,
zest,

587
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.020
vigor of spirit,

588
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.280
love of life coupled with a willingness and eagerness to risk life itself in a

589
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:06.180
good undertaking,

590
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.880
a spirit of high adventure that turns a difficult mission into a rare chance to

591
00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:14.670
show the stuff of which men are made.

592
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.540
This is the weapon that makes a military unit unbeatable.

593
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

594
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:28.220
<v 0>Think of a mission as a rare chance to show the stuff of which men are made</v>

595
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:34.010
highly motivated.
Zest depends.
First,
upon physical fitness,

596
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:39.650
it demands a sharp appetite that will make a soldier eat plentifully and digest

597
00:37:39.651 --> 00:37:40.011
his food.

598
00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:43.880
It requires physical exercise that brings plenty of oxygen into the lungs and

599
00:37:43.881 --> 00:37:47.930
plenty of red blood circulating to the brain and back to the hands and legs.

600
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.940
If a man is to meet the sunrise with any sort of spirit for the new day,

601
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.620
he must have slept at night,

602
00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:59.621
sound and undisturbed by anxious dreams within him or by vermin in his bed.

603
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.570
Fatigue can quickly reduce a fighting spirit.

604
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:05.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.170
<v 0>The symptoms of mental fatigue,
whether in the air or on the ground,</v>

606
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.310
are a staleness,
a lack of interest in the job to be done.

607
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.020
Lack of enthusiasm,
enthusiasm,
a heaviness of limbs,
eyelids,

608
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:24.290
even of the will that makes it well nigh impossible to drag through the day's

609
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:29.550
duties and with it,
shortness of temper,
irritability,

610
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.140
and for blues.

611
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.840
All leaders have to be constantly on guard against this insidious spiritual

612
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.180
fifth columnists among their men and among themselves,

613
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.790
regardless of how invaluable the man,

614
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.440
when fatigue is made at this attack on his fitness,
he must have relief.

615
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.420
He must be required to sleep,

616
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.500
to take respite from responsibility to get away from the strain he has been

617
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.670
under.
Otherwise,

618
00:38:57.671 --> 00:39:02.671
the price is a psychological casualty and the more important demand,

619
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.800
the greater the cost to the army.

620
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.180
<v 1>Okay?</v>

621
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.990
<v 0>Make sure your people are getting some rest as much as you can.
And again,</v>

622
00:39:11.991 --> 00:39:14.960
this book counters these things all the time by saying,
Hey,

623
00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:16.130
there's some times where you're not going to be,

624
00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:17.990
people aren't gonna be able to rest.
That's the way it is.

625
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.390
So then we should have to do is you have to understand,

626
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.220
you have to understand that that's what this book is about.

627
00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:24.500
You have to understand now,
what are the risks involved?

628
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.610
Now we've got a unit that is severely fatigued and battle worn.

629
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.870
What are the risks?

630
00:39:29.871 --> 00:39:32.810
They're not going to be able to fight as well as they did when they were fresh.

631
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:33.783
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

632
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.550
<v 0>If you don't know that,</v>

633
00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:38.730
perhaps you send them in the front line to another battle.
If you know it,

634
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.880
you take another group that was in the rear and you send them the front line.

635
00:39:41.881 --> 00:39:44.280
You let the guys that are fatigued to be the reserves.

636
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:49.200
That's why if the no one understand these things,
hmm.
Back to the book.

637
00:39:49.201 --> 00:39:54.201
Excessive physical discomfort can also eventually deaden all zest for life and

638
00:39:54.421 --> 00:39:56.760
for battle.
Men can fight with their socks,

639
00:39:56.761 --> 00:40:00.180
stiff with dirt or frozen to their feet with hands,

640
00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:02.970
so swollen and crack that they can barely pull a trigger.

641
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:08.570
They have fought when the baths are unknown and shaves are almost a scarce when

642
00:40:08.911 --> 00:40:12.840
marching must be done through cs of mud and clothing never dries.

643
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.920
And when the eyes are cut and lungs are choked with never settling.

644
00:40:16.921 --> 00:40:21.921
Clouds of dust and sand men have fought and are fighting under such conditions.

645
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:23.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

646
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.600
<v 0>But it takes an unquenchable spirit to keep execed.
When things are like this,</v>

647
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.060
whole armies have shown this spirit,

648
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.120
but such conditions prolonged get zest in the end and therefore must be relieved

649
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.960
whenever possible.

650
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.840
When a man has his first encounter with the immediate threat of death,

651
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:48.190
when he must kill and see men killed,

652
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:53.020
when he must steal himself to hear the unheated cries of the mortally wounded

653
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.120
and endure the stench of battle,
a man may become sick in his very vitals.

654
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.210
He may lose interest in his food.

655
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.490
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.740
<v 0>and yet this will be no sign of squeamishness.</v>

657
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:10.590
The toughest of Leathernecks may feel intensely the inward revolting in horror.

658
00:41:10.591 --> 00:41:12.990
The battlefield can provoke.

659
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

660
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.870
<v 0>The defenses against these physical and mental foes of the spirit,</v>

661
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.580
our faith in good leaders,

662
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:24.530
a loyalty to them and to comrades and a shoulder to shoulder feeling of

663
00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:27.140
solidarity with the other men of the outfit.

664
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:33.010
I can go anywhere and stand anything my captain and the rest of my outfit can

665
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.370
got to set that good example.

666
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.020
Fear ally or trader.

667
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.270
The first battle,

668
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.260
the first experience of having an enemy machine gun aimed at you the first time

669
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:52.040
an airplane swoops low to lay it's deadly eggs and your particular patch of

670
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:52.874
ground.

671
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.230
That is an experience anticipated by the young soldier with mingled dread and

672
00:41:57.231 --> 00:42:01.250
eagerness.
He is eager by that time to get at the enemy.

673
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.820
He has learned a great deal about the science of war and wants to use this

674
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:07.070
knowledge to wipe out the enemy and gain victory.

675
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.310
But he always wonders every man does just how he will behave when the time

676
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:17.630
comes.
He doesn't feel like a hero.
If he is honest,

677
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.980
completely honest with himself,
he knows he will be scared,
terrified.

678
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.140
The experienced soldier who has been through all this the first time in many

679
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:31.940
other times has found out for certain that every man going into battle as
scared,

680
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.730
his hands tremble,
his throat is dry.

681
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.060
He must swallow constantly because his heart is in his mouth.

682
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.710
He does idiotic things like looking at his watch every few seconds or examining

683
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:44.690
his rifle a hundred times to be sure it is loaded.

684
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.070
The soldier green to battle may think he's the only one so disturbed,

685
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.100
but it is true of all the veteran as well

686
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.550
and it is true of the enemy.

687
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.840
Germans and jabs get just as scared as Americans and British.

688
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.500
The bad moments do not come during actual combat.
However,

689
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.420
but in the time of tense waiting just to be for,

690
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.520
as you just talked about,
echo,

691
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.080
as soon as the frightened man is able to go into action to do something

692
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:21.950
effective against the enemy,
especially if it involves a violent physical action,

693
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.330
his fried is apt to be dispelled or forgotten because he's too busy fighting to

694
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:27.164
remember it.

695
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:33.610
And this is great propaganda to talk about because what they're basically,

696
00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:39.230
they're given this book to young soldiers that are getting ready to go and fight

697
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.990
and what they're telling him is,
look,
you're going to be scared.

698
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:43.040
Everyone's scared.
It's fine.

699
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.520
So that way they don't get scared and freak out because they're scared.

700
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.970
Airplane pilots who had distinguished themselves in action against the Japanese

701
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:57.971
said when asked whether they were scared during those moments of acute peril,

702
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.630
why?
I don't know.
There was too much to do.
We didn't have time to think.

703
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.480
Most were scared at first,
wrote a member of a torpedoed ship.
Sure we were.

704
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.830
But when the torpedo hit us,
we forgot all about it.
There wasn't much time.

705
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:17.330
And then there was much work to do.
It's another thing when you,

706
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.620
and it's going to go into this,

707
00:44:18.621 --> 00:44:22.280
but when you're a leader and things are going bad,

708
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.860
give people something to do,
right?
Give them a direction.
Give them an order.
Say,

709
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:30.860
look our,
this is what we're going to do right now.
I don't know about that,

710
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:31.920
but what we're gonna do,

711
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.990
we're gonna move all these chairs and to get them into this world where you
know,

712
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.450
whenever you figured out something to do and do it.

713
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.060
<v 3>Okay.</v>

714
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.480
<v 0>Encounters with the enemy are most terrifying.
When they are unfamiliar,</v>

715
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:44.010
the soldier becomes used to gunfire,

716
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:47.700
the explosions and to the site and odor of death or sorry,

717
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.850
as the soldier becomes used to gun fire explosions and the sight of older side

718
00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.621
and odor of death,

719
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.770
he gradually acquires the power to meet these things more stoically.

720
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:57.390
He does not actually lose his fear,

721
00:44:57.391 --> 00:45:01.470
but learns to ignore it sufficiently to keep his attention mainly on the

722
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:05.580
business of combat.
And if he has in his train,

723
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:09.960
hands of good weapon,
which he knows,
we'll put the enemy out of action.

724
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:11.580
This gives him a feeling of confidence,

725
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:15.720
a sense of power that in large measure outweighs his fear.

726
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:20.640
He knows it will soon be the other fellows turned to be scared.

727
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:23.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

728
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:29.040
<v 0>Fear when experienced is intensely uncomfortable and seems to often to be</v>

729
00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:33.700
incapacitating.
If the period of fright is Paul prolonged,

730
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.000
a man may feel that his nerves are all shot by it.

731
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.610
For fear is disintegrating,
demoralizing.
It shatters morale.

732
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.650
The soldier may be rooted to the spot,
paralyzed or immobilized by fear.

733
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:48.491
Nevertheless,

734
00:45:48.491 --> 00:45:53.491
such awful moments before an attack when each second seems an hour may actually

735
00:45:54.191 --> 00:45:58.930
be useful to any soldier they may really add to his efficiency.

736
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.270
For fear is the body's preparation for action.
The heart pounds,

737
00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:08.680
faster,
blood pumping more rapidly to the arms and legs and brain where oxygen is

738
00:46:08.681 --> 00:46:13.210
needed,
belongs do their part by quick and breathing.
Blood pressure goes up.

739
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:13.931
Adrenaline,

740
00:46:13.931 --> 00:46:17.500
which is nature's own shot in the arm is pro poured liberally into the

741
00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:18.334
bloodstream.

742
00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.740
Subtle changes in body chemistry automatically affected by powerful emotion.

743
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.330
Serve to protect the soldier.

744
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:29.290
Inaction in ways you would never think of if he had to plan them himself,

745
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:34.060
his blood clots more rec readily,
he loses temporarily sense of fatigue,

746
00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:36.130
even though he may have been dog tired.

747
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.990
It is sometimes difficult for a tense frightened soldier to get started into

748
00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:44.620
combat to begin the action will relieve his fear.

749
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.270
That part is taken care of by army training and discipline.

750
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.400
Months of training of taught the soldier respond from habit to definite battle

751
00:46:54.401 --> 00:46:59.320
orders.
Even though in battle commands often cannot be given as in training,

752
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.540
it has become second nature to him to carry out his own job as a member of the

753
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:06.610
fighting team.
So there you go.

754
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:10.540
This is also important when you recognize,

755
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:11.620
when you know what's going to happen,

756
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.490
it allows you to not be scared that you're scared,
right?

757
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.730
So all of a sudden your breathing starts going faster and you feel the

758
00:47:18.731 --> 00:47:19.990
adrenaline going through your system.

759
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.030
If you don't know what's happening and then it might,

760
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.480
it might catch you off guard.
Yeah,
but if you know what's happening,
well cool.

761
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:30.370
That's my adrenaline.
You know when you have,
when you feel adrenaline.

762
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.880
Actually go through your system,
like,
um,

763
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.660
let's say you're driving and somebody pulls out in front of you,

764
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:40.300
almost crashed into it too,
right?
And you can,

765
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:44.620
you can feel the adrenaline go down your arms and your legs or you felt that

766
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:45.454
before.
Oh yeah.

767
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:50.350
So if you don't have any idea what that is and it happens,

768
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.130
you might scare you a little bit.
What you know,
what it is,
you're kind of,

769
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.790
you're kind of good with it.
Yeah.
It's like you,
it's helped people.
I mean,

770
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:01.750
not enough.
I don't know the actual

771
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.340
<v 2>process,
but you know,
Holly come,
yeah.</v>

772
00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:09.300
When you tense up before you do something right and you feel your heart beating

773
00:48:09.301 --> 00:48:12.320
all fast and stuff like that,
if you know,
okay,
you know,
I'm,

774
00:48:12.321 --> 00:48:16.200
I'm getting excited because of this event that's big in my mind or whatever.

775
00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.670
But if you're like,
if you don't know or you're like,
what?
I'm losing it.

776
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.340
I feel like I'm losing it right now.
You know?
Like if you're,
I dunno.
Yeah.

777
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.970
And you know,
if you're about to go skydiving or something different for you,

778
00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:31.440
obviously,
but the normal person before they jump out of an airplane,
you know?

779
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.190
Yeah.
Oh my gosh,
I'm losing it.
I can't.

780
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:37.200
<v 0>And that's what a lot of the military training that you go through is to get</v>

781
00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:42.120
yourself,
hey,
when you,
when you start the fast road roping out of a helicopter,

782
00:48:42.121 --> 00:48:43.800
when you're repelling off of,
uh,

783
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.670
off of the side of a cliff or out of a window in an urban environment,

784
00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.640
or you're parachuting,
static land,
parachute free,
fall,
parachute,

785
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.090
all these things that you do when you first start doing them,

786
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.600
there's like an adrenaline rush,
but you just get used to it.

787
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.330
And so then by the time you're getting shit,
by the time we're getting shot at,

788
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.110
you're like,
oh yeah,
I know what this is.
I'm good.
Yeah.
I can carry on.
Yeah.

789
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.481
Back to the book.

790
00:49:06.481 --> 00:49:11.481
No matter how distracted your mind may be by unfamiliar in terrifying sights and

791
00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:16.710
smells and sounds,
you act from sheer force of habit.

792
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.430
In fact it is habits which take care of a man.

793
00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:24.780
If he is too frightened to think clearly like the habit of diving for cover when

794
00:49:24.781 --> 00:49:28.800
bombs come down then presently you are an action.
You are fighting.

795
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:29.820
<v 3>Okay,</v>

796
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.210
<v 0>you are at last using your force against the foe.</v>

797
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:37.500
No more are you a depressed,
frightened soul,
fears,
forgotten,

798
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.760
provided your well trained

799
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.750
good to teach people the how to respond in certain situations like he didn't.

800
00:49:45.751 --> 00:49:47.640
You know when he comes to the self defense,

801
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.820
hey if you get attacked,
here's what happens.

802
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:55.570
Here's what you do when they just have that plan that's worth a lot.

803
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.420
Just having a plan is worth a lot.
Somebody grabbed you here,

804
00:49:58.421 --> 00:50:01.060
this is your reaction.
Somebody grabs you there.
This is your reaction.

805
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.050
You know those things they if you see him out of context,

806
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.940
like if you watch ah Gracie defense video out of context,

807
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:12.880
you'll say well it's going to be hard for that particular movie.

808
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.450
It's if you go watch like a mic Dojo,
self defense,
then you go,
that's just the,

809
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.940
obviously that's never going to work.

810
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.900
But even you watch a Gracie self defense thing out of context,

811
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.060
you don't understand it.
You might be like,
well,

812
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:28.010
I don't know how that's gonna work,
but it's a

813
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.450
<v 4>plan that you're going to take action and it is an effective plan.</v>

814
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:34.310
By the way,
it's not like it's not a good plan,

815
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.000
but the fact that you are going to immediately take action,

816
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:41.090
you're going to respond to the event immediately.

817
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.090
It's going to put you in a totally different place and a much,

818
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.630
much infinitely better place.
Then I just got,
you know,

819
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:52.660
someone just grabbed me by the head or by the arm and I have no idea what to do.

820
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.410
That's a bad situation.
Then that fear is going to rise.
If you have a reaction,

821
00:50:57.411 --> 00:51:01.460
boom,
you go and action and then the,
he talks about like training,
right?
If you,

822
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.320
you know,
the well trained person,

823
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.890
it's like you're just so fun because training is just like repetition rate,

824
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:11.600
all these different scenarios,
so you're so used to it.
It's like nothing new.

825
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.900
You're so used to this stimulus or,
okay,

826
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:18.720
remember when you're in elementary school,
they do a fire drill every whatever.

827
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:22.940
Then you just calm,
lead,
stand up and walk out in a single file line.
You know,

828
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:26.690
it's like,
it's kind of boring in a way,
but I mean,

829
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:28.430
we'd never had a fire in my elementary school,

830
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:31.820
but I'm imagining that if the,

831
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.900
once you heard it was a certain speed is a specific belt that went on it instead

832
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:39.320
of the regular bill,
it would go ding,
Ding,
Ding.

833
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.680
It was obviously a fire drill,
you know,
when you heard the bell.

834
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:47.000
So it was so ingrained in,
well in me anyway.

835
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.280
I'm sure everyone else felt the same way as a kid.
Um,

836
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.720
when you heard that you were like,
oh,

837
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:55.460
you just sorta automatically like a Zombie stand up and line up.
Like,
you know,

838
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.830
it was almost like,
yeah,
I was like so automatic.

839
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.720
So I'm assuming that like if a fire actually happened,

840
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.100
your instinct would be to do what?

841
00:52:05.101 --> 00:52:09.440
Just do it normally you wouldn't run and scatter and be all crazy or whatever.

842
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:13.760
You'd just,
cause you're still quote unquote trained just to do it,
you know,

843
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.840
completely.
I guarantee if you look back in the history of school fires,

844
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.020
at some point there was a school fire before they did that training and everyone

845
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:24.680
panicked and freaked out and people died.
Yeah,
well maybe people didn't die,

846
00:52:24.681 --> 00:52:27.830
but people said,
Ooh,
that could have gone bad.
And so then,
oh guess what you do,

847
00:52:27.831 --> 00:52:31.250
you rehearse it,
you trained this bell means stand up moving this direction,

848
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:35.800
go out this door,
assemble in the recess area for head count.
Yeah.

849
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:40.190
In fact,
I remember in college someone pulled the fire alarm.
It was,

850
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.820
it ended up to be a praying,
but everyone's sorta thought that,
oh,

851
00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:46.640
this building is on fire.
Right.
It was in the middle of the night.

852
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:51.760
I don't think I've ever believed a fire alarm in my whole life.

853
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.570
And I'm trying to think if,
no,
wait.

854
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:59.510
I've been in one situation where there was a legit fire,

855
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.240
but I was like completely.

856
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:06.610
Everyone just thought I was super cool and calm.
But I was actually,

857
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.380
and then finally I was,
yeah,
we needed to get out of here.
But yeah,

858
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:15.970
most fire,
cause you think about,
I've experienced a lot of fire alarms and yeah,

859
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.030
there's a very low percentage of them that were real fires.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's,

860
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.950
well,
I mean I guess that's an added element though.
Like if,
if your train,

861
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.220
but you never think

862
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.320
<v 2>it will ever,
ever happen.
I don't know if the,</v>

863
00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.940
I would think that'd be a little bit different because almost like you run the

864
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:36.590
risk of when it actually does happen and you smell smoke or see the smoke or

865
00:53:36.591 --> 00:53:41.100
have see the flames of whatever that might introduce an added element that you

866
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:45.420
weren't expecting,
you know?
Yeah.
So that might jam you up.

867
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:49.570
But nonetheless,
I think like when you go through,

868
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.390
like I remember there,
there was a fire,

869
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:54.360
but it was like way in a different building and it was just procedure.

870
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.340
Everyone evacuate,
you know,
kind of thing.

871
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:59.250
And we found out it was just later or whatever.
So,
yeah,

872
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:02.010
I don't think I ever had the stimulus of the fire,

873
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.750
but in college or whenever,
when,
when I did think that it was on fire,

874
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:09.690
I didn't hear it.
Or I mean I didn't smell it or see it or nothing like that.

875
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:13.890
We all are thought,
obviously we're in no threat,

876
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.560
but because if there's no fire around you than you think.
Yeah.

877
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:20.970
That time to get out.
Yeah.
But it was still the same.
Like no one was panicking,

878
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.840
it seemed like,

879
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.770
<v 0>but I'm just saying there's no,
there's no,
like what we're talking about here,</v>

880
00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:31.030
there's no incentive to run because it's just the alarm and you follow the

881
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.500
procedure.
Yeah.

882
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.030
<v 2>Well yeah.
And then if you,</v>

883
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.750
let's say you're just lining up in a single file line commonly cause you're

884
00:54:38.751 --> 00:54:42.260
supposed to do it calmly.
Meanwhile,

885
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.650
the guy behind you is like choking and getting busy.

886
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.590
<v 0>Sure.
It's on fire.
Right.
You're going to run straight up.</v>

887
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.090
I might try and help him actually the old stop,

888
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.730
drop and roll.
It's old school.
Yeah.
Running.
Well Bro,

889
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:04.130
the fire.
Good point.
Right?

890
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:09.220
It goes into some specifics here,
how to fight fear.
One action dispels fear,

891
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.850
do something and the time is suspense.

892
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:15.210
When men are all ready for action but are waiting for the signal to start,

893
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:19.230
fear is at its height.
If the period of waiting is prolonged,

894
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:21.810
perhaps delay until uh,
uh,
weather changes.

895
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.720
The time should be occupied with preparation for action.

896
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:29.870
Fight fear with necessary or manufactured work when expecting combat,

897
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.250
when waiting for enemy bombers to return manufacturer at work.
Like,

898
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.840
Hey,
you just got to make something up for people to do.
Seems it seems.
Yeah.

899
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.530
Huh.
And he is not hard in combat.
There's always something to get ready.
Right?

900
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.940
So he's not hard to say.
All right.

901
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.820
What we're gonna do is we're gonna set up a couple other bunkers.

902
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:51.540
Let's fill some sandbags.
Cool.
We're all working.
There's always a reason you,

903
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:53.040
it doesn't even have to be manufactured.

904
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:58.041
It can be real to physical contact with friends helps men shoot if at all

905
00:55:58.261 --> 00:55:58.741
possible.

906
00:55:58.741 --> 00:56:02.790
Stay with inside of in time of peril but not bunched up enough to become a bomb

907
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:03.624
target.

908
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.740
Just the presence of another man not far off with no when no word is spoken.

909
00:56:07.741 --> 00:56:10.890
Minimize fear.
Three roll calls help men.

910
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:15.891
Imperils should be reminded that they are not alone for knowledge is power over

911
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:17.670
fear surprises.

912
00:56:17.671 --> 00:56:22.230
The most important element in battle bus men should be constantly kept informed

913
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:26.710
of the dangers they may meet.
That one can be a little bets.

914
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:28.150
A little bit of a tricky one because

915
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:29.710
<v 3>yeah,</v>

916
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.710
<v 0>sometimes people would get a little freaked out when they would hear about what</v>

917
00:56:35.251 --> 00:56:39.030
the enemy can do.
You know what I'm saying?
Like I'll tell you one thing.

918
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:42.600
When when when we were in Ramadi,
it was a lot of ideas,

919
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:47.490
a lot of ids and when,
if someone would come to visit us,

920
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:48.570
<v 3>okay,</v>

921
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.120
<v 0>we and they wanted to come on an operation with us,</v>

922
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.280
we would give like the slightly longer IED brief so that they understood the

923
00:56:56.281 --> 00:57:01.020
threat.
It wasn't always helpful for them.
Psychologically.

924
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:05.070
You could see as the brief went on,
you could see,

925
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.490
I would watch the reactions on,

926
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:10.590
on people's faces and you could see them start getting really concerned because

927
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:15.120
it's just,
you know,
my EOD guy standing nodes,
here's the bomb,
you know,
from,

928
00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.980
this is what it did to this vehicle yesterday.

929
00:57:16.981 --> 00:57:18.930
This is what it did to the de vehicle day before.
Here's what,

930
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.330
here's what it looked like.
Here's one that they found.
Here's what they did.

931
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.441
And it was just,
you know,

932
00:57:22.441 --> 00:57:27.441
slide show of bombs in the city that you're about to go into,

933
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.330
which is not a big city.
It's,
it's two miles,

934
00:57:30.331 --> 00:57:33.780
three miles across snot like we're going and there's a small chance,

935
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.950
and by the way,
there's seven to 10 IED detonated a day on Route Michigan,

936
00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:39.570
one road going across your body.

937
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:44.570
So it was when you tell when people would come to Ramadi and they'd get that

938
00:57:45.301 --> 00:57:48.780
brief,
he would always be sort of an interesting look on their face.

939
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.640
I would see people tapping their toe shaking their leg,

940
00:57:53.641 --> 00:57:56.040
you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
It's like a nervous thing.

941
00:57:56.070 --> 00:58:00.120
I would watch for that and I'd see people just getting all nervous because hey,

942
00:58:00.121 --> 00:58:04.390
it's a real thing.
I mean I get it,
but the guys from t bruiser,

943
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.280
we're kind of adjusted to it.
You know,
they were adjusted to it.

944
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:13.590
Back to the book,
control of action helps to be afraid.

945
00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:16.920
Does not mean that a man must act afraid on this one.

946
00:58:16.921 --> 00:58:21.921
So good to be afraid does not mean that a man must act afraid.

947
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.250
Fear is contagious.
Winded is expressed in action.

948
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.890
If a man goes to pieces and becomes panicky,

949
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.400
he must be removed from the site of other men.
If that is at all possible,

950
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:37.610
it is each man's responsibility to control the signs of his own fear if he can

951
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.920
so as to spare the others.

952
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.730
If he can manage to act as though he were calm,

953
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.460
he may actually become more calm.

954
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:48.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

955
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:51.220
<v 0>At any rate,
the opposite of true is true.</v>

956
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.830
Giving into fear tends to increase it.

957
00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.003
<v 3>Okay.</v>

958
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.280
<v 0>There you go.
It's straight forward.</v>

959
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.800
Don't be shaking your leg during the brief.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

960
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.550
Don't show that you're scared cause that gets contagious.

961
00:59:11.551 --> 00:59:15.570
And other people will start feeling like your,
you've got to act like no factor.

962
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:20.040
Whatever you think they can blow me up.
Bring it.
Yeah,
bring it.

963
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:26.290
You can't be panicking and freaking out and each man is responsible to keep

964
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.410
themselves in check,

965
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:33.080
keep their fear in check and just cause you're afraid doesn't mean you get to

966
00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:37.320
act like it.
Cause I kinda like when when your kids get older you,

967
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.100
well you and your kids get older,
you have to have that conversation with them.

968
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.540
You know I have that conversation with the law.

969
00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.520
You don't get to act like you're scared.

970
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:46.160
You don't even get to act like you're mad.
That's why we play normal face.

971
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.080
You don't get to act like that.

972
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.300
You think you're going to get hit in the head with this thing.

973
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:53.060
Cool deal with it on the inside.

974
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.080
<v 4>You know like when your kid,
when they're young,
young and they fall down.
Right.</v>

975
00:59:59.081 --> 01:00:01.690
Your kid,
your son,
daughter,
whatever,
they fall down.

976
01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.060
Best thing you can do laugh at them or,
yes.
And it's funny cause there was,

977
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:09.670
that was awesome.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a good one.
That idea,

978
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.680
but there's that split second.
When they fall,
they're stunned.

979
01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.290
They're shocked and they look at you with like,

980
01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:22.030
how am I supposed to act right now?
If you're like,
Ooh,
good,
run up to him.

981
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.490
Oh my gosh,
are you okay?
I think it's there every time.

982
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.830
<v 0>That noise that you just made is,</v>

983
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:32.320
is my wife is the absolute greatest at this time.

984
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.250
<v 4>She can make a grown person make you think that you should start crying and</v>

985
01:00:39.251 --> 01:00:41.950
freaking out because she just gives the

986
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.500
cause for alarm.
She causes so much alarm.

987
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.420
<v 0>Married to her for over 20 years.
Yeah.</v>

988
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.750
And we'll be driving.
Oh no way.

989
01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.230
Where we're not,

990
01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.610
we're not talking like a rainstorm on the highway going 60 miles an hour.

991
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:03.560
We're talking just cruising,

992
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.980
just through like a normal area and I'll just speak no relaxed thinking,

993
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.900
paying attention all of a sudden.

994
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.910
<v 4>And you know what she'll say at the end of it and she'll go look at that.</v>

995
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.430
<v 0>Cool.
And I'm thinking,
can you know,</v>

996
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.930
I've been telling her not to do this,
but it's an instinct that she has.
It's a,

997
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.330
it's an instinct that my wife has
and it's,

998
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.280
and now,
you know,
my son doing his driving,

999
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:41.140
like he got his license so he can drive.
Oh.
And he came home the other days like,

1000
01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:46.090
man,
he said,
Dad,
I'm driving with mom and then it's kind of scary.

1001
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:50.410
And I'm like,
why?
What did she do?
I was thinking she was driving.
He goes,
no,

1002
01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:55.390
I was driving,
but I drove by like,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1003
01:01:55.391 --> 01:01:57.240
road and she,

1004
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.770
<v 4>oh,
I can't do,
don't act scared.
Don't do it.</v>

1005
01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.540
<v 0>And,
and for some reason my wife's,
that's,</v>

1006
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:09.650
that's an emotional noise that she makes.
It's not fear.
It's like excitement,

1007
01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.210
everything.
Sometimes it's like I see something cute too,

1008
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.500
just so,
I mean,
I see something.
Why would you do this?

1009
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.980
Or if you see cute,
why

1010
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.940
<v 4>would you go?
Don't do that noise.
Yes,
the wrong noise.</v>

1011
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.570
That noise means I'm about to get in braced for impact.

1012
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:28.950
That's what that noise means.

1013
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.850
Noise means I'm about to get t boned and I have a split second to accelerate out

1014
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:37.200
of the kill zone.
That's what that noise means.

1015
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.600
It doesn't mean look at that cat,

1016
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.100
stop it please.
I don't know if that's it.

1017
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.620
A life thing or what?
Cause my wife is the same thing.

1018
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.480
Same Way and it actually is exactly what this book said where you get like act,

1019
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.050
act scared because it will cause other sax scared essentially right now induce

1020
01:02:58.051 --> 01:03:00.090
panic,
whatever.
Which cause that's what it did.

1021
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.890
That's what your wife for sure to you.

1022
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.900
That's what my wife does to me when she's like,

1023
01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.500
like on the computer and she's like,
oh.
And then I'm like looking around like,

1024
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:08.334
oh what's that?

1025
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.690
Clearly we're all about to die in the next 15 seconds cause we just made that

1026
01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:15.990
noise.
Exactly right.
And that's kind of what goes off for a split second.

1027
01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:20.430
I wonder because I should have been able to deprogram myself and I have a
little,

1028
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.220
I have a little bit,
but it's not full.
It's not a full deep program.

1029
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:23.671
When I hear it,

1030
01:03:23.671 --> 01:03:28.650
I still think imminent threat is within 14 seconds of impact,

1031
01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:32.880
if not three seconds.
Especially when it's out of nowhere.
Like,
oh,

1032
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:35.640
it's totally out of new is,
you know,
we're just driving.
It's a sunny day.

1033
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:36.474
Everything just looks

1034
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.050
so bad.
Don't make that noise unless you're,

1035
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:47.580
unless you see a person with a machete and it gets in the striking position,

1036
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.700
they'll make that noise.
Cause that's what I think.
I think.

1037
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.810
I think Freddy Krueger's with behind me with uh,

1038
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.060
with ready battleaxe getting ready to take my head off.
No,
I don't know.

1039
01:03:58.061 --> 01:04:02.790
Here they have a battle ax.
Weird fingers.
The Nice on the fingers.

1040
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.540
But yeah.
Dang.
That's,
yeah,
good advice.
100%.
You can't,

1041
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.020
I don't know how much you can train yourself with that though.
That's,
no,

1042
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.513
I think that's a,

1043
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:16.970
I think that's a genetic programmed noise that heightens the reaction and

1044
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.890
prepares you for combat situations.

1045
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.330
Cause there's like some reason it's morphed into this thing where it can also be

1046
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:28.890
triggered to make that noise by a cute cat cans.

1047
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:33.780
You know,
whatever.
Yeah.
Or like maybe she forgot something,

1048
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:38.420
you know.
Oh yeah.
That's another one.
I forgot her to tell you.
Oh,
you know,

1049
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.080
our friends are having a baby or something like this.
You know?
No,

1050
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.170
we won't even be that.
It'll be like,
I forgot to tell you.

1051
01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:48.660
I got Billy coming over to work on,
you know,

1052
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.730
yard sprinkler.
Okay,
cool.
Thanks.

1053
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.560
Now that my adrenaline is through the roof,
that's going to happen.

1054
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.810
Check back to the book.

1055
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:04.500
There's another kind of fear that must be endured for days and weeks,

1056
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:09.090
perhaps months or years.
If men are besieged cutoff from help,

1057
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:11.430
deprived of adequate,

1058
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:16.380
deprived of adequate defense than the ever present peril from the enemy may be

1059
01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:18.340
aggravated by the greater peril

1060
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.770
<v 0>of disease,
famine,
exposure,</v>

1061
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:26.140
and there may be little chance for action.
Men and the president wore,

1062
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:30.790
have endured primitive sorts of hardships that would seem to be beyond human

1063
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:35.791
endurance in Bhutan on Corregidor alone on a rubber life raft for five weeks and

1064
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:41.830
blistering sun and drenching storm without food,
without shelter,

1065
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:46.270
without water,
without any aid,
but their own unquenchable spirit,

1066
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.910
their fortitude and their faith.

1067
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:55.090
This means terror mixed with despair.
The misery cannot be relieved.

1068
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:59.140
It can only be endured then they must maintain sanity,

1069
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:04.141
courage and life itself by their ingenuity in originating occupations for hands

1070
01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:09.400
and minds that were leave the tension and seem to reduce the hazards.

1071
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.910
And this is the kind of stuff that captain plumb talked about,

1072
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.080
figuring out stuff to do,
like just we're going to figure out stuff to do,

1073
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:21.040
whether it's,
whether it's make,

1074
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:25.970
teach herself calligraphy by making an ear wax,
a re,
uh,

1075
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:31.660
etch a sketch
or whatever.
I mean these guys,

1076
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.280
those guys figured out things to do back to the book and such trying times and

1077
01:06:36.281 --> 01:06:37.100
intense moments.

1078
01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:41.260
All laugh can be a lifesaver and army officer relating experience of the World

1079
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.130
War.
That's the first world war.

1080
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.500
It tells him what time when badly frightened untrained soldiers of that warrant

1081
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.600
taken refuge in a roadside ditch against an unforeseen horror.

1082
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:53.560
The fire of American guns turned on them by mistake.

1083
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:57.850
Panic sent the blood pounding into my head and emptied my stomach of courage.

1084
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.310
It was bad enough to be shot at by the Boesch,

1085
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:04.270
but there was no sense in being killed by friendly troops.

1086
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.850
My men look wild and fingered their triggers,

1087
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:10.480
ready to return fire of our other battalion.

1088
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:15.640
Something had to be done and done quick and captain wast did it unintentionally,

1089
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:20.080
but he still did it.
Jackson,
he yelled,
yes,
Captain,
where are you?

1090
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.650
Right here across the road.
Stand up so I can see you.

1091
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:28.060
Captain Jackson shouted above the crackling roar of machine gun bullets.

1092
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.090
If you want to see me,
you stand up.

1093
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.810
American humor can lick anything.

1094
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.310
The smothered chuckles ran down the line orders were given and listen to men

1095
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.380
wriggled backwards out of the zone of fire.

1096
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.040
The first to reach the trees dash down the line with third battalion shutting

1097
01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:49.090
off the guns.
So you'll get to hear jokes like that and it is helpful

1098
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:55.030
continuing the soldier who deliberately chooses to be blown up in order to wipe

1099
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:58.810
out an enemy tank or machine gun nest that would have otherwise cost the lives

1100
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:00.670
of his friends as ideals,

1101
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.500
as indeed all it takes to make a soldier the commander of a ship who Cooley

1102
01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:09.400
sends away the last lifeboat and goes down with his vessel rather than abandon

1103
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:13.150
it while some of his men are helplessly imprisoned in one of its compartments is

1104
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:17.420
afraid but governed by something more powerful than fear.

1105
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:24.660
That's a good statement,
isn't it?
Governed by something more powerful than fear.

1106
01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:27.570
What kind of governance do you have over your own emotions?

1107
01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:32.190
That's a good question.
You may call this force idealism,

1108
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.600
conscience,
religion,
philosophy,
tradition,
code,

1109
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:37.980
or even habit.

1110
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1111
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:42.100
<v 0>Or you may be modern and call it ideology.</v>

1112
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.320
Psychologists sometimes call it the triumph of the social over the selfish

1113
01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.183
instincts.

1114
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.990
They recognize this force as the most potent weapon and army can possess men

1115
01:08:52.991 --> 01:08:56.620
fighting for their homes and armed with this spirit can stand their ground and

1116
01:08:56.621 --> 01:08:59.140
win against tremendous opposing forces.

1117
01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:06.740
Next section.
Why men fight lower animals fight from a variety of causes,

1118
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:10.820
some fight because as be slippery,
they live by killing and devouring.

1119
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:13.940
Animals may fight their own kind in a tussle over a mate.

1120
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.750
They fight to defend their young,
their homes or their own lives.

1121
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.440
Some are aggressive and go about seeking what they may devour.

1122
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:23.870
Others fight as a last resort when they're cornered.

1123
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.940
Men being two legged animals may fight for any or all of these reasons,

1124
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:34.190
but because they have minds capable of being moved by abstract ideas such as

1125
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.280
honor,
glory,
freedom,
sympathy,
justice and patriotism.

1126
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:42.550
Men also fight for what they believe to be right greater than fear of injury and

1127
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:47.900
death.
Napoleon said is the fear of shame.

1128
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.060
Before a drafted man throws himself wholeheartedly into his work as a soldier

1129
01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:59.410
before the civilian makes up his mind to enlist in the army he has stirred by

1130
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.180
he's stirred in influenced by one or perhaps many of the following forces.

1131
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.720
He may be carried away by men.

1132
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.840
This is Jesus laying out why people are in the army.

1133
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:11.190
And this is important to understand.

1134
01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:14.010
If you're a leader of a bunch of people in the army and you've got to understand

1135
01:10:14.011 --> 01:10:15.840
how they ended up there.
So if you're in charge of a company,

1136
01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:18.450
you got to understand well how people ended up in a position where they're

1137
01:10:18.451 --> 01:10:21.210
working for you.
Why?
Why are they there?
How'd they end up there?

1138
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.750
He breaks it down for people that join the army.

1139
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:28.110
One he may be carried away by mass suggestion

1140
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.240
and infectious martial spirit spreads through the community roused by government

1141
01:10:33.241 --> 01:10:36.090
officials,
speakers or writers.
Flags are waving,
bands are playing,

1142
01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:39.180
drums are beating and crowds are cheering.
Boom.
Two,

1143
01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:44.180
he may become involved in a wave of war.
Hysteria like the fervor love,

1144
01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:47.460
martial spirit,
war hate is infectious.

1145
01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:51.900
Men rush to arms at news of the enemy's evil designs or brutalities of a

1146
01:10:51.901 --> 01:10:54.150
treacherous assault or intended innovation.

1147
01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:00.980
Three he may be urged on by s strong spirit of adventure for the ambitious self

1148
01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:02.394
centered man,

1149
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:07.290
especially perhaps if he has been unable to achieve success in civilian life,

1150
01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:11.460
may see war as an opportunity to gain personal glory and power.

1151
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.310
Five he may be driven

1152
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:19.200
<v 1>by his own combativeness.
Some men delight and fighting for its own sake.</v>

1153
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:24.030
Some may even be killers at heart because murder is outlawed in civilian life.

1154
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:25.530
And because in many circles,

1155
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:29.220
even taking a poke at a man or cursing him freely is frowned upon.

1156
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:33.810
Some combative men may find their first thrill of release in an attack on the

1157
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:34.644
enemy.

1158
01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:41.100
<v 0>Six he may be unconsciously trying to relieve a grouch by violence that is</v>

1159
01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:43.330
considered legitimate.

1160
01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.080
The man who has spent a lifetime in during unending series of disappointments,

1161
01:11:47.081 --> 01:11:48.250
failures,
and obstacles,

1162
01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:53.560
and who is damned up in himself over every mountain grievances and resentment

1163
01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:57.100
may be able to turn all that ill will against the enemy.

1164
01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:01.720
Seven he may have joined the army as he would apply for a job.

1165
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.310
So the thing about the stark difference between those couple there who got one

1166
01:12:06.311 --> 01:12:09.190
person that just wants to fight people and one person that feels like they've

1167
01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:09.971
been a failure and everything,

1168
01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:13.510
it just kind of has an opportunity to take that grudge out against the world.

1169
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:16.870
Right.
I'm a murderer at heart and you've got another guy that,
hey,

1170
01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:19.600
I joined cause this is,
hey it seems like a good job.

1171
01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.550
They get to pay my GI bill or whatever.

1172
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:24.670
Eight he may be.

1173
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.910
He may have been driven into army life by regard for public opinion.

1174
01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.790
He may feel keenly the way his friends,

1175
01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:35.440
especially the girls regard a military uniform and a fighting man.

1176
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.590
He may hate the thought of being considered a slacker

1177
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.750
nine it may be his desire to maintain his own self esteem that moves him.

1178
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:47.480
He may have to end his secret.

1179
01:12:47.481 --> 01:12:52.340
Shame at the thought that others are doing the fighting forum.

1180
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.160
Ten eight his action may be based on a feeling of oneness with the nation and on

1181
01:12:58.161 --> 01:13:00.470
faith and leaders in the nation's leaders.

1182
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.860
11 he might be acting out of his faith in democracy.

1183
01:13:03.861 --> 01:13:06.890
12 he might be compelled by his spirit of sacrifice.

1184
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:11.180
All these reasons why men joined the army,

1185
01:13:11.181 --> 01:13:15.380
why they accept training in many cases,
why they keep on willingly,
willingly.

1186
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:20.150
When they go on overseas to a fighting front

1187
01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.750
yet by the motives,

1188
01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:27.310
by then the motives usually change or some of them do and here are the chief

1189
01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.370
chief reasons why a man of fights at the front.

1190
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:32.830
So there's a little difference here.

1191
01:13:32.831 --> 01:13:35.140
So this is why they joined and now it's why they're fighting and this is

1192
01:13:35.141 --> 01:13:36.740
something that you hear about this kind of a,

1193
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:40.260
it's a kind of a cliche thing you know is fighting for the guy who's left and

1194
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.350
two is right,
this is this.

1195
01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.380
We're going to go into it a little bit cause that that is what it is and it's

1196
01:13:44.381 --> 01:13:46.630
true.
13 in a unit with good morale,

1197
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.690
he fights out of loyalty to his comrades in his unit.
Boom,
there it is.

1198
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.120
This is important though.

1199
01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:57.900
14 or he may fight because he is led men at the front face danger and are often

1200
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:01.630
uncertain what to do about it.

1201
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.350
This is especially true in a unit with uncertain morale.

1202
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:08.530
It's like I said earlier,
like sometimes the leaders,

1203
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.810
if you've got a good leader that's going to make things happen and could make

1204
01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:11.644
things,

1205
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:12.723
<v 3>hmm,</v>

1206
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.901
<v 0>this is a good one.</v>

1207
01:14:14.901 --> 01:14:19.150
In 15 a finally a man may fight because there's literally nothing else to do.

1208
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.540
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1209
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:25.000
<v 0>And of course everyone uses the word literally now,
literally time.</v>

1210
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:28.240
And if you take it,

1211
01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.070
if you remove that from your brain to to make literally mean what it's supposed

1212
01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:36.130
to mean,
think about the sentence.
Finally,

1213
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.120
a man may fight because there is literally nothing else to do.

1214
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.950
He and his comrades are in the war and at the front in battle,

1215
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.090
no one stops to figure out why he should escape from a burning house.

1216
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:53.980
So with fighting.
So yeah,
there's some people like,
oh yeah,
yes.
What?

1217
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.990
You have two choices,
fight or die and you're going to fight.

1218
01:14:59.100 --> 01:14:59.933
Yeah.

1219
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:06.560
How men meet defeat the way a man stands up to a blow part.

1220
01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:09.630
Leave course depends on how heavy the blow.

1221
01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.620
When a man is faced with a very difficult problem or a series of them with any

1222
01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:15.480
sort of obstacle or frustration,

1223
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:18.420
when things become too difficult or three sorts of things he can do,

1224
01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:19.680
he can work at it harder,

1225
01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.950
attacking the problem from new angles with increasing vigor.

1226
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:27.150
He can get mad and attempt to destroy the obstacle or himself or something else,

1227
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.730
and three,
he can give up in despair and runaway

1228
01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:31.543
<v 3>in apathy.</v>

1229
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.820
<v 0>The first way is the way of learning.
Right?</v>

1230
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:36.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1231
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.580
<v 0>When what seems like a good plan is hit upon it is tried.
If this fails,</v>

1232
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.140
there's a signal for more thinking.

1233
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.830
When a good working plan is finally evolved,

1234
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.140
success is achieved and the man is learned,
so that's,

1235
01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:51.010
that's the best thing to do.
Right?
You tried different solutions.
Yeah.

1236
01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:55.740
All this activity is healthy and less the individual.
Oh,

1237
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:57.780
there's a little balance.
There's a little dichotomy here.

1238
01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.080
All this activity is healthy unless the individual become so engrossed with a

1239
01:16:03.421 --> 01:16:04.350
single problem,

1240
01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:08.910
so obsessed by it that he fails to eat or sleep or pay attention to other

1241
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.550
necessary problems,
can't get target fixation.

1242
01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:12.563
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

1243
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:19.410
<v 0>Getting mad over disappointments or failures is generally not profitable,</v>

1244
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.280
is particularly hard on the innocent bystander because of the way men have of

1245
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:30.060
shifting their grouch from the original obstacle to other persons or things.

1246
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:35.660
The man who fails to get a promotion he has been working and longing for,

1247
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.610
doesn't take a poke at the officer who refuse to recommend him.

1248
01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:43.290
Much as he would like to have it out with him and said he's likely to kick his

1249
01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:45.240
buddy in the pants so much that he raised,

1250
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:50.270
if he's so much as raises an eyebrow leaders to make take it out on on offending

1251
01:16:50.941 --> 01:16:54.120
men who then wonder what's eating him.

1252
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:55.803
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1253
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.710
<v 0>Aggression may also be turned inward on to the self.</v>

1254
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.390
Many a man goes about kicking himself usually figuratively,

1255
01:17:06.391 --> 01:17:10.760
but sometimes in real self punishment such as the head or punching or kicking a

1256
01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:12.830
hard object until the flesh is bruised.

1257
01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:18.930
Of course the extreme of self punishment for disastrous failure or frustration

1258
01:17:18.931 --> 01:17:23.310
is suicide,
but mostly suicide is just giving up.

1259
01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:24.803
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1260
01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:27.690
<v 0>If at first you don't succeed,
try try again.</v>

1261
01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.590
This adage may be used to maintain courage,

1262
01:17:31.591 --> 01:17:35.430
but the process is actually governed by natural law.

1263
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:41.130
The number of times man will attempt to accomplish a certain job or to reach a

1264
01:17:41.131 --> 01:17:44.730
certain objective is governed in one direction by the importance of that

1265
01:17:44.731 --> 01:17:49.710
particular success and in the other direction by the effort and pain involved in

1266
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:50.544
trying.

1267
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.620
When the successful achievement means less than the individual to the
individual,

1268
01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:59.280
then the freedom from the strain of trying to attain it,

1269
01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:01.200
any man will abandon the struggle.

1270
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:06.840
Giving up is nature's way of protecting the organism against too much pain,

1271
01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.160
so that's my don't.

1272
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.450
Once you've banged your head against the wall 44 times,
that's enough there.

1273
01:18:18.451 --> 01:18:21.900
You're not going to get through it on the 45th or the 46 of the 47th track.

1274
01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.590
You need to find a different way.

1275
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.633
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

1276
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:27.383
<v 0>that goes on.</v>

1277
01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:32.230
Giving up may mean defeat.

1278
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:33.263
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1279
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.200
<v 0>but it does not always mean surrender.
In most situation.</v>

1280
01:18:37.201 --> 01:18:41.940
What has given up is some particular way of reaching the goal rather than a

1281
01:18:41.941 --> 01:18:44.610
complete abandonment of the objective.

1282
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:50.280
This sort of defeat results in thinking in fresh striving in eventual progress.

1283
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:53.640
A man who has been unable to get a commission in the army main list,

1284
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:57.480
earnest stripes in later reach an officer candidate school,

1285
01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.020
another kind of giving up results in compromise.

1286
01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.940
The original objective is abandoned,

1287
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.800
but another more easily achieved is substituted and this stuff is,

1288
01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.870
this is this.
These are the things that people,

1289
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.210
people get the impression that well from me,

1290
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:18.700
you just never give up.
Never compromise.

1291
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.500
It sounds really cool to say that.
Yeah,
there was no,

1292
01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.440
there was no t shirt back in the day.
Sure.

1293
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.280
It was four h and k rifles.
Yeah,

1294
01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.270
and it said in a world of compromise,
some don't.

1295
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:39.910
It had a picture of like an entry team going into a building and of course you

1296
01:19:41.621 --> 01:19:45.400
hear that and you think that's right.
No compromise effort.
Yeah,

1297
01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:48.070
but here's the problem.

1298
01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.020
No compromise means if you don't win every single time,

1299
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:56.210
you will get defeated and destroyed because you're not going to end.

1300
01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:58.390
The problem with that is you're not going to win every time.

1301
01:19:58.391 --> 01:20:00.670
You're not going to win.
Every argument that you have,
you're not going to win.

1302
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:05.080
Every idea that you put forth isn't going to be the idea that gets selected and

1303
01:20:05.081 --> 01:20:07.680
what you end up being as a person that can't work anyone else.

1304
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.120
Or you end up a person that has one chance at charging machine gun nest and you

1305
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.340
go straight forward up the hill towards the machine gun nest.
And guess what?

1306
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:19.680
Everyone does.
You,

1307
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:24.660
you didn't achieve the mission and everyone is dead.
Now,
if you would have said,

1308
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:28.020
you know what?
We tried,
we lost two guys,
we backed up.

1309
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:31.170
Now we're in covered position and we're waiting for some reinforcements.

1310
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.990
And when the reinforcement show up,
here's the plan.

1311
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.460
We're going to put down covering fire.

1312
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:37.920
We're going to maneuver around to the flank or we're going to get a heavy weapon

1313
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:42.090
in here and we're going to shoot a bazooka at this thing,
whatever.
So this one,

1314
01:20:42.091 --> 01:20:45.990
he's the one in the book where it says,
um,
give up.

1315
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.220
It's not giving up.
It's more like giving up on a certain says,

1316
01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:53.700
giving up does not always mean surrender.
Yeah.

1317
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:55.230
So surrender is like I give up.

1318
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:58.830
Essentially giving up is like giving up,

1319
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:03.840
like just basically stop doing something that's not working kind of thing.

1320
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.460
Right.
Yeah.
We had this question on the podcast is when is it okay to quit?

1321
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:12.250
Yes.
Like defined this thing,
the definition.
That's kind of,

1322
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:17.290
and I had the conversation with the guy that we both know who was,

1323
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:19.680
was making a great effort in a business.

1324
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:24.830
The business was not being successful the way he had envisioned it and it was

1325
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.840
costing him a lot of money.
It was costing him time.

1326
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:32.460
He was putting all of his efforts into it and
you know,

1327
01:21:32.461 --> 01:21:35.880
he literally asked me,
hey man,

1328
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:40.740
if I shift to something else,
is that quitting?

1329
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:46.590
And I said,
it's quitting but it's not surrendering.

1330
01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:47.431
And I actually said,

1331
01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:52.431
what is your goal in his goal was not to be successful in that particular

1332
01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:53.041
business.

1333
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.480
His goal is to spend time with his family and set up a safe financial situation

1334
01:21:57.481 --> 01:21:58.314
for them.

1335
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.440
And he kind of got his wires crossed on thinking that this business that he had

1336
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:08.280
started was the mission wasn't the mission.

1337
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:12.840
The mission was taking care of his family and spending time with his family and

1338
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:14.940
he had was actually failing to do either.

1339
01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.450
So sometimes you have to,

1340
01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:22.530
sometimes you have to make those adjustments.
You have to quit.
You.

1341
01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.150
Just because you quit one plan doesn't mean you surrender.
In fact,

1342
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:30.900
I would get mad at young seals when they would come up with their plan.

1343
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:34.080
They'd use the plan to go hit a training target.

1344
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.830
The plan would start to fail and they wouldn't adapt.
They wouldn't change.

1345
01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:41.580
They'd stick with their plan and I'm not a quitter.
We're going to keep going.

1346
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:44.190
Oh really?
Okay cool.
We'll kill everyone that you have.

1347
01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:47.190
You can do buddy carries the rest of the night out here in the desert I got all

1348
01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:51.540
night.
So it's essentially re when it comes down to,

1349
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:56.190
it's almost like an issue with the language cause like quitting giving up.

1350
01:22:56.191 --> 01:23:00.930
Like these are things that we're kind of trained to think are these are bad

1351
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:02.880
things to quit and give up.
So all you have,

1352
01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.600
I mean in given what he's talking about,
you know,
like nowadays

1353
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:07.930
<v 4>I've heard people use the word pivot,</v>

1354
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.990
like the guy you're talking about with the business,
right?
Pivot.
Yeah,

1355
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.530
I've got to pay a bit.
It's like,
well,
eat,
pivot,
quit,
give up.
I mean,

1356
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.940
I'd rather use the word pivot because it sounds like,
hey,
I'm still on the,

1357
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.550
on the mission,
on the path.
I'm just taking a different direction.

1358
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:26.620
We'd have to come up with a legitimate what never quit,

1359
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:30.550
which is what we're actually taught in the seal teams.

1360
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.520
But then when you say you're never quit,
that means never surrender.
That's what,

1361
01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:38.710
that's what it really means is never lose sight of accomplishing and doing what

1362
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:43.300
it takes to accomplish your longterm strategic goals.

1363
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.670
That's what it really means.
But that doesn't sound as cool as never quit.
Yeah,

1364
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.500
but then and then give up.
Same thing.
They're giving him up means like,

1365
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:55.060
this is too much for me,
or I'm not willing to work hard through it or whatever.

1366
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.300
That's what it feels like it means.
But in this book,
it doesn't mean that,
I mean,

1367
01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:02.260
here's a,
here's a little,
little dichotomy for me that kind of hurts.
And I know,

1368
01:24:02.261 --> 01:24:05.800
I think it's pretty much ego talking,
but I,
when I hear pivot,

1369
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:11.020
I always think,
oh,
things aren't going so well.
Is that good enough?
You know what?

1370
01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:14.110
That sounds kind of a negative connotation,
which is,
which is not good.

1371
01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:18.220
I'm criticizing myself for even having those thoughts because you do have to

1372
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.970
pivot in business.
You do have to pivot in combat.
You can't be like,
oh,

1373
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:24.370
here's what we were trying to do and it wasn't working,

1374
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:27.460
so we're just going to do it harder.
No,
you actually have to say,
hey,

1375
01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:29.380
this isn't working and we're going to make some adjustments.

1376
01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:30.930
We're gonna pivot yet.

1377
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:35.200
And I think that's what that word was sort of introduced to that whole space to

1378
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:38.750
mean because of all these different,
but then here's the thing though on the,
uh,

1379
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:41.380
on the flip side of that,
some guys don't give up.

1380
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.900
They'll straight up give up cause it's too much work and be like,

1381
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:47.380
I'm going to take a new direction and it might be for the pivot towards on,

1382
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:47.561
you know,

1383
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:52.240
more of the more personal stuff or pronoun or some more personal things.

1384
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.050
Meanwhile they surrendered their whole mission.
It too much work.
You know,

1385
01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.900
you can come as easy or quickly here what we're going to pin it or in a pivot

1386
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:05.940
hard if we need to check

1387
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.613
next.

1388
01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.330
Ability to accept a feat in such ways is no fault of character.

1389
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.261
In fact,

1390
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:19.060
a man who can take it and still do as best without bitterness is highly regarded

1391
01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:21.370
in the army and in civilian life.

1392
01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:26.500
But there are other ways of meeting to feet or disappointment that are

1393
01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:30.670
destructive in may result in psychological casualty.

1394
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.920
The familiar sour grapes reaction is what happens in a man who has said his

1395
01:25:35.921 --> 01:25:40.030
heart so firmly on a particular achievement that he can't give it up and face

1396
01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:40.750
the fact.

1397
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:45.430
So he belittles or runs down the very job he wants so much to have.

1398
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:46.481
He says,

1399
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:51.280
pilots are all crazy or fools and the whole flying game as a jip.

1400
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.950
Do we have to talk to good deal,
Dave Burke about that one?
Could do no,

1401
01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:59.380
because,
and that,
that,
that definitely happens.
You know,

1402
01:25:59.381 --> 01:26:01.120
you get someone that's trying to achieve,

1403
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:04.490
you don't even care about a black belt who's not even that big of a deal,

1404
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.260
but cool.
Don't get one because apparently you're not sour,
sour grapes.

1405
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:12.320
You know where that expression comes?
I do not.
Yeah.

1406
01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:17.090
So I didn't need it until I was well into adulthood.
So it's like a old,

1407
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:20.490
what do you call them?
Little feeble.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1408
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.290
What is it when it's like a story that didn't really happen,
but it was a

1409
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.580
super short,

1410
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.580
so this Fox was hungry and I saw some grapes up on the vines.

1411
01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:35.420
Right.
And so the Fox,
I'm like Dang,
there's pretty high so and it's all good.

1412
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:40.060
I'm going to jump up on me,
eat those grapes cause I'm on gay jumps up,

1413
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.740
misses the great,
he can't jump high enough.
So he's like,
all right.

1414
01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:46.790
He comes back and he's like,
you know I just got to jump higher.
That's all.

1415
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:50.210
So he jumps high,
even higher,
still can't still can't get him,
tries again.

1416
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:54.860
Still can't get them again.
Still can't get him.
Finally gives up.

1417
01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:59.660
It doesn't pivot gives up and while he's leaving he says it's grapes were

1418
01:26:59.661 --> 01:27:04.200
probably sour anyway huh?
There it is.
Started to go.

1419
01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:06.620
I don't like that.

1420
01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:14.630
<v 0>Continuing more likely to occur is a sort of symbolic running away through</v>

1421
01:27:15.571 --> 01:27:18.660
feigned illness or physical defect defect.

1422
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:23.690
A man faced with failure to pass an examination for a promotion or he has long

1423
01:27:24.311 --> 01:27:24.581
form,

1424
01:27:24.581 --> 01:27:27.900
may suddenly announced that he is colorblind or night blind or has some other

1425
01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:32.640
previously undiscovered defect that would prevent a success or he may become

1426
01:27:32.641 --> 01:27:37.020
actually ill and be honestly unaware of the connection between sudden sickness

1427
01:27:37.021 --> 01:27:38.970
and frustration.
This is a

1428
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.680
feigned physical defect is a big one for people that don't make it through some

1429
01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:51.300
kind of military training program.
So what does that,
we're like,
well,

1430
01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:56.010
what happened?
I wrote my leg,
right?
Maybe they did it or we are.

1431
01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.150
So are they blaming something that actually is occurring or are they just sort

1432
01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:03.690
of make physical effect?
Hey,
I couldn't do this because my leg was hurt.

1433
01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.290
That's why I didn't make it through the program because I got this.
I got that.

1434
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.533
Yeah.
Okay.

1435
01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:12.930
And then the other thing that they make is sometimes people actually get sick,

1436
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:17.460
but it's because they're,
you know,
like the mind body connection.
Huh.

1437
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:22.500
That's crazy.
Back to the book.
Each man,

1438
01:28:22.501 --> 01:28:26.190
no matter how strong mentally and physically has his limits beyond which the

1439
01:28:26.191 --> 01:28:28.710
strongest will cannot drive him.

1440
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.550
The wise man learns his own tolerances and cautiously retreats if possible,

1441
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:38.150
to a more defended position when hazards and obstacles.

1442
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:41.090
He's in danger of our two.
Great.

1443
01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:42.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1444
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:48.590
<v 0>It's amazing that they so clearly understood this and this is 1942 or something</v>

1445
01:28:49.921 --> 01:28:52.650
like that and they're saying,
look,
they're saying the exact same thing.

1446
01:28:52.651 --> 01:28:56.280
That's a big revelation to say pivot nursing.
The same

1447
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:01.740
rage,
a two weapon,

1448
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.060
a group of tanks stands in a field,
silent,
motionless,

1449
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.660
any dead suddenly switches are thrown,
motor start and they become alive.

1450
01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:12.630
Noise burst from their exhaust and they roar to attack.

1451
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:16.890
A gun is a nurse and dead until high explosive powder is set off and it's

1452
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:19.860
chambers a bomb without Nitroglycerin is a dud.

1453
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.900
All weapons are mere useless pieces of metal until the release of energy brings

1454
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:25.740
them to life.

1455
01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:27.120
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1456
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.290
<v 0>man too.</v>

1457
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:33.350
As a weapon of war must have energy release to galvanize him into acting,

1458
01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.520
fighting soldier,

1459
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:42.910
and the high explosive that sets off a man's fighting power is emotion.

1460
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:48.950
There are certain things that a man can do in an automatic way without the fire

1461
01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:52.430
of emotional energy,
but these things would win.

1462
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:55.490
No wars without fear and without rage.

1463
01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:58.970
He could not even defend himself if the enemy were aiming at him and about the

1464
01:29:58.971 --> 01:30:02.300
fryer.
Slap a man's face and he will become enraged.

1465
01:30:02.301 --> 01:30:06.290
Drop a bomb beside him and he may become terrified.

1466
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:12.320
But although the two feelings may seem different to made seem to the man very

1467
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:17.880
different inwardly the changes that take place in his body or similar,

1468
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.850
his heart beats faster,
his blood pressure rises,

1469
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.230
his blood is shifted from internal organs to the muscles.
His digestion stop,

1470
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:28.710
stops,
sugar in his blood,
increases his hands,
tremble,

1471
01:30:28.711 --> 01:30:33.360
his voice quivers the body wastes in the bladder or bowels may be expelled.

1472
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.060
He becomes alert and ready for instant action.

1473
01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.680
Whether all this extreme preparation for action by the body as a good thing for

1474
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:45.090
the soldier or whether it will eventually or whether we'll actually endangers

1475
01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:47.400
life depends on the circumstances.

1476
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:50.970
When in primitive hand to hand combat,

1477
01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:55.620
when the last ounce of energy of which the body is capable must be summon

1478
01:30:55.621 --> 01:31:00.621
instantly for one tremendous spurt of running to get away from peril or for one

1479
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:07.010
outburst of physical strength to down the foe rage or fear will pour into blood

1480
01:31:07.681 --> 01:31:11.640
the adrenaline it necessary to rouse that vital energy

1481
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.830
if immediate vigorous action is impossible.
However,

1482
01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:21.810
and if life depends,
instead upon the cool headed use of skill,

1483
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:27.140
self control and discipline than violent emotion can put the soldier in mortal

1484
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:28.943
peril.

1485
01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:35.480
So this one thing can kill you or save you.
Yup.

1486
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:40.750
Yeah.
It was an interesting differentiation there where it's like,
hey,
if,

1487
01:31:40.751 --> 01:31:43.800
if the task kind of requires like skill and stuff,

1488
01:31:43.810 --> 01:31:46.420
probably you got to control that you gotta you know,
you can't be doing it.

1489
01:31:46.421 --> 01:31:49.450
But if it's like,
hey,
if you sometimes,
because let's face it,

1490
01:31:49.451 --> 01:31:50.950
men in life and whatever,

1491
01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:54.730
sometimes it just brought you just kind of power through some stuff every once

1492
01:31:54.731 --> 01:31:56.680
in a while.
No,
no doubt about it.
And you know,

1493
01:31:56.681 --> 01:32:00.400
so and how you actually hear the way he said put quite eloquently,

1494
01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:03.100
<v 4>uh,
what does it sometimes,</v>

1495
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.760
sometimes you have to use your logic and sometimes you have to use your logic

1496
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:09.830
fails freedom field man,
this thing is in,

1497
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:14.260
he's in the field manual sometimes if if your,
if your logic fails,

1498
01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:15.610
like if you can't think of a good reason to,

1499
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:18.700
why should I do another set or why should I go compete in this thing?

1500
01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:21.760
You have to let your emotions get a little get in the game,

1501
01:32:23.010 --> 01:32:27.220
and then sometimes your emotions get shut down because you think Bruce is just

1502
01:32:27.221 --> 01:32:30.010
stupid.
This doesn't all make sense.
Yeah.

1503
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:32.470
Well then you got to let your emotions go way mean.

1504
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:36.530
It doesn't make sense because you're being weak and you don't like that.

1505
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:41.260
None of that's bad.
Actually,
the logic one a lot of times is,
well,

1506
01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:43.720
it's more more dynamic I'd say,

1507
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:46.360
because you can have full Kotton lawn and what'd you,

1508
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:50.290
but I can have full conversations in my head and the working out one was a big

1509
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:51.160
one where I'm like,

1510
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.910
think about how you'll feel after that's going to be the benefit,
you know?

1511
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.560
But then at the same time it'd be like,
Hey,
wait,

1512
01:32:56.561 --> 01:32:59.320
but you could easily restaurant now you can get recovered.
You know?

1513
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:01.600
So it's like you're one of those guys that has a huge,

1514
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:06.700
huge surplus of standing by things that are like,
look,
you know,

1515
01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.680
the most important part of working out is rest.
You don't,

1516
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:15.320
you don't grow,
you don't get stronger when you're working out.

1517
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:19.420
You actually get stronger when you're rested.
You got that little voice.

1518
01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:20.120
So you got that,

1519
01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.150
that one little monkey on your shoulder that's whisper and those things.
Yeah,

1520
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:27.370
but now I got you.
Who in the big monkey,

1521
01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.170
even giggling because you and I got this from you essentially where it's like,

1522
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:36.410
okay,
I can,
this is kind of the conversations going on in my head.

1523
01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:41.780
Um,
typically.
So yes,
I can be like,
yeah,
the recovery,
that's how you,

1524
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.400
you know,
get the gains,
whatever.
That's on one side.

1525
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.270
Then the other side is like waves,
but you want to train,
train a whole,

1526
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:53.110
there's way more to working out than just getting bigger and stronger.

1527
01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.550
There's more to it.
There's mental exercises,
mental toughness exercises in there.

1528
01:33:57.551 --> 01:34:01.360
There's doing discipline all like all these things.
Oh,
yet and hand,

1529
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:06.040
they're more like,
they're longer lasting.
Like things to try to develop,
you know,

1530
01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:09.820
like we need to develop them.
They applied it more things.
So you can be,
I can be,

1531
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:13.930
I can easily be like,
hey,
I don't feel like it today.

1532
01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:16.830
That's my body telling me I should rest today.
Yeah.

1533
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:21.850
I really don't feel like it physically.
And that is true.
It's probably true.

1534
01:34:21.851 --> 01:34:26.851
But what else is true is if I can train myself to power through these sorts of

1535
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:29.410
situations,
even though they're true,

1536
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.540
that's going to serve me way better in light.

1537
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.410
So if you develop that skill out of this,
so I'm like,
Dang.

1538
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.950
So now he got two months explaining some of that stuff to my youngest daughter,

1539
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.780
my youngest daughter,

1540
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:45.580
about how competent competition is good.

1541
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.630
And the reason competition is good is because life is a competition.

1542
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.850
It is a straight up competition.

1543
01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:56.980
And if you're not good at competing,
if you don't get comfortable with competing,

1544
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.810
that's going to be a problem.
When it comes time to compete,

1545
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:00.970
which you will have to,

1546
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:03.680
you're not going to get through life without comp competing for things,

1547
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:06.380
for whatever.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't happen.

1548
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:09.440
You're going to have to compete for a job.
You're going to have to compete for,

1549
01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.870
you know,
to,
to meet someone,
to be,
to be your wife or husband.

1550
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.520
You're,
there's competition going on for that.

1551
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.700
They're just not like down for the cause out of the gate.

1552
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:24.730
Now you've got to fight off other humans to get what you want.

1553
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:30.350
Whether it's a spouse,
whether it's a job,
whether it's a promotion,

1554
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:33.590
whether it's a part in the school play.
Oh,

1555
01:35:33.730 --> 01:35:35.540
there's other people that are going to be trying.

1556
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:38.210
I was telling my little daughter this,
you think they're just going to walk.

1557
01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:43.070
Step aside,
when you show up,
you want the lead role.
Yup.
You got it.

1558
01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:48.500
You know it's a competition and you must destroy the competition and the way you

1559
01:35:48.501 --> 01:35:50.990
do that,
as you compete,
you compete in different things a lot.

1560
01:35:50.991 --> 01:35:55.400
You push yourself and you figure out what it takes to step up.
Yeah,

1561
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.990
like wrestling a lot.

1562
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:02.330
Wrestling puts a lot of pressure on kids and it is straight competition.

1563
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:05.570
Mono e mono or in the case of my daughter,

1564
01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.500
what does that female,
a woman,
well motto versus a woman.

1565
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:14.840
No,
it is straight competition that you against another human being.

1566
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:18.350
One of you's going to win,
one of you's going to lose 100% of the time.

1567
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:22.510
That's what's going to happen.
And it's all on you.
Yeah.

1568
01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:26.930
So that's really good for,
for people.
It's good for kids.

1569
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:30.650
Jujitsu competition,
same thing.
And then you just get,

1570
01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:34.700
you can just say any kind of competition,
you know?
Yeah.
It's like a,
well,

1571
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.090
a dichotomy too,
you know,
in,
in the spirit of accuracy,

1572
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:42.520
it's cut like life.
Not to get too deep here,
but life is,

1573
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:46.760
is half competition,
half collaboration.
So they ain't gonna.

1574
01:36:46.761 --> 01:36:49.580
It could be different.
Could be 60 40 and whatever,
whatever.

1575
01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:53.550
You're a hundred percent competition for me and a bunch of collateral for you.

1576
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:58.080
No,
but here's the thing where,
yeah,

1577
01:36:58.090 --> 01:37:01.970
you get people who lean to too far towards competition,

1578
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:05.300
they start to alienate people and they can't maintain relationships like the,

1579
01:37:05.301 --> 01:37:08.660
all of these problems,
they're playing the short game.
Short game.
Yes.

1580
01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:11.060
And the collaborations,
if they're playing the long game,

1581
01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:14.180
that's not a factor because they're realizing,
oh,

1582
01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.320
I'm going to win in the long game.
Well,

1583
01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:21.230
so this short game is a sacrifice.
You no problem.
Oh,
is I want to,
you know,

1584
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:24.530
I'm not going to do something that's going to create an antagonistic

1585
01:37:24.531 --> 01:37:27.320
relationship with these people that I'm going to count on in the future.

1586
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.440
So guess what?
We're going to take a little hit right now.

1587
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:31.680
We're going to make something,
you know,
we,

1588
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:35.900
you make compromises because you're focused on the long game because ultimately

1589
01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:41.540
it is a competition.
Yeah.
Well it is a competition.
Sure.
Um,

1590
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:45.590
not everything's a competition.
A lot of it is a collaboration,
but we then,

1591
01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.790
I mean most times we collaborate to compete.
Yeah.
So what I'm saying,
so it is,

1592
01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:53.060
it's like a little balance,
like a little dance you're doing with collaboration.

1593
01:37:53.061 --> 01:37:56.100
Competition.
That's why I think anyway,
I don't know.

1594
01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.840
<v 0>But from what I can view or see,
observe that.
Yeah.</v>

1595
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:04.710
If you lean too much towards competition,
[inaudible] yourself up.

1596
01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:08.370
And if you can English teacher much towards collaboration as a dichotomy,

1597
01:38:08.371 --> 01:38:11.160
jam yourself up too.
It's like you can't,
you can't succeed.

1598
01:38:11.161 --> 01:38:15.720
It's like you can't get out of like your little clouds.
It should be balanced.

1599
01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:17.940
And if you are competing on things,

1600
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.170
because there's people that compete on things that don't matter yet,

1601
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:24.510
don't matter.
And the wall or they compete when they should be collaborating.

1602
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:25.830
Yeah,
that's true too.

1603
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:30.090
Or they're afraid to compete so they don't compete at all.

1604
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.530
So there's all kinds of problems.
But yes,
I,
what am I,

1605
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:39.590
I'm speaking a little bit simplified for my daughter because what my daughter,

1606
01:38:40.631 --> 01:38:44.900
when I want my kids to realize is that there is competition.
Yeah.

1607
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.950
And that they're part of it whether they want to be or not.

1608
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.420
That's the point that I'm trying to make.

1609
01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:52.890
And so when I talked to my daughter about something and she gives me a kind of a

1610
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:57.000
shoulder shrug about something,
when it's not a shoulder shrug situation,

1611
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:03.020
then you've aren't understanding that things are a competition and life is a

1612
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:06.750
competition.
And you know what?

1613
01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:10.890
It is hard to say.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1614
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:15.980
it's very extreme to say everything in life or life in general or life as a

1615
01:39:17.071 --> 01:39:20.400
whole is a competition.
That's a real extreme statement.
And I can see,

1616
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:25.140
I totally agree with your point and you are correct that that can result in then

1617
01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.460
a bad,
a bad attitude.

1618
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.000
And it really of not even just a bad attitude,
a bad life.
I mean,
you can end up,

1619
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:33.661
like you said,

1620
01:39:33.661 --> 01:39:36.690
you can alienate everyone and you can end up alone and you're competing in New

1621
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:40.290
York.
I beat that person.
I'd be that person.
And now when you're just,
you've lost.

1622
01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:45.360
That's the thing is you,
you,
you've lost a whole section of,
of your competition,

1623
01:39:45.361 --> 01:39:48.870
which is developing relationships with other human beings that you can then

1624
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:51.990
count upon in your times of need or that you can provide for.

1625
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:55.470
It's like all you've ruined everything.
So,

1626
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.680
but what I'm saying is even that right there,

1627
01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:02.880
if you think about it in terms of what I just said,
you lost.

1628
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.370
So ultimately to win the competition,

1629
01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:13.620
you have to be aware of it.
You have to compete and competing.
This is,

1630
01:40:13.621 --> 01:40:15.900
this is probably the crux of what we're trying to say.

1631
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.270
Competing doesn't always mean
compete.

1632
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:23.190
He's smashing the other person.
Yeah.

1633
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.180
Competing doesn't always mean that sometimes competing means actually letting

1634
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:27.871
the other person,

1635
01:40:27.871 --> 01:40:32.871
when you're competing sometimes means letting get compromising.

1636
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:39.030
Because I'm going to win the long game.
I'm playing the long game over here.
Yeah.

1637
01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.810
And you're playing around with the short game.
It'd be,
it'd be,
hey,
good job.

1638
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:47.790
I'm going to applaud you.
I mean golf clap.
Yeah man.

1639
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:51.420
It's too,
cause at the end,
you know,
you can collaborate all you want,

1640
01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.040
but if you have like you put it the long game,

1641
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.850
<v 2>which is really,
really effective way to look at it by the way with everything.</v>

1642
01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:01.990
But if you can be collaborating and be the,
you know,

1643
01:41:01.991 --> 01:41:06.580
the best team player in the whole wide world,
but your goal,

1644
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:10.470
your goal is for your team.
If you're the team player is free,

1645
01:41:10.471 --> 01:41:14.950
your team to win whatever you're doing.
And when,
I mean it's,
here's the thing,

1646
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.020
I think people get emotionally jammed up when they hear no,

1647
01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:22.510
everything's a competition and they shouldn't be like that or whatever to win in

1648
01:41:22.511 --> 01:41:26.080
life when me and that they think that like I win,
you lose kind of thing.

1649
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.610
But really when it comes to even like just genetically,
right?

1650
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:34.150
You know how they say,
you know,
finding a mate or reproducing whatever,

1651
01:41:34.151 --> 01:41:36.940
it's like you're,
it's like survival of the fittest,
right?

1652
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:41.380
Darwinism kind of thing.
Like organisms compete for me,
it compete for this cause.

1653
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:46.840
So it's kind of like that's how it is.
You know,
it's not like I'm a person,

1654
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:50.290
you're a person,
I'm going to win and defeat you and you,
you're the loser.

1655
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:54.000
It's not that,
that thing.
It's like basically you want to be successful and for,

1656
01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.020
for most situations,
for you to be successful,
you have to kind of,

1657
01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.520
you have to beat someone out of them then.

1658
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:06.100
<v 0>And in order to be successful,
you also have to play the game.</v>

1659
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:08.370
You also have to play the game by the rules.
Yeah.

1660
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.070
Cause otherwise you end up ostracized or in jail.
Right.

1661
01:42:13.090 --> 01:42:16.540
Cause you could say,
I'm going to win.
I'm going to make the most money.

1662
01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:18.050
So why don't we know him to steal it from people.
Yeah.

1663
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:22.210
Do immoral things in order to get there.
That that would be,
uh,

1664
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:24.310
everything's a competition attitude.

1665
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:27.070
But it's the wrong attitude because you're not going to win in the end.

1666
01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:30.940
We're going to lose,
you're going to be in jail.
So you lost.

1667
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:36.040
But if you realize that it is a competition and you have to play the roles and

1668
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:39.640
you have to win the game and winning the game means that you are successful in a

1669
01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:43.390
place where you can help other people and you've got what you need and that's

1670
01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:47.620
what we're looking for.
Yeah,
definitely dichotomy with that one.

1671
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.900
Speaking of dichotomies,
going back to the book,
it is possible.

1672
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:57.990
It is as possible to be literally blinded by rage as it is to be paralyzed by

1673
01:42:58.661 --> 01:42:59.440
fear.

1674
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.880
A Prize fighter knows that he can win against a stronger and more skilled

1675
01:43:03.881 --> 01:43:08.050
opponent if he can rouse his opponent to violent anger in which he strikes

1676
01:43:08.051 --> 01:43:11.560
wildly and fails to use his science.
We see that all the time.

1677
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:16.790
Got To maintain your composure in a fight on the maths,

1678
01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.050
even on the mats of justice for the Jujitsu.

1679
01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.450
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Big Time.
You know what?
You don't what movie was like the,
the,</v>

1680
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:28.780
the epitome of that was a few good men I remember at the end.

1681
01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:32.700
Oh,
and he was like,
when he made them admit to it,
he did.

1682
01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.750
That's exactly what he did,
man.
Told him,
took him out of the game,

1683
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:40.220
got them all riled up,
made them Batman knows good.
You can't handle the truth.

1684
01:43:40.221 --> 01:43:42.410
That's right.
That was a good speech though,
by the way.

1685
01:43:42.710 --> 01:43:47.690
He but he let the rage and the emotion cause a problem for him jammed him up.

1686
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:51.050
He could have just,
he didn't have to do anything.
No,
he could.

1687
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.070
He just kept his mouth

1688
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.180
<v 0>shut and be like,
yeah,
whatever.
Yep.
Didn't do it.
Tom Cruise,</v>

1689
01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:01.130
Tom Cruise.
He played the game really well.

1690
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:03.890
New to the TAC is emotions.
Yep.

1691
01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.680
Isn't it funny that if you understand psychology and human nature,

1692
01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:14.710
you can actually play it on someone and bring their own demise based on

1693
01:44:15.201 --> 01:44:18.530
something that they're going to do when you sell still?
It's crazy.

1694
01:44:18.531 --> 01:44:20.180
That's why it's important to understand human nature.

1695
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:25.580
Back to the book of the main purpose behind all the long routine of military

1696
01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:28.670
training and the preconditioning of troops to simulate battle conditions,

1697
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:32.450
to drill into soldiers fighting habits so deeply ingrained so intimately.

1698
01:44:32.451 --> 01:44:34.670
Second nature that they will persist,

1699
01:44:34.671 --> 01:44:39.671
persist in the face of the most overwhelming provocations to rage or panic.

1700
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.060
Long practice in shooting Cooley at a target without undue excitement,

1701
01:44:44.061 --> 01:44:48.590
without blood lost makes it possible for the soldier to shoot calmly as at his

1702
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:52.940
target.
When his very life and the safety of his pals are at stake,

1703
01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.920
his hand must not tremble.

1704
01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:59.210
Then his keen eye and steady nerve must not waver.

1705
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:01.521
Fortunately,

1706
01:45:01.521 --> 01:45:06.290
men in civilized society have been trained since early childhood to control and

1707
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:11.110
discipline their natural impulses.
For the normal adult,

1708
01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.100
it is entirely possible for intelligence to remain in command of his behavior

1709
01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:19.960
and for even recently acquired habits to be retained in opposition to the

1710
01:45:19.961 --> 01:45:24.760
instinctive impulses to run or drop his rifle and flail out with his fists.

1711
01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:27.550
There are many degrees of anger,
however,

1712
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:32.170
and although the violently enraged individual may be at the mercy of the enemy,

1713
01:45:32.171 --> 01:45:34.000
a milder form of resentment,

1714
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:39.030
of injustice and calm determination to avenge cruelty can serve to fill men with

1715
01:45:40.031 --> 01:45:42.640
the fighting spirit that knows no defeat.

1716
01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:48.610
The difference between this cool anger and rage is like the difference between

1717
01:45:48.611 --> 01:45:52.180
tempered steel and molten iron.
Oh,
that's a good one.

1718
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:56.440
Like the difference between a raging torrent that destroys blindly and the

1719
01:45:56.441 --> 01:46:01.330
harness the power of a Niagara that can be directed intelligently to wipe out

1720
01:46:01.331 --> 01:46:05.860
the enemy such deep and controlled anger is not to be roused

1721
01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.860
artificially by any group before any group of men.

1722
01:46:12.190 --> 01:46:15.850
It is the automatic result of an unpardonable offense.

1723
01:46:15.851 --> 01:46:19.360
It rises like an unquenchable fire when a man's house is attacked,

1724
01:46:19.361 --> 01:46:23.800
when his wife or children are abused,
when his own native land is invaded.

1725
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.770
Such anger can be used not only for actual killing of the enemy,

1726
01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.310
but also to provide the energy needed for work behind the lines.

1727
01:46:33.311 --> 01:46:37.060
A soldier who is determined to defeat the enemy will do anything that he feels

1728
01:46:37.061 --> 01:46:38.860
contributes to wiping out the flow.

1729
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:42.460
Whether it is changing the tires on the truck or unloading shells from a pack in

1730
01:46:42.461 --> 01:46:46.930
case or policing barracks in his training camp,
he will fight at his job.

1731
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.180
He will do that job well and we'll use his own initiative to volunteer for extra

1732
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:55.200
duty to think up ways of doing his job more quickly and more efficiently.

1733
01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:56.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1734
01:46:56.850 --> 01:47:00.420
<v 0>Anger is infectious and can spread from one person to another through personal</v>

1735
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:01.254
contact.

1736
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:06.410
Just to see the flushed face and tense expression of a Rafi person may be enough

1737
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:10.020
to stir anger in others.

1738
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:15.550
The sound of anger in a raised voice or the sight of angry behavior is even more

1739
01:47:16.610 --> 01:47:21.610
catching anger spreads most readily when the beholder is sympathetic,

1740
01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.340
when he's able to put himself in the angry man's shoes,

1741
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:29.300
when the person who is injured is one of us.
For this reason,

1742
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:34.450
the rouse anger of a people is much greater and more moving than the sum of the

1743
01:47:35.541 --> 01:47:40.070
individual anchors within the group.
They reinforce one another.
Anchor,

1744
01:47:40.071 --> 01:47:41.630
shared,
controlled,

1745
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:46.810
and directed to the single purpose of destroying the enemy is a powerful force

1746
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:49.880
for survival and for a victory.

1747
01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:53.830
Anger as a gift

1748
01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:00.020
that a rage against the machine is indeed respect.

1749
01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:02.980
Bringing out quotes.

1750
01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:09.970
It goes on hatred of the enemy.
Makes Sense.

1751
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1752
01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:14.640
<v 0>The army is organized throughout for one single purpose.</v>

1753
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:19.500
Fighting soldiers must be fighting men with a fighting spirit,

1754
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:23.970
but some of the acts of aggression by soldiers are useless to the war effort,

1755
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.710
effort,
and actually dangerous to the army when competition.
Here we go.

1756
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:32.520
When competition between companies or regiments turns into bitter rivalry.

1757
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:36.840
When soldiers in town for a Saturday night pick corals with each other or with

1758
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:37.730
the townspeople.

1759
01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.690
When race prejudices are permitted to develop within a camp or when officers

1760
01:48:42.691 --> 01:48:44.760
stooped professional jealousy,

1761
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.360
the harmful results can be as bad as those dealt out by the enemy.

1762
01:48:50.230 --> 01:48:54.940
This is when life and I always say the enemies outside the wire.
Yeah,
this,

1763
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:59.140
all those things are fighting inside the wire,
fighting against ourselves.

1764
01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:04.780
Such conditions make riffs in the solidarity essential to the fighting morale.

1765
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:06.880
They cause a deterioration of discipline.

1766
01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:10.720
Produce a state of anxiety and insecurity among the troops and worst of all,

1767
01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.700
they actually drain off in ineffective petty squabbles.
The fighting energy,

1768
01:49:15.701 --> 01:49:18.280
every ounce of which is needed to bring victory.

1769
01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.860
The thoughtful leader,

1770
01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:26.100
knowing that no group or nation can long survive even is torn by internal strife

1771
01:49:26.891 --> 01:49:31.891
or dissension with its allies is seriously disturbed by any tendency toward

1772
01:49:32.021 --> 01:49:36.070
personal or factional friction within his command.

1773
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:43.810
He well knows that victory can only come if the whole group puts all its efforts

1774
01:49:44.721 --> 01:49:47.980
into a unified cooperative battle against a

1775
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.820
<v 4>common enemy.</v>

1776
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:56.460
You always end up with these little
factions,
right?

1777
01:49:56.790 --> 01:50:00.570
And you have to try and prevent that.
You Ha you gotta,

1778
01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:04.110
you gotta Watch out for those because they sneak up on you and it happens.

1779
01:50:04.111 --> 01:50:05.500
And it happens in any organization though.

1780
01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.150
People start to relate to each other and then they pick a little common enemy

1781
01:50:09.151 --> 01:50:13.560
even with inside the wire.
It's like us against them.
Yeah,
that's true,
Huh?

1782
01:50:13.590 --> 01:50:16.620
Cause and picking a common enemy,
even on a social level,

1783
01:50:16.621 --> 01:50:20.460
whatever that that like promotes cohesion within a group.

1784
01:50:20.461 --> 01:50:25.050
Like I apparently from what I read is like gossip,
right?

1785
01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:29.550
There's a purpose for gossip.
Like if people gossip,
it makes them like bond.

1786
01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:33.840
It's weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
And actually there's this book talks about rumors.

1787
01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:37.740
You were going to talk about that.
What are the fruitful,

1788
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.970
ripe terrain for rumors to grow?
For gossip to grow.
Yeah.

1789
01:50:43.410 --> 01:50:46.200
But the act of doing it with each other,
part of the reason,

1790
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:49.620
part of the reason is if you and I need something to connect on when we'll just

1791
01:50:49.621 --> 01:50:53.830
make fun of this guy,
we'll talk smack about this guy and we kind of bond,
right?

1792
01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.050
If you hate this guy,

1793
01:50:55.051 --> 01:50:59.880
and I hate this Guy Ben in the gate when the gate saw you.
So,

1794
01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:04.320
uh,
and you know the,
and this says,
and you say that you should,

1795
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:07.170
you should try to prevent those,
you know,
little um,

1796
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:10.530
like what do you clicks or whatever I took it kind of is there,

1797
01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:15.070
do you think there's benefit to them actually for his benefit,

1798
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:19.710
just on a low level,
low level,
there are benefits but it has to be balanced.

1799
01:51:19.770 --> 01:51:22.800
Because guess what?
I'm the task unit commander of tasking at bruiser.

1800
01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.660
I Have Charlie and Delta platoon.

1801
01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:29.910
I Want Charlie and Delta platoon to be competitive against each other so that

1802
01:51:29.911 --> 01:51:31.680
they're pushing to try and become,

1803
01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:36.060
try and make each other or try try and become their best so they can talk smack

1804
01:51:36.061 --> 01:51:39.270
to the other guys.
We beat you in this thing.
We did a tune that thing.
Okay,
cool.

1805
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:41.370
That's positive.
I want that to happen.

1806
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:45.050
What I don't want is delta will tune,

1807
01:51:45.051 --> 01:51:48.380
figured out a good standard operating procedure and doesn't share it with

1808
01:51:48.381 --> 01:51:52.430
Charlie platoon because we want to keep out performing them on this drill or

1809
01:51:52.431 --> 01:51:54.560
vice versa.
That's what we don't want to have happen.

1810
01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:57.140
So you've got to balance these dichotomies.
Yes.

1811
01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.780
And you want to have these little competitive groups and inside,
guess what?

1812
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:02.940
Inside of Charlie Platoon,
there's squad one in squad too.

1813
01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.330
They should compete with each other and InsideSquad one in squad to InsideSquad

1814
01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:09.980
one you got fire team one and fire team too.

1815
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:11.420
They're competing against each other.

1816
01:52:11.421 --> 01:52:14.750
And then inside that fire team you've got to swim pairs and they're competing

1817
01:52:14.751 --> 01:52:19.370
with each other.
So you want to establish that healthy competition.

1818
01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.880
But what you want to make sure is that it doesn't cross the boundary into

1819
01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:27.440
sabotage.
Yeah.

1820
01:52:27.441 --> 01:52:32.441
So it's like it has to remain at all times has the little mini competitions or

1821
01:52:34.011 --> 01:52:35.060
competitive situations,

1822
01:52:35.061 --> 01:52:39.170
you have to remain within the boundary of the team goal.

1823
01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:42.440
Like he can never cross over that,
right?
Like it has to be,

1824
01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.010
it all has to support team goal,

1825
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.020
<v 0>right?
Whatever,
whatever that means.</v>

1826
01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:53.150
I can't ever be taking away from the fact that we have an unified mission to

1827
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:56.300
execute and achieve.

1828
01:52:56.450 --> 01:53:01.450
We can never let anything undermine that goal ever.

1829
01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:05.030
And that right there

1830
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:11.720
we throw around this term putting the mission first,
right?
Like,
Oh,

1831
01:53:11.721 --> 01:53:14.120
you got to put the mission first.
Like we throw that around.

1832
01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:19.100
But if you think that through to its ultimate end,

1833
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:24.430
it is the most powerful force that you can have from a leadership perspective,

1834
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.600
from,

1835
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:30.560
from the way that you operate and the decisions that you make because you look

1836
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:33.830
at some decision that it needs to get made.
And if you,

1837
01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.160
if you truly ask yourself the question,
okay,

1838
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:39.440
how will this,

1839
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:44.450
will this move us towards our objective in a positive way if it will?
Okay,

1840
01:53:44.451 --> 01:53:48.320
we're moving in the right direction.
It sounds like a day.
If it's not doing that,

1841
01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.840
you're,
it's the wrong decision to make.

1842
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.890
And so it comes time to fire someone.

1843
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.670
You're firing this person cause they talk back to you and they were,

1844
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.270
they got a bad attitude.
Okay?
So then you ask yourself,
okay,

1845
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:06.350
what does this do to our mission,
our ability to execute our mission?
Well,

1846
01:54:06.351 --> 01:54:10.610
the guy's a Turd and he doesn't know his job well and he's been slacking off.

1847
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:15.740
Okay.
And no one likes him.
Guess what?
He's getting fired.
But okay,

1848
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:17.810
wait a second.
I don't like him.

1849
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.230
I don't like him because he rubs me the wrong way.

1850
01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.970
I don't like him because he's got a big ego,

1851
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.310
which means he's brushing up against my big ego,

1852
01:54:25.311 --> 01:54:27.860
which is making me hold it against him.
And by the way,

1853
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:30.020
he's come up with a couple ideas that were better than mine.

1854
01:54:30.021 --> 01:54:32.180
And I resent him for that.
And by the way,

1855
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:36.260
he's asked some questions during my last brief that were really hard for me to

1856
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:39.620
answer,
to kind of put me on the spot,
all these things.

1857
01:54:39.621 --> 01:54:42.620
And so I've racked those things up and I started and now I put together my

1858
01:54:42.621 --> 01:54:44.090
little click,
who's did?
I started saying,
Hey,
you know,

1859
01:54:44.091 --> 01:54:48.950
he does this and he did this on this op and all of a sudden I got a reason and

1860
01:54:48.951 --> 01:54:53.470
now I need to ask myself,
okay,
am I furthering the mission?
If I get rid of them,

1861
01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.320
who's going to replace him?

1862
01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:56.480
He has experienced who's gonna replace that experience?

1863
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:58.880
He's another body who's gonna replace that other body.

1864
01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:04.970
And so if you make your decisions based on what's good for the team,
by the way,

1865
01:55:04.971 --> 01:55:07.040
what's good for the team is what's good for the mission.

1866
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:09.920
You have a team to accomplish the mission.
If your team is dysfunctional,

1867
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:11.030
you're not gonna accomplish the mission.

1868
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:14.180
If your team has destroyed or part of your team has lost,

1869
01:55:14.181 --> 01:55:15.290
you can't accomplish the mission.

1870
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:21.270
So if you really truly look is is what I'm doing a well,

1871
01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.210
what about your family,
right?

1872
01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.020
Your family mission is to provide for your family and take care of your family.

1873
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:31.850
When you start looking at things from that standpoint,
hey,

1874
01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:35.840
really want to get this new car.
Yeah,
right.

1875
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:40.850
I really like this new car,
sir.
Okay.
We know that that's an emotional decision.

1876
01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:44.130
Yeah.
Buying cars for most people,
emotional decision,

1877
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:48.980
myself included Americans.
It's not even just Americans.

1878
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:51.000
People who love cars.

1879
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.150
I don't know if it's cause the advertising thing,

1880
01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:57.360
but cars represent freedom.

1881
01:55:58.770 --> 01:56:03.770
You have the ability to travel hundreds and thousands of miles on your own

1882
01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:08.640
accord and maybe you just need to travel to the grocery market,

1883
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:14.540
but still a car gives you freedom and then the car in a deeper level is

1884
01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:18.420
reflection of you.
It's your,
it's your,
yeah.
This is,

1885
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:23.520
it's literally something that you get inside of and when people look at it,

1886
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:28.970
they're looking at the metal and steel version of you in your own mind.

1887
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:30.263
This.

1888
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:35.300
It's so it can be hard to drive a 1997 dodge grand caravan with an attack when

1889
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:40.770
the duck tape on the on the window,
sir,
it can be hard.

1890
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.960
The fires,
the fires in San Diego in 2003 where you here for those yesterday?

1891
01:56:45.961 --> 01:56:47.220
Port ash everywhere.

1892
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:49.950
So that ruined a lot of paint if the cars were sitting outside.

1893
01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:54.720
So my 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan had all peeled paint look like,

1894
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:58.980
just just horrible peeled paint.

1895
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:03.780
It was like a dark red,
but then there was these flakes of clear stuff all over.

1896
01:57:03.781 --> 01:57:04.860
It fallen off.

1897
01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:10.110
So if you looked at that car and I saw that car as a reflection of me,

1898
01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.160
it was pretty,
pretty low reflection.
You know,

1899
01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:18.810
nothing against my brother's out there that are driving the de minivans props.

1900
01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:19.861
You got the family you,

1901
01:57:19.861 --> 01:57:23.820
but you make that your priority because what I could have done back in the day

1902
01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:26.670
saying say no,
what I really want to get,

1903
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.340
whatever the,

1904
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:35.570
the Ford f three 50 super duty duly extended king cab.

1905
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:41.430
You know what I'm saying?
I'm oak trim.
That's me.

1906
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.640
I want to look like that on the outside.

1907
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:47.760
So then what is my decision making broad.
Do I need that vehicle?

1908
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:51.450
I live in San Diego by the way.
I live in San Diego.

1909
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:54.420
What do I do with my vehicle?
I drive to work.
I drive home.

1910
01:57:54.421 --> 01:57:58.290
I take my kids to the Jujitsu tournaments.
That's what I do with my vehicle.

1911
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:01.290
Do I need an f three 50 super duty,

1912
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:06.300
duly extended cab diesel,
7.3 power stroke engine going,

1913
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:10.050
I need that.
I Dunno,
kind of.
No,
I don't.

1914
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:13.170
So what is the mission?
What is the mission?
First of all,

1915
01:58:13.171 --> 01:58:15.750
we know that when I buy a car,
it's going down in value.

1916
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:18.240
If I buy a piece of property,
buy a house,

1917
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.830
buy a home that's going to go up in value over time.

1918
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.750
Sure it might go up and down a little bit,

1919
01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:27.030
but over time it's going to go up in value over time.

1920
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:32.670
My kids can have that in 30 years that that they don't want that Ford in 30

1921
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:35.070
years that things barely even running in 30 years.

1922
01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:40.440
So what is my mission?
My mission is to provide for the family,
protect a family,

1923
01:58:40.441 --> 01:58:44.980
take care of the family,
set them up for success in the future.
What do I need?

1924
01:58:44.981 --> 01:58:49.870
Drive.
I need to drive a Dodge Caravan.
Yeah,
that's what I need to drive.

1925
01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:51.460
I understand.

1926
01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:56.410
So if you frame things correctly about what your broad mission is,

1927
01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:59.350
you're going to do better off.
You're going to make better decisions as a leader.

1928
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:00.970
That's the way it's going to be.

1929
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:09.400
Oh,
and by the way,

1930
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:14.170
speaking of leaders here we go back to the book.

1931
01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:19.500
The most serious of all causes for an epidemic of dissension is the bad leader.

1932
01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.530
When as sometimes happens in any organization like an army,

1933
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:28.510
men have placed over them.

1934
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:33.840
A man they do not trust one who loves to show his authority and throw his rank

1935
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:39.190
around or an unreasonable Martin net.

1936
01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.880
The whole outfit will be filled with resentment.

1937
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:47.800
Since it is impossible.
Show this antagonism to the officer who is at fault.

1938
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.680
The troops go around with chips on their shoulders,

1939
01:59:50.681 --> 01:59:52.480
daring each other to knock them off.

1940
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:57.040
The only way to wipe out such an infection of dissension is to track down and

1941
01:59:57.041 --> 02:00:01.150
remove the cause.
If men believe they have a grievance,

1942
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.240
even if the complaint is unjustified,

1943
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:08.290
they should be permitted to tell their troubles to someone in authority.

1944
02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:11.560
If an officer gives them a patient hearing,

1945
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:16.750
investigates conditions with a fair and open mind and explains his findings to

1946
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:18.940
the men,
they will usually be satisfied.

1947
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:23.410
Even in cases where it is impossible to do much to correct the objectionable

1948
02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.580
state of affairs.
This is such good advice.
Guess what?

1949
02:00:27.610 --> 02:00:28.870
When you're in a leadership position,

1950
02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.510
you're going to have people that are gonna complain about things that are going

1951
02:00:31.511 --> 02:00:36.270
to see problems.
And what you should do in those situations is lesson.

1952
02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.900
Listen to what the team has to say.
Listen to what that individual has to say.

1953
02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:45.820
Yeah,
get feed back.
That's what you should do.

1954
02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:47.711
Back to the book.

1955
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:52.660
Just telling their troubles to a willing listener serves to get the air cleared.

1956
02:00:52.930 --> 02:00:57.760
And in cases where men make constructive suggestions for correcting conditions,

1957
02:00:58.050 --> 02:01:02.680
they will take in the organization a pride that they never had before.

1958
02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:06.120
So that Kinda tells you to do something or asked you to do something and gives

1959
02:01:06.121 --> 02:01:08.560
you a suggestion,
used it and give him credit.

1960
02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.580
These are reasons why for many years in our army,

1961
02:01:12.610 --> 02:01:16.120
any officer or soldier has been free to tell a grievance to the inspector

1962
02:01:16.121 --> 02:01:19.600
general sent periodically to each place where there are troops,

1963
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:25.060
inspector generals,
like a internal affairs type situation,

1964
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:27.520
but you shouldn't need to resort to that.

1965
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.490
You know if you're a good commander and a good leader,

1966
02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:34.180
when the internal affairs people show up,
they get told,
hey,
everything's awesome.

1967
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:38.140
They have no grievances to put out there because they already told you and then

1968
02:01:38.141 --> 02:01:40.580
you gave them an answer and then people say,
well,

1969
02:01:40.581 --> 02:01:44.030
what if I can't answer the grievances?
Will you figured out what the answer is?

1970
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:48.830
If you,
if,
if my subordinate comes to me and says,
Hey,
this is,

1971
02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:53.960
we're not getting the right food out here.
Well I don't just say,
well,
sorry.

1972
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:56.840
No.
I said,
okay,
let me see what I can do about it.
Hey,
this is what's going on.

1973
02:01:56.841 --> 02:02:00.530
By the way,
there's a lack of flights heading in this direction.

1974
02:02:00.531 --> 02:02:03.150
The supply trains are getting blown up by IED.

1975
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.110
We have an alternate plan for food.

1976
02:02:06.111 --> 02:02:08.090
We're going to try and make it happen in a couple months,

1977
02:02:08.091 --> 02:02:11.810
but right now we kind of got what we got and now what do you say?

1978
02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:17.210
Screw you.
No,
you go,
okay,
I understand we're at war for crying out loud.

1979
02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.010
I understand I'm not going to get steak dinner every night.
It's not happening.

1980
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:25.100
Even though we might want it,
we're not going to get it.

1981
02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.150
So here out those grievances

1982
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:36.990
it some people get s concerned that if you start taking grievances from people,

1983
02:02:41.571 --> 02:02:43.940
then it turns into a bitch session.

1984
02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:48.200
You heard this word this term before the bitch session.

1985
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:52.460
I'm actually in general not scared of bitch sessions.

1986
02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:58.300
I'm not scared of them because if you ask me a good question or you ask me a

1987
02:02:59.721 --> 02:03:01.820
question,
I should have an answer for it.
I'm the leader.

1988
02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:05.570
If if you're in my platoon and you have a question for me,

1989
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:09.050
I should be able to answer.
If you have a bitch,

1990
02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:13.340
I should be able to give you a reason why that is occurring and why we either

1991
02:03:13.341 --> 02:03:16.700
can move forward with some kind of a corrective measure or why we cannot because

1992
02:03:16.701 --> 02:03:18.440
the following limitations that we're under.

1993
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:24.850
So I'm not really scared of bitch sessions unfolding.

1994
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:28.670
Have I seen them become unproductive?
Absolutely.

1995
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:33.830
I especially see them become unproductive when we're,

1996
02:03:33.831 --> 02:03:37.310
when we start to like lose the conversation.
And if the leader,

1997
02:03:37.311 --> 02:03:41.980
if you ask me a question and I say,
because yeah,
you know,

1998
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:46.700
if you say,
hey,
why can't we get better food?
And I say,
because

1999
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:51.500
then you say,
because of what?
And I said,
because I said,

2000
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:53.180
so now we're going to have a problem.

2001
02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:58.460
Now this bitch session just became unproductive.
If you say,
Hey Jocko,

2002
02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.250
we know we've been here for two months,
why can't we get some better food?

2003
02:04:01.251 --> 02:04:06.110
And I'm like,
you know what?
Right now I don't even know cause I,
I agree with you.

2004
02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:10.310
The food is pretty bad.
And I like food.
And so let me take a note here.

2005
02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.260
I'm going to write down what I've set it up,
the chain of command.

2006
02:04:12.261 --> 02:04:16.490
We can figure out a,
what's going on,
why we don't get,
have good food,
and B,

2007
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:19.730
if there's a way we can possibly start making this happen,
I hear you.

2008
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:26.510
Bitch is now subdued,
right?
The complaint has been subdued

2009
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:29.930
because I gave you a legitimate answer.

2010
02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.500
I didn't even give you a solution by any stretch.
I just gave you an answer.

2011
02:04:33.501 --> 02:04:37.040
I just took your information and heard what you had to say,
which is legitimate.

2012
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.070
I've seen

2013
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.090
<v 4>people where they,
they,</v>

2014
02:04:41.130 --> 02:04:44.690
they send up a complaint and then they get subdued,
but then the,

2015
02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.230
the leader doesn't follow up on the complaint.
Like,

2016
02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:49.680
I don't follow up and actually go up the chain of command and say,

2017
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:54.150
why aren't we getting better food?
That's going to be a problem.
Next session.

2018
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:58.760
It's,
hey,
you said you were gonna do some,
what's the answer?
And I said,
well,
I,
uh,

2019
02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.130
uh,
but the bit,
now you're mad,

2020
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:07.790
rightfully so.
And that's really it.
That's really the,

2021
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:11.370
that what tells the tale.
Cause like,
okay,
so a bitch session,
right?
That'll,

2022
02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:12.831
I mean,
uh,

2023
02:05:12.831 --> 02:05:17.400
along with complaints come with what I think is more important than like the

2024
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:21.090
complaint or the issue that's complained about more important is the motivation

2025
02:05:21.091 --> 02:05:25.890
to complain.
So let's say the food is junk,
right?

2026
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:30.120
If I think,
if I'm mad about that,
if that bothers me,
whether it be,

2027
02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:32.730
because I think the food should literally be better.

2028
02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:35.730
It should be better right now.
I don't know why it's bad right now,

2029
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:39.960
but I think it should be in that mix that bothers me at the very least that

2030
02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:44.700
produces a motivation,
a complaint.
But if the food can be just as bad,

2031
02:05:45.150 --> 02:05:46.560
but if I have an explanation,

2032
02:05:46.561 --> 02:05:49.050
I have no motivation to complain because they're not mad at that.

2033
02:05:49.051 --> 02:05:51.300
It's understandable.
So a bitch session will,

2034
02:05:51.930 --> 02:05:55.350
will develop when those feelings,

2035
02:05:55.351 --> 02:05:58.650
those motivations to complain or maintained or escalated.

2036
02:05:58.651 --> 02:06:01.860
So like if you're like swearing ward,
because,

2037
02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:04.510
because I said so I'm still mad,
totally throw,
I'm,

2038
02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.860
and I'm even a little bit more mad because of the way you said that to me.

2039
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:11.490
So that's when those bitch bitch sessions will come.

2040
02:06:11.491 --> 02:06:15.240
Or if he get a couple of people making the same complaint and then another

2041
02:06:15.241 --> 02:06:17.490
couple of people like you know,

2042
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:20.910
kind of refuting it or something like that word anywhere where there's emotions

2043
02:06:20.911 --> 02:06:25.500
kind of in one,
one key factor that you brought up is the is the building up,

2044
02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.650
right?
If you're constantly communicating with your people,

2045
02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:30.990
then the bitch sessions don't build up.

2046
02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:33.210
It's when you decide which one or you don't,

2047
02:06:33.211 --> 02:06:36.270
when you lock yourself in your own vacuum and you don't listen to what anyone

2048
02:06:36.271 --> 02:06:39.720
has to say.
And then once every six months you go,
hey guys,

2049
02:06:39.721 --> 02:06:42.870
we're going to have AI,
a Q and.
A.
If you guys have any questions for me,

2050
02:06:42.871 --> 02:06:45.210
you guys can come in and you guys can ask me questions.
Well,

2051
02:06:45.211 --> 02:06:47.480
these guys have been brewing up questions the last six months and they go,

2052
02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:51.570
they got some questions,
boy,
and they're going to hit you with a mark.

2053
02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:56.720
So you that if you want to prevent the bitch session from getting out of

2054
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:59.910
control,
guess what?
Communicate with your people more often.

2055
02:07:00.210 --> 02:07:02.880
It'll take that question about why is it food so bad?

2056
02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:06.630
By the time it's six months deep and that guy's been eating crappy food for six

2057
02:07:06.631 --> 02:07:07.500
months,
you,

2058
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:10.800
there's almost no solution that you can provide that's going to be good for
them.

2059
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:12.990
And by the way,
you wasted six months of trying to find a solution.

2060
02:07:12.991 --> 02:07:14.790
So that's just wrong.
So you're,

2061
02:07:14.791 --> 02:07:19.791
you're already starting off with a f with in a really negative situation.

2062
02:07:20.850 --> 02:07:24.810
So communicate with your people a lot.
Don't be afraid if some people say,

2063
02:07:24.811 --> 02:07:28.200
what if they asked me a question?
I don't know the answer to.
Cool.
You say,
Hey,

2064
02:07:28.201 --> 02:07:30.780
let me write this down and let me run this up the chain of command and find out

2065
02:07:30.781 --> 02:07:33.000
what's going on with that because I don't know the answer.
What if they,

2066
02:07:33.210 --> 02:07:36.040
what if they ask me a question that

2067
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.230
<v 0>I don't like the answer to,
right?
I don't like this.</v>

2068
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:43.000
I don't like what I've been told.
What you as the leader,

2069
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.020
as the leader and someone says,
you know,
I get told,
hey,

2070
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:50.480
you're not getting food because we prioritized one of the other platoons and

2071
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:53.050
they're getting all the stake,
which by the way would never happen.

2072
02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:56.770
But if they did that and then I,
and then someone says,
hey,

2073
02:07:56.771 --> 02:07:58.960
why are we getting this bad food?
And I go,

2074
02:07:58.961 --> 02:08:01.540
well it's cause they gave it to the platoon.
You know,
I,

2075
02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:05.860
I wouldn't say I would s I would answer the question truthfully,
which is like,

2076
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:07.090
listen,
this is what's going on right now.

2077
02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:10.930
For some reason they gave the other platoon all the stake.

2078
02:08:11.290 --> 02:08:12.250
Believe me,

2079
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:16.600
we have no greater champion for stake in this platoon than me.

2080
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:21.610
I am personally flying to see the boss and I'm going to figure out what's going

2081
02:08:21.611 --> 02:08:25.560
on.
We will get steak.
You know what I mean?
As opposed to just being mad or,

2082
02:08:25.561 --> 02:08:27.790
or not wanting to give the answer.
We're trying to hide it.

2083
02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.420
[inaudible] what's going on?
Oh,
I don't know why we're not getting sticky.

2084
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:32.650
You know why you're not getting steak.
Tell everyone.
Yeah,

2085
02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:34.660
don't the more open you are,

2086
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:38.170
and of course there's a dichotomy to this too because we can go too far and

2087
02:08:38.171 --> 02:08:38.771
telling the truth.

2088
02:08:38.771 --> 02:08:42.370
We can tell people the truth about things that they don't need to know about.

2089
02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.340
Right?
Yeah.
So you do have to be careful about that.

2090
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:51.280
You have to be careful.
You have to be judicious in telling the truth.

2091
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:56.550
You have to make sure that it makes sense in accomplishing the long term

2092
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:58.143
mission.

2093
02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:03.250
If I tell everyone that we're not getting food because we got cut off and we're

2094
02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:08.140
out here on her own and we're,
we have about three days worth of food and water,

2095
02:09:08.230 --> 02:09:10.330
and by the way,
we're not going to live and we're all gonna die,

2096
02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:14.290
so we should be happy with this.
That's,
that's,
that's,

2097
02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:16.860
that's not going to help my mission.
Now I could eat.

2098
02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:19.060
I could turn that into something that says,
listen,

2099
02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.140
well here's what's going on right now.

2100
02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:21.700
We're caught off and here's the mission of going to,

2101
02:09:21.701 --> 02:09:25.660
to undertake to make this happen.
It's probably not a great example,

2102
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:29.350
but I think we all understand that there's times if you screw up a video,

2103
02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:33.250
if you put a video together for me and it's got the worst Christmas music to the

2104
02:09:33.251 --> 02:09:34.690
video,
another terrible example,

2105
02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:37.990
I don't just drop the hammer on you and say you suck at editing.

2106
02:09:37.991 --> 02:09:40.930
Even though I kind of think that at the moment.
Instead I say,
Hey,

2107
02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:42.220
I like what you put together.
You know,

2108
02:09:42.221 --> 02:09:45.010
maybe can you explain why you did this music selection?

2109
02:09:45.011 --> 02:09:48.450
Cause for me it's a little bit different than what I would expect.
Yeah,

2110
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:53.230
thank you for that
check.
Going back to the book,

2111
02:09:53.231 --> 02:09:57.160
incidentally,
but most important I keep,

2112
02:09:57.190 --> 02:10:01.130
I keep adding emphasis to things that are literally not ms book.

2113
02:10:01.131 --> 02:10:03.970
So what that actually says incidentally,
but importantly,

2114
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:07.750
it doesn't say most important.
I added that I did.

2115
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.160
This is second time I've done that.
I've,

2116
02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:12.760
I've taken something to the next level even though just on my own accord,
hey,

2117
02:10:12.761 --> 02:10:14.720
you're funny or you're feeling that.

2118
02:10:14.721 --> 02:10:18.940
And so what it says is incidentally in parenthesis,
but importantly,

2119
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.130
this method of dealing with this fat dissatisfaction cheats.

2120
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:28.360
The fifth columnist and Saba saboteur who made lurk in the camp,

2121
02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:33.410
it is much safer for the army that men should pour their gripes into the of an

2122
02:10:33.411 --> 02:10:36.500
officer then that they should spill them in a beer joint,

2123
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:39.950
in town or in any other place where outsiders can listen.

2124
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:45.410
Another method of handling dissension and overt aggression is by punishment.

2125
02:10:46.190 --> 02:10:51.190
This is the chosen method of dictatorships and autocratic organizations.

2126
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:52.813
Generally,

2127
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:58.700
the method is commonly used even in America and most children have to learn that

2128
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:01.670
when they feel aggressive,
punishment is not that far away.

2129
02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.680
So another thing you can do when somebody asks you a question,

2130
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:10.190
Hey Jocko,
can you tell us why we're not getting any steak?

2131
02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:13.310
I'll tell you why we're not getting steak because you haven't worked hard
enough.

2132
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:17.450
Guess what you're doing tonight?
KP duty or whatever.
You know,

2133
02:11:17.451 --> 02:11:22.400
like when I punish you for asking your question.
That's like what autocrats do.

2134
02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:25.220
Dictators do that back to the book?

2135
02:11:25.221 --> 02:11:28.670
Sometimes the soldiers troubles can not be attribute attributed to any one

2136
02:11:28.671 --> 02:11:29.504
person.

2137
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:35.000
They are due to the conditions of war or of army life and ambitious and

2138
02:11:35.001 --> 02:11:39.860
energetic man may find himself so wound up in red tape that he can not do a good

2139
02:11:39.861 --> 02:11:43.610
job and organization may be all set to go forward to an objective but as

2140
02:11:43.611 --> 02:11:47.180
hindered by failure of supplies,
by shortages,
by weather,

2141
02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:48.710
no one is to blame,

2142
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:53.570
which I kind of disagree with that statement cause I always you're in charge of

2143
02:11:53.571 --> 02:11:57.470
that.
If you're in charge of that and then guess what,

2144
02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.540
you should have figured out how to get the supplies there in time.

2145
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.210
You should have figured out a contingency plan for the weather.

2146
02:12:02.211 --> 02:12:07.211
But what what they're talking about is sometimes things go wrong and continuing

2147
02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:12.920
on that this natural need for someone to blame and punish when things go wrong.

2148
02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.040
Responsible for much race and religious prejudice is also the cause for most

2149
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:24.521
corals that grow up between allies and between one branch of the service and

2150
02:12:24.741 --> 02:12:27.740
another.
So when you have these interservice rivalries,

2151
02:12:27.741 --> 02:12:32.090
it's cause there's no one else to blame when you have organizations where the

2152
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:37.830
production guys that the sales guys are selling stuff.

2153
02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.240
And the builders of the stuff,

2154
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:44.330
the engineers that design the stuff aren't getting it to them in time.

2155
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.510
When they're getting it to them in time,
that's fine,

2156
02:12:47.511 --> 02:12:52.400
but just the market is down and they start hating on each other when they should

2157
02:12:52.401 --> 02:12:56.960
be focusing on how to adjust to the market adaptations that need to be make made

2158
02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:58.640
or the market adjustments that need to be made.

2159
02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:01.940
Instead they're going at each other's throats.
Why?
Cause they're,

2160
02:13:01.941 --> 02:13:05.300
they're looking for someone to blame.
No one looked for someone to blame,

2161
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.250
figure out what the problem is,
insolvent

2162
02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.950
back to the book and occasional individual in any large group appears to

2163
02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:16.130
contradict all the rules about how aggression was built up.

2164
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:21.110
He will turn nasty when he's,
this is a really interesting psychological profile,

2165
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.580
so I'm going to read this again.

2166
02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.640
And occasional individual in any large group appears to contradict all the rules

2167
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:29.510
about how aggression was built up.

2168
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:34.990
He will turn nasty when he is treated with kindness and becomes very docile

2169
02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.230
under punishment or frustration.

2170
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:41.820
He is excessively polite and cooperative as long as he's kept in a subordinate

2171
02:13:41.821 --> 02:13:44.460
position.
But when he has put in command of other men,

2172
02:13:44.461 --> 02:13:46.470
he becomes tyrannical and overbearing.

2173
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:51.300
Such peculiar behaviors often the result of two severe punishment of self

2174
02:13:51.301 --> 02:13:53.220
assertion or aggressiveness and Childhood.

2175
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:58.140
This man is carrying around his own grouches and resentments bottled up inside

2176
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:00.840
them.
He's deeply anxious to punish and hurt other people,

2177
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:03.690
but as long as he is faced with the threat of punishment himself,

2178
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:06.780
he retains his childhood fear of showing his feelings.

2179
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:11.100
As soon as other people treat him decently and no longer appear like a threat to

2180
02:14:11.101 --> 02:14:13.500
him than his meanness lashes out.

2181
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:18.480
People who have this curious reversal of normal reaction to other people's

2182
02:14:18.481 --> 02:14:23.481
kindness or aggressiveness often like to boast that they are tough or hard and

2183
02:14:23.791 --> 02:14:26.130
that they respect a man will stand up to them.

2184
02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:31.350
This boast is an explanation that fool's many people even including the

2185
02:14:31.351 --> 02:14:34.540
explainer himself,
actually the respect they claimed.

2186
02:14:34.541 --> 02:14:36.990
A fuel is nothing but an unconscious fear.

2187
02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.890
A secret fear that the rebellious subordinate will punish them.

2188
02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:44.330
Such men make poor leaders,

2189
02:14:44.630 --> 02:14:47.870
they make their subordinates angry and uncooperative.

2190
02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.810
They work best when alone,

2191
02:14:53.070 --> 02:14:54.180
and this continues on.

2192
02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:59.630
The good leader is not afraid of criticism from his subordinates.

2193
02:15:01.610 --> 02:15:02.443
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2194
02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.060
<v 0>Amen.
I guess is what I would say to that.</v>

2195
02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:10.510
A good leader is not afraid of criticism from the subordinates.

2196
02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:16.110
He will encourage it as a constructive and cooperative way of eliminating causes

2197
02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:18.970
for resentment and dissension,

2198
02:15:19.330 --> 02:15:21.880
and he will use it himself and dealing with his subordinates.

2199
02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.710
But the criticism should be constructive and directed it some true cause of the

2200
02:15:26.711 --> 02:15:27.221
difficulty,

2201
02:15:27.221 --> 02:15:31.540
not some imagined evil or some harmless and defenseless person of the group.

2202
02:15:31.810 --> 02:15:34.120
It should not be a means of passing the buck.

2203
02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:38.830
Here's some rules for critics to keep in mind,

2204
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:44.020
so when you want to start throwing darts at the old man,
one,

2205
02:15:44.110 --> 02:15:48.460
stick to things that can be corrected.
Don't criticize dead issues.

2206
02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:52.480
We're on ultra bull situations.
You ever know?
Some people just get stuck,

2207
02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.830
they get stuck on something and they'll just never let it go.
Hey,

2208
02:15:56.831 --> 02:16:00.100
that happened three months ago.
I get it was a bad decision.

2209
02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:03.280
We would I if I could go back in time.
I do it a different way.
I didn't.

2210
02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:05.230
That's the call that got made.

2211
02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:09.400
Here's the adjustments we've made from what we learned and here's where we're

2212
02:16:09.401 --> 02:16:13.240
going forward.
Are you good with that?
Yeah,

2213
02:16:13.241 --> 02:16:14.470
but I'm just saying it where I can go

2214
02:16:18.130 --> 02:16:21.640
to be specific.
Keep to concrete issues.

2215
02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:25.810
Say what three limit the issue.

2216
02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:30.370
Don't blame the brass hats or the in general.

2217
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:34.960
<v 4>Say who.
That's a good one.
A lot of times we'd just like to blame them,
right?</v>

2218
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:36.650
They did it.
Yeah.

2219
02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:41.680
Suggest practical solutions to problems.

2220
02:16:41.710 --> 02:16:45.790
Don't arouse emotion without suggestion.
What to do about it.

2221
02:16:45.850 --> 02:16:50.680
Say how five stick to facts.
Don't swallow rumors,

2222
02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:53.380
especially access inspired rumors.

2223
02:16:56.350 --> 02:17:00.550
Six criticized leaders or men for their acts and policies,

2224
02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.320
not for their personalities.

2225
02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.100
Seven put blame where it belongs.

2226
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.920
Don't find scapegoats.

2227
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:12.550
I was gonna ask ways.

2228
02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:17.530
I wonder why it's so like appealing for lack of a better term,

2229
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:22.270
to blame other people.
Cause I mean,
I guess when you think about it,

2230
02:17:22.271 --> 02:17:26.290
it feels like
if I don't have to blame myself,

2231
02:17:26.291 --> 02:17:29.450
that's a safety thing,
right?
So we'll start there and then sure.

2232
02:17:29.451 --> 02:17:32.400
If someone will blame other things that are not people,

2233
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:36.040
I got another weather or the,
you know,
whatever.
But it's like,

2234
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:41.070
it's almost like it seems more satisfying to blame other people because I don't

2235
02:17:41.781 --> 02:17:41.891
know,

2236
02:17:41.891 --> 02:17:45.400
maybe because they would feel satisfying cause it takes the blame off of you.

2237
02:17:45.670 --> 02:17:49.090
Yeah.
But even,
even more than like blaming the weather.
Right.

2238
02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:52.800
Whether it's like,
it's almost like it's,
it's,

2239
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:56.800
it's more satisfying because if I can blame someone else because someone else

2240
02:17:56.801 --> 02:18:01.480
has the capability of actively trying to get in the way of my success.

2241
02:18:01.481 --> 02:18:05.270
So it's almost like this is what it feels like.
I,
I'm just wondering.
Yeah.

2242
02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:09.820
Because I don't feel good about blaming anything or anybody or anyone.

2243
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:14.140
Yeah.
So it could be cause yeah.
Cause you're really in touch with like,
you know,

2244
02:18:14.410 --> 02:18:18.370
that part of things.
But I'm just saying just by nature,

2245
02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.140
because it has to be a natural thing,
right.

2246
02:18:20.141 --> 02:18:23.470
It has to be like a natural reaction to something I would think,
you know,

2247
02:18:23.471 --> 02:18:26.230
in different people have it worse than another.
I would say that that's a,

2248
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.510
that's a reaction that's not to natural.

2249
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:33.600
And it's a reaction that you have to nourish and raised correctly in yourself.

2250
02:18:34.061 --> 02:18:37.620
Because when you,
when a little kid spells spills the milk,

2251
02:18:37.650 --> 02:18:42.430
when you walk into the kitchen and your daughter's sitting there and the milk is

2252
02:18:42.431 --> 02:18:45.820
spilled over,
she says,
you say what happened?

2253
02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:48.630
And she says the milk spilled.
Yeah,

2254
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.290
she's blaming the milk and the inanimate object already and she's four years
old,

2255
02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.670
five years old,
right.
I'm the same way.

2256
02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:02.080
Everyone starts off that way.
It's,
it's a blow to our ego to,

2257
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:04.420
to take the blame for things.
We don't like to do it.

2258
02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.140
So it's not like it's something you have to mature into.

2259
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:13.510
It's something you have to figure out over time and the more you figure it out,

2260
02:19:14.470 --> 02:19:15.520
the better off you're going to be.

2261
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:20.910
And I was talking with Dave Burke about this could deal Dave and he was like

2262
02:19:21.881 --> 02:19:24.940
really fired up one day and the,

2263
02:19:24.970 --> 02:19:29.970
the fire was coming and I forget even what,

2264
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:31.940
you know,
how we got on this topic.

2265
02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.130
<v 0>I actually,</v>

2266
02:19:34.140 --> 02:19:38.540
I do think we were talking about a client that we have at echelon front and he

2267
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:43.541
was trying to explain to them that everything like trying to explain to the

2268
02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:47.300
boss,
the CEO,
everything,

2269
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:53.360
everything is your fault.
Everything.
And the guy like,
no,
no,

2270
02:19:53.361 --> 02:19:55.280
I get it.
But

2271
02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:00.990
<v 4>yeah,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Everything.
No,
no,
no.
I get it.
No,
no,
it's,
I'm,</v>

2272
02:20:00.991 --> 02:20:04.420
I'm all about extreme ownership.
I get it,
man.
I,
that's a great book and a,

2273
02:20:04.421 --> 02:20:06.510
you know,
I'm definitely taking ownership of what's going on here,

2274
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:08.423
<v 0>but,</v>

2275
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:12.650
<v 4>and there's always a,
but,
but the market,</v>

2276
02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:14.930
but the d the guys that I hired,

2277
02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:17.870
but the person that dead I partnered with,

2278
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:22.220
but the person I bought the company from,
but it goes on and on,

2279
02:20:22.250 --> 02:20:27.020
but the real estate that we leased it,
it just goes on and on.
And guess what,

2280
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:29.540
if none of those are your probe and none of those,
your fault and guess what,

2281
02:20:29.541 --> 02:20:30.710
you're never going to fix any of them.

2282
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:35.210
So the idea that this stuff is 100%

2283
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:36.590
<v 0>your fault,</v>

2284
02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:42.460
100% your fault that's going on in your team s that it's hard to get that

2285
02:20:43.551 --> 02:20:46.130
through your brain.
Anyone's brain.

2286
02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:49.470
<v 4>Yeah.
It's weird.
He like he ever,
you know,</v>

2287
02:20:49.471 --> 02:20:53.400
when you're a kid or something or whether you witnessed someone else do this,

2288
02:20:53.401 --> 02:20:56.010
will you do it where it's like,
let's say you lost something,
right.

2289
02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:58.490
And sometimes the first reaction,
who took my whatever,

2290
02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:02.940
what do you mean that's a seal curse.
So the seal curse,
if you lose something,

2291
02:21:03.570 --> 02:21:07.350
as soon as you say,
hey,
you took my,
or hey,
somebody stole my,

2292
02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.510
as soon as you say those words come out of your mouth and you're gonna,

2293
02:21:09.511 --> 02:21:10.470
it's gonna appear in front of you,

2294
02:21:10.530 --> 02:21:14.920
you can actually do it like two to find something that evolves.
He's buying,

2295
02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:16.730
somebody's going to do,
then you'll find it immediate.

2296
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:21.450
That's probably my earliest memory in the seal teams of,
Hey,
don't blame people.

2297
02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:22.410
Is that right there?

2298
02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:26.850
Because if you can't find your sexy mar life jacket or whatever,

2299
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:30.390
so we took my second mark.
Oh,
there it is.
There's a willing stencil.

2300
02:21:30.391 --> 02:21:34.470
The JKO stencils on,
on that one right over there.
It was underneath another one.

2301
02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:36.750
But yes,
that's something that we all do.

2302
02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:40.380
But it's like a natural thing to think because,
okay.
I said I have these,

2303
02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:45.240
these slippers at home.
Do you mean flip flops?
No,

2304
02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:48.330
that's the thing there.
There are negatives in Hawaii.
We cost the flip flops.

2305
02:21:48.331 --> 02:21:49.780
Slit Phillip's.
Exactly right.

2306
02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:53.630
But these are slippery slope kind of like you can just fly in and out of like

2307
02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:57.850
when you're walking and whatever.
And uh,
so flip flops,
like if,

2308
02:21:57.870 --> 02:22:02.660
let's say you're wearing flip flops or thongs,
slippers,
flip flops are,

2309
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:05.790
so they're not that because if you're wearing socks,

2310
02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:09.660
which I haven't been recently,
cause it's kind of chilly but weak,

2311
02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:11.280
it's all wear socks.

2312
02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:15.180
So he can't just slide in and out of flip flops with socks on.
Not that good.

2313
02:22:15.210 --> 02:22:18.000
You know,
if I'm going to take out the trash or something like this.
So anyway,

2314
02:22:18.001 --> 02:22:21.090
I have these slippages a real comfortable too.
They're like just regular Nike,

2315
02:22:21.091 --> 02:22:22.350
like slippers,
whatever.

2316
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:27.090
So when can't find them for him,

2317
02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:28.350
it's his moment.
You know,

2318
02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:32.490
there's literally like six or seven places that are far away from each other.

2319
02:22:32.491 --> 02:22:36.770
By the way,
in my house,
six,
seven places that they could struggle is real.
Yes.

2320
02:22:37.390 --> 02:22:38.190
Charles was,

2321
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:42.450
my slippers are located in the far distance away inside my own house.

2322
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:47.280
They're really far apart.
I look in what place,

2323
02:22:47.281 --> 02:22:50.040
number one,
they're not their place.
Number two,
they're not there.

2324
02:22:50.041 --> 02:22:51.600
I automatically go.

2325
02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:55.960
My wife took swearing my slippers or someone grabbed my slippers.
You know?

2326
02:22:55.961 --> 02:22:58.920
That's like the thing even more so than the,
you know,

2327
02:22:58.921 --> 02:23:01.440
the four or five other places that I could easily.

2328
02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:05.910
That's why I think it's a natural thing.
It is a natural thing.
Yes.

2329
02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.720
You are correct.
Blame something.
I've been saying that for the whole time.

2330
02:23:09.721 --> 02:23:11.040
You and I have been doing this podcast.

2331
02:23:11.041 --> 02:23:13.430
It's a natural thing to blame someone else.
Yeah.

2332
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.400
That's why this idea of extreme ownership of actually taking ownership of the

2333
02:23:17.401 --> 02:23:22.380
problems that you have is very important and it's hard to enact.
Its not,

2334
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:24.670
it's not comfortable.
There's no one,

2335
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:28.860
even when people eat the book and they listened to every podcast and they talk

2336
02:23:28.861 --> 02:23:29.880
about it with their troops,

2337
02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:35.210
even then it's very easy to slide into an excuse and you blame someone or

2338
02:23:36.751 --> 02:23:37.590
something else.

2339
02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:42.000
And the problem with those excuses are they don't ever solve themselves.

2340
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:47.160
They don't fix themselves.
You can control you.
So take control over everything.

2341
02:23:48.330 --> 02:23:52.890
Take ownership of everything so that you can make them the way that they should

2342
02:23:52.891 --> 02:23:57.800
be.
What's the dichotomy in this?
That's why we wrote dichotomy leadership.

2343
02:23:57.830 --> 02:24:00.300
Cause some people took that and said okay well I'm just going to do everything

2344
02:24:00.301 --> 02:24:05.300
myself.
Yeah,
there's an old everything.
So now I'm going to hit her.

2345
02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:08.820
But you know what?
Send me a script for the video you're making right now.

2346
02:24:08.821 --> 02:24:13.020
I want to review it.
Send me up.
What's it called when you like draw the pictures,

2347
02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:14.470
send me up stories.

2348
02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:18.840
Tell me a story board for your next video ownership.
No,

2349
02:24:18.841 --> 02:24:22.110
that's not what I'm talking about.
There is a balance.
Yeah.

2350
02:24:22.770 --> 02:24:26.640
So this question pit,
you have to keep it balanced.

2351
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.670
So this question might not really care about the answer.

2352
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:33.980
So is it easier to blame another person or just something else,
like,

2353
02:24:34.310 --> 02:24:38.760
okay,
original point.
And to me it's the point is other than matters,

2354
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:43.110
I feel equally horrible.
I actually feel more horrible.

2355
02:24:43.111 --> 02:24:44.610
Blame blaming another person.

2356
02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.180
You seem to feel better about knowing of nursing under.
No,
I feel worse.

2357
02:24:48.181 --> 02:24:51.330
I feel bad.
I'm Brown.
I'm with you.
Okay.
Do you believe me?

2358
02:24:51.350 --> 02:24:55.890
Not blaming like something other than yourself.
It does feel really,

2359
02:24:55.891 --> 02:24:58.220
really whack.
Yes.
But,

2360
02:24:58.450 --> 02:25:03.450
and that's kind of the rule now you look after like four to six months of like

2361
02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:05.340
dealing with you in this stuff.

2362
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:09.870
It's like you became like a rule subconsciously or whatever.
Um,

2363
02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:13.840
so easy to identify when other people do it too.
Yes.
We fully,
we're like,

2364
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:17.280
well I was,
yeah.
And you feel it in yourself.

2365
02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:20.650
Even if you have the thought like you feel it.
But,
so I was,

2366
02:25:20.850 --> 02:25:25.780
I was thinking,
wondering,
and I guess it doesn't matter,
right?

2367
02:25:25.781 --> 02:25:27.160
Because the rule is the rule,

2368
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:31.450
but is it easier to blame a person because it's more comforting?

2369
02:25:31.451 --> 02:25:32.420
I was saying the genius teacher,

2370
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:37.180
it's easier to blame a thing because then it's free.
There's no guilt involved.

2371
02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:39.430
The weather was bad.
That's why we failed.
Oh,

2372
02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:41.230
the weather doesn't get mad at you cause you can where's?

2373
02:25:41.231 --> 02:25:43.780
I'm like a echo screwed up and dropped the ball.
That's why we failed.

2374
02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:47.590
You are going to be mad at it.
The weather's not going,
hey,
you got a flat tire.

2375
02:25:47.591 --> 02:25:50.440
That's why I'm late.
You should have left earlier.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You're like,

2376
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.400
that's blaming.
That's me taking ownership.
But it's easy.

2377
02:25:54.430 --> 02:25:56.500
But wouldn't it be more comforting to be like,
hey,

2378
02:25:56.501 --> 02:25:58.100
someone fly like let's say you,

2379
02:25:58.101 --> 02:26:00.170
you walked out to your car and your tire was flat.
Yeah.

2380
02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:04.900
He'd be more comforting if someone was actively trying to get in your way

2381
02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:08.440
because it seems more like,
okay,
that's why it got defeated by this situation,

2382
02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.430
I think to me saying,
Hey,
I walked out here.

2383
02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:15.470
There was a nail in my thing and you might take that one step,

2384
02:26:15.471 --> 02:26:18.490
but somebody left and down as soon.
I'm saying,
no,
I mean I wouldn't,

2385
02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:23.020
I don't think it would maybe hire,
you're sweating this distinction.

2386
02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:25.630
Don't blame other people or other things.
That's what you do.

2387
02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:29.140
You don't blame other people or other things.
I'm reveling in the understanding.

2388
02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.030
Don't revel in it.
Just do,
just take action.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you're right.

2389
02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:34.953
You're right.

2390
02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:39.820
And you know what we're going to wrap for today.

2391
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:43.990
We haven't even,
we haven't even covered the major,

2392
02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:46.660
the one of the main reasons why I'm covering this book.

2393
02:26:46.661 --> 02:26:51.160
We haven't even got to yet,
so we haven't even gotten to it yet.
I,

2394
02:26:51.350 --> 02:26:53.920
I don't want to jump into it right now because

2395
02:26:55.510 --> 02:27:00.070
this is a book where I'm highlighting entire pages,
entire pages.

2396
02:27:00.071 --> 02:27:01.660
I'm just so,

2397
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:07.690
I want to have time to discuss this properly and we will not have time to

2398
02:27:07.691 --> 02:27:09.880
discuss the rest of this properly today.

2399
02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.010
So one thing we do have hopefully time to discuss properly,

2400
02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:18.580
it's questionable because I know someone said the other day,

2401
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:24.250
I said on the podcast,
a,
all we need to do is no,
just wrap this up.

2402
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:29.670
And they looked at their podcast player and there was 47 minutes left,

2403
02:27:30.850 --> 02:27:35.510
and so it took you 47 minutes.
I'm blaming you.
I know.
I'm kind of,
I know,

2404
02:27:36.670 --> 02:27:37.001
I know.

2405
02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:42.001
I am at least partially guilty for lengthy sections of the podcast because what

2406
02:27:44.291 --> 02:27:47.950
I can't refrain from doing is making a little comment that spurns you to talk

2407
02:27:47.951 --> 02:27:51.190
about Hawaii five o other important topics.

2408
02:27:53.470 --> 02:27:58.060
So
we'll continue with this book next week.

2409
02:27:58.090 --> 02:28:00.340
Right now if you,

2410
02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:06.160
if you want to compete.
Sure.
In life.
Look,

2411
02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:11.250
I'm not saying you got to look at life as one big competition win or loose,

2412
02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:16.090
but I'm saying you should at least consider that that's kind of happening

2413
02:28:16.091 --> 02:28:19.300
whether you want it to be happening or not in that,

2414
02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:23.510
in that view,
you want to

2415
02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:31.040
get on a path,
a path of victory,
a path of discipline,

2416
02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:32.240
a path of winning.

2417
02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:37.250
And I know you have some things that might help us in there.
Yes sir.

2418
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:39.110
I do Echo Charles.
So it is one of these.

2419
02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:42.830
So if you like the way you live your life,
right?
You're,

2420
02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:46.310
it's like you're preparing for a battle metaphorically.
You're rule or whatever,

2421
02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:50.840
right?
Sure.
You're not competing with me or with whatever in,

2422
02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:54.800
in every single little thing.
Right?
In fact,

2423
02:28:54.801 --> 02:28:58.040
you're a big part of what you do is collaborate with me.
True,
good.

2424
02:28:58.041 --> 02:29:02.210
Collaborate with other people,
but it's a,
we can win so we can win.
Exactly.
Right.

2425
02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:04.190
And in addition to that,

2426
02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:07.710
if you wake up just one moment and you're in the company,

2427
02:29:07.711 --> 02:29:11.300
the heated competition of whatever,

2428
02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:15.080
you're going to be more prepared to win.

2429
02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:19.850
Sin told few PR.
If you put yourself in stressful situations,

2430
02:29:19.870 --> 02:29:24.470
you'll be more prepared when the real stress comes.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2431
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:27.830
So let's say Jujitsu for example,
right?

2432
02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:30.950
Let's stressful situation you can put yourself right into.
Yeah.
So let,

2433
02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:34.980
let daily basis think about this too and where,
you know,
the whole collaboration,

2434
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.240
competition,
balance goes give me,

2435
02:29:37.241 --> 02:29:41.420
and you were competing in Jiu Jitsu with each other.
When we train,
right.

2436
02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:43.850
Or,
or end,

2437
02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:48.230
we're competing with ourselves because you're using me to just get better in

2438
02:29:48.231 --> 02:29:50.830
general.
So sure.
There's a part of it that's like you're trying to do,

2439
02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:52.040
feed me whatever.

2440
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:56.730
But the main part is you're trying to defeat how,
you know the,

2441
02:29:56.731 --> 02:30:00.850
the gut yourself.
Yes.
Beat,
you know,
a month ago or a day ago,
whatever.
Yes.

2442
02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:05.120
Trying to get better.
And to do that,
you have to collaborate with me.

2443
02:30:05.121 --> 02:30:09.590
Who's going to provide that stress on you see,
so it's always like,

2444
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.430
I think there's always an overarching competition.

2445
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:17.110
That's the life game.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

2446
02:30:17.570 --> 02:30:21.860
With varying levels of outcome.
Lots of little competitions along the way.

2447
02:30:21.861 --> 02:30:24.950
Some of them are important,
some of them aren't.
Some you've got to surrender.

2448
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:28.970
Yeah,
because it's going to propel you further in the long game.

2449
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.110
Some of them will feel like they should be a competition when they should be a

2450
02:30:33.111 --> 02:30:37.960
collaboration.
They should be okay.
Anyway,
back to Jujitsu.

2451
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:41.240
Okay.
Jeez too.
We're doing,
we're all doing Jiu Jitsu.
If you're not,

2452
02:30:41.241 --> 02:30:43.490
then just due to just eat.
You have to,

2453
02:30:43.530 --> 02:30:48.050
you essentially have to to to know the path broadly.

2454
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:53.050
One thing that's good about Jujitsu is it is also,

2455
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:57.230
I talked about combat and war being a revealer.

2456
02:30:57.580 --> 02:31:01.910
Jujitsu is revealing to,
oh,
it feels about the things about yourself.

2457
02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:05.570
It reveals things about human nature,
real,
real things about your ego.

2458
02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:07.520
It reveals things about your temper.

2459
02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:11.360
It reveals a lot of things and it reveals those things about other people and

2460
02:31:11.361 --> 02:31:15.470
you start to be able to sense and understand other people better because you see

2461
02:31:15.471 --> 02:31:17.510
their reactions,
you see how they respond,

2462
02:31:17.511 --> 02:31:22.511
you see how they get through or don't get through trying situations.

2463
02:31:22.930 --> 02:31:23.730
It's really in.

2464
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:28.730
So there is some really good benefits beyond the fact that you will get a good

2465
02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:34.430
workout beyond the fact that you will truly learn to defend yourself in bad

2466
02:31:35.371 --> 02:31:39.690
situations.
You will also learn about life.
Yes,

2467
02:31:39.860 --> 02:31:44.250
you will learn about people and you will learn about yourself.

2468
02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:45.990
Yes sir.

2469
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:49.440
So go down to your local Jujitsu Academy and tell them you want to train some of

2470
02:31:49.441 --> 02:31:52.450
the digits zoo.
That's kind of abstract though though.

2471
02:31:52.451 --> 02:31:55.440
What you said what's true and like,
you know when you'll learn about life,

2472
02:31:55.441 --> 02:31:59.130
not abstract.
Sorry.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.

2473
02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:01.980
It's general though.
Here's,
here's some of the specific,

2474
02:32:01.981 --> 02:32:06.981
you know what if I told you I've learned more about life and people and myself

2475
02:32:07.201 --> 02:32:11.820
from Jujitsu,
then I have learned about self defense from Jujitsu.

2476
02:32:12.130 --> 02:32:13.160
And that's a bold statement.

2477
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:18.170
I don't know what that might not be specifically true cause I don't think I've

2478
02:32:18.421 --> 02:32:22.040
learned a lot,
but I'm,
you learned so much about actually fighting.
Yes.

2479
02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:27.100
That's kind of what I just said.
Not really.
It could be fraud.

2480
02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:32.240
There's a lot,
but I don't want to exaggerate and lie.
Well,
here's why we say,

2481
02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:34.920
well,
here's why I started in,
in whether,
I mean,

2482
02:32:34.921 --> 02:32:39.120
I think you started before this event,
so okay,
so there's,

2483
02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:43.980
there is this family,
they said,
hey,
we developed this martial art,
you know,

2484
02:32:43.981 --> 02:32:46.560
whatever.
Is there a reason?
You're not saying the Gracie family,

2485
02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:50.440
it was gonna it was going to develop it into oak story,
but yes.

2486
02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:52.890
So the Gracie family,
they developed their martial art.
They were like,
Hey,

2487
02:32:52.891 --> 02:32:55.850
this is our fighting style.
It real fighting now.
So let's,

2488
02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:56.693
this is what we're going to do.

2489
02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:00.540
We're going to invite everyone from all around the world with whatever fighting

2490
02:33:00.541 --> 02:33:03.970
style.
No matter how big,
no matter how small the guy is,
whatever fighting stuff,

2491
02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:08.100
we can invite everybody to come,
come like fight.
No time limit,

2492
02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:10.710
no rules,
no nothing.
Just everyone's going to fight.

2493
02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:12.510
See who's fighting style is the best.
Right.

2494
02:33:12.890 --> 02:33:16.410
It sounds like an old school like movie or something.
Yeah,
but it's true.
Yeah.

2495
02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:20.940
Straight up happen.
99 1993 right?
Yeah,
Colorado.

2496
02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:25.500
So they come and hoists Gracie,

2497
02:33:25.501 --> 02:33:28.840
who's hundred 65 pounds.
Oh,
he's not 165 pounds.
He's,

2498
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:35.120
I don't think so.
I think he was like one 62 or three actions.
Check with voice.

2499
02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:40.770
You'll see one two,
three one,
two four if you rolled with voice before.
No,

2500
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.210
he's not small broke.
Yeah,
he's tall.
He's tall,
but he's thinner.
Yeah.

2501
02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:45.620
It then there,

2502
02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:50.340
but he's not like skinny and he wasn't skinny back then.

2503
02:33:50.430 --> 02:33:52.920
He wants to wait at least one 80 I'm going to give him one 80 what?

2504
02:33:52.921 --> 02:33:55.890
We'll talk to hoist and get confirmation.
We'll talk to some of our people.

2505
02:33:55.891 --> 02:33:57.720
I think one sixties yeah.
Anyway,

2506
02:33:57.750 --> 02:34:02.730
if he was one 60 I would have to check the scales.
Well,

2507
02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:03.511
nonetheless,

2508
02:34:03.511 --> 02:34:06.600
have you ever heard that they reasoned hoists was fighting and not Hixon is

2509
02:34:06.601 --> 02:34:11.601
because her voice was smaller and slender and look to less boots imposing,

2510
02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.750
didn't Hixon.
Yeah.
Who did look imposing,
right?
Yeah.

2511
02:34:15.751 --> 02:34:20.110
And that was kind of an added,
like more imposing.
Who looked more imposing?

2512
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:23.980
Hixon Gracie or Ken shamrock and Shama Ken shamrock.

2513
02:34:23.981 --> 02:34:25.300
Loved real imposing.

2514
02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.010
That's why it was so shocking when hoists at 160 pounds apparently.

2515
02:34:30.850 --> 02:34:35.350
Tap them out.
Yeah.
So the store,
the store,
the facts go,

2516
02:34:35.351 --> 02:34:37.780
this is what happened.
You can watch it on the old videos.

2517
02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.200
So they called it the ultimate fighting challenge is what they called it,

2518
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:46.570
the UFC.
Sure.
So Hoists Gracie surprisingly beats up everyone.

2519
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:49.300
This wasn't the kind of like you have one fight in one night,

2520
02:34:49.390 --> 02:34:52.420
this is like four fights in a way.
If you,
when you go on,
you know,

2521
02:34:52.421 --> 02:34:53.380
no time limit by the way.

2522
02:34:54.010 --> 02:34:59.010
Full contact fighting headbutt like whatever the kick in the groin and whatever.

2523
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:05.490
Anyway,
hoists Gracie beats everybody,
including Ken Shamrock who's like what?

2524
02:35:05.491 --> 02:35:09.220
And he was like two 20 she was at risk of 20 shoot fighting,
wrestling,

2525
02:35:09.221 --> 02:35:13.930
like just bad ass.
He went for a full block.
He went for a few lucky,
she's crazy.

2526
02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:17.900
She's got on top.
Yeah.
And hoist new to defend it.
That's even crazier,
you know,

2527
02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:21.430
go out and talk and choked him up.
And then guys like who,

2528
02:35:21.431 --> 02:35:24.810
I don't think people talk enough about this Guy Pat Smith and he was Patrick

2529
02:35:24.810 --> 02:35:28.710
Smith,
obesity bare knuckle kickboxing champions like 250.

2530
02:35:28.711 --> 02:35:32.950
And know that's what it said on the,
on the video.
Um,
tough,

2531
02:35:32.951 --> 02:35:36.610
bad ass beating guys up real bad.
In fact,
he beat this,

2532
02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.500
this Ninja guy up on UFC two.
And I was like,
as a kid watching,

2533
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:45.860
I was like,
Dang,
that's like,
this is brutal man.
This is like scary,
brutal.
And um,

2534
02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:48.880
nowadays that's nothing.
You know,
you're under,
you've seen us do nothing.

2535
02:35:48.881 --> 02:35:49.541
But nonetheless,

2536
02:35:49.541 --> 02:35:53.860
it was brutal then and hoists Gracie beat him up and hoists Gracie beat him up.

2537
02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:56.410
He,
he didn't do a submission hold on him.

2538
02:35:57.130 --> 02:36:01.160
He just had him in the mouth and just punching.
He tapped due to strike,
you know.

2539
02:36:01.390 --> 02:36:04.600
Anyway,
so the point is hoists Gracie with Gracie Jujitsu,

2540
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:06.700
which is Brazilian Jujitsu.
It's interchangeable nowadays.

2541
02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:12.580
Beat up everyone proving that it's like the ultimate fighting style.
Yeah.

2542
02:36:13.390 --> 02:36:17.870
So that's why that's the number one reason I think most people come into it too.

2543
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:22.660
That's definitely a good reason.
I think,
well back then I would say this,

2544
02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:27.960
that's the number one reason in 99319941995 white people want to do Jitsu.

2545
02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:33.250
I think Jujitsu now is,
I think Jujitsu as a whole is more popular.

2546
02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:34.870
You can get you to from anywhere.

2547
02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:37.730
I mean at wrestling tournament there's all kinds of kids day walking around

2548
02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:40.300
Jujitsu,
tee shirts on.
They didn't even,
they weren't even close.

2549
02:36:40.330 --> 02:36:43.570
They weren't even,
they were 12 years old.
Yeah.

2550
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:48.130
And now it's to remember 1993 think about something that happened,

2551
02:36:48.250 --> 02:36:52.360
whatever 20 years before you were you born in 77 think of something that

2552
02:36:52.361 --> 02:36:57.010
happened in 1957 I can't think of one single thing.
And that's what I'm saying.

2553
02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:00.370
That's when the first UFC happened against kids 20 years before they were born.

2554
02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:04.630
They don't remember it.
It's not even a thing.
But what they do remember is like,

2555
02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:09.220
oh,
some kid down the street knows how to fight.
He choked me.

2556
02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:10.510
I want to learn that.
Yeah.

2557
02:37:10.511 --> 02:37:15.511
Well if they're watching ultimate fight night last night or the other night or

2558
02:37:15.561 --> 02:37:18.410
whatever,
and they saw crone,
Gracie,
yes.

2559
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:21.380
Choke out the guy in UFC in the first round,

2560
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:25.370
someone's going to join two to three cause that anywhere.
That is true.
Yes,

2561
02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:29.480
that was true.
A beautiful display of Jujitsu.
Very chrome.

2562
02:37:29.481 --> 02:37:33.080
Gary from Kron Gracie.
Yeah.
And that always feels good.

2563
02:37:33.081 --> 02:37:35.750
Cut It because it's a reminder because it's easy like now,

2564
02:37:35.751 --> 02:37:39.050
cause everyone knows that you did,
you know,
varying levels of whatever in UFC.

2565
02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:41.690
But when you get a guy who like so good at Jujitsu,

2566
02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:45.140
every once in a while like heal and Damien Maia would do this to where they'd

2567
02:37:45.141 --> 02:37:48.910
remind everyone,
like how powerful,
if you're just really good at Jujitsu and,

2568
02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:51.980
and the other guy doesn't quite have those elements or whatever,

2569
02:37:51.981 --> 02:37:56.570
it's really reminds me and lender dean lister.
He reminds me of that a lot.

2570
02:37:56.870 --> 02:38:00.920
Yeah,
for sure.
Nevertheless,
well do we need you to,
and we need a Gig.

2571
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:04.830
What did he do?
We get,
we get origin.
He's made America,
you know,

2572
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.780
from the cotton all the way up to the game in America for Jujitsu,

2573
02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:13.490
not many other are martial arts as well.
Just for Jujitsu specifically,

2574
02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:14.630
not [inaudible].

2575
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:19.940
They're not made for Iq for Jujitsu made in America.
They're,

2576
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:23.090
they're the best geese.
Straight up.

2577
02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:25.700
There's not even any question about that one origin,

2578
02:38:25.701 --> 02:38:29.180
mean.com that's also got a rash guards,
rash guards.

2579
02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:33.050
If you won't need rash guards for your Nogi situations.
I got t shirts,

2580
02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:36.920
sweatshirts,
jeans.

2581
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:41.750
He just sent me a picture of genes coming off the rack there in production at

2582
02:38:41.751 --> 02:38:45.590
this time.
Jeans.
So be ready to get jeans.

2583
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:50.750
Also supplements from origin labs,
best kind of supplements,

2584
02:38:50.751 --> 02:38:52.610
the kind of maintain your joints.
Joint Warfare.

2585
02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:58.060
I strew I incurred a hip injury.

2586
02:38:58.710 --> 02:39:03.560
Um,
yeah,
the other day and it's really bad that night.
So it,

2587
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:07.280
oh,
I don't overdose.
Can you overdose on joint warfare?
I'm not sure.

2588
02:39:07.281 --> 02:39:10.190
I haven't tried.
So add just one pill.
Usually I take,

2589
02:39:10.191 --> 02:39:13.430
how many did you take at night?
Three.
Take three a day.
Okay.

2590
02:39:13.431 --> 02:39:16.670
I take three in the morning.
Three at night.
Okay.
So I went to and two.
Okay.

2591
02:39:16.850 --> 02:39:18.830
And I'm like,
I'm just going to do this or whatever.

2592
02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:24.040
And it was surprising the difference between night one of the injury and night

2593
02:39:24.681 --> 02:39:29.210
two of the injury was surprising given how the injury fell.
There you go.

2594
02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:31.670
So this is the,
yeah,
so joint warfare and these are the,

2595
02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:34.670
now I think these are the most important kind of supplements.
There's,

2596
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:37.190
I think I agree with you.
Joint Warfare,

2597
02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:41.330
Krill oil discipline and discipline.
Go

2598
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:44.120
when you need a little bit of

2599
02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.040
need to get me to know you need to get up on step is what we call it in the

2600
02:39:49.041 --> 02:39:49.670
teams.

2601
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:53.810
Well and what that means is you're in a little Zodiac boat and the Zodiac boat

2602
02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.230
going across the water with a 55 horsepower engine.
If you're out on the,

2603
02:39:57.231 --> 02:39:58.640
on the west coast,
on the east coast,

2604
02:39:58.641 --> 02:40:01.910
they use a smaller engine on the west coast or you use a big 55 horsepower

2605
02:40:01.911 --> 02:40:04.490
engine cause you're out in the Pacific and the waves are freaking huge.

2606
02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:09.780
But the reaches a point where it kind of the,

2607
02:40:09.781 --> 02:40:12.650
the boats like trying to push.
And then it gets on the,

2608
02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:16.920
it's in the water and then it gets kind of on the surface of the water and all

2609
02:40:16.921 --> 02:40:21.510
of a sudden he goes,
where there and then you're going fast.
You're on step,

2610
02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:25.680
getting on step.
I don't know where that comes from,
but Zodiac.

2611
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:29.810
So it's like the perfect zone where the water catches the water,

2612
02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:34.320
the boats drag.
Yes.
It's the minimum amount of drag for the boat.

2613
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:38.940
And that's what I feel like when I take discipline.
Go.

2614
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:44.100
That's it.
You got to go.
I'm going to meet with someone.
I take like,
you know,

2615
02:40:44.101 --> 02:40:46.380
in a meeting I'm going to be working with a company,

2616
02:40:47.050 --> 02:40:51.550
takes some discipline to go get the mind firing correctly.
That's up.

2617
02:40:51.570 --> 02:40:54.600
Don't forget about moke additional protein,

2618
02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:57.360
additional protein and delicious.
Well,

2619
02:40:57.361 --> 02:41:00.840
you can call it additional protein or you can just call it dessert and straight

2620
02:41:00.841 --> 02:41:05.841
on yesterday I had three scoops of where your kid strawberry milk and I was just

2621
02:41:09.331 --> 02:41:13.590
sitting there drinking it and being happy about the whole world.
Guilt,

2622
02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:16.140
three guilt.
But Hey,
look,
can you,

2623
02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:20.100
can you can have beverage make you happy to be alive?
Yes,

2624
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:23.730
Warrior cake,
strawberry milk can make you can,

2625
02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:28.920
you can make you happy to just be in the world and just be looking in beach,

2626
02:41:28.921 --> 02:41:33.810
sipping on it and being and having a whole,
a whole big cup and you're just,

2627
02:41:33.811 --> 02:41:36.990
every sip is you're not,
you're not even uh,
what's the word?

2628
02:41:37.050 --> 02:41:40.740
You're not even rationing yourself at all.
It's just wait,
sipping,

2629
02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:45.360
just free form.
Just as much as you can put in your mouth.

2630
02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:50.390
Like just beautiful strawberry milk and are really getting crazy now where I'm,

2631
02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.890
I've,
I'm really scatterbrained.
I'm like peanut butter milk.
They can,
all right.

2632
02:41:57.930 --> 02:42:00.300
So anyways,
that's that very good.

2633
02:42:00.350 --> 02:42:05.350
All that stuff is@originmain.com also Jocko was a store,

2634
02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:11.100
it's called Choco store and that's where you can be on the path for sure.

2635
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:16.670
Be on the path requirement but if you want to represent while on the path but a

2636
02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:22.090
Jocko store.com got some cool shirts on there,
more rash guards,
you know,

2637
02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:27.070
more representative of the path.
Specifically some hoodies on there,

2638
02:42:27.071 --> 02:42:32.010
some hats.
Yup.
Truckers and stuff specifically or flex fit,
whatever you like,

2639
02:42:32.011 --> 02:42:35.580
Bro.
Both however you want to represent and here's the thing.
Look,
I don't,

2640
02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:38.940
I don't know if I'm going to put zip up hoodies on there.
I don't know.

2641
02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:44.310
I think so.
That might not be your thing.
They better be so thick.

2642
02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:49.580
Maybe they'll get the whole world,
the whole world stops and says,
hmm,

2643
02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:51.840
if I was in somewhere cold,

2644
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:55.020
I would wear that because the whole world will say has actually that makes
sense.

2645
02:42:55.020 --> 02:42:57.900
If you go ultra thick with the zip up,

2646
02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.610
the reason you want zip up his cause you got other clothes on.

2647
02:43:00.611 --> 02:43:03.240
It's an awkward taking it on and off,
over overhead.

2648
02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:07.410
That's why he got the zip because it's a real heavy duty.

2649
02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:10.290
I prefer the Zip light or heavy.
Yeah,

2650
02:43:10.470 --> 02:43:15.040
but you prefer the pullover as you indicated.
One point I like to pull over,

2651
02:43:15.130 --> 02:43:19.240
if we're talking about w you know,
medium weight,

2652
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:21.750
but if we're going to ultra heavyweight,

2653
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.780
which no one has showed me ultra heavy weight,
I want to see ultra heavyweight.

2654
02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:28.480
I want something that actually is hard to pick up kind of

2655
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:33.370
physically.
Nonetheless,

2656
02:43:33.371 --> 02:43:38.200
I think I'm going to go with some zip up stuff for Jocko store.

2657
02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:41.500
Look good at it.
That's what I think.
And brainstorm as you brainstorm that.

2658
02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:46.560
Let me see the samples and let me talk to the producers of the fabric so I can

2659
02:43:47.561 --> 02:43:51.550
make sure that it is the heaviest and most durable and warm mist fabric.

2660
02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:55.600
All right.
Oh well it's a promise.
All right,
there it is.
It a,
again,

2661
02:43:55.601 --> 02:43:59.230
it's that Jocko store.com gone there.
He liked something.

2662
02:43:59.231 --> 02:44:03.520
Get something good way to represent while you're on the path.

2663
02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:08.700
Also Jocko white tea if you were are a tea drinker or not a tea drinker,

2664
02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.110
still drink Jocko white tea for various reasons.

2665
02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:18.610
So I gave some of this to my neighbor.
We're doing some things,
you know,

2666
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:23.890
and uh,
she goes,
oh my gosh,
yes.
You know,
like it was the one in the camp.

2667
02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:28.480
Um,
so my wife gave her three of them and she's like,
oh my gosh,

2668
02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:30.670
thank you so much.
This is so good.

2669
02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:34.690
And it's so hard to find t and a can that's certified organic.

2670
02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:38.000
That was the front running thing for interesting.

2671
02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:42.520
So I'm like looking at her like understanding that she has no idea that she can

2672
02:44:42.521 --> 02:44:47.350
like deadlift 8,000 pounds or you know,
like all these other added benefits.

2673
02:44:47.351 --> 02:44:52.140
But nonetheless,
it really demonstrated how fast the,
uh,

2674
02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:54.560
benefits,
you know,
and the,

2675
02:44:55.270 --> 02:44:58.870
it's kind of a weird perspective to have on life when you,

2676
02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:04.500
when you rate certified organic over a guaranteed of dead lift of 8,000 pounds.

2677
02:45:05.770 --> 02:45:09.100
Now clinically,
you know,
it's crazy little bit strange nonetheless.

2678
02:45:09.101 --> 02:45:12.250
A after you know,
a little bit of thought.
I understand.
Cause you know,

2679
02:45:12.251 --> 02:45:16.030
there's a nice lady who lives next door and um,
you know,
I dug it either way,

2680
02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:20.220
but one of the added benefits was brought to the surface and I liked dish room.

2681
02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:22.240
Speaking of,
uh,
benefits,

2682
02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:26.310
subscribe to the podcast to which we were going to stop saying until it was,

2683
02:45:26.311 --> 02:45:30.370
people noted that they didn't subscribe to the podcast until echo actually set

2684
02:45:30.371 --> 02:45:34.570
it on podcast 164 or no,
163.
And someone's like,

2685
02:45:34.810 --> 02:45:37.720
I listened to 163 podcasts and hadn't subscribed.

2686
02:45:38.210 --> 02:45:42.340
So subscribe to the podcast or echo will keep telling you to.

2687
02:45:42.370 --> 02:45:44.260
And don't forget about the warrior kid podcasts.

2688
02:45:44.530 --> 02:45:48.280
Lagging lagging on the warrior kid podcast.

2689
02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.130
And I got told by young Alana,
you know Alana?

2690
02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:56.000
Sure I got told by Alana's Dad said he,
she's like,

2691
02:45:56.350 --> 02:46:00.920
he said she has memorized the first whatever it is,
21 podcast.

2692
02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:05.020
And I said,
I looked at her and I said,
I'm sorry,
I'll make more.
And she said,

2693
02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:08.860
it's okay,
but she didn't mean it.
I don't think she meant it.

2694
02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:09.920
I think she was Kinda like

2695
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:13.550
<v 0>just being nice.
She's a nice girl.
I don't think she wanted to say,
yeah,</v>

2696
02:46:13.551 --> 02:46:17.930
you should if some more podcasts because the first 21 are getting worn out.

2697
02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:23.650
Warrior could podcast a good podcast for kids to learn a really solid lessons

2698
02:46:25.970 --> 02:46:29.600
about life.
Don't forget about the warrior kids soap,

2699
02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:32.150
Irish oaks ranch.com where Aiden,

2700

got manufacturing happening.

it's soap.
Is it an iPhone?
No,

2707
02:47:00.051 --> 02:47:03.440
but you know what?
What were you doing at 13 years old?
You weren't,

2708
02:47:03.441 --> 02:47:06.710
you didn't have a manufacturing line set up?
I don't think so.

2709
02:47:06.711 --> 02:47:10.070
If you want to support kid,
a kid warrior give that's getting after it,

2710
02:47:10.071 --> 02:47:15.071
Irish oaks ranch.com and get yourself some soap so that you can stay clean.

2711
02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:21.800
You know youtube videos.
Yes.
If you like watching youtube videos,

2712
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:23.150
that's not good.

2713
02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:26.780
You probably don't need to watch youtube videos of their distracting.

2714
02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:30.830
They take up a bunch of time.
If you do feel the need,

2715
02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:36.010
you might as well watch this youtube video of this podcast or the smaller

2716
02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.880
excerpts of this podcast that are clipped out or you can even watch echos.

2717
02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:46.850
Legit videos,

2718
02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:51.770
which are videos that echo his modified with CGI.

2719
02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.280
Straight up,
straight up CGI,
Chinet image,

2720
02:47:55.281 --> 02:47:59.420
computer generated graphics.
That's what echo is good at.

2721
02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:04.040
That's his thing.
He's good at that and he's going to curls

2722
02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:08.420
not as good as I was before.

2723

So subscribe to the Youtube Channel and then you can watch all these videos.

Psychological warfare,
don't forget about that.

2725
02:48:17.930 --> 02:48:22.190
Echo is just know showing me a funny thing on the gram,

2726
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:26.840
the gram Instagram of a girl that was lip sinking,

2727
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:29.990
a psychological warfare video and I have to say it was awesome.

2728
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:32.930
I'm going to try and find it and put it out there so everyone can see.

2729
02:48:32.931 --> 02:48:36.400
This girl was super fired up and good at lip syncing.

2730
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:39.110
Yeah she knows like spot on.
Spot on.

2731
02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:43.760
If you didn't know you or her like you'd be like,
Bro,
this girl's voices weird.

2732
02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:47.230
You know,
cause she has your voice with it cause it's,
it looks really good.

2733
02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:49.130
She did a good job with that.

<v 2>legit fitness gear while you're still with developing your home gym,</v>

2740
02:49:13.111 --> 02:49:17.310
which we always are.
I still am.
This is where you get your stuff.

2741
02:49:17.311 --> 02:49:20.940
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash jack or a lot of good stuff on there.

2742
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:25.140
I just got a storm trooper.
Oh wait,
I told you this last time.
Okay,

2743
02:49:25.141 --> 02:49:28.440
so I made a mistake.
So storm troopers are not clones.

2744
02:49:28.650 --> 02:49:31.380
Stormtroopers are like individual humans.
Yeah.

2745
02:49:31.381 --> 02:49:35.920
That they raise from kids or whatever.
Clones are,
uh,

2746
02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:41.240
the clones from McClone war who came from bubble fit or Jango Fett.

2747
02:49:41.850 --> 02:49:42.520
One of them.

2748
02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:44.320
<v 0>Once again,
Bro,
you're out of my league.</v>

2749
02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.200
<v 2>Yeah,
well I was talking about him.</v>

2750
02:49:46.210 --> 02:49:50.820
I got scolded by my brother and various people for not knowing the Charles

2751
02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:55.140
jumped on you like you just,
he was literally listening to it in my presence.

2752
02:49:55.141 --> 02:49:57.240
I didn't know you was,
he got into it.
She paused.

2753
02:49:57.241 --> 02:50:00.290
He's like Bra and I'm going to hit on one of these,
you know,
kind of like us,

2754
02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:02.370
like Ooh.
It was like that Cayenne and

2755
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:08.010
resort and he was,
he was mad nonetheless.

2756
02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.410
I still got the storm trooper kettle bell,

2757
02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:14.340
which has nothing to do with any clones.
It's just dope.
And it's a kettle bell,

2758
02:50:14.341 --> 02:50:17.130
which is good for,
you know you're working on and stuff.
Anyway,

2759
02:50:17.131 --> 02:50:19.980
I got it from on it.
That's where they have the best,
the best kettle bells,

2760
02:50:19.981 --> 02:50:22.110
the best stuff.
Go on there and get something from there.

2761
02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:24.930
It's really good stuff on it.com/jock

2762
02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:30.320
<v 0>we also have some books.
What kind of books?
Well books for reading,</v>

2763
02:50:30.470 --> 02:50:34.520
I guess you might say Mike in the dragons.
How'd you like Mike in the Dragon?

2764
02:50:34.521 --> 02:50:36.830
Snouts Denny,
how often do you read it?

2765
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:41.420
<v 2>So I re it's not on any kind of rotation,</v>

2766
02:50:41.421 --> 02:50:42.770
but I've read it three times

2767
02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:47.310
<v 0>to the children.
Yeah.
And did they support?
Yeah.</v>

2768
02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:50.500
<v 2>So you know what's funny,
they live,
not only do it like reading it,</v>

2769
02:50:50.501 --> 02:50:54.880
they like watching the video,
which,
and I'm working on the whole book video,

2770
02:50:55.300 --> 02:50:57.480
so when I work on it or whatever,
they,
you know that

2771
02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:03.280
I'm not always uninterrupted.
We'll say that.
So they'll see me working on that.

2772
02:51:03.281 --> 02:51:06.250
Then I get constant interruption cause they want to watch it.

2773
02:51:06.251 --> 02:51:10.180
They want to see it,
but it,
I mean I,
I dig it because it is fun.

2774
02:51:10.750 --> 02:51:12.960
Really good book.
Mike and the dragons,
a little lesson,

2775
02:51:13.330 --> 02:51:16.030
<v 0>four kids in that book.</v>

2776
02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:20.170
It's probably meant for a little bit younger ages than the other kids books.

2777
02:51:20.171 --> 02:51:24.850
I've written way the warrior kid and weigh the warrior kid to Mark's mission and

2778
02:51:24.851 --> 02:51:27.490
now we have way of the warrior kid three.

2779
02:51:27.700 --> 02:51:31.120
I'm trying to get that up for pre order on Amazon.

2780
02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:36.720
The subtitle is where there's a will and some challenges presented to mark in

2781
02:51:37.751 --> 02:51:38.620
this latest book.

2782
02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:44.160
Thankfully uncle Jake is around to guide him and show him the path.

2783
02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:49.420
Also we got discipline equals freedom of field manual.

2784
02:51:50.590 --> 02:51:55.030
It explains all the people that ask what you work out,

2785
02:51:55.060 --> 02:51:57.130
what did you eat,
what time did you sleep?

2786
02:51:57.131 --> 02:52:01.180
All those questions are all in there and then all the questions that are,

2787
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:06.790
how do you,
how do you get out of bed?
How do you,
when you want to procrastinate,

2788
02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.370
what do you do when you're tired?
What do you do when you're angry?

2789
02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:11.860
What do you do when you're afraid all those questions and put all those

2790
02:52:11.861 --> 02:52:12.790
questions in one big book,

2791
02:52:12.791 --> 02:52:17.791
it's called the discipline equals freedom field manual and it's a book that you

2792
02:52:20.411 --> 02:52:25.411
can give to someone and they will be happy and they will not.

2793
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:29.470
They will.
They will get more from the book

2794
02:52:31.450 --> 02:52:34.580
then just a good read you.

2795
02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:39.250
They'll get a little shift in their perspective in life and they might even

2796
02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:44.280
hopefully get themselves hadn't down what we like to call the path,

2797
02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:49.630
the path of discipline.
I think you were right about that.

2798
02:52:49.631 --> 02:52:54.100
When you say that it's like the book that you sort of wish you had.

2799
02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:54.993
Oh for sure.

2800
02:52:55.870 --> 02:53:00.150
I would say maybe not when I was like a teenager because I don't think I would

2801
02:53:00.151 --> 02:53:02.230
have had the capacity.
Yeah.

2802
02:53:02.470 --> 02:53:06.220
Except you know this but like young adulthood,

2803
02:53:06.310 --> 02:53:09.400
maybe like 2123 ish.
Yup.

2804
02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:11.320
That'd be like man.

2805
02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:16.590
And what's crazy is I've got people that are 54 the,

2806
02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:20.800
one of the coolest things was I,
I met a woman at the muster,

2807
02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:25.720
she was like 55 years old and she was all excited.
She saw me and she's like,

2808
02:53:25.721 --> 02:53:27.070
hey.
And I was like,
Hey,

2809
02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:31.090
and we were working out and we got done with a workout in the gym or something?

2810
02:53:31.091 --> 02:53:35.440
No,
no,
no.
In the yes.
And she says to me,
she says,

2811
02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:37.810
you know why I'm here.
And I was said,
actually,

2812
02:53:37.811 --> 02:53:40.180
I have no idea why you're here or how you got here.

2813
02:53:40.450 --> 02:53:45.450
And she was in Costco or Walmart or target and saw the discipline equals

2814
02:53:45.971 --> 02:53:49.670
freedom,
freedom field manual.
And she just looked at it and said,
I'm buying this.

2815
02:53:49.671 --> 02:53:51.790
I don't even know what it is.
A mind.
And got home,

2816
02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:56.550
opened up reddit next day,
gets up at four 30 in the morning,

2817
02:53:56.580 --> 02:54:00.250
starts working at like,
that's what we're talking about from zero.

2818
02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:04.000
This is a person that doesn't know anything about me,

2819
02:54:04.090 --> 02:54:06.340
about the podcast,
about any of the other books.

2820
02:54:06.341 --> 02:54:10.600
Just that one book picks up and says this,
I'm just gonna get this.

2821
02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:14.830
And she was fired up.
She,
she lost weight.

2822
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:16.900
She's just crushing things.

2823
02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:20.680
So that's a good book to get for yourself.

2824
02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:24.430
It's a book that I read.
It keeps me on the path.

2825
02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:30.550
And if you want,
the audio version is on iTunes,
Amazon music,
Google play,

2826
02:54:31.210 --> 02:54:34.030
other MP3 platforms.
There's obviously extreme ownership.

2827
02:54:34.031 --> 02:54:36.340
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin,

2828
02:54:38.650 --> 02:54:39.483
it's about leadership.

2829
02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:43.990
It's about the leadership principles we learned in combat and how you can apply

2830
02:54:43.991 --> 02:54:44.290
them.

2831
02:54:44.290 --> 02:54:47.740
And then I talked about dichotomy of leadership today because sometimes we can

2832
02:54:47.741 --> 02:54:51.700
take any principal and we can go too far in one direction or another that can

2833
02:54:51.701 --> 02:54:55.870
cause major derailment of your organization,
your team,

2834
02:54:55.900 --> 02:54:56.733
your life.

2835
02:54:56.830 --> 02:55:01.570
So read the dichotomy of leadership so you can know and understand and recognize

2836
02:55:01.571 --> 02:55:06.080
the pitfalls of going too far in one direction or the other.

2837
02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:09.860
On top of those two books,
we've got a little company called Ashkelon Front.

2838
02:55:09.861 --> 02:55:14.861
It's a leadership consultancy in what we do is we solve your problems through

2839
02:55:14.931 --> 02:55:16.790
leadership.
That's what we do.

2840
02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:20.170
Whatever problems you're having in your organization,

2841
02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:22.640
those problems are leadership problems.
Nope,

2842
02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:24.670
no matter what those problems are there.
Leadership problem,

2843
02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:27.700
that's what they are and if you want to get those problems fixed,

2844
02:55:28.470 --> 02:55:33.470
go to Ashkelon front.com and we'll be in touch.

2845
02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:35.620
Also the muster,

2846
02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:40.300
which is a leadership conference 2019 we got May 23rd and 24th in Chicago.

2847
02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:42.250
We got September 19th and 20th in Denver.

2848
02:55:42.251 --> 02:55:45.130
We got December 4th and fifth in Sydney.

2849
02:55:45.850 --> 02:55:50.740
All of our shows we've ever done have sold out.
These are going to sell out too.

2850
02:55:50.770 --> 02:55:52.030
If you want to come to them,

2851
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:57.490
go to extreme ownership.com and work it out.

2852
02:55:58.150 --> 02:56:02.140
F Online,
just launched online in January.

2853
02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:04.510
If you can't come to the muster,

2854
02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.840
if you are living in a situation where you can't come to the muster,

2855
02:56:09.851 --> 02:56:11.410
you can't afford the muster,

2856
02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:16.000
but you really want to get the information from the muster.
Awesome.

2857
02:56:17.650 --> 02:56:20.680
You liked extreme ownership and you want to get more out of it.
Awesome.

2858
02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:25.030
You like listening to the podcast and you want to dig a little deeper.
Awesome.

2859
02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:30.180
All those situations is why we made something called e f online at a company 18

2860
02:56:31.931 --> 02:56:35.710
months ago.
Guy Said,
hey,
I want you to train everyone in my organization.
I said,

2861
02:56:35.711 --> 02:56:38.440
yeah,
do it.
No problem.
And then I was like,
wait a second.

2862
02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:44.130
How many people do you have?
87,000 globally.
Guess what I,

2863
02:56:44.230 --> 02:56:46.510
I was like,
okay,
let me,
let me,

2864
02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.830
let me get back to you cause I humanly physically could not do that.

2865
02:56:51.490 --> 02:56:55.000
So I had to think about how we're gonna scale this thing.

2866
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:57.520
We talked to les from like let's Go,

2867
02:56:57.521 --> 02:57:02.521
let's go digital and is a little scary because in the navy we did like the

2868
02:57:03.281 --> 02:57:05.260
digital training,

2869
02:57:05.261 --> 02:57:10.261
sometimes online HR type training and it was a lame and so I was nervous about

2870
02:57:10.331 --> 02:57:14.620
it.
But once,
once we saw the new technology which exists,
which is awesome,

2871
02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:17.950
that's what we did.
So we spent the last year putting it together.

2872
02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:20.540
It's interactive,
you do role plays,

2873
02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:22.750
you put yourself in combat situations as a leader,

2874
02:57:22.751 --> 02:57:24.490
you put yourself in business situations as a leader.

2875
02:57:24.491 --> 02:57:26.050
You got frequently asked questions,

2876
02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:31.500
you got all kinds of choose your own adventure scenarios that are your fault and

2877
02:57:32.081 --> 02:57:37.081
you get the briefings and explanations and details around the principles of

2878
02:57:37.601 --> 02:57:41.320
combat leadership.
It's all in there.
So if you want to check that out,

2879
02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:47.100
it's at e f online.com online.com and also we have f Overwatch where we are

2880
02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:52.510

2881
02:57:54.470 --> 02:57:59.470
combat proven leaders from special operations and combat aviation and we're

2882
02:57:59.511 --> 02:58:04.511
putting them into companies that need leaders that understand the principles

2883
02:58:05.461 --> 02:58:09.690
that we talk about in the books and on this podcast.

We are

2891
02:58:36.850 --> 02:58:37.190
<v 1>okay</v>

2892
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:41.810
<v 0>on the interwebs.
We are on Twitter,
we own Instagram and we are on that.</v>

2893
02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:46.140
It Echo is adequate.

2894
02:58:46.141 --> 02:58:50.400
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and of course thanks to everyone who is out

2895
02:58:50.401 --> 02:58:52.800
there in uniform holding the line.

2896
02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:54.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2897
02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:59.580
<v 0>Our military personnel,
police and law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,
EMT,</v>

2898
02:58:59.790 --> 02:59:04.770
correctional officers,
border patrols,
all you first responders.

2899
02:59:06.430 --> 02:59:11.430
Thanks for everything that you do to keep our safety and security in tact.

2900
02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:17.850
And to everyone else that's out there listening.

2901
02:59:20.370 --> 02:59:23.800
Remember what this book said and that's,

2902
02:59:23.850 --> 02:59:28.850
remember that real defeats other than death itself are psychological in nature.

2903
02:59:32.890 --> 02:59:37.890
And that the important contests in life itself are psychological in nature.

2904
02:59:38.410 --> 02:59:41.680
So know who your dealing with.
Know who you can count on,

2905
02:59:41.681 --> 02:59:44.740
know your enemy and what his strengths and weaknesses are.

2906
02:59:45.100 --> 02:59:47.800
And most important know yourself.

2907
02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:51.450
No your own nature.

2908
02:59:51.690 --> 02:59:56.690
So you can avoid the pitfalls that we are all susceptible to know yourself so

2909
02:59:59.731 --> 03:00:04.731
you can stand up in any situation and keep getting after it.

2910
03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:06.073
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2911
03:00:06.580 --> 03:00:10.970
<v 0>no matter what.
So until next time,</v>

2912
03:00:11.630 --> 03:00:14.900
this is echo and Jocko out.
