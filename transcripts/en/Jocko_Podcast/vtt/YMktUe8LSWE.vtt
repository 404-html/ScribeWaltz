00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.670
This is Jocko podcast number one 39 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.340
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.470
I lived awhile on Corregidor aisle that Sun Baked God cursed land where bomb and

4
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.790
Shell made life a hell with def on every hand.

5
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.840
I got the thirst there of the cursed with no water to be had.

6
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.770
I heard men scream in hellish dreams and watched my friends go mad.

7
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.740
Tis No man's fault,

8
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.450
the water salt or that the food is gone.

9
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.590
The guns are manned by men full damned facing each new dawn.

10
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.530
And when our bones blend with the stones,

11
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.720
you'll hear the parents cry.

12
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490
The men who owned these splinter bones,

13
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.360
we're not afraid to die

14
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
and that is a poem written on the back of a scrap of paper postmarked prisoner

15
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.560
of war mail.
March,

16
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600
1943 the note was addressed to James D culp,

17
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.610
US Navy gunner's mate FirstClass via his wife from the Red Cross while he was in

18
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.470
a prisoner of war camp in Osaka,
Japan.

19
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080
And the author is unknown so it wasn't written by James d called,

20
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.630
it was sent to James d culp.

21
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
The author is unknown but is assumed to be one of copes fellow prisoners that

22
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.260
was captured on the Philippine island of Corregidor

23
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.073
and

24
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.670
the fall of the Philippines in World War II resulted in an absolutely horrific

25
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.650
event that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Filipino service

26
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.704
members.

27
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And there's not any great records of how many actually died

28
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.900
in this terrible situation,

29
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
but throughout the prisoner of war camps of the Japanese in World War II,

30
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.850
the death rate was about 40% it was a nightmare.

31
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.350
And this is,

32
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.560
this is about the Bataan death march.

33
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.610
And we've heard a little bit about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war in

34
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.690
World War II.

35
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.190
We read the forgotten Highlander by Alastar you cart,

36
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.670
and that was podcast number 12

37
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.350
and he didn't talk about the Bataan death march,

38
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.290
but today we're going to hear from someone that did

39
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.400
<v 2>okay.</v>

40
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.990
<v 0>The Bataan Death March,
a guy by the name of James Bolek,</v>

41
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.920
a young member of the Army Air Corps

42
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.343
who

43
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.760
suffered through that terrible situation and wrote a book about it.

44
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.200
The book is called US soldiers journal by James Bullock.

45
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.380
And let's get right into it.
Go into the book.

46
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.020
I joined the service August 23rd,

47
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.350
1940 at Barksdale field,
Shreveport,
Louisiana,

48
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.370
and was assigned to the 16th bomb squadron at 27th bomb group.

49
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.050
I joined because Paris had just fallen to the Germans and I felt we would soon

50
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.980
be at war.

51
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.240
I was in college at the time and just finished my third semester.

52
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.470
All the talk around school was about war and it was hard to keep my mind on

53
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:18.190
books.

54
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.080
I was attending southwestern Louisiana Institute in Lafayette through a

55
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.460
government program called the end.
Why?
Yay.
The National Youth Administration,

56
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.820
we received $30 a month and had to work a full eight hours every other day.

57
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.983
Because of this,

58
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.050
it was hard to schedule classes and hard to study properly from our $30 pay.

59
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.870
We had to put about $18 each month for Roman board,

60
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.000
which left $12 for other essential such as books,
paper,
pencils,

61
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.770
et cetera.
Because going to college was so difficult under these circumstances.

62
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.550
It seemed that the army could not be any worse,

63
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.770
so going to join the army.

64
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.540
I went home and told my parents what I plan to do.

65
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:08.650
My mother was horrified and strictly against it.
At the time.

66
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.110
I needed my parent's consent to join because of my age.

67
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.670
I was 19 my father agreed to sign and convinced my mother to sign.
Also,

68
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.850
I remember her saying that if anything happened to me,

69
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.090
she did not want to be blamed for letting me go in the army.

70
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.420
I was sworn in with the rest of the recruits.

71
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.620
I had a choice of joining a weather squadron or a bombardment squadron.

72
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.380
Of course,
I chose the bombardment squadron.

73
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.310
I did not join the army to study the weather.
I joined a fight.

74
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.930
That is what I thought.

75
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.690
I was therefore assigned to the 16th bomb squad and the 27th bomb group,

76
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.170
army clothes and equipment.
At this time,

77
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:50.950
we're in short supply and were not provided and we were not provided with

78
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.250
clothes,
et Cetera for quite some time.
Obviously,

79
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:59.150
my statement that I always make is I'm skipping big chunks of this book and

80
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.930
reading some of the highlights so you get the flow of the story before we get

81
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.070
into the meat of the book.
It's a,
it's a great book.

82
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.550
It's a relatively short read,
but it's a great book.

83
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.790
Back to the book,
the clothing we had was essentially still world war one.

84
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.960
We had leggings,
campaign hats,
et Cetera at this time,

85
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.310
and then he ends up going to a school to learn his skills about bombing.

86
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.361
Back to the book.

87
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.360
The school lasted about nine months and I came out knowing everything.

88
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.720
There was no about an airplane.
When school was over from my class.

89
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.890
I was offered a position as instructor of drafting,
but I turned it down.

90
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.440
I want to get back with my outfit and his outfit was down in Savannah.

91
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.510
When I got back to Savannah,
I found out my,

92
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.750
I found my outfit packing up to go on maneuvers in Louisiana.

93
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.460
Within a few days we were,
we were on our way by army truck.

94
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.940
At night.
We would stop,
set up our mess tent,
eat and hit the sack.

95
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.010
We slept on the ground under a pup tent.

96
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.160
It took us through two or three days to reach our final stop,

97
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.720
which was at the airfield at Lake Charles here.
We lived in tents again,

98
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:09.830
just as our first days in Savannah.
As far as I was concerned at the time,

99
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.450
maneuvers were a joke.
Instead of having actual machine guns,
antiaircraft,
guns,

100
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.770
foxholes,
et Cetera,
there were wooden signs all around to indicate these.

101
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.810
If the air raid siren went off,

102
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:23.360
we were supposed to run out to one of these signs.

103
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.870
The way that one of the maneuvers did apparently help us with down the line was

104
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.640
to adapt too hard,
rough outdoor living.

105
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.980
We were also on reduced rations,
which helped prepare us for what was to come.

106
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.413
Later on,

107
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.400
we would fly over the enemy and drop small sacks of flour on them.

108
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.630
Referees could tell if we hit or missed and the sides were scored accordingly.

109
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.090
I don't remember how long these maneuvers lasted,

110
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.270
but it seems like it was at least a month,
so they're out there.

111
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.500
I thought this was interesting because we do dumb stuff like that sometimes in

112
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.330
the military where,
well you think it's dumb,

113
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.920
but what you're really trying to do is get the broad muscle movements of a

114
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.350
military organization working.
So you say,

115
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:11.351
okay cause it's not easy to get 500 men assembled and move to a location that it

116
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:16.460
takes practice and so that they just run people through planning and training

117
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.250
exercises that you're just trying to get these broad muscle movements.

118
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:22.070
Even though for the troops on the ground sometimes I remember sometimes I'd be

119
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:26.380
thinking this is ridiculous,
this is so unrealistic.
But we weren't training the,

120
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.380
the front line troops,

121
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.410
what they were training was the logistics of this giant scenario.

122
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:34.580
So that's kind of what they're doing here.
Back to the book,

123
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.910
we finally got word to pack up and headed back home to Savannah.

124
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.570
We'd already gotten word that as soon as we reached Savannah we would need to

125
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:46.220
pack again this time to go overseas.
But no one knew where as yet.

126
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.630
So again,
Germany,
France had fallen to Germany or Paris would fall into Germany,

127
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:52.130
but we weren't in the war yet,

128
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.980
so this is pre World War II for America this time,

129
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.780
so he's just thinking he's going on a regular kind of deployment at this point.

130
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.340
Back to the book,
when he reached Savannah,

131
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.300
we found that most of our gear that we had left behind was already created and

132
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.060
ready to go.
As I recall,
in about a week or so,

133
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.220
we boarded the train for San Francisco.

134
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.320
All of our crates were stenciled with the letter letters,
p l u m plum,

135
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.030
but no one knew what it meant.

136
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.940
I should mention here that before we left Savannah,

137
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.300
I was called the first sergeant's office and told that I did not have to go

138
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.820
overseas if I did not want to.
Of course,

139
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.960
I immediately rejected the idea and it's that I definitely wanted to go to this

140
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.350
day.
I don't know why this came up because in talking to others in my outfit,

141
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.820
no one had had that opportunity

142
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.530
since I had applied for flight school.
It may be that I could have gone there,

143
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:43.090
so he had,
I didn't mention this part,

144
00:09:43.091 --> 00:09:47.050
but he wanted to be a pilot so they could have been a possibility that they

145
00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:48.250
wanted to send him a flight school.

146
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.910
But of course like many young 19 year old men,

147
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.980
what you want to do is you want to stick with your unit.

148
00:09:53.981 --> 00:09:57.040
You want to go and fight and do.
At this point he's,
no,
he's fighting,

149
00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:00.550
but he wants to go deploy with his guys.
Back to the book,

150
00:10:00.551 --> 00:10:03.640
I still don't know what plums stood for,
but looking back now,

151
00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:06.040
apparently the p stood for Philippines.

152
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.540
The l stood for the island of Luzon,
but the UNM,

153
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.260
I do not know that.
That's awesome.

154
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.290
Now they get to San Francisco eventually and here we go.

155
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.180
They're boarding the ship.
Back to the book,

156
00:10:22.181 --> 00:10:26.020
the SS Coolidge was a lovely shipped that normally carried civilian passengers

157
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:29.410
to the Orient,
but now it was being used to transport troops.

158
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.070
We did not have state rooms but slept in corridors comparable to regular army

159
00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:37.660
transports.
About the third day we found out where we were going up.
To this time.

160
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:38.171
No one knew.

161
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:41.650
Our squadron commander called us together and told us we were headed for the

162
00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:42.700
Philippine islands.

163
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.710
He told us that we were the first part of an expeditionary force being sent out

164
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:52.260
to beef up the defenses of the Philippines.
After this talk.

165
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.270
I don't remember anyone getting very excited about it.

166
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.540
We all went back to killing time and doing things that we were doing before.

167
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.180
Some people read some gambled and some exercised.

168
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.720
There was light boxing going on,
so I decided I would participate.

169
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.900
I boxed is a lightweight at 165 pounds and I mentioned the 165 pounds because

170
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.420
that weight is gonna go away.

171
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.660
Honolulu is a place where I finally learned the port and starboard sides of a

172
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.390
ship on large shifts.
I still get lost and confused.

173
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:23.680
I had to go out on deck to see which way the boat was traveling.

174
00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:26.730
Cloak Cape myself.
This is funny.
Where do you get first get on a ship?

175
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.560
You have no idea where you are and there's a,
Oh,

176
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.730
there's a system in a ship that you can use to figure out,
and they mark.
Well,

177
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:34.530
navy ships,
they market very clearly,

178
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.400
but it takes a little time to get used to and apparently he didn't get taught.

179
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.140
We finally left the dock and as we pulled out of pull harbor,

180
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.230
so all the ships with our planes coming in,

181
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.930
we never saw our plane again.

182
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.130
And little did we realize what would happen to Pearl Harbor and just few short

183
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.890
weeks.
So this is pre Pearl Harbor

184
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.960
so they can say set sail.
They're out at sea.
Back to the book.

185
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:05.560
One morning when I got up and went out on deck,
I noticed islands all around us.

186
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.210
We were finally in the Philippines just as soon as we got off the ship,

187
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.600
we loaded it into army trucks and were taken to Fort Mckinley.

188
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.600
I should point out here that during the peace time,
I like this part.

189
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.030
I should point out here that during peace time in the Philippines,

190
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.170
prior to our arrival,

191
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.320
the military was on duty only in the morning from eight o'clock to 11 o'clock it

192
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:30.040
was thought that a white person could not survive and tropical sun after 11

193
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:34.690
o'clock what a deal they had,
and to top it off,
time spent in the tropics,

194
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:38.530
Hawaii included,
counted as time and a half toward retirement.

195
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.510
Another reason we were so Honda's when we first arrived in the tropics was the

196
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:46.810
fact that we still had our winter uniforms,
so I thought that was,

197
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.350
that was pretty funny to think about that.
That's not that.
Well,

198
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:52.930
this is the 1940s they're thinking,
look,
you're not going to make it.

199
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.280
They listened up white boy,

200
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.950
you're not going to make it past 11 you need to go back in the shade.

201
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.220
Back to the book.
As long as I was at Fort Mckinley about two weeks,

202
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:05.860
the only thing I ever did was dig trenches around the fort.

203
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.670
These are not Fox foxholes,
but long zigzag trenches.

204
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.590
We were undoubtedly preparing for war.
Then they'd go out there,

205
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.820
they go out,
they catch a movie and back to the book.
After the movie,

206
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:22.960
we took a tram or trolley back to the gate at Fort Mckinley before going to our

207
00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:23.201
tent,

208
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:26.170
we decided to stop with the mess tent for something to drink before retiring,

209
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.910
and that is when we heard that Pearl Harbor was being bombed by the Japanese.

210
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.960
This message came from a radio that was playing in a mess tent and I suspect we

211
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:37.240
were one of the first to hear the news.

212
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.290
I was not terribly surprised or concerned because we'd been preparing for war

213
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.120
and now it was here.

214
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.870
I was not frightened by the news and remember going to bed and immediately

215
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:48.970
falling asleep because the hour was very late.

216
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.800
I know I would have been frightened if I had known what terrible destruction the

217
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.010
Japanese had inflicted on our forces at Pearl Harbor.

218
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.510
We never knew about our terrible losses until the war was over.

219
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.470
I am sure our top brass knew,
but we were never told,

220
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.720
which I am sure was best.

221
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.400
I may not have been scared the night when I heard that the war started,

222
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.530
but I would be lying if I said I was not scared.

223
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:18.580
When the second night rolled around the day started with an early frantic call

224
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:22.420
before breakfast for all to us immediately assembled in front of the first

225
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.810
sergeant's tent.
I had a pretty good idea of what it was all about,

226
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.460
but most of the outfit had not yet heard anyway.

227
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.490
We were told we were now at war with Japan and would be issued arms and

228
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:37.990
ammunition,
so just like that everything changes.

229
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.350
I was issued a 30 caliber Springfield rifle and a 45 caliber colt automatic

230
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:47.410
pistol since we were air core personnel.

231
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.280
We had never received instructions on firing a rifle and a lot of these men had

232
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:56.210
never had a rifle in their hands before.
A lot.
We're like me.
However,

233
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.620
they were farm boys who were brought up with guns and knew how to use them.

234
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.890
So good in these guys.

235
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.830
It's a peace time and even though they might've been preparing for war,

236
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.260
it's a peace time situation.

237
00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:11.770
And you know how I talk about when you're training in Jujitsu,

238
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.620
you can't train hard enough to be prepared for a car.

239
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:18.560
You can't train the same way a competition fields.
You just,
you just can't.

240
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.470
It's the same way here when there's no war going on.

241
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:24.650
I don't care how much you're trying to simulate it.
If there's no war going on,

242
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.480
you can't simulate it well enough.

243
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.810
And that's kind of the situation that they were in.
Guys hadn't even,

244
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:31.820
some of the guys that never even shot a rifle before,

245
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.940
this doesn't take long to escalate at all.

246
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.400
Back to the book that night,

247
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.690
we all retired to our tents early because a total blackout was in effect.

248
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.540
It really made no difference to us because we had no lights in the tents.

249
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:49.370
Anyways,
all of a sudden,
around midnight or so,

250
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:53.210
there was a loud whistling and everyone outside,
uh,

251
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.670
loud whistling on the outside by our first sergeant.

252
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.440
The whistling followed by shouts of everyone up.
Everyone up,
air raid.

253
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.500
We could hear air raid sirens in the background,

254
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:04.940
so we were sure it was the real thing.

255
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.130
A lot of guys were up and dressed and out in minutes,

256
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.340
but a lot of guys were slow and lagging around.
They figured it was a dry run,

257
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:12.530
so why hurry once out of the tents,

258
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.410
we were told to go to the edge of the jungle nearby and get away from our tents

259
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.040
because they were undoubtably become a great target for the enemy.

260
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.050
Everyone did as he was told,

261
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.490
but before long there was grumbling and people wanted to go back to bed.

262
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.290
Eventually we were given the order to return to our tents.
Needless to say,

263
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.470
we were ready once back in the dark tents,

264
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.860
we got out of our clothes and before long everyone was sound asleep again.

265
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.080
I'm not sure how long we were asleep,

266
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.680
but sometime later that night we were awakened by horrendous sounds,

267
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.080
the likes of which we had never heard before.

268
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.290
Great explosions were going on all around us and the ground was shaking as if an

269
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.890
earthquake was taking place.

270
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.850
Brilliant flashes of light could be seen through the thick canvas of our tents.

271
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.590
By now,
our first sergeant was out again,
yelling for all the head for the jungle.

272
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:01.070
Again.

273
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.880
This time there were no stragglers of lot of the guys just took off in their

274
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:08.660
underwear.
Some pants,
no shirt,
some shirt,
but no pants.

275
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.470
I managed to get closed on and untied shoes before leaving our tent,

276
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.460
but once outside I was stunned for a while by what I heard and saw,

277
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.700
the sky was filled with bursting antiaircraft fire and tracer bullets could be

278
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:24.140
seen headed up in all directions.

279
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.560
The sound of straining aircraft could also be heard,

280
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:30.890
intermingled with the rumbling sound of exploding bombs.

281
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.740
It looked like the world was coming to an end.

282
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.320
So that's two days to go from,
hey,
we're going to a movie and we're,

283
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:44.000
we're hanging out in the Philippines drinking some beers to this.
That's,
that's,

284
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.670
that's completely insane to think about.

285
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.960
War had now come to us with a bang and it was real.

286
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.890
Again,
fast forwarding when we received word to pull out of Lipa,

287
00:17:58.891 --> 00:17:59.730
which is where they were.

288
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:03.870
The reason given was that the Japanese had landed a few miles from us and if we

289
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:07.290
did knock it out of there in a hurry,
we might be overrun.
So think about that.

290
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.570
You know,
here you are,
you're American,
you've got the strongest military,

291
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840
you come from this giant country and all of a sudden the Japanese who you

292
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.450
weren't even at war with five days ago,
four days ago,

293
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.900
now they're landing on beach and you're under the threat of being overrun.

294
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.210
I look back now and think that the real story was that the Japs landed in force

295
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:37.070
and they are commanders wanted all of us evacuated to the Bataan peninsula as

296
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:40.790
quickly as possible.
So they move,
they march,

297
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.170
they end up in Bhutan,

298
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.590
they no longer have tents and they're living basically outside in little

299
00:18:48.081 --> 00:18:52.850
shelters that they're building and they are starting to get bombed all the time.

300
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.970
Here we go back to the book,
bombs frightened the devil out of me.

301
00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.170
I figured there was no way I could survive.
So many close calls day after day.

302
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.160
There was many.

303
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.720
There was many a day when bombs fell within 20 or 30 feet of me and eventually

304
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:10.460
some much closer.
If it had not been forced,
strategically located foxholes.

305
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.130
I know I would not be here today.

306
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:18.190
So these guys are getting just crushed because I didn't mention this part,

307
00:19:18.411 --> 00:19:21.780
but uh,
you remember when he said when he,
when they left polar harbor,

308
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.220
they saw the ships with their planes on them.
The planes never showed up.

309
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.510
They got bombed in Pearl Harbor.

310
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.160
So they had like just a few planes that had already been there in the

311
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.860
Philippines.
They didn't have an actual war load out of planes.

312
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.180
So the Japanese had total air superiority and that's why they were able to just

313
00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:41.630
bomb them with,
with complete unrestricted violence

314
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.980
back to the book during a bombing raid,

315
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.160
I would normally peep over the edge of my foxhole to see where the planes were.

316
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.493
At first,

317
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.340
all you knew was that they were headed in your direction and you had better stay

318
00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:59.240
put.
As they got closer and closer,

319
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.160
you could tell better if they were going to pass to the side of you or if they

320
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.230
were coming directly over.
You.
Remember that?

321
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.570
You remember the book we read where I would,

322
00:20:08.571 --> 00:20:12.380
it builds up with the heavies coming.
They the big slow war.

323
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:16.610
It's Ernie Pyle and he's talking about how the big slow w roar is coming and he

324
00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:21.611
looks up and he sees it's the heavies and how the guys were just so happy that

325
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:23.360
the bombers were coming.

326
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.220
The big allied American bombers were coming to give them support.

327
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.740
Well,
this is the opposite.

328
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.240
This is what it's like to be on the ground and the heavies are coming.

329
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:38.210
The Japanese bombers are coming here.
We go back to the book.

330
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.430
If they were directly overhead,

331
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:44.750
you began to sweat because that mean meant you were about to take a pounding.

332
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.240
As you watched the planes,

333
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.440
you could all of a sudden see many small flashes of silver appear just below the

334
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:53.494
planes.

335
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.450
This meant that their bombs had been dropped and they were on their way down.

336
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.210
The silver flashes were only visible for a few seconds,
then disappeared.

337
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.730
If you were still looking up,

338
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.970
the next thing you saw and now heard were these large black objects coming at

339
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:14.980
you with a terrible hissing sound.

340
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.590
<v 1>Okay?</v>

341
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.970
<v 0>In a fraction of a second,</v>

342
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.330
they were exploding with a terrific bang as they hit the ground.

343
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.160
They did not go off simultaneously,

344
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:25.380
but one at a time until they had all exploded.

345
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.750
If the bombs were just in front of you,

346
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.190
you could hear them getting closer and closer and that was the scary part.

347
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.690
It wasn't until you could hear the explosives go past you that you knew you were

348
00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:41.090
safe and could now relax.
That's when you thanked God for foxholes.

349
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.080
So we've talked about similar before with people being in the trenches in world

350
00:21:46.081 --> 00:21:46.914
war one,

351
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.570
I think it was Bobby Hoffman or Bob Hoffman that was talking about in his book.

352
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.280
I remember the last war where when they would get mortared or hit with

353
00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:59.850
artillery,
that's how artillery works.
You fire around,

354
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:01.560
then you move a little to the left,
then you fire round.

355
00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:02.560
Then you move a little to the left.

356
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.510
Then you fire round and then you move a little to the left and so you knew you

357
00:22:06.511 --> 00:22:10.020
could feel it's getting closer and closer and closer and closer and until it

358
00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:14.070
goes by you,
you're waiting to get blown up.
You're waiting to die.

359
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.010
And that's exactly what he's talking about here.
Back to the book,

360
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:23.700
besides bombs and enemy strafing,
there was another danger coming from the air.

361
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.440
It was the hot whistling metal fragments raining down on us from our own

362
00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:30.750
antiaircraft guns at Corregidor.

363
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.900
So Craig doors not co located with them and Coreg is firing antiaircraft and

364
00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:41.280
some of the fragments from all that fire is raining down on these guys.

365
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.680
It wasn't long before our food supply was practically gone and we had to

366
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:49.660
scrounge around to find something to eat.

367
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.590
We eventually eight all of our horses that belonged to the cavalry and the

368
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:55.840
murals that were used to pull their cannons,

369
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.840
so they ran out of food very quickly.

370
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.590
Although we were air corps,

371
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.860
we were ultimately designated as infantry and carried on and fought as such.

372
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.150
When the front lines we're active,

373
00:23:14.151 --> 00:23:17.090
we could always hear the roar of Canon's being fired in the noise of the

374
00:23:17.091 --> 00:23:18.380
resulting explosions.

375
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.750
Many a night I fell asleep listening to this noise and especially during the

376
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.620
last few weeks and days of our struggle with this noise getting closer and

377
00:23:27.621 --> 00:23:30.440
closer as the front lines fell back.

378
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.040
I never in my wildest dreams felt that we would be defeated.

379
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.550
We were tired,
hungry,
and in many cases sick,
but we were still ready to fight.

380
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.690
So let me just break that down a little bit.

381
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.520
There's infantry soldiers up that are closer to the enemy that are fighting and

382
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:52.580
they can hear that fighting taking place and they're back at by,
you know,

383
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.650
in their air field area trying to,
well,

384
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:58.580
they're holding security,

385
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:02.630
but they're basically around an airfield and the the infantry soldiers in the

386
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:07.631
army or are further away to the front and they can here day after day.

387
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.810
That front line is getting closer and closer and closer to where they are

388
00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:16.811
because the Japanese are pushing them back and back and back and it ends up like

389
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:19.430
this.
This is scary.
Ooh,
back to the book.

390
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:24.431
One day stray soldiers started appearing at our air strip and the surprise me,

391
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:27.710
because I had never seen this before,
and talking to them,

392
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:30.380
they said they had left the front line looking for food.

393
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.180
They were being constantly bombarded by Japanese guns and no food was getting to

394
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:38.960
them.
It was either go out and look for food or starve to death.

395
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.050
So now eventually the guys that are,

396
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:42.920
we're out fighting the Japanese on front line.

397
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:46.220
Now there's stragglers starting to come back to the airfield because they're

398
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:47.054
starving.

399
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.550
<v 2>Wow.</v>

400
00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.480
<v 0>One day we got word to gas up the last [inaudible] that we had,</v>

401
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.450
three as I recall,
and get them ready for takeoff.

402
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.260
We pulled them out of their hiding place in the jungle and down to the field

403
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.760
where the pilots,
we're waiting.

404
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.550
Normally the pilots wanted to jump in and take off immediately before the Japs

405
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:14.020
saw them,
but this time it was different.

406
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.060
They said they were leaving baton and going to a field on one of the islands to

407
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:19.810
the south,

408
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.810
which was still in friendly hands before the pilot got in his plane.

409
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.330
He asked me and a friend of mine if we wanted to send a message home,

410
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.250
we said yes because it was the first opportunity that we had had do so since

411
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:34.330
leaving the states.

412
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:39.450
He had a pencil and I wrote a short note letting everyone know at home that I

413
00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:40.714
was,
well

414
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.400
<v 2>yeah,</v>

415
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.700
<v 0>when the last of our planes left,
that was the beginning of the end.</v>

416
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.390
It may have been the same day or the day after.

417
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.510
We were hurriedly taken back into camp and told to pack up.

418
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.270
We were told only to bring the bare essentials,

419
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.140
the clothes and shoes that we had on toothbrushes,
et cetera.

420
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.520
Nothing else.

421
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.140
So you know you're in a bad way when the plans are taken off in the guys saying,

422
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:07.840
Hey,
you want me to pass a message home cause we're not coming back.

423
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.420
And then to get told to,
hey take just the clothes on your back.

424
00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:21.280
Basically we're leaving.

425
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.420
By the time we fault plot finally pulled out,
it was getting dark.

426
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.190
The people that we got back from the field said that they could hear jap tanks

427
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:35.191
coming up the road and where and they were near for the last several days toward

428
00:26:35.671 --> 00:26:39.490
ward gotten much closer to us.
Gunfire was almost constant at night.

429
00:26:39.491 --> 00:26:43.260
You could see the flash of our canons and here the exploding shells of the
enemy.

430
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.610
It wasn't long before we could hear the drone of Jap bombers coming from a

431
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:54.030
distance.
We looked up and sure enough they were headed our way.

432
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.970
All of a sudden we could hear this swishing of falling bombs.

433
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.960
They started exploding as they hit the ground and each explosion kept getting

434
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:03.480
closer and closer working in our direction.

435
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.730
I knew that we were in big trouble when I heard explosions getting louder and

436
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:09.360
louder.

437
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.340
Then almost immediately we were practically obliterated by an exploding bomb

438
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.350
that missed us by a few feet.

439
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:18.830
<v 0>When the bomb went off,</v>

441
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.850
it's sent dirt and large rocks flying in the air in all directions and we were

442
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:25.580
almost covered by falling debris.

443
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.250
This bomb was actually closer to me than the other bomb that killed the engineer

444
00:27:31.251 --> 00:27:33.920
on our airstrip and peppered my arm with shrapnel.

445
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.590
You could reach out from our foxhole and practically touch the edge of the large

446
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:43.490
crater that it made,
but none of us were seriously hurt.

447
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.580
<v 2>Okay,</v>

448
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.780
<v 0>that's,
that's crazy.</v>

449
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.830
So you've got giant bombs blowing up and you can catch the crater that it leaves

450
00:27:53.081 --> 00:27:56.260
and you're surviving.
That's why you dig foxholes,
by the way.

451
00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:00.760
That's why you dig foxholes cause they provide incredible amount of protection.

452
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.760
That is when we decided we'd better go back and find our outfit.

453
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.200
When we did find our outfit,
we were flabbergasted by the news.

454
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.930
We were surrendering.
I could not believe it.

455
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:19.090
<v 2>Okay?</v>

456
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.780
<v 0>All these men still with arms and now under the protection of Corregidor,</v>

457
00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:27.140
his big guns we were giving up.
But it was true.

458
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.330
We were told to destroy all of our weapons and ammunition immediately in any way

459
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:33.164
that we could.

460
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.790
Most people were disassembling their rifles and pistols and throwing them into

461
00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:41.900
the bay.
So I did the same.
It was the quickest way to get rid of them.

462
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.980
I did not mind getting rid of my rifle,
but I hated to throw away my pistol.

463
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.310
<v 0>We were told by our leaders to stay put until the Japs came in.</v>

465
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.680
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

466
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.610
<v 0>and when they did,</v>

467
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.300
we would be taken to prisoner of war camps where we would sit out the rest of

468
00:28:57.301 --> 00:29:01.240
the war.
I did not like this idea at all,

469
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.800
but you could tell a lot of the guys who felt relieved they were dirty,

470
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.770
tired,
hungry,
and it had enough of war.

471
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.150
They felt now that they had survived and would soon be fed,

472
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.110
sheltered and given sub long read,
long needed rest.

473
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.670
Little did we know that we were headed for hell.

474
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

475
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.350
<v 0>And he goes into some the do you got to get this book and read the whole book</v>

476
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.100
because he goes into all the details of how this collapsed kind of finalized

477
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.460
back to the book.
By the time we got back to the group,

478
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:45.190
Japanese troops had arrived from the other direction.

479
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.520
They were already lining people up to count us.

480
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.370
Pretty soon a Jap soldier came up to me muttering something and at the same time

481
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:55.840
flapping his hand up and down.

482
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.990
I looked at him with a puzzled look because I didn't have the slightest idea

483
00:29:58.991 --> 00:29:59.890
what he wanted.

484
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.380
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.380
<v 0>The jap camp is puzzling jet gestures and I could tell that he was getting more</v>

486
00:30:06.811 --> 00:30:10.260
furious.
By the minute
I turned around,

487
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.300
looked at some of the guys and shrugged my shoulders indicating that I did not

488
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:14.560
know what the jap wanted.

489
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:15.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

490
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.760
<v 0>Someone said he wants you to sit down,
so I sit.</v>

491
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.520
So I sat down immediately and received a cross,

492
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.280
a crack across my head with a rifle butt.

493
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

494
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.220
<v 0>I knew then that that was not what he wanted,
so I immediately got back up.</v>

495
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

496
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:35.020
<v 0>That's when he gave me a shove and the guy next to me,
a shove and so on.</v>

497
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.270
He wanted us to start walking.

498
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:44.090
That was the beginning of our march out of Bhutan and I believe that I was the

499
00:30:44.091 --> 00:30:46.100
first one to start it.

500
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.183
<v 2>Okay.</v>

501
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.410
<v 0>This is where my story is going to be difficult to tell for two reasons.</v>

502
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:57.310
The first being that we were told on our return to the u s that we were not to

503
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:01.990
speak to anyone about our experience as prisoners of war,
not the press,

504
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:03.670
our family or friends.

505
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:09.010
The reason for this was that somewhere down the line we might be in a war again

506
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160
and undoubtedly more prisoners would be taken if we revealed how we survived

507
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:17.320
this information would get into the hands of our enemy,

508
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.160
which would then make it doubly tough on our prisoners.

509
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.560
This made good sense and I did abide by it over the years.
However,

510
00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:30.820
our story has been told so many times now I feel free to tell mine.

511
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.670
The second reason is

512
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.510
<v 2>okay</v>

513
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:40.510
<v 0>that I was and still am reluctant to tell about my experience as a pow is the</v>

514
00:31:41.781 --> 00:31:46.070
fact that I thought it would be impossible to describe what we went through.

515
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.610
Impossible to tell,
an impossible does to describe in written word.

516
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:59.150
I've since read many good books on the subject and seeing film documentaries

517
00:31:59.461 --> 00:32:02.970
made,
but you had to be there to experience it,

518
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.800
to know what it was like.

519
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

520
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.330
<v 0>I know that my meager attempt will also fail,</v>

521
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.520
but I will write about it anyways,

522
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.670
so now we're,
we're clearly,
now we're starting this horrific situation.

523
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.520
This is the,
this is the Bataan death march.

524
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:26.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

525
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.910
<v 0>As we marched along the road,
we soon,</v>

526
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.530
soon found ourselves without hats and something far more critical water.

527
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.350
The Japanese were quick to take our canteens and empty them on the road and our

528
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:41.390
steel helmets off with the rifle butts.

529
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:42.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

530
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.230
<v 0>We were marching through frontline troops that had just overpowered us.</v>

531
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.920
They were still inflicting punishment on us in any way that they could.

532
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.350
We endured constant beatings,
beatings,
beatings.

533
00:32:55.351 --> 00:32:58.020
Every time we ran into a new group down the road.

534
00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

535
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.360
<v 0>They hit us with rifles,
sabers sticks,</v>

536
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.460
and anything else they could get their hands on.

537
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:05.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.880
<v 0>We were half starved and many so weak.
They could barely walk,</v>

539
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.980
but they showed us no mercy.

540
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.920
The day was torture.

541
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.663
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

542
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.900
<v 0>To begin with.
We did not know where we were going and we kept thinking,</v>

543
00:33:24.901 --> 00:33:27.810
surely it couldn't be much further,
but it was

544
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.940
much,
much further.

545
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.000
The Sun on our bare heads was bad,

546
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.500
but the worst was passing up water after water but not allowed any.

547
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

548
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.100
<v 0>After marching well into the dark that day,</v>

549
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.980
we finally stopped completely beat and exhausted.

550
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.240
We felt we would surely now be given food and water,
but that was not to be,

551
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.590
<v 2>yeah.</v>

552
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.910
<v 0>They put us in a fenced off yard and told us through an interpreter that if any</v>

553
00:33:56.911 --> 00:33:58.230
of us was found with a knife,

554
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.870
razor blade or anything that could be used as a weapon,

555
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.690
he would be immediately shot.
I thought to myself,

556
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:06.980
they did not say compass,

557
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.920
but I knew that I would be in big trouble if they found it.

558
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:13.370
So he had taken a compass and he's keeping that on him in case he ever gets the

559
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:16.670
chance to escape.
This place was extremely dark,

560
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:19.670
but there was enough light to see the Japanese soldiers with machine guns

561
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:20.510
surrounding us.

562
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:21.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

563
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.090
<v 0>We were packed like sardines with barely enough room to stretch out and no</v>

564
00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:29.410
latrine facilities.
If you had to relieve yourself,
you did it where you were.

565
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:36.150
I had now gone 48 hours without food and what liquid I had before starting the

566
00:34:36.461 --> 00:34:39.610
march was long gone by way of sweat.

567
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

568
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.230
<v 0>There was a lot of talking and moaning going on,</v>

569
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.280
but it stopped immediately when we were told we would be shot if they heard any

570
00:34:48.281 --> 00:34:52.570
noises out of us.
Again,
needless to say,

571
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.710
things quieted down and that is the last thing I remember that day.

572
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

573
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:04.170
<v 0>The next day we were started on the road again before dawn without food or
water,</v>

574
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.880
same treatment by the troops heading into Bhutan,
beatings and more beatings.

575
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.060
We,
we're now plotting along like zombies.
All we could think about was water.

576
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

577
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.100
<v 0>And he talks about the fact that they're,
they're passing these little wells,</v>

578
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.330
these little pump and they can see that there's water they could clearly have

579
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.060
and the Japanese are not allowing them to drink this water.

580
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:33.650
And that was torture is additional torture to what they were going through.

581
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.060
Back to the book,
the countryside that we were now crossing was a total wreck.

582
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.070
The forest was literally destroyed.

583
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.160
It looked like a forest fire had gone through it.

584
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.570
And all that was left with the skeleton of what was formerly giant trees.

585
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.040
No remnants remained of what were once villages.

586
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.720
The roadside was littered with burned out trucks and cars and an occasional tank

587
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:02.340
could be seen.
They look like total destruction that it was

588
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.210
<v 2>okay.</v>

589
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.680
<v 0>The worst part,
however,</v>

590
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.820
was the dead bodies scattered all over.

591
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.160
You could tell that they had been there for some time because they were all now

592
00:36:15.161 --> 00:36:16.690
black and bloated.

593
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.340
The stench was horrible and the site was made more terrible by the swarm of

594
00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:25.720
flies around each body

595
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.090
again all day we staggered along that hot dusty road and though we passed

596
00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:41.290
running artisans wells from time to time we were not allowed to drink.

597
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:46.420
We had long ago stopped thinking about food.
Now it was water,
water.

598
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.490
You kept thinking,
where are they taking us?
When will it end?
You are thinking,

599
00:36:51.491 --> 00:36:55.300
surely they know we are exhausted to the point of death and they would soon

600
00:36:55.301 --> 00:36:56.134
relent

601
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.500
but they did not and we had to muster every bit of strength that we could carry

602
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:04.404
on.

603
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.370
Many of the sick and wounded had fallen out before now and the world knows how

604
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:13.710
they were executed as they fell.

605
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.720
I saw some of this,
but not nearly as much as the people bringing up the rear.

606
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.880
I was fortunate in being near the front of the line and have the strength and

607
00:37:25.881 --> 00:37:27.950
fortitude to stay on my feet

608
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.540
all day.

609
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.930
We look forward to the end of the heat and misery thinking that at night fall we

610
00:37:34.931 --> 00:37:37.300
would stop like we did the night before,

611
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.350
but this was not to be darkness came and we kept going

612
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.100
long before now we had dumped any excess baggage that we were carrying.

613
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.820
A lot of people started the march with blankets,
mosquito nets,
et Cetera,

614
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.290
but by the end of the first day,
this had all been discarded.

615
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.840
It was hard enough carrying your own weight,

616
00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:03.510
much less anything additional for the most part.

617
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:08.000
Now we were plotting along with strangers.
We,

618
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.830
when we found out we were surrendering,

619
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.550
the squadron broke up and we were lucky if we ran into a buddy.

620
00:38:13.551 --> 00:38:18.551
Occasionally being together as a unit under such a trying situation would

621
00:38:19.151 --> 00:38:22.510
probably have helped.
But that did not happen.

622
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

623
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.600
<v 0>So this is just a,
is a nightmare getting worse by the moment.</v>

624
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.470
And I didn't do a good job of explaining that going into this.

625
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.960
It wasn't like they were well fed and well nourished going into this situation.

626
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:47.260
They had already been under attack and they'd not had food.

627
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:48.850
They'd run out of food very quickly.

628
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.290
So these guys were already hungry and dehydrated when they started this thing

629
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.540
and now it's just getting

630
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:57.020
<v 2>okay.</v>

631
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.130
<v 0>It's just getting worse.</v>

632
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.510
I do think that the following took place shortly before dark.

633
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:07.120
On the third day I was desperate for water,

634
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.840
even though I had had some the night before by now,

635
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:13.780
many of the men were rushing every well that we came to,

636
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.570
even though they were being shot at as they did.

637
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:20.950
So there were one or two guards close enough to do the show shooting.

638
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.470
So if 10 or 12 men when at once,

639
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.100
the chances were six or eight would get back without being hit.

640
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.560
I decided I would go for it but would wait until late evening.

641
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.310
The opportunity finally arrived.

642
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.840
I made a dash for it with about 10 or 12 others.
Shots were fired,

643
00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:45.390
but I got a gulp of water without being hit

644
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.720
and this continues on and on

645
00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.360
word continue.

646
00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:03.290
Word quickly spread that we were finally going to be fed and given water.

647
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.100
How that rumor got started,
I don't know,
but it did not happen.

648
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.280
After a period of about 30 or 40 minutes,

649
00:40:10.281 --> 00:40:12.680
they started marching us out on the road again.

650
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.850
The gate that we went in was the opening between one of the houses and the high

651
00:40:18.921 --> 00:40:20.570
vine covered fence.

652
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.140
As we approach this opening on our way out,

653
00:40:24.141 --> 00:40:28.220
I noticed an army canteen sitting on a small ledge on the side of the house.

654
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.290
My first reaction was at the canteen was a track you would grab it and the jap

655
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:37.940
guards would shoot you for stealing.
I thought to myself,
trap or no trap,

656
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.940
I am going to grab it.
Which I did is I went by,

657
00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:46.090
it was an easy arm's reach away and somewhat concealed by more ivy growing on

658
00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:51.770
the side of the house.
Another miracle,
it was filled with water,

659
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.270
but I dared not drink it.

660
00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:58.100
Then I had to wait until dark to make sure that a Jap guard did not see me.

661
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.610
It is unexpected happenings like this that helped us to survive.

662
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.170
This is about the time that I started pulling out of it.

663
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.780
By that I mean I no longer expected to stop just up the road to be fed and given

664
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:17.200
water,

665
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.200
but now knew that the Japanese intended to march us until we all finally

666
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.660
perished.
To this day,

667
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.610
I still believe this to be true,

668
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:33.110
but I was not going to give them that satisfaction.

669
00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.740
So that's a,

670
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:43.240
that's a hell of a mental transition to make from,
hey,

671
00:41:43.241 --> 00:41:45.130
when are they gonna stop?
When are they going to give us some food?

672
00:41:45.131 --> 00:41:47.320
When are they getting to us?
Give us some water to,
no,

673
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.500
they're not going to and they're going to march us until we die.

674
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.380
And you know what,
I'm not giving in.

675
00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.130
Fast forwarding a bit here.

676
00:41:59.131 --> 00:42:04.131
The next day we reached the town of San Fernando where we finally stopped at

677
00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:09.550
least for the rest of that day and for that night here we were finally fad about

678
00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:13.630
a couple of a cup of boiled rice and allowed to have water.

679
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

680
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.690
<v 0>At this point,</v>

681
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.900
many would have said that the rest was more important or appreciated than the

682
00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:26.290
food because many were suffering from incredibly blistered and bloody feet.

683
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.120
My feet were badly blistered,

684
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.560
but not as bad as some who had put on new shoes when they were told to pack up

685
00:42:32.561 --> 00:42:35.730
and get ready to break camp.
I had no new shoes,

686
00:42:35.731 --> 00:42:37.140
otherwise I would have done the same.

687
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.730
There's no way for a person to walk as far as we did without getting blistered

688
00:42:41.731 --> 00:42:46.150
feet.
We spent the night at San Fernando.

689
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.090
Then the next day took off again,
no breakfast of course,

690
00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:53.430
but now at least I had a canteen full of water.
By this time,

691
00:42:53.431 --> 00:42:58.431
we were in an area where the Filipinos had returned to their barrios and Nipa

692
00:42:58.831 --> 00:43:00.540
huts bordering the road,

693
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.010
damage to property and terrain was not as bad as it was further to the south

694
00:43:05.011 --> 00:43:06.390
where more fighting had taken place.

695
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.680
So now they're marching through sort of the regular Philippine villages that

696
00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:14.490
weren't as decimated as the areas where the heavy fighting had taken place.

697
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.650
There were Filipino men,

698
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.040
women and children watching us as we weirdly walked along.
And by the way,
I,

699
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.450
another thing I didn't explain very well,
the Philip,

700
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.480
the Filipino military men were also being marched it simultaneously,

701
00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:34.170
but they had them segregated.
So this is from the American viewpoint.

702
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:39.320
They could see that the Filipinos were getting treated equally brutal and if not

703
00:43:39.751 --> 00:43:41.550
worse,
and they took massive casualties.

704
00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:45.750
They took tens of thousands of deaths on this,
on this March,

705
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.460
um,
but these,

706
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.950
but now they're walking through where these regular Filipino civilians are

707
00:43:52.951 --> 00:43:56.670
watching this death march take place.
Back to the book in several places,

708
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.840
the women tried to hand food to us,
but the Japanese guards would not allow it.

709
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.300
They had bananas,
mangoes,
and Coconuts,
and it all looks so good.

710
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.280
I never saw it happen,

711
00:44:08.281 --> 00:44:12.420
but supposedly several Filipinos lost their lives to Japanese bullets when they

712
00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:14.400
tried passing food to the Americans.

713
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:15.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.650
<v 0>This was the beginning of the end of the march out of Bhutan,</v>

715
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.800
but we did not know until sometime that afternoon when we arrived at Camp

716
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:25.483
O'donnell,

717
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.070
so that kind of like you said,
this

718
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.600
<v 2>is the beginning of the end of the march and here they ended up at camp.
Well,</v>

719
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.271
Donald Campbell.

720
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:39.570
Donald was a training camp for the Philippine army and was built just prior to

721
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:43.410
the war.
It consisted of a series of barracks built in typical Philippine style.

722
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.030
The fast roofs had bamboo frame sides and floors and openings for windows,

723
00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:49.620
but no screens or shutters.

724
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.690
Each barracks was about 50 feet long and could be called a double double decker

725
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.610
because the attic was forward as well.

726
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:02.810
The attic space may have been for storing personal Geren instead of an area for

727
00:45:03.481 --> 00:45:03.901
sleeping.

728
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:06.630
I say this because the highest point between the floor and the ceiling or the

729
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:11.310
roof was about five feet.
It would be cramped even for a short Filipino.

730
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.940
I should know because that is where I slept.

731
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.930
<v 0>Once we pass through gate,</v>

732
00:45:17.931 --> 00:45:21.740
we were made to sit down in an open field with the law was laid down by the

733
00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:22.790
Japanese commander.

734
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.530
I did not pay much attention to what he said except to hear him say that if you

735
00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:30.830
did this,
you would be shot and if you did that you'd be shot.

736
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.460
I wondered what we could do without being shot.

737
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.510
After he was through,

738
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.740
an American officer walked up and introduced himself as general king.

739
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.520
He said that he was the general in charge of the troops on Bataan and he was

740
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:49.950
solely responsible for our surrender.

741
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.040
He told us not to feel bad or discouraged or guilty because we had nothing to do

742
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:56.550
with it.

743
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:01.380
It was his decision and if any blame was to eventually come,

744
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.180
it was his to face.

745
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.303
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

746
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:11.340
<v 0>that's an ownership right there.
I had never heard of the general before,</v>

747
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:15.000
but he struck me as a brave and sincere officer.
Well,
there you go.

748
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.600
That's what happens when you take ownership people,

749
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.460
the people in your chain of command look and think you're a brave and Sisiro

750
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.710
officer magic.
If he stood up and said,
well,

751
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:25.200
we didn't get the support that we needed,
and now we're in this position.

752
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.100
It's like,
no.

753
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.930
I later learned that he surrendered the troops on baton without orders from

754
00:46:30.931 --> 00:46:34.740
general Wainwright and MacArthur when he realized that to continue fighting was

755
00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:37.800
useless considering the condition of the men under his command.

756
00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:39.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.800
<v 0>He thought for sure that he would be court martialed when the war was over</v>

758
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:47.210
because his last orders from MacArthur were to attack the enemy an order which

759
00:46:47.211 --> 00:46:48.320
he chose to ignore.

760
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:49.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

761
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.980
<v 0>He knew that it meant sending hundreds more to their deaths,</v>

762
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.950
something that he would not do.
Needless to say,

763
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.700
he was not court marshal at the end of the war because everyone by then realized

764
00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:03.830
that he did the right thing.

765
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.850
We were finally taken to a barracks and I decided the best place was up in the

766
00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:13.880
loft.
I figured it'd be the quietest and least disturbed.

767
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.500
I took my only possession from around my neck,
my musette bag,

768
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:21.650
place it on the floor and got some long deserved rest.

769
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.380
The day was about over,
mosquitoes swarmed around my head before I fell asleep.

770
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.070
But I did not have the

771
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.290
<v 3>energy to brush them off.</v>

772
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:45.150
Sometimes I think when I read these books about how pathetic.

773
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.413
<v 2>Hm.
Hm</v>

774
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.970
<v 3>I am.
And you know how much,</v>

775
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:55.600
like there's a mosquito in your room and it drives you crazy and you have to

776
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:59.680
wake up and go kill it because you just can't deal with one mosquito that might

777
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.890
bite you.
Yeah.
And here you are.
Maybe if you're,
you will,

778
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:07.640
have you ever been in a subtropical place?
It hasn't.
Mosquitoes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

779
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.050
So it can be crazy.
Yes sir.
It can be crazy.

780
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.410
Do you have to sleep with a mosquito net there in your house?
No,

781
00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:17.420
not in the house,
but there,
there are some places where,
yeah,

782
00:48:17.421 --> 00:48:19.600
they all have mosquito net.
And it depends on where you live too.

783
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.590
If you live more up in like a mountain jungley please.
Oh yeah.

784
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.920
Must give them that time sometimes.
Yeah.

785
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.310
So I've been in places where you got to sleep in a mosquito net and,
and

786
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.690
<v 0>even imagining you think you're some all,
whoa,</v>

787
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.630
this would be a nightmare if I didn't have a mosquito net and these guys are,

788
00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.260
they don't have anything close to mosquito.
You have sheets,
have nothing there.

789
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.240
There's nothing to cover themselves from being bit.

790
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:47.390
So you think about these little tiny things that are like a major trauma when

791
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:51.720
you're in your normal life.
Yeah.
It's a major trauma.

792
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.170
<v 3>Yeah.
Like I can't believe there's mosquitoes out right now.</v>

793
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.320
You know what's fun is you still,

794
00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.590
you mentioning the mosquitoes still kind of bothering me right now.

795
00:49:01.591 --> 00:49:04.950
Like the thought of mosquitoes being in the room now.
Yeah.
It's kind of fun.

796
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.230
Like we're sitting here letting it bothering you and then you imagine the

797
00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:09.570
situation these guys are in and he's,
he's like,

798
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.900
there's no who cares about mosquitoes.
Yeah.
He's not even brushing them off.

799
00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:17.880
He's too tired to brush him off,
man.
Yeah.
Back to the book.

800
00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:18.520
We are now being

801
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.330
<v 0>fed a meager amount of rice,
but water situation was still critical.</v>

802
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.620
There was one very slow running faucet out in the yard with a flow capacity of

803
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:29.350
about a court every 15 minutes or so.

804
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.650
The foster was wide open and that is still all it would deliver.

805
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:37.960
So even now if and when we got water it had to be stringently conserved.

806
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.580
There was a line at the Faucet always 24 hours a day,

807
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.650
barely enough water to drink and definitely not enough to wash with.

808
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:50.910
It had now been a week since we broke camp on Bhutan and we had not been able to

809
00:49:50.911 --> 00:49:52.080
wash since.

810
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:53.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

811
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.790
<v 0>From here on,
I won't be able to recount what happened on a day to day basis,</v>

812
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.690
but I will try to tell what was going on under and under what conditions.

813
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.160
As I mentioned earlier,

814
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:07.870
we were now getting a small amount of rice each day and for a change in menu

815
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.550
started getting vegetables.

816
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:10.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

817
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:14.780
<v 0>Not the part you would normally eat,
but the part that was normally discarded.</v>

818
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

819
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.510
<v 0>We were first given boiled carrot tops.</v>

820
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.130
I presume the Japanese were eating the carrots and they generally generously

821
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.780
gave us the tops.

822
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.040
<v 2>Okay.</v>

823
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.550
<v 0>They might as well have kept because they were inevitable.</v>

824
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:29.680
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

825
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.500
<v 0>They would not stay down.
They were so horrible and strong.</v>

826
00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.970
We would upchuck after a few swallows.
Bye.

827
00:50:36.971 --> 00:50:40.030
Now there were many sick people around with dysentery,

828
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.130
malaria and diptheria.

829
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.310
Every conceivable disease was surfacing because of the physical condition of the

830
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:50.580
men and the unhealthy conditions under which they were living.

831
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:52.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

832
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:56.430
<v 0>The sick were in such bad shape that they no longer stayed in the barracks but</v>

833
00:50:56.431 --> 00:51:01.200
remained outside some under the building stay out of the sun and some lying

834
00:51:01.201 --> 00:51:03.960
outside on the ground near the slit trenches.

835
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:10.100
Their clothes were all covered with excrement and some had discarded their

836
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:12.050
clothes preferring to be naked.

837
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:18.750
<v 0>These men had dysentery and to die of dysentery was the most horrible way to go.</v>

839
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:21.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

840
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.790
<v 0>They had to stay outside or near the latrines because with dysentery you pass</v>

841
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:28.400
blood and mucus every 20 minutes or so.

842
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.710
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

843
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.120
<v 0>There is no way to keep from it.</v>

844
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:34.210
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:38.590
<v 0>I know these men would have preferred dying fighting instead of in a horrible</v>

846
00:51:38.591 --> 00:51:40.360
way that they were now going

847
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:45.510
this tree almost invariably men

848
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.433
<v 2>def.</v>

849
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.940
<v 0>I think I mentioned that my best friend had drunk,</v>

850
00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:54.290
polluted water and he'd come down with dysentery.
Well,

851
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.360
I now had the initial symptoms even though I did not drink.

852
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:01.110
I was lucky if you want to call catching dysentery.

853
00:52:01.111 --> 00:52:05.820
Lucky in that my symptoms were occurred a week or so after we reached O'Donnell.

854
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.840
I was lucky because I found out that the leaves from the trees found on the

855
00:52:09.841 --> 00:52:12.420
prison grounds were a cure for dysentery.

856
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.990
I was also lucky because there were still leaves to be found and I was able to

857
00:52:18.991 --> 00:52:22.620
get a good pocket full of them,
which I immediately consumed in a few days.

858
00:52:22.621 --> 00:52:27.621
My symptoms disappeared and also in a few days the trees were stripped bare.

859
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:29.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

860
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.720
<v 0>Apparently word had gotten out around that.</v>

861
00:52:31.721 --> 00:52:34.990
The leaves were a medicine but there were not enough to go around.

862
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:42.020
Dysentery spreads so rapidly because the v open latrines and the millions of

863
00:52:42.181 --> 00:52:43.290
flies around them.

864
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.790
They were the same big green flies that we saw in the dead bodies as we walked

865
00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:48.624
out of Bhutan.

866
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.870
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

867
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:54.870
<v 0>There were so many that the branches of small trees around were bent to the</v>

868
00:52:55.151 --> 00:52:59.730
ground.
Sick men were also covered,

869
00:52:59.731 --> 00:53:03.990
especially those near latrine because the latrine itself held the greatest

870
00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:04.824
number.

871
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.030
It was no wonder under these conditions that so many of the prisoners died

872
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:19.930
besides the flies.
The stench was something else that was always with us.

873
00:53:19.931 --> 00:53:24.370
It was everywhere inside,
outside,
on you and on everyone else.

874
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.250
There was no way to get away from it.

875
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.650
It came with a dysentery and by now the dicentric was also causing the death of

876
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:34.860
many,
many prisoners.
They were dying by the hundreds.

877
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.020
We heard that as many as 400 were dying each day,

878
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.860
and I remember I looked around to try and determine how many of us were still

879
00:53:45.861 --> 00:53:48.860
alive.
I estimated that the rate we were dying,

880
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.470
we would all be gone within a month or so.

881
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.430
It reached a point where there were so many sick that I decided it was decided

882
00:53:58.431 --> 00:54:02.450
to put them in a separate section.
It was called a hospital officially,

883
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.960
but the prisoners called it the zero ward.

884
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.650
When you went there,
that was the beginning of the end.

885
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.400
Most died within days.

886
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:17.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

887
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.880
<v 0>The dead were buried in mass graves of about 15 to 20 bodies in each.</v>

888
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:25.690
Each grade was about five or six feet wide,
eight or 10 feet long,

889
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:27.850
and about six or seven feet deep.

890
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:33.050
About as soon as a grave was finished,
there were bodies to fill it

891
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:38.810
every morning and detail was sent to the hospital to collect the dead and then

892
00:54:38.811 --> 00:54:41.180
take them out to the graves for Vr,
for burial.

893
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:46.280
I was on this detail several times and it was gruesome.

894
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:53.240
The dead that we picked up were all naked and were nothing but skin and bones.

895
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

896
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.940
<v 0>Several of the dead were from my squadron and one I could only recognize from</v>

897
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:00.774
his teeth.

898
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.270
Each body was carried by four men,
although now they weighed practically nothing.

899
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.880
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

900
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.770
<v 0>The dead were carried on wicker racks,</v>

901
00:55:12.771 --> 00:55:17.771
which at some time were probably used as a door or as a window shutter.

902
00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:25.900
When we reached the graves,
we just dumped them in the open holes.

903
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.243
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

904
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.410
<v 0>You could hear the bones crack as bodies were dumped on bodies.</v>

905
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.780
This seemed like a terrible way to treat our dead buddies,

906
00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.210
but since they had all died of dysentery,

907
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.240
it was wise to handle the bodies as little as possible.

908
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:45.623
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

909
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.930
<v 0>when the hole is full.</v>

910
00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:47.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

911
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:52.680
<v 0>It was then covered with dirt,
but no prayer or religious service was given</v>

912
00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.030
across the road from us to Filipinos were doing the same as we burying their

913
00:55:59.031 --> 00:56:00.890
dead by the hundreds.

914
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

915
00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:08.140
<v 0>Diptheria was a big killer as was cerebral malaria and Barry Barry.</v>

916
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:13.210
In the early part of our confinement,
there were two kinds of beriberi,

917
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.230
wet and dry.
With the wet,

918
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:19.550
a person's hands and feet swelled enormously and if the swelling progressed up

919
00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:24.000
the legs and into the abdomen,
death resulted with

920
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.040
<v 2>the dry form.
There was no swelling,</v>

921
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.240
but it brought excruciating pain to the feet and hands with no lead up.

922
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.550
As far as I know,
this type is not fatal.
I came down with the wet type.

923
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.960
<v 0>Another killer was hepatitis or yellow jaundice.</v>

924
00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:44.330
I caught it at prison camp

925
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.180
next to dysentery.

926
00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.570
Hepatitis was probably the number two killer in the prison camps.

927
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:52.340
It caused you to lose your appetite,

928
00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.730
which is one thing you could not afford to do because the food that you were

929
00:56:55.731 --> 00:56:58.610
getting was barely enough to keep you alive as it was.

930
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.980
It's,
it's,
when you think of,
uh,

931
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:12.450
just again putting this in perspective,
you know,

932
00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:14.280
when we get sick,
we,
you know,

933
00:57:14.281 --> 00:57:18.120
we take a day off from work and you stay in your bed or whatever,

934
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:23.250
and the,
these guys,
there's no,
there's no medical treatment whatsoever.

935
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:24.683
There's nothing.

936
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

937
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.660
<v 0>Up to now,
no one had escaped again.</v>

938
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.100
I'm fast forwarding up to now.
No one had escaped.

939
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.720
But one night it happened.

940
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:46.060
It should not be called escape because these prisoners were caught trying to get

941
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.980
back in the prison camp.

942
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.820
There were three of them and they had been out looking for food or medicine.

943
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.390
I remember they were putting a cage near the gate where the prisoners going and

944
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:58.150
coming to and from work details could see them.

945
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:03.340
The cages were in the hot sun and they were not given food or water.

946
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.570
You could tell they were suffering miserably.

947
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.140
But they're suffering only lasted a day or two as I recall,

948
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:15.280
because late one evening we were called out to witness their execution.

949
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:23.620
They were made to dig their own graves and fell into them when shot

950
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:29.910
after these men were shot,

951
00:58:29.911 --> 00:58:33.660
the Japanese came up with an idea that they thought would stop prisoners from

952
00:58:33.661 --> 00:58:34.620
trying to escape.

953
00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:39.860
They put us in what was called blood brother groups and if one of the group

954
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:44.290
escaped or tried to escape,
the rest would be shot.

955
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.260
Regardless of their complicity.

956
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:53.260
Later escapes did cause the death of innocent people.

957
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:07.190
Many of the men felt abandoned and decided that such an existence as ours was

958
00:59:07.191 --> 00:59:10.670
not worth the price of survival.
So they just gave up

959
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:13.961
dying.

960
00:59:13.961 --> 00:59:18.961
Was it much easier than the fight to stay alive and many chose this way out?

961
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.401
No.

962
00:59:26.401 --> 00:59:31.401
He gets assigned eventually to a bridge detail to build a bridge and this is

963
00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:35.160
kind of wipe,
you know the bridge on the river Kwai type scenario.

964
00:59:35.161 --> 00:59:39.600
You got to go work and help build this bridge back to the book that works was a

965
00:59:39.601 --> 00:59:41.370
short distance from our school.

966
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.910
What's where they were being held and turned out to be the rebuilding of an

967
00:59:44.911 --> 00:59:48.780
enormous bridge that had been destroyed during the war.

968
00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:53.100
When we were not caring and placing timber,
we were made to carry rocks,

969
00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.260
rocks from the river bed up to the bridge level,

970
00:59:55.261 --> 00:59:59.640
a climb of probably 30 or 40 feet,
but it felt like scaling Mt.
Everest

971
01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:07.260
dysentery soon weakened our workforce and before long prisoners were again dying

972
01:00:08.411 --> 01:00:09.640
like flies.

973
01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:11.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

974
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.920
<v 0>I could not help but notice one guy's foot.</v>

975
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:17.760
It looked like it was rotting away and I'm sure he had gang green.

976
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.970
What impressed me about him was his attitude about his affliction.

977
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.480
He seemed to even jovial as we rode back to camp.

978
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.950
I never saw him again,
but it was a miracle if he survived

979
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.440
according to a book written by one of the guys on this bridge detail,

980
01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:37.170
only seven of us were alive at war's end.

981
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.090
Another man had something terribly wrong with him.

982
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.700
I was never sure what the problem was exactly,

983
01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:48.660
but it involved his stomach and I don't know if it was a war wound or what.

984
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.410
He wore a very wide rubber band around his stomach and I was told it was to keep

985
01:00:55.411 --> 01:00:56.580
his intestines in.

986
01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:58.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

987
01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.870
<v 0>The rubber band was caught from a large inner tube that's slipped that he</v>

988
01:01:01.871 --> 01:01:02.740
slipped into.

989
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

990
01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:06.730
<v 0>I never did see a stomach beneath the rubber bandage,</v>

991
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:11.530
but I did see a Japanese guard make him show it to him and the guards stepped

992
01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:13.030
back.
Horrified.

993
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.360
I doubt if this prisoner survived.

994
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.170
They end up at a different prison camp called Kebana,

995
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:29.600
Twan Cobana.

996
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:33.740
Twan prison camp was just like O'Donnell and it hard for me to separate them.

997
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:34.550
In my mind,

998
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:38.750
I have trouble separating the two prison camps because one was just as bad as

999
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:41.600
the other little water and dirty,

1000
01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:45.560
filthy living conditions back to rice,

1001
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.750
but now more soupy instead of dry.

1002
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.990
People were still dying with this and treat and other diseases.

1003
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.730
I was still in my dirty clothes,

1004
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:57.080
clothes that had not been off my body since leaving our camp on Bhutan

1005
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.750
and now they're getting told that they're going to be transported back to the

1006
01:02:07.751 --> 01:02:09.850
book.
When we were told we were going to Japan,

1007
01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.980
the Japanese made it sound like we were going to heaven.

1008
01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:16.660
We'd be leaving this stifling tropical heat and going to a climate that was cool

1009
01:02:16.661 --> 01:02:17.494
and comfortable.

1010
01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.800
They get to Manila and eventually they get on a ship.

1011
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.820
The ship that we got on was large and apparently carry Japanese troops from

1012
01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:29.640
place to place.
I'm not sure how many prisoners board of this ship,

1013
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:33.960
but the number was very high.
Uh,
later estimation put the number at 2000,

1014
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.970
we would end up like sardines except we were packed vertically instead of

1015
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:39.804
horizontally.

1016
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:41.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1017
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.870
<v 0>It turned out lucky that I was to be on the floor because even though I could</v>

1018
01:02:44.871 --> 01:02:46.280
not lie down and stretch out,

1019
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:50.660
I could at least sit and stand people crowded in the sleeping bays also did not

1020
01:02:50.661 --> 01:02:51.860
have room to stretch out,

1021
01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:55.160
but they also did not have enough head space to stand up

1022
01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.261
by now.

1023
01:02:57.261 --> 01:03:00.590
The ship was getting unbearably hot from the heat of the tropical sun and the

1024
01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:04.280
large number of prisoners in such a confined space added to it.

1025
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:05.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1026
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:07.230
<v 0>It was quickly turning into agony,</v>

1027
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.620
but we had not seen the worst

1028
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:16.240
because many of the prisoners were still coming down with dysentery.

1029
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.730
Toilet facilities soon became a problem.

1030
01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:24.690
All we had was a bucket on top side and the Japanese guards would only let about

1031
01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:26.630
two people out at a time.

1032
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:32.840
It wasn't long before we were crowded at the ladder wanting to use the so called

1033
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:33.674
facility.

1034
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:35.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1035
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:39.300
<v 0>And it also wasn't long before the place became a stinking cesspool.</v>

1036
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.190
People soiled their clothes and everyone and everything around them.
If anything,

1037
01:03:46.191 --> 01:03:50.210
it was worse than Campo,
Donald,
because now everyone was confined in a small,

1038
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.900
overcrowded space and you just could not get away from it.

1039
01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:01.000
Getting drinking water was also just as bad because it was also top side and you

1040
01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:02.980
got it.
When you went to the latrine

1041
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.690
as expected under such conditions,
people began to die.

1042
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.100
At first it was maybe one or two a day and some days none,

1043
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.380
but eventually it got up to several a day.

1044
01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:20.020
Motion of the dying occurred at night for some reason,

1045
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.780
and in the morning they were passed up to the Japanese to be thrown overboard.

1046
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.610
Nights were probably more stressful because the whole that we occupied was in

1047
01:04:30.611 --> 01:04:33.160
total darkness.
You could not see a thing,

1048
01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:37.180
but you could hear the constant moaning of men in agony.

1049
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:41.283
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1050
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:44.420
<v 0>One night,
all bedlam broke loose.</v>

1051
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:49.430
There was loud screaming and thrashing of disturbed bodies,

1052
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:54.040
which caused a considerable uproar
in the dark.

1053
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.960
You could tell that many people were involved,

1054
01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.700
even though they could not be seen.

1055
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.350
Next morning we found out what happened.
One of the prisoners had gone mad.

1056
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1057
01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.430
<v 0>And started attacking everyone around him with his canteen.</v>

1058
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.180
When he severely hurt several around him,

1059
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:15.670
it was obvious that he could not be restrained.

1060
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.970
He was killed by those around him with his own canteen.

1061
01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:29.180
Next morning he was lifted out of a hole with several others and slipped

1062
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.043
overboard.

1063
01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.060
His troubles were over.

1064
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:38.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1065
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:42.503
<v 0>So</v>

1066
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:49.190
I don't know what is much worse than the situation that we're in right now.

1067
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:52.560
Um,

1068
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:57.560
when you have guys going crazy and the only choice that you're left as a fellow

1069
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:03.530
soldier is to kill your fellow soldier to prevent him from hurting anyone else.

1070
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:11.920
Eventually after about three or four weeks,
we came to a complete stop.

1071
01:06:11.921 --> 01:06:15.820
We could hear voices on the outside of the ship as our ship was tied up,

1072
01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:20.890
research soon learned that we were in a Taiwan harbor

1073
01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:24.980
now that we were back out in the open and breathing again,

1074
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.690
fresh air felt like we had risen from the dead.
So they,
they get off the ship

1075
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:32.523
<v 1>and</v>

1076
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.790
<v 0>they end up there.
I mean,
obviously they're,
they're literally covered in shit.</v>

1077
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:44.130
And you know,
when he talked about people with dysentery,
you're,
you're,
you're,

1078
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:49.190
you're relieving yourself and you're shitting out blood and mucus.

1079
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.840
And that's what they're just covered it.

1080
01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.390
I don't know if this was their original intention,

1081
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.450
but after they saw how dirty and filthy would they,
we were,

1082
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.180
they decided to clean us up as well as the ship.

1083
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:08.200
They made us strip completely and then blasted us with water from fire hoses,

1084
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:12.040
the force,
the water hurt and stung.
But it felt good.
We had no soap,

1085
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.060
but that was all right.

1086
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:18.990
This was the first water I had had on my body since we left our BIVOUAC in book

1087
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.013
on Bhutan.

1088
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:21.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1089
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.320
<v 0>We were also stomping on our wet clothes to hope to work out some of the dirt</v>

1090
01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:28.230
and crud as well as that on our own bodies.

1091
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:31.230
While this was going on,

1092
01:07:31.231 --> 01:07:35.160
there was a crowd of Taiwanese onlookers taking all this in there.

1093
01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:39.720
We're both men and women.
It was about,
now that I noticed my own body,

1094
01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:44.550
I was shocked and horrified by what I saw.

1095
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1096
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:50.770
<v 0>It was not the dirty body as such,
but the physical condition of that body.</v>

1097
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:52.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1098
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:56.010
<v 0>I had dwindled to skin and bones and had not been aware of it.</v>

1099
01:07:56.250 --> 01:08:00.900
My legs and arms were completely devoid of muscle and flesh and I looked like a

1100
01:08:00.901 --> 01:08:02.040
living skeleton.

1101
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.890
I was as skinny as the men who had died of dysentery.

1102
01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.560
It really shook me to discover this.

1103
01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.480
<v 1>Okay.
Yeah,</v>

1104
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.690
<v 0>and if you go on the Internet,</v>

1105
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:19.750
you see pictures of guys that were involved in this and they look absolutely

1106
01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.490
wretched.
They actually look.

1107
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.600
Some of them look exactly how he describes it as and they look like living

1108
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:30.800
skeletons.
That's how much,
how,
how completely malnourished they were.

1109
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.990
Back to the book.
When we finally did get back on the ship,

1110
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.820
we found our so called quarter still dripping wet and now very cold.

1111
01:08:42.150 --> 01:08:44.310
Even after we were all back in,
it did not.

1112
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.960
It's still not feel warm by now because of the number of prisoners that had
died.

1113
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:50.910
There was a little more space for everyone.

1114
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:57.460
I remember the one guy who had a bunk position now had enough room to lie down.

1115
01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:00.580
He was even kind enough to give me his space from time to time to stretch out

1116
01:09:00.581 --> 01:09:05.480
and take a nap.
It was funny because we never did learn each other's names.

1117
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.800
I think it was the best way because if the person died,

1118
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.840
you would not take it so hard.
Just another stranger gone,

1119
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:19.370
so they'd go out at sea again

1120
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.170
and then they pull into another port.
Finally,
after many days,

1121
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.060
I felt the ship's slow and come to a halt.

1122
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.320
I thought Japan at last and now I might get medical help and medicine for my

1123
01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:31.370
sickness and pain.

1124
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.780
Before long prisoners were called crawling up the ladder out of a hole until the

1125
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:40.781
place was almost empty with my musette bag around my neck and my canteen in it,

1126
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.500
I made an attempt to cross over to the ladder,
but that was not to be,

1127
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.890
I could not even raise rise.
Much less walk.

1128
01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.600
Pretty soon to Japanese soldiers came down into the hole and started lifting the

1129
01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:56.180
sick and dying to the other Japanese above.

1130
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.720
I was not the only one unable to move.

1131
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:01.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1132
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.090
<v 0>When they came to get me,</v>

1133
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:04.700
they lifted me to my feet and drug me over to the ladder.

1134
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.790
They wanted me to crawl up and out,
but that was impossible.

1135
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:14.130
I was too weak and I hurt too much.
When they saw I could not do it,

1136
01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:18.330
each Japanese guard grabbed me by the arms,
lifted my arms above my head,

1137
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:22.890
then handed me to waiting guards above the jap guards above grabbing by re my

1138
01:10:22.891 --> 01:10:24.360
wrists and lifted me out.

1139
01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:29.370
How I survived this ordeal.
I shall never know.

1140
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:34.550
The pain that I felt when being lifted by the arms was excruciating.

1141
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1142
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.370
<v 0>I had never felt anything like it before,</v>

1143
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.120
nor have I felt anything come close since.

1144
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:50.050
So
I mean,
he's just,
he ain't can't even stand up.

1145
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:55.260
He's just completely broken and starving and they have to drag him out of there.

1146
01:10:55.901 --> 01:10:59.110
Luckily,
they didn't kill him.
They load them onto a truck.
Back to the book.

1147
01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:01.750
The truck ride that followed was no joyful experience either.

1148
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.710
Now my bones began to take a beating as I lay on the metal bed of the truck.

1149
01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:09.640
I was being bounced around because of a very rough road and I had no flesh on my

1150
01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:13.800
bones to CAUTI cushion each bounce again,
pain and misery.

1151
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.100
When would it end?
Finally,

1152
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:21.490
we arrived at what appeared to be an army camp and the trucks drove up to one of

1153
01:11:21.491 --> 01:11:26.110
the barracks.
Once inside we found the place to be very clean and nice and warm.

1154
01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:29.950
There was snow on the ground outside,
which accounted for the heat inside.

1155
01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:34.630
There were even straw filled mattresses and blankets for each man.

1156
01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1157
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.610
<v 0>We learned a little later that we were not in Japan,</v>

1158
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:42.870
but in a place called Pusan Korea.
I had never heard of it before.

1159
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1160
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.370
<v 0>So now they're,</v>

1161
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.510
obviously they're in Korea now and you can see the treatment gets a little bit

1162
01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:50.841
better.

1163
01:11:50.841 --> 01:11:54.620
There's a little bit of influence from the Koreans trying to be a little bit

1164
01:11:54.621 --> 01:11:55.820
more humane.
I think

1165
01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:01.760
all back to the book as all as in all the places I had previously been,

1166
01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:04.070
people were dying at the rate of two or three a day.

1167
01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:05.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1168
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.240
<v 0>They were picked up in the morning when the doctor came in and taken out and</v>

1169
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.074
cremated.

1170
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1171
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:13.730
<v 0>By then,
you could tell when a person was about to die.</v>

1172
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:17.420
They had what we called a death grin.

1173
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.170
The skin was stretched so tightly across their flesh list,

1174
01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:25.280
faces that their mouth state permanently open as though grinning

1175
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.450
a person in that condition was not long for this world.

1176
01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.340
There was another condition that we called the death rattle.

1177
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.280
This also meant death within a few days.

1178
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.570
I was shocked beyond belief.

1179
01:12:40.571 --> 01:12:44.290
One morning when the person next to me said that during the night I was making

1180
01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:48.880
the rattling sound.
After that,

1181
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.750
I was afraid to go to sleep because that was usually what a person died.

1182
01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:57.520
I remember fighting to stay awake night after night.

1183
01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.750
The nights seem to last into eternity and I remembered how glad I was to hear

1184
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:03.400
the sound of the crows and the distance.

1185
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.950
It meant morning was near and I was still around.

1186
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:12.830
You reach a point where dying becomes easy,
but staying alive is a battle.

1187
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.473
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1188
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.420
<v 0>Many chose not to fight any longer.</v>

1189
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:24.770
I would say that after two or three weeks,
the dying ceased.

1190
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:30.830
There were about 20 or 25 of us left and we were slowly starting to get out of

1191
01:13:30.831 --> 01:13:33.500
bed and move around some.
So like I said,

1192
01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:36.140
they're starting to get a little bit more fruit,
a little bit better treatment.

1193
01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:39.063
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1194
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.720
<v 0>One thing that I'm not sure of in my mind is when the Japanese finally gave us</v>

1195
01:13:42.721 --> 01:13:44.370
new clothes and shoes to wear,

1196
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:48.660
the clothes we were given were all Japanese army issue shoes,
cap shirt,
pants,

1197
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:50.040
socks,
underwear and coat.

1198
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.110
These were Japanese summer uniforms and clothes and not willing uniforms that

1199
01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:56.400
our guards were now wearing.

1200
01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:02.270
We hated having to wear a jap uniform,
but we really had no choice.

1201
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:06.783
So

1202
01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.160
now they actually end up on a train and they go for a long train lot ride.

1203
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.570
And when they finally get off,
um,

1204
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.910
the place looked like and felt like the inside of a deep freezer,

1205
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:24.700
everything was covered with snow and frozen solid.

1206
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.340
And then they get put into a truck after they get off the train in this frozen

1207
01:14:34.621 --> 01:14:39.180
area and they travel out from the train area,

1208
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:43.170
from the train station away from the city and they keep going and they keep

1209
01:14:43.171 --> 01:14:46.500
going.
And finally to get to a place that looks like a prison.

1210
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.370
Back to the book,
I remember there were several buildings,

1211
01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:54.360
possibly a dozen or more,
but I am not sure of the exact number.

1212
01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:00.150
The buildings were low to the ground and barely visible because of the thick

1213
01:15:00.151 --> 01:15:01.680
blanket of snow that cupboard.
Everything.

1214
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:04.950
We stopped shortly at one of the buildings and unloaded again.

1215
01:15:04.951 --> 01:15:06.120
I needed assistance.

1216
01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:09.780
I wasn't in the building more than five minutes on one of the men said that my

1217
01:15:09.781 --> 01:15:14.781
nose was frozen to our frostbitten and I had better quickly do something about

1218
01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.810
it.
If I knew my frost,
my nose was frost,

1219
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.510
a frozen my feet,

1220
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:26.570
surely we're also both my nose and feet blistered horribly and turned black and

1221
01:15:26.941 --> 01:15:28.560
blue like a bad bruise.

1222
01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.030
The skin eventually peeled off and I was fine except for some badly scarred
feet,

1223
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:35.970
so I didn't go into enough detail.

1224
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.640
But while they're transporting in these trucks,
it's freezing.

1225
01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:42.230
And so you've got these guys that are in whatever summer uniforms and by the way

1226
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.250
there the way nothing,
they have no zero,

1227
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:48.150
they literally have zero body fat on them and they're freezing and these trucks

1228
01:15:48.151 --> 01:15:51.650
and he gets frostbite.
Back to the book,

1229
01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:56.651
we also found out that we were near the city of moon den Manchuria.

1230
01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.720
We'd come from the furnace of the tropics into the deep freeze of the Arctic and

1231
01:16:02.721 --> 01:16:05.840
if you remember that name might sound a little bit familiar,

1232
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.090
moot in Manchuria.

1233
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:13.910
That is one of the locations where the Japanese,

1234
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:18.970
the unit seven 31 did experiments on Caucasian.

1235
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:25.030
They wanted to have Caucasian prisoners to do experiments on to make sure that

1236
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.240
the reactions to biological and chemical weapons were the same as they were on

1237
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:34.440
the Asian prisoners' that they had been using on them.

1238
01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:36.700
I'm on the Chinese prisoners.
They'd been using these,

1239
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:41.730
these chemical weapons on and these biological weapons on and so that's where he

1240
01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:44.734
is now.

1241
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:55.650
Settle in a little bit here.
Before long it was lights out time.

1242
01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.210
I again became aware of how weak I was.
I tried to call crawl under my blankets.

1243
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.630
When I read this,
I was thinking about this.
Let let,
so listen this,

1244
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.100
I tried to crawl under my blankets but could not lift them.

1245
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.560
Eventually with the help of others,
I managed to make it.

1246
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:14.570
The commerce felt good for a while,

1247
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:19.690
but before long my body began to ache from the weight of the covers and I had a

1248
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.630
miserable night.
If I removed the blankets,
I would freeze and if I left them on,

1249
01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:28.610
I would hurt.
I decided hurting was better because I was used to that by now.

1250
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.093
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1251
01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.500
<v 0>it was the next day or close to it to the Japanese,
came around and gave,</v>

1252
01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:38.200
gave each man a number.
Mine was 1439

1253
01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:43.030
about this time we were also weighed,

1254
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.610
we replaced on a foot scale.

1255
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I figured I weighed around 90 pounds after subtracting for food for shoes and

1256
01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:56.420
clothing.
So if you remember,
he was boxing at one 65 and as you know,

1257
01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:59.780
like a boxer,
it's not like you're,
you don't have a lot of weight on you.

1258
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.550
You're not sitting around with a bunch of extra weight.

1259
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.370
So now he's under 90 pounds.

1260
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.360
And why are they getting weighed?
Well,
he didn't know at the time.

1261
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:08.991
Why are they getting weighed?

1262
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:10.760
They're getting weighed because they're going to be experimented on.

1263
01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:16.040
And he doesn't really connect the dots in this book,

1264
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.390
but you know,
obviously they're getting weighed because they're there.

1265
01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:23.510
They're trying to figure out how much weight they're going to lose and how much

1266
01:18:23.511 --> 01:18:26.180
weight they're gonna gain and how of the,
how long it takes him to get sick.

1267
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:28.370
And the and if you remember it,

1268
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:32.330
unit seven 31 one of their goals was to keep the prisoners healthy enough that

1269
01:18:32.331 --> 01:18:34.700
they could experiment on them,
so that is one

1270
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:40.700
I guess small benefit to to this situation,

1271
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:43.040
if I could even call it that.
I guess I can't,

1272
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:48.070
but there's one upside to this is that since they're going to be used as

1273
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:54.980
experiments,
and again he doesn't talk about it too much and it's not very clear,

1274
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:01.070
but they start feeding them better.
Back to the book,
going to beans from rice,

1275
01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:05.090
I'm sure saved many prisoner's lives as I am almost positive it's saved mine

1276
01:19:05.091 --> 01:19:06.950
beans are rich in vitamins and protein.

1277
01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:10.520
While rice is a starch or a carbohydrate which we know is not

1278
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.083
<v 1>good.</v>

1279
01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:18.210
<v 0>Contrary to expectations,
coming to a cold climate did not stop the dying.</v>

1280
01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.680
The first winter was the worst with the killers still being dysentery happened.

1281
01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:26.700
Titus and now pneumonia was added to the list and again,

1282
01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:31.730
who knows how many of these diseases were actually inflicted on on the prisoners

1283
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:35.550
by the Japanese because they're in a cold climate.

1284
01:19:35.551 --> 01:19:37.770
Why are they getting these tropical diseases as well?

1285
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:44.670
Back to the book here,
the sick and dying had a new scourge.
Body Lice.

1286
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:50.430
They were crawling all over by the thousands.
Body hair,
clothes,
you name it.

1287
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.460
They were there in the heat of the tropics.

1288
01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:55.650
It was flies and here it was body lice.

1289
01:19:55.830 --> 01:20:00.720
Body lice probably spread germs as readily as flies.
Everyone had lice,

1290
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.110
but those were well enough to keep the number of lice down.

1291
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.930
They got in the seams of your clothes.

1292
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.740
They went when they were not biting you and that is where you look for them.

1293
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:12.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1294
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:13.460
<v 0>As they were discovered,</v>

1295
01:20:13.461 --> 01:20:16.460
they were squashed between your fingernails exposing the blood.

1296
01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:20.150
They had sucked from your body that Chinese Cooley's did not let them get away

1297
01:20:20.151 --> 01:20:22.790
with their blood because they ate them.
When they were discovered,

1298
01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:26.660
I Chinese coolie at rest was always searching for lice.
Come to think of it,

1299
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.210
we were to,
at least at this time,

1300
01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.580
during that first winter,

1301
01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:36.480
all the dead were placed in a storage building that was necessary because the

1302
01:20:36.481 --> 01:20:40.170
ground was still frozen,
solid,
making impossible to dig graves.

1303
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:44.190
Burial could not.
Therefore take place until mid to late spring.

1304
01:20:45.650 --> 01:20:49.490
When the time arrived,
a large burial detail was sent out to dig graves.

1305
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:53.930
Even when even then digging was difficult because only the top eight to 10

1306
01:20:53.931 --> 01:20:56.960
inches of the ground had was fought with frozen rock.

1307
01:20:56.961 --> 01:21:00.080
Hard soil below this was permafrost country.

1308
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1309
01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.250
<v 0>When the graves were finally Doug,
we went for the bodies.</v>

1310
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.980
We found them stacked like cordwood again,
this,

1311
01:21:06.981 --> 01:21:11.981
this is remnants of unit seven 31 because they were still frozen solid as in the

1312
01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.150
Philippines.
They were all naked.

1313
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.630
They look like skeletons with skin stretched over their bones.

1314
01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.230
The one difference was many of the bodies were lemon.
Yellow.

1315
01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:22.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:25.310
<v 0>They had died from hepatitis or so called yellow jaundice.</v>

1317
01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:29.570
Although it was prevalent in the tropics,
it was catching up with us now.

1318
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.640
Now eventually he gets well enough and they put them on a work detail in a

1319
01:21:40.341 --> 01:21:42.950
factory and

1320
01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.260
still dealing with troubles.
Back to the book,

1321
01:21:47.261 --> 01:21:49.030
when we were in prison campuses in the Philippines,

1322
01:21:49.031 --> 01:21:52.870
our strongest want or desire was water.
Food was secondary.

1323
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:56.320
Now that we had sufficient water,
it was food that was constantly on our minds.

1324
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:59.140
I remember how we used to say it.
If we ever got back to the states,

1325
01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:03.520
we would carry food with us wherever we went.
If we had a house,
it would be full.

1326
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.500
If we had a car,
the trunk would be loaded.

1327
01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:09.340
The pockets of our clothes would also be stuffed with candy bars and peanuts.

1328
01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.430
We could at least dream if nothing else.

1329
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.770
And so this is pretty cool there in this factory and what they're doing is

1330
01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:18.880
they're preparing their,

1331
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:24.010
this work detail is to prepare a factory for the Japanese and the,

1332
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:28.240
they're putting a cement floor in and they've got these big machines that are

1333
01:22:28.241 --> 01:22:31.660
going to be used to build whatever and here we go.

1334
01:22:31.661 --> 01:22:35.380
The machines that were in crates were brand new and consisted of metal lathes,

1335
01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:37.450
large drill plastic presses,

1336
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.900
extremely large shapers and others that I was not familiar with.

1337
01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.230
Closer investigation,

1338
01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.190
they found a little wooden box in the corner for each created machine.

1339
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:52.660
Closer investigation revealed that the wooden box contained handles knobs,

1340
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:56.500
dials,
screws,
bolts,
et cetera.
In other words,

1341
01:22:56.501 --> 01:23:01.060
precision tools and essential parts that went with the machine right away.

1342
01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:04.180
We knew what we had to do with them to get rid of them.

1343
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:08.650
We started by taking the smaller parts and dumping them in the latrine and the

1344
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.390
same old saddle trench style,

1345
01:23:10.391 --> 01:23:14.530
but eventually got bolder when a whole was completed and ready to be filled with

1346
01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:15.364
concrete.

1347
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.970
Someone grab a bunch of parts and throw them in the hole where they would be

1348
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:23.680
quickly covered without these important parts,
the machines would be useless.

1349
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:27.130
That's like hardcore.
These guys are still resisting.
It's still fighting.

1350
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:29.080
They want the Japanese to be able to build anything

1351
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.340
so they destroy these parts.

1352
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.010
I mean that's at risk of obviously that's at risk of death.

1353
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.870
You get caught doing that,
you're going to get killed.

1354
01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.270
They eventually move to a different camp

1355
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:49.180
and this one looks,
it's another one that looks just like a prison

1356
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.420
and he talks about some of these other diseases.
When I wrote,

1357
01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.690
when I wrote earlier of diseases that existed among the prisoners in the

1358
01:23:58.691 --> 01:23:59.470
Philippines,

1359
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:04.470
I forgot to mention that we also had much scurvy and something else called Guam

1360
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:08.560
blisters.
They were like a Ross or without a scab,

1361
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:12.190
but they started as small as a small blister,
which would not heal,

1362
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:16.780
but kept getting bigger and bigger.
Since there was no medication to cure them,

1363
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:21.990
they would eat away at the entire layer of skin leaving the flesh below exposed.

1364
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.770
As the blister grew and devoured more skin,
no scab formed,

1365
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.110
which made for an ugly looking sore

1366
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.680
where the good skin was being eaten away.

1367
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.320
There was all always a small rim of Pos.

1368
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:39.460
Some of these blisters has got as large as a silver dollar and some of the

1369
01:24:39.461 --> 01:24:40.450
prisoners had several.

1370
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:44.470
At one time I was lucky I did not have one,

1371
01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.010
but I did have a very large ring warm on my stomach.

1372
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:53.020
It was about the size as a saucer and getting larger by the day.

1373
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:56.650
So there's something all of us do,
Jujitsu people can relate to.

1374
01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:01.450
You get a ring warm,
that's the size of a dime and it's like a nightmare.

1375
01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:07.660
And here you got a ringworm that's the size of a saucer

1376
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:14.470
and it gets worse.
Here we go.
Here came the fleas.

1377
01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:20.200
They only showed up in great numbers at night,
but then it was by the hundreds.

1378
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:23.890
They were actually a lot more aggravating than the lice.

1379
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:29.010
Their bite was a lot more painful and they made it almost impossible to sleep at

1380
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:29.914
night.

1381
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.090
I reached a point where it reached a point where our underwear looked like it

1382
01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:38.830
was made from polka dotted material,
when in fact it was spotted with dry blood.

1383
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:43.730
Even though we were in much better quarters our food and not improved.

1384
01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:49.040
So we still had much sickness and some dying still tuberculosis was now killing

1385
01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:52.460
people and Barry Barry was still prevalent.
You know,

1386
01:25:52.461 --> 01:25:57.350
I think I've been bitten by a flea five times in my whole entire life.

1387
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.520
Maybe zero here,
zero for Echo Charles.

1388
01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.960
And here are these things that are,

1389
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:07.400
they're biting you so much that your underwear looks like it's spotted.

1390
01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:08.510
Like it's Polka dotted.

1391
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:15.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:20.540
<v 0>Another person had dry beriberi so badly that he consented to be taken to a</v>

1393
01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:24.950
place in Mukhsin where the nerves to his feet were severed.

1394
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.470
It apparently relieved his pain,

1395
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:32.120
but it's now his feet now looked floppy to me like you did not have any control

1396
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:35.540
of them anymore.
Well,
yeah,
they cut his nerves.

1397
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:41.340
Bye now.
Bye now.
My main problem was with my teeth.

1398
01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:45.990
I had developed bad cavities in two back teeth and they hurt constantly,

1399
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:49.620
so now his teeth are all jacked up,
so now he goes to a,

1400
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.770
to a supposedly a dentist.

1401
01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:55.880
I sat down in the chair,

1402
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:59.660
one of the Japanese reach for an instrument and I instinctively opened my mouth.

1403
01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.480
He reached in and immediately I felt this horrible pain.

1404
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:07.130
I fought good and is finally out in another second or two more pain just like

1405
01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:08.780
the first and more and more.

1406
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.140
What was happening was that the Japanese was not pulling yet.

1407
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.320
He was just cutting the gum away from the two so he could reach way down on it

1408
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.820
and get a good grip for pulling.

1409
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:24.990
Luckily it finally came out with at an out any problem,

1410
01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.420
the pulling was less painful than the cutting.

1411
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.450
I forgot to mention there was no Novocaine or other painkiller provided when the

1412
01:27:33.451 --> 01:27:34.500
teeth were pulled.

1413
01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.200
Don't like that one.
No,
sorry man.

1414
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:44.030
<v 3>Cause you know when you go to the dentist,
it's nerve.</v>

1415
01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.950
<v 0>You know,
I,
I actually considered whether or not I should put that in there.</v>

1416
01:27:48.951 --> 01:27:52.040
Cause I know there's some people that really don't like going to the dentist.

1417
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:53.390
I myself was never,

1418
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:57.380
never really cared and it was not that big of a deal to me to go to the dentist.

1419
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:01.160
But I know that some people have like a legitimate phobia of the dentist and I

1420
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.670
apologize.
I'm sure that last little section isn't going to help out.

1421
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.990
<v 3>No,
no.
And I don't know that I'm a phobia.</v>

1422
01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.920
I think I'm normal dentist.
Um,

1423
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:15.730
regarder I guess their regrets,
but it is nerve racking though.

1424
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.800
So you know,
you don't want the dentist,
you know when they,

1425
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:21.100
when they do put novacane right then needle for some reason it doesn't hurt.

1426
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:24.330
I don't know.
Does it hurt?
You don't feel the needle right?

1427
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.750
Like with less than like if you,
even if you got like a blood test or something.

1428
01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.910
Anyway,
so,
so you're all numb,

1429
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:35.320
but when they bust out that drill and doing like all that stuff they do in
there,

1430
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.150
it's nerve wracking because you're like,
cool,

1431
01:28:37.151 --> 01:28:41.260
I can feel it grinding my teeth out,
whatever they're doing.

1432
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:44.830
And then,
but you don't really feel the actual pain every once in a while,

1433
01:28:44.831 --> 01:28:45.011
you know?

1434
01:28:45.011 --> 01:28:49.480
So it's just you're constantly at this high stress level and then now this guy,

1435
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:53.380
no,
no,
we can't basically what year at the stress level for,

1436
01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:56.350
he's just taking it head on hundred percent

1437
01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.010
and then he's like,
hey,
when they pulled out my tooth,

1438
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.540
<v 0>it wasn't as bad as the cutting.
No.</v>

1439
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.740
Cutting your gums is not going to be a good situation.
Yes.
No Sir.

1440
01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:10.970
It's not for a very long time now,

1441
01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.550
we had had no news about the progress of the war.

1442
01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.000
The Japanese kept telling us that before long they would be sitting in the White

1443
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.580
House in Washington.
None of us believed this propaganda,

1444
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:24.200
but why was it taking the u s so long to beat the Japanese?
We did not,

1445
01:29:24.201 --> 01:29:28.460
or at least I did not know about Pearl Harbor and maybe that was a good thing

1446
01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:30.200
not knowing had we known.

1447
01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.650
I know that our morale would have sunk to the bottom of our toes and he's just

1448
01:29:33.651 --> 01:29:36.770
talking about the mass destruction that that when that happened

1449
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:43.850
so far I have not mentioned anything or very little about our thoughts of home

1450
01:29:43.851 --> 01:29:44.684
and family.

1451
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:49.580
It was a personal thing with every one of everyone and was little if ever

1452
01:29:49.581 --> 01:29:53.210
discussed,
but you can be sure that it was on everyone's mind.

1453
01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.130
If others were like me and I'm sure most war you thought about your parents back

1454
01:29:58.131 --> 01:30:01.010
home almost every night and knew how they were suffering,

1455
01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:05.570
not knowing where you were or how you were or even if you were alive or dead.

1456
01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.780
This must have been an agony to them.

1457
01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.980
The same could be said of brothers and sisters and wives and children.

1458
01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:17.960
I always felt that the prisoners who suffered the most mentally,

1459
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:20.840
we're the ones with wives and children back home.

1460
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.010
I know it was extra hard on them,
but they were few in number.

1461
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:30.870
Most of the men were young and not married.
So That's interesting.

1462
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:32.670
If you remember when Captain Plumb was on,

1463
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:37.860
I think those guys got to a level where they knew they were going to survive and

1464
01:30:37.861 --> 01:30:41.880
even cabin plum said he didn't think he was going to die.
You know,
he said,
Aye,

1465
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.690
Aye.
I was going to live like he thought that they were going to live through the

1466
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:49.410
war.
But I think for these guys it must be a different,

1467
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.470
and that's why the guys that were in like the Hanoi Hilton,

1468
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.160
remember they knew everything about everyone's life in every single story that

1469
01:30:56.161 --> 01:30:59.340
you would try and remember every single possible thing that you could about your

1470
01:30:59.341 --> 01:31:01.560
whole life and tell it to your roommate.

1471
01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.460
But I think these guys are in such a state where survival is not a known entity.

1472
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:10.860
And so I think it sounds like,

1473
01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:15.870
and he mentioned earlier that not knowing people was actually easier.

1474
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:19.260
So it's sort of a different psychological situation

1475
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:24.510
now he goes on,

1476
01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:29.640
I know everyone enjoyed going to sleep at night and if you dreamed it was

1477
01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:31.590
usually always the same,

1478
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:34.920
but it left you extremely depressed the next day.

1479
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:40.100
In most dreams you were at last freed from prison camp and back in the states

1480
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:46.200
and feeling euphoric,
free,
free,

1481
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:49.860
free again.
How wonderful.

1482
01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:51.203
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1483
01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:57.570
<v 0>but the shock of awakening was so heartbreaking when you found out you were</v>

1484
01:31:57.701 --> 01:31:58.720
still in prison.

1485
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.460
I believe these dreams actually did more harm than good.

1486
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:06.400
Even so they came back time and time again.

1487
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:11.580
There was no getting away from them.
No,

1488
01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.740
the people not home,
we're not forgotten.
And we knew they had not forgotten us.

1489
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:19.663
So that's,

1490
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.610
you have these beautiful dreams that everything's cool and then you wake up and

1491
01:32:22.611 --> 01:32:26.630
you're still in prison camp.
Back to the book,

1492
01:32:26.631 --> 01:32:30.170
the Japanese put everyone to digging foxholes.

1493
01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:32.090
They were not for us,

1494
01:32:32.091 --> 01:32:36.350
but for the Japanese somewhere at the factory in some of on the Japanese side of

1495
01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:39.040
the camp,
but none were.
None were on our side.

1496
01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:42.260
When this work started,

1497
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.240
we knew that the Japanese were now expecting expecting possible error rates and

1498
01:32:47.241 --> 01:32:51.590
we were excited because the war was getting closer.
It wasn't too much longer.

1499
01:32:51.591 --> 01:32:55.130
After we finished digging all of the Fox holes that we were required to cover

1500
01:32:55.131 --> 01:32:55.964
them over,

1501
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:59.630
they were covered with heavy timbers and then further covered with a large

1502
01:32:59.631 --> 01:33:04.280
amount of dirt.
This told the Japanese that we were taking,

1503
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:07.100
this told us that the Japanese were taking a pounding somewhere,

1504
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:11.930
which in our minds was great at about the same time the Japanese were becoming

1505
01:33:11.931 --> 01:33:15.530
rather aggressive and there was a definite change in their attitude and

1506
01:33:15.531 --> 01:33:16.460
treatment of us.

1507
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:21.290
We now had to really watch what we were doing and if we did anything illegal,

1508
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:26.330
make sure we were not caught.
Some of the men were caught.
However,

1509
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:31.340
it's suffered the consequences,
so this is great news there.
They're like,
oh,

1510
01:33:31.341 --> 01:33:33.500
you got to dig in.
That means Americans are common.

1511
01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.293
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1512
01:33:38.610 --> 01:33:40.860
<v 0>One morning,
shortly after we had gone to work,</v>

1513
01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:44.880
air raid sirens started going off all over the city and everyone became very

1514
01:33:44.881 --> 01:33:46.830
excited,
especially the Japanese.

1515
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:50.850
We were quickly rounded up and made a double time back to camp.

1516
01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.540
This time we were not searched but sent immediately to our barracks and told to

1517
01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:58.140
stay inside.
We could still hear sirens going off in all directions.

1518
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:00.510
We had not been back to our barracks and very long.

1519
01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:03.360
When the Japanese came back and said,
everyone outside in the yard,

1520
01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:08.190
our yard was probably 150 to 200 feet long and perhaps a hundred feet wide,

1521
01:34:08.191 --> 01:34:11.130
more or less.
When everyone was out,

1522
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.300
the Japanese made us lie down and then took off probably for their foxholes.

1523
01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.040
It wasn't long before we could see a large formation of heavy bombers headed our

1524
01:34:20.041 --> 01:34:20.874
way.

1525
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.710
They were up very high and each left a streak in the sky that extended for many

1526
01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:26.700
miles behind it.

1527
01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:31.530
It was a beautiful site and we felt proud and excited.

1528
01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:36.000
It had to be American planes and the war had reached Manchuria.

1529
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.390
We watched them slowly come our way,

1530
01:34:39.391 --> 01:34:43.560
but the Japanese also saw them coming and sent up fighter planes to intercept

1531
01:34:43.561 --> 01:34:46.950
them,
which was a mistake from the ground.

1532
01:34:46.951 --> 01:34:50.130
It looked like a swarm of mosquitoes going after a flock of geese,

1533
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.230
and the comparison is good because that is about how effective the jap fighters

1534
01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.920
were
from the ground.

1535
01:34:57.921 --> 01:35:01.970
We could see flashes of fire coming from the bombers and see Japanese planes go

1536
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:03.620
plunging down in smoke.

1537
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.390
Just about then you could hear the roar of the guns from the bombers as the

1538
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:12.710
sound reached the ground time after time the Japs moved in,

1539
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:14.390
but the results were the same.

1540
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:18.440
Japs going down in flames with no apparent damage to the bombers.

1541
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:19.580
What a fight.

1542
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1543
01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:26.220
<v 0>I would like to interrupt writing about this attack at this point to mention</v>

1544
01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.690
that our prison camp was in the middle of a heavy,
a heavily industrialized area,

1545
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:34.170
which is was against international rules of war.

1546
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.290
We should not have been imprisoned.
Where we were,

1547
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:41.250
right next to us was an ammunition factory and a short distance behind us,

1548
01:35:41.251 --> 01:35:42.360
a tank factory.

1549
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.350
We were very close to an airplane factory and a major rail yard.

1550
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:51.150
There were numerous military targets for Americans to bomb and unfortunately we

1551
01:35:51.151 --> 01:35:55.260
were right in the middle of them.
Still lying on my back.

1552
01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:59.190
I kept my eyes on the bombers and was impressed by the large number in the

1553
01:35:59.191 --> 01:36:02.370
formation about 18 or 20 as I recall.

1554
01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:08.420
Pretty Soon I could see the silver flashes of released bombs and then in another

1555
01:36:09.450 --> 01:36:14.040
few seconds saw the sky filled with hundreds of bombs hurdling down on us and

1556
01:36:14.041 --> 01:36:16.470
making their typical loud swishing sound.

1557
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:19.620
I knew they would not miss and they did not.

1558
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:25.710
Three of the bombs from the plain on the outside of the formation hit our camp

1559
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:27.810
and the destruction was horrible.

1560
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:32.700
One of the bombs landed near the high brick wall that surrounded our compound

1561
01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.070
and knocked a big chunk out of its top.

1562
01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:39.510
The bomb fell right in the yard where we were allying and instantly killed 19 of

1563
01:36:39.511 --> 01:36:41.760
us and severely wounded many more.

1564
01:36:43.050 --> 01:36:47.730
The third bomb was an incendiary and fell in our barracks and set it on fire.

1565
01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:52.020
It was a tragedy hair we were after so very long,

1566
01:36:52.021 --> 01:36:56.910
a time excited beyond belief at watching our side win for a change and look what

1567
01:36:56.911 --> 01:37:00.000
happened.
We could hardly believe it,

1568
01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:03.840
but we were now being killed by our own bombs.

1569
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:10.500
Even though I was within 20 feet or so of the bomb,
I was not hurt.
I looked up,

1570
01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:11.821
as I looked up,

1571
01:37:11.821 --> 01:37:16.821
I saw men black and from the blast try to rise but fall back terribly wounded or

1572
01:37:18.331 --> 01:37:19.164
dead

1573
01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.490
again.
It's the heavies from the other,
the other side,
the other perspective.

1574
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:32.950
Now at a certain point,
one of those bombs,

1575
01:37:32.951 --> 01:37:37.951
one of those bombers did get shot down and the the air crew and pilots from the

1576
01:37:39.281 --> 01:37:44.281
aircraft that got shot down got captured and so here we go.

1577
01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:48.670
These were men who had survived the blowing up in there be 29 bomber and we're

1578
01:37:48.671 --> 01:37:51.850
now being held captive in a house within sight of our camp.

1579
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:53.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1580
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:57.480
<v 0>They said they did not know of our prison and they get communication with them.</v>

1581
01:37:57.690 --> 01:38:01.860
They said they did not know of a prison camp and in actuality it was marked on

1582
01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:04.710
there.
Ma maps as a must get target.

1583
01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:07.650
This wasn't terribly reassuring,

1584
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:11.100
but they did pass on more cheering information than that.

1585
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.900
They said Japan was being defeated all over the Pacific and it,
uh,

1586
01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:20.070
it appeared that the war should not last two very much longer by the action in

1587
01:38:20.071 --> 01:38:20.760
the sky.

1588
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.840
We had already come to assume that they also said that they were flying out of,

1589
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:26.430
from the island of Guam.

1590
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1591
01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.580
<v 0>There was always the positive.
They feel like the war.
Okay.</v>

1592
01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.710
This is obviously a really positive side.

1593
01:38:35.711 --> 01:38:40.120
The jap Japanese are getting beat all over the Pacific.
The bombers are there,

1594
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.070
even though it's horrible that they're getting bombed.

1595
01:38:42.071 --> 01:38:44.800
They at least feel like the war is heading in the right direction.

1596
01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:48.310
But then there's this back to the book,
there was always the possibility.

1597
01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:51.970
We felt that when the war was over or about over,

1598
01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.490
and the Japanese realize that they had lost.

1599
01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:58.930
They may decide to execute all of us instead of letting us go free.

1600
01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.720
So they got that in the back of their mind

1601
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:08.050
little section here.
He gets in some trouble.

1602
01:39:08.051 --> 01:39:11.660
One morning when we arrived at the factory and headed for our work in the lumber

1603
01:39:11.661 --> 01:39:14.320
yard,
we noticed Japanese soldiers all over the place.

1604
01:39:14.321 --> 01:39:16.630
They were running and crawling and obviously playing war,

1605
01:39:16.631 --> 01:39:18.190
so the Japanese were running a drill.

1606
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:21.580
We just ignored what was going on and walked right through them to get to our

1607
01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:25.160
shack.
When we were in the process of hanging up our coats,
when a jet,

1608
01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.800
we were in the process of hanging up or quotes when a Japanese officer burst in

1609
01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.380
on us and he was mad,
mad,
mad.

1610
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:35.223
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1611
01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:37.520
<v 0>So he gets in trouble.</v>

1612
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:41.060
The the Japanese officer that's all mad lines up,

1613
01:39:41.061 --> 01:39:45.710
everyone in the little shack and he has his saber and his left hand and he

1614
01:39:45.711 --> 01:39:50.630
started punching each guy in the face and that's what,

1615
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:54.020
that's what he does and he ends up,

1616
01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.290
they ended up getting in trouble because they got punched.

1617
01:39:57.291 --> 01:40:02.120
I guess they got in trouble because they got punched and finally that he's going

1618
01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:05.480
to be questioned and he's in this going to get questioned.
This guard house,

1619
01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.800
which is sort of like where they do solitary confinement in this,

1620
01:40:09.801 --> 01:40:13.120
in this guard house,
the prison within the prison.
So the,

1621
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.500
so James is about to get

1622
01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:19.470
interrogated back to the book.

1623
01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:22.590
He asked me if I thought that the Japanese officer at the factory had a right to

1624
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:25.800
hit us the way he did.
I hesitated for a second,

1625
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.090
like I was pondering the question then answered,
well,
I am not sure.

1626
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.280
Just as soon as these words came out of my mouth,

1627
01:40:32.281 --> 01:40:33.870
I knew that I had answered wrong,

1628
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:37.920
but nothing happened and I was questioned a bit further until the same question

1629
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:38.754
came up again.

1630
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.840
Did I think that the Japanese officer at the factory had the right to hit us the

1631
01:40:42.841 --> 01:40:46.380
way he did for a second?
I was in a quandary.

1632
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:50.160
Should I just say yes sir?
Or should I repeat my first answer?

1633
01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:54.250
I decided maybe being consistent.
The way to go,
sorry.

1634
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:57.970
I repeated my original answer and that was a mistake almost instantly.

1635
01:40:57.971 --> 01:41:01.930
I was hit on the right side of my jar with a closed fist,
not by the officer,

1636
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.370
but by the interpreter.

1637
01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:04.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1638
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:07.840
<v 0>From that point on.
He decided to slap me in the face as hard as he could.</v>

1639
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.890
I think he really hurt his fist when he heard me the first time,

1640
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.410
which is why he changed to the slap.

1641
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.860
All the while you are being beaten.

1642
01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:21.670
You were being made to stand at attention with this kind of beating.

1643
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:25.840
You don't give them the satisfaction of knowing you letting them know you are

1644
01:41:25.841 --> 01:41:29.230
hurt.
You just don't let yourself fall down and Moan.

1645
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.010
All I could think about was you little son of a bitch.

1646
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:36.010
If I could just get you a loan under different circumstances,

1647
01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:37.960
I would tear you apart.

1648
01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:41.600
After the beating stopped,

1649
01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:44.600
I was thrown into the guard house with the rest of the guys.

1650
01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:49.100
The inside of my mouth was badly cut and I swallowed blood for several days.

1651
01:41:49.190 --> 01:41:53.540
My face was swollen and I had black eyes.

1652
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:54.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:57.320
<v 0>I stayed in the guard house for about three weeks.</v>

1654
01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:02.870
Conditions in the guard house were unbelievably cruel and I hope I can explain

1655
01:42:02.871 --> 01:42:06.380
exactly what it was like.
It was built similar to our barracks.

1656
01:42:06.381 --> 01:42:09.290
Excepted had cells instead of separate sleeping quarters.

1657
01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.230
There was a central hall with cells on either side.

1658
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.060
Each cell was about eight feet wide and probably 12 feet long with a very narrow

1659
01:42:17.061 --> 01:42:19.520
slit trench,
fertile latrine in the back corner.

1660
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:23.410
The floor was concrete and that was it.

1661
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:27.070
No bed blanket chair or anything else.

1662
01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.360
The guard,
the guard house was solitary confinement at its worst.

1663
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.230
<v 0>I found the hardest thing to take was the boredom.</v>

1665
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:41.120
You've heard the song time goes by so slowly.
Well,

1666
01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:45.500
it certainly applied then standing in one place,
even if not at attention,

1667
01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:46.370
can be a killer.

1668
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:50.920
<v 0>I used to watch a spot of light that came in through the crack on the board at</v>

1670
01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:53.740
window and it almost drove me mad.

1671
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1672
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.490
<v 0>I tried to ignore it,
but I couldn't.</v>

1673
01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1674
01:42:58.350 --> 01:43:00.450
<v 0>It would be made to get up.</v>

1675
01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.190
I would be made to get up in the morning at five o'clock and several hours later

1676
01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.380
when there were sufficient light,
the spot would appear.

1677
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:12.730
It first showed up on one side of my cell and then moved so terribly slowly

1678
01:43:12.731 --> 01:43:16.240
across the other side until it finally disappeared after was gone.

1679
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.960
I knew I still had several hours to go before I would get rest.

1680
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:25.170
It was agony to watch and it was the same thing day after day after day.

1681
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.393
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1682
01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.350
<v 0>and then eventually we were probably released when we were without the usual</v>

1683
01:43:34.351 --> 01:43:38.520
trial and sentencing because the Russians invaded Manchuria

1684
01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:43.060
and here we go.
At this point,

1685
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:48.090
I would like to refer you to a diary that I started on August 15th,

1686
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.040
1945 and continued until September 2nd,

1687
01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.300
1940 it tells the story as it was happening,

1688
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:56.990
which is much better than my trying to recall events 50 years later,

1689
01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:00.260
the diaries short,
but I think it's worth including here.
So

1690
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.120
basically we,

1691
01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:08.030
we end up with him getting released and he starts tracking what's happening

1692
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:09.590
because he can,

1693
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.520
there were some Americans that were brought into the situation and he starts

1694
01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:20.390
keeping a little journal as he said.
And I'm just going to read a little bit,

1695
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:22.190
a little bit from the journal.

1696
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:28.970
Americans working at the Japanese garage brought in news that about the same

1697
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:31.160
time that the war was definitely over.

1698
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:37.100
They said that a nip told them that Japan had surrendered at nine 30 o'clock on

1699
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:41.420
the 15th of August.
These men were willing to bet anything on this dope.

1700
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.411
Yes,

1701
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:47.240
optimism reigns supreme and I had never seen excitement such as this before.

1702
01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1703
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:53.240
<v 0>But such a heart rendering drop came a little while later when word was passed</v>

1704
01:44:53.241 --> 01:44:57.340
around that these six new men had been placed under locking key in the guard

1705
01:44:57.341 --> 01:45:01.160
house.
Yes.
Morale rating was now zero minus.

1706
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:02.860
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1707
01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:06.880
<v 0>now we'll go August 17th this morning we found out who these new men are.</v>

1708
01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:10.960
They are American volunteers who were flown over from China to take over this

1709
01:45:10.961 --> 01:45:14.260
prison camp and to see that the Japanese did not mistreat us.

1710
01:45:15.370 --> 01:45:19.600
Also set up communications between here and our American forces.

1711
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:23.740
The story of their undertaking is very thrilling in these men deserve a word of

1712
01:45:23.741 --> 01:45:25.720
praise and credit for they're brave deed.

1713
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:28.930
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1714
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:29.980
<v 0>and then this happens.</v>

1715
01:45:29.981 --> 01:45:34.330
The American assembly call was blown about eight o'clock and we formed outside

1716
01:45:34.331 --> 01:45:36.700
where General Parker,
the senior American official,

1717
01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:40.690
made a speech before he would cut us in on the real dope.

1718
01:45:40.691 --> 01:45:45.070
He told us that we must be calm and maintain a hold on ourselves.

1719
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:49.150
He emphatically stressed that there were to be no demonstrations.

1720
01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:54.370
He proceeded to tell us of the armistice between America,
England,

1721
01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:56.110
the Netherlands and Japan,

1722
01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:59.110
which brought about a roaring cheer from the prisoners,

1723
01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.250
but he warned us that we were still prisoners and that Japan and Russia,

1724
01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:04.360
we're still at war.

1725
01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:06.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1726
01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.240
<v 0>This little speech brought happiness to everyone even though we knew what he was</v>

1727
01:46:10.241 --> 01:46:11.710
going to say before he started.

1728
01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.190
This was the news that we had been waiting to hear for three and a half years

1729
01:46:15.191 --> 01:46:18.940
and it was now official man,
three and a half years,

1730
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:23.920
so I just buzzed through this in an hour and 47 minutes right now,

1731
01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:26.290
and this is three and a half years.

1732
01:46:26.291 --> 01:46:30.190
You got to get the book and then you got to think about even more than what

1733
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.660
school you read about in the book.

1734
01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:36.640
We were still under Japanese guard,

1735
01:46:36.641 --> 01:46:40.720
but the administrative ministration of the camp was taken over by Americans.

1736
01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:42.110
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:42.943
<v 0>we really,</v>

1738
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:47.390
we really chowed like we should have now that we had the keys to the storeroom.

1739
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:51.660
So boom,
let's go.
There's,
there's,

1740
01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:56.550
they start seeing Russian pursue planes over the camp.
Um,
the Sunday,

1741
01:46:56.551 --> 01:47:01.551
the 19th held church services to get today in Thanksgiving for our wars,

1742
01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:03.780
ending more Russian planes overhead.

1743
01:47:03.781 --> 01:47:07.410
Today the men really got a thrill out of seeing friendly plains.
Again,

1744
01:47:07.650 --> 01:47:11.760
they're all anxious to see the American air force and it's large bombers that

1745
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.430
they have heard so much about Monday,
August 20th,

1746
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:17.010
we were told today that the Russians would be in camp,

1747
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.260
saw our first be 24 bomber today at a route four 30.

1748
01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.220
The prisoners really went wild with joy.
It's circled over the camp three,

1749
01:47:26.221 --> 01:47:31.221
two or three times and drop leaflets telling us about the war being over and for

1750
01:47:31.531 --> 01:47:35.640
us to remain where we were until help arrived.
These leaflets were late.

1751
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:39.280
They should have been dropped before the parachute is came in.
And that's the,

1752
01:47:39.570 --> 01:47:42.990
the rumor mill.
The guys that had come in earlier.

1753
01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:48.510
The Russians came in at about seven o'clock and did they cause great excitement.

1754
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.150
There was a general in five or six officers.

1755
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:53.610
The general call does together and gave us a speech.

1756
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:56.130
An American prisoner acted as an interpreter.

1757
01:47:56.550 --> 01:48:01.550
The general said that from this day on we were free and no longer under the hand

1758
01:48:01.681 --> 01:48:04.620
of the Japanese.
The crowd went wild with joy,

1759
01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.720
cheer after cheer rang through the air.

1760
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:10.860
He told us how in the last 10 days they'd covered 1000 kilometers of mountain

1761
01:48:10.861 --> 01:48:13.890
streams and wilderness more cheering from the crowd.

1762
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:18.780
He told us that he was in Berlin when Germany surrendered and met officers of

1763
01:48:18.781 --> 01:48:21.930
the U s eighth army.
He said that he would,

1764
01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:26.640
he told them that he would soon be leaving to fight Japan and that he would set

1765
01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:27.474
us free.

1766
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:34.020
Also had a ceremony of the surrender of the Japanese guards and the turning over

1767
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:36.690
of their sabers and arms to the American guards.

1768
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.630
It was quite an interesting and strange spectacle.

1769
01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:44.100
What made it appear strange was that it was performed in the light of the moon.

1770
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:48.780
The Russian general presented General Parker with a Japanese revolver.

1771
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:53.340
This ceremony was completed by the Russian general having the American guards

1772
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:58.080
parade the Japanese before the prisoners and off the parade ground.

1773
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:06.840
Man,
the restraint is,
is,
is insane.

1774
01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:09.990
I mean,
yeah,
I can't,
I,
it's hard for me.
Um,

1775
01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:13.710
I've considered myself to be a pretty,
you know,

1776
01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.420
emotionally controlled person and I think if I was in that prison for three and

1777
01:49:18.421 --> 01:49:23.340
a half years and the war ended and the Japanese that had tortured and beat and

1778
01:49:23.341 --> 01:49:25.710
starved,
we might have a little something to talk about.

1779
01:49:26.230 --> 01:49:28.230
Am I a little something for those guys?

1780
01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.600
A little bit more than just marching them around the camp.

1781
01:49:31.890 --> 01:49:35.820
But you know what that shows you,
it shows you that that's the,

1782
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.230
that's how professional the American soldier is,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's amazing.

1783
01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:45.480
It's amazing.
We got this from,
from units seven 31 those books as well.

1784
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:47.260
The people that were being tortured,

1785
01:49:47.261 --> 01:49:50.260
they got turned over by the Russians and said,
do what you want with them.
And,

1786
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.710
and the,
the determination was we're going to treat them humanely.

1787
01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.033
<v 1>No.</v>

1788
01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.100
<v 0>Back to the book.
Back to the diary,
September 2nd we have been moving.
We have,</v>

1789
01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.050
we've been having moving pictures.

1790
01:50:04.110 --> 01:50:09.000
He means movies for at least two nights and I've never enjoyed anything so much

1791
01:50:09.001 --> 01:50:10.800
before in all of my life.

1792
01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.300
Being in prison camp for so long almost made me forget what was going on back in

1793
01:50:15.301 --> 01:50:18.960
America.
I am just beginning to realize now what I have missed.

1794
01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:22.260
If I would've seen a movie two years ago,

1795
01:50:22.261 --> 01:50:24.990
I'm afraid I would have tried to escape at any cost.

1796
01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.550
If I would've realized to what I was really missing this long time in prison

1797
01:50:29.551 --> 01:50:32.100
camp would have been much harder to bear,

1798
01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.400
more sick left by plane.

1799
01:50:35.401 --> 01:50:39.180
Today our new colonel told us that we would probably be out of here,

1800
01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:41.460
out here for at least another month.

1801
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.500
What's a measly month more after having been here for so long.

1802
01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:47.573
In fact,

1803
01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:51.660
it is good to know that we will be leaving for home and only a months time.

1804
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:53.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1805
01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:02.100
<v 0>Yeah.
When you kind of consider in his mind it's either,</v>

1806
01:51:02.130 --> 01:51:06.490
it went from never to one month,
so it's like,
oh,
all right.

1807
01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.050
You could do that month.
Yeah.
It's also interesting how he,

1808
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:15.560
he got detached from what the world had and he actually found that beneficial in

1809
01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:18.660
it.
And I've talked about the robe.
The first interview I did with Tim Ferriss,

1810
01:51:18.661 --> 01:51:20.570
I talked about how it kind of detached from

1811
01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:22.120
<v 1>okay,</v>

1812
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.080
<v 0>from what's going on,
you know,</v>

1813
01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:26.080
from like pictures of my kids and didn't hang them up cause I want,

1814
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:28.540
I didn't want to be thinking about that because I'm there to do the job and yet

1815
01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:31.630
you can see that he's saying he would have gone crazy and tried to escape if

1816
01:51:31.631 --> 01:51:36.460
he'd known he was missing
back to the book.

1817
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:39.730
When we finally got to see what the Japanese had on their side of the prison

1818
01:51:39.731 --> 01:51:41.440
camp,
we were astonished and mad.

1819
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:45.700
They had a room full of mail and packages from the states that they never

1820
01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:49.510
delivered plus a large quantity of Red Cross packages.

1821
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.980
We speculated that the Japanese were living off our red cross packages when food

1822
01:51:53.981 --> 01:51:56.890
became scarce food that was meant for us.

1823
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:02.633
<v 1>Bye.
Now</v>

1824
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:05.500
<v 0>since we were all free to leave prison camp and wander,</v>

1825
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:09.250
everyone was looking for a Japanese saber to take home as a souvenir from the

1826
01:52:09.251 --> 01:52:09.730
war.

1827
01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:14.730
It would show that at long last in the end we were the winners and they were

1828
01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.660
vanquished.

1829
01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:20.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:23.990
<v 0>Eventually and again get the book</v>

1831
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:26.960
the he's leaving booked in.

1832
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:31.970
I was on the last truck out and as we pulled away I saw the Russians come out of

1833
01:52:31.971 --> 01:52:35.480
the front gate with the Japanese and walk on the outside of the brick,

1834
01:52:35.481 --> 01:52:37.070
walled toward the back of the camp.

1835
01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:41.720
My impression was that they were going to line the Japanese up against the back

1836
01:52:41.721 --> 01:52:43.850
brick wall and shoot them.

1837
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:51.260
Check.
I'm supporting the Russians in this one.
I think

1838
01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.490
back to the book there.

1839
01:52:57.491 --> 01:53:02.491
They end up in up in the port in in China where they're going to get their ride

1840
01:53:04.091 --> 01:53:07.080
home on a ship.
There was an American transport waiting for us to dock,

1841
01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:11.290
but when the ship captain saw all of us armed with rifles and Sabers,

1842
01:53:11.291 --> 01:53:15.190
he would not let us on the ship unless we gave up our weapons.
We said,
no way,

1843
01:53:15.191 --> 01:53:17.500
captain.
These are ours and we're not going to part with them.

1844
01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:22.180
He then said that he would safely store them for us and they would be returned

1845
01:53:22.181 --> 01:53:26.350
when we docked.
Our reply was an emphatic no.

1846
01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:27.581
By now.

1847
01:53:27.581 --> 01:53:30.880
We were looking for a place to sack out because we were not going to board that

1848
01:53:30.881 --> 01:53:33.490
ship without our arms.
Well,
after a lengthy delay,

1849
01:53:33.730 --> 01:53:37.510
the captain relented and we were finally allowed on the ship with our sabers

1850
01:53:37.511 --> 01:53:39.820
clanking at our sides.
They,
he talks about they go,

1851
01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:42.370
they'd go through great efforts to get these Japanese sabers

1852
01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.161
once on the ship.

1853
01:53:45.161 --> 01:53:48.820
We were given a cursory medical check deloused and giving clean clothes,

1854
01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:51.490
I believe before being taken to our living quarters.

1855
01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.030
Our dispute with the captain,

1856
01:53:53.050 --> 01:53:56.890
the ship wasn't over now and everyone could relax and clean quarters on a very

1857
01:53:56.891 --> 01:53:57.820
comfortable bed.

1858
01:53:57.970 --> 01:54:02.350
This was the first real mattress that I'd slept on since leaving the SS Coolidge

1859
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:04.090
almost four years ago.

1860
01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:05.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1861
01:54:05.890 --> 01:54:09.640
<v 0>It felt great and the food provided was also very good.</v>

1862
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:13.270
Now our minds and bodies,
we're truly at ease.

1863
01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.570
No mattress for f you,
you know,

1864
01:54:16.571 --> 01:54:21.130
when you got to like sleep in the airport or whatever and you complain about it,

1865
01:54:22.090 --> 01:54:24.730
that's a carpet that's actually a pretty good deal.

1866
01:54:24.731 --> 01:54:27.670
And you've got a sweatshirt that you've wrapped up in and you put a little

1867
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.640
something under your head.
Oh,
bathroom too,
by the way.
Yeah,

1868
01:54:30.641 --> 01:54:32.360
there's a nice bathroom,
right?

1869
01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:35.740
There's not lice digging into your skin or fleas eating at your

1870
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:40.750
four years,
four years on the dirt.

1871
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:44.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1872
01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:49.200
<v 0>Um,
so now they get to,
they sail from there to Okinawa.</v>

1873
01:54:49.590 --> 01:54:53.280
Once they're in Okinawa,
they're doing a little bit of port time in Okinawa,

1874
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:57.000
getting some supplies where soon told that a strong typhoon was headed our way

1875
01:54:57.001 --> 01:55:00.300
in.
The safest place for us was in the open water instead of the shallow bay.

1876
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.591
Before long,

1877
01:55:01.591 --> 01:55:05.940
the island of Okinawa disappeared in the distance and night wasn't long in

1878
01:55:05.941 --> 01:55:09.150
coming.
So there's a big typhoon coming.
They take,
they get back on board,

1879
01:55:09.151 --> 01:55:11.520
this ship,
they head out to sea.

1880
01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:14.910
I must've fallen asleep eventually because about four o'clock in the morning I

1881
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:18.150
was awakened when the ship was rocked by a tremendous explosion.

1882
01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:22.140
I could not imagine what it was because it was a lot worse by far than an

1883
01:55:22.141 --> 01:55:26.740
exploding depth charge.
Before I got completely dressed,

1884
01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:30.630
I could hear sailors working their way down toward us shouting everyone topside,

1885
01:55:30.670 --> 01:55:35.380
everybody top side and prepare to abandon ship

1886
01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:42.100
everybody topside,
hurry,
hurry,
hurry and he goes through some of the details.

1887
01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:43.053
We had hit a

1888
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:48.270
which tore a hole in the side of our ship and flooded the engine room and in

1889
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:52.920
turn knocked out our power.
There was a possibility that this ship might sink,

1890
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:55.020
which is why we were all ordered tops.

1891
01:55:55.021 --> 01:55:57.630
I didn't give him life preservers we had all,

1892
01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:01.590
we had to be ready to abandon ship if needed.
Even if we abandoned ship,

1893
01:56:01.591 --> 01:56:03.180
I doubt many of us would have survived.

1894
01:56:03.181 --> 01:56:06.300
It was still dark and on top of that there was no possible way to lower the

1895
01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:11.420
lifeboats with the ship lurching back and forth as it was once on deck,

1896
01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:15.210
we had to tie ourselves to something to keep from getting thrown off.

1897
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:16.860
At least that is what I did.

1898
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.820
I found a place where I could sit down and also time myself with the straps of

1899
01:56:20.821 --> 01:56:21.840
my life preserver.

1900
01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:23.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1901
01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:23.571
<v 0>By now,</v>

1902
01:56:23.571 --> 01:56:28.400
everyone was wet from the driving rain and the wind whistled and how old I

1903
01:56:28.401 --> 01:56:32.570
thought to myself,
is our misery ever going to end?

1904
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:36.140
When daylight came,
I sort of wished it hadn't.

1905
01:56:36.170 --> 01:56:40.670
What I saw was enough to scare a person to death.
We were adrift in violence,

1906
01:56:40.671 --> 01:56:43.070
sees with 50 foot waves.

1907
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:46.790
You had to look almost straight up to see their crest.

1908
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:50.300
When they came rolling towards you,
they were much higher than the ship,

1909
01:56:50.301 --> 01:56:52.970
especially when the ship was in a trough.

1910
01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:58.690
So they had hit this mine.
Yeah,

1911
01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.820
the engine room was flooded.
There's still 200 miles from Okinawa,

1912
01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.193
so this is

1913
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:12.430
the captain.
The captain comes on is like confident,
like don't worry,

1914
01:57:12.431 --> 01:57:16.960
we're only 200 miles from Okinawa and he says to himself,
Hey,

1915
01:57:16.961 --> 01:57:21.820
I can't swim 200 miles.
I don't know about you,
Kevin,
back to the book,

1916
01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:23.710
besides severely damaging the ship,

1917
01:57:23.711 --> 01:57:28.300
the exploding mine was responsible for the deaths of about 10 ex prisoners and

1918
01:57:28.301 --> 01:57:30.580
several sailors that were in the engine room.

1919
01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.760
The ex prisoners were on the deck when the mine went off the explosion slung

1920
01:57:35.801 --> 01:57:39.850
landing ladders that were hanging on the side of the ship up and over the

1921
01:57:39.851 --> 01:57:44.230
railing like lethal whips.
These men were apparently killed instantly.

1922
01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.850
These were the same ladders that we had used to board the ship just a few days

1923
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:52.180
earlier.
I felt depressed and I'm sure that the other men felt the same.

1924
01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:57.420
These were men who were on their way home after they're terribly long and hard

1925
01:57:58.301 --> 01:58:00.850
or deal,
and now they were dead.

1926
01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:02.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:05.950
<v 0>To get this far and still not make,
it was unbelievable.</v>

1928
01:58:06.130 --> 01:58:10.960
The Japs finally got them after all with their floating mine.

1929
01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:12.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1930
01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:16.430
<v 0>I couldn't help but think of the poor parents and families back home.</v>

1931
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.930
They had been notified that their son or husband or brother was on his way home

1932
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:23.870
and you can imagine the joy that they felt now.

1933
01:58:23.871 --> 01:58:28.850
They had to be notified that they had been killed
on the way home.

1934
01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.500
Um,
yeah.

1935
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:39.550
They eventually go from Okinawa to Manila and then from Manila they're waiting

1936
01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.630
for a ship to go back to the states.

1937
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:46.930
One day I finally saw my name on a list pinned to a bulletin board as I was

1938
01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:51.931
leaving as one leaving by ship for the states on such and such a date before

1939
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:55.090
long and he gets on the ship before long the last,

1940
01:58:55.091 --> 01:58:59.260
the tropical islands disappeared in the distance we are now well out in the open

1941
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:01.270
ocean.
There was nothing to do but eat,

1942
01:59:01.271 --> 01:59:04.450
sleep and read and this would go on for several weeks.

1943
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.490
My Body tingled in the dark.

1944
01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:10.780
When I thought about what the future might bring sitting out on the deck with a

1945
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:15.781
cool breeze blowing and the ship gently rocking made me feel a little guilty for

1946
01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:19.360
having it.
So good.

1947
01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:22.613
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1948
01:59:22.770 --> 01:59:26.450
<v 0>goes on.
They sale.</v>

1949
01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:32.810
One day we spotted land and before long we were going under the Golden Gate

1950
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:34.340
Bridge and into San Francisco Bay.

1951
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:39.200
We eventually doctored the same pier we had taken off almost four years earlier.

1952
01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.113
At the dock.

1953
01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:44.360
Many soldiers were met by their families and you could see the joy in their

1954
01:59:44.361 --> 01:59:46.880
faces as they tightly embraced each other.

1955
01:59:47.150 --> 01:59:49.730
They had been to war and survived.

1956
01:59:52.890 --> 01:59:55.200
Now they check into a hospital.

1957
01:59:55.201 --> 01:59:57.470
One of the first things that the doctor said when he saw me was,

1958
01:59:57.490 --> 02:00:01.170
you have hepatitis
a.

1959
02:00:01.171 --> 02:00:05.850
We were fed for large meals a day between meals.
Nurses brought around ice cream,

1960
02:00:05.851 --> 02:00:08.100
candy and cookies for anyone that was still hungry.

1961
02:00:08.101 --> 02:00:11.040
They were obviously trying to fatten us up before we went home.

1962
02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.020
Finally he gets on a hospital train car he has for San Antonio,
Texas,

1963
02:00:16.770 --> 02:00:19.860
and then from there he was finally given a pass to go home

1964
02:00:21.450 --> 02:00:24.810
and he's with a friend of his.
Before we got to Lafayette,

1965
02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.830
I talked my friend into staying overnight and Crowley so we could clean up and

1966
02:00:28.831 --> 02:00:33.390
be rested for our trip home.
The next day we spent the night at the rice hotel.

1967
02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:39.610
Next morning I decided to get a haircut,
so I went to a barber shop nearby.

1968
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.360
The barber started talking about the boys that had left to go to war,

1969
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:45.040
some of whom had been killed.

1970
02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:52.820
He then talked about about a family that lived near Mulatta that had two sons

1971
02:00:54.301 --> 02:00:57.090
killed and another missing in action.

1972
02:00:58.620 --> 02:00:59.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1973
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:02.950
<v 0>He said that the one missing in action later turned out to be a prisoner of war</v>

1974
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:08.500
of the Japanese.
I was shocked beyond belief,

1975
02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.150
belief,
and I know I turned pale because I was positive.

1976
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:18.070
He was talking about me and my brothers even though he did not give names.

1977
02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:19.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1978
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:22.610
<v 0>This news came as a complete surprise,</v>

1979
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:25.400
but I had begun to suspect something before.

1980
02:01:25.401 --> 02:01:29.900
Now in a letter or two that I sent home,
I inquired about Andrew and Steven

1981
02:01:31.530 --> 02:01:35.550
but never got any information concerning them.
When I received mail in return,

1982
02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:41.570
I thought maybe they had overlooked questions or at worst or at worst,

1983
02:01:42.191 --> 02:01:44.060
maybe they had been wounded in the war.

1984
02:01:45.230 --> 02:01:47.720
I knew that Steven was in the service but not Andrew.

1985
02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:54.780
You can imagine my grief when I found out they had both been killed

1986
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:59.031
before long.

1987
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:03.700
I decided to call my sister Eunice to see if she could come and get me into.

1988
02:02:03.710 --> 02:02:05.960
Of course,
she was overjoyed to hear my voice.

1989
02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:10.310
She said that she would be over as soon as she could before long she arrived in

1990
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:13.490
some of her first words that she said were,
pat,

1991
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:15.650
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

1992
02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.340
Pat was a nickname that my family calls me.

1993
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.030
I knew what she was about to say,
so I stopped her and said,

1994
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:25.040
I already know about my brothers.

1995
02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:32.500
I finally got to the farm.
My mother met me at the front gate.

1996
02:02:33.670 --> 02:02:35.890
She was crying,
which I expected,

1997
02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:38.740
and started to tell me about Andrew and Steven.

1998
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:45.650
I told her I knew everything
and everything would be all right,

1999
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.820
but she kept crying.

2000
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:51.860
We hugged each other for awhile and finally I was able to shake hands with my

2001
02:02:51.861 --> 02:02:55.720
father.
He said one word,

2002
02:02:56.650 --> 02:03:01.110
Pat,
and I said,
one papa,

2003
02:03:02.490 --> 02:03:06.660
and that was it.
He was never much for talking,

2004
02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.040
but I knew that he was glad to see me back.

2005
02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:17.390
So after all that,

2006
02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:20.500
he comes home and finds out that both of his brothers had been killed.

2007
02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:26.410
His father says,
Hey,

2008
02:03:26.411 --> 02:03:30.880
if you want to stay here and work at the farm and hang out,

2009
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:33.580
that's fine.
And he tells his dad,
no,

2010
02:03:33.581 --> 02:03:38.581
he's going to go to college and finish his degree in the Gi bill covers his cost

2011
02:03:40.121 --> 02:03:40.954
of his college

2012
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.300
and he says there's not a great deal to do.
While home on leave.

2013
02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:47.790
I walked in the woods a lot,

2014
02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.160
visited our old swimming hole at the big cypress tree.

2015
02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:54.310
I thought of the fund we used to have

2016
02:03:56.230 --> 02:03:58.510
and especially the mudflats that were so exciting.

2017
02:04:00.490 --> 02:04:04.510
We were all grown up.
Now that is the ones who were still alive.

2018
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:06.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2019
02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:09.250
<v 0>Such a change in five and one half years.</v>

2020
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:14.810
I was given my discharge

2021
02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:19.400
on February 17th,

2022
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.330
1946 I had been in the service for five and one half years and those are years.

2023
02:04:23.331 --> 02:04:26.090
I shall never forget.
When I was in the service,

2024
02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:29.690
I always felt so very young because everyone else was older than me.

2025
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:34.130
Returning to college,
I felt just the opposite.

2026
02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:39.870
I felt so much older than most of my students and of course I was

2027
02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.353
<v 2>okay.</v>

2028
02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.530
<v 0>One thing I never talked about wall in college.</v>

2029
02:04:44.531 --> 02:04:46.240
It was my experience in the service.

2030
02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:51.430
I would tell new friends that I was a veteran and had served overseas,

2031
02:04:51.431 --> 02:04:52.264
but that was it.

2032
02:04:53.650 --> 02:04:58.630
I was still abiding by the militaries requests not to tell about your pow

2033
02:04:58.631 --> 02:04:59.710
experience to anyone.

2034
02:05:00.850 --> 02:05:05.440
I may not have had trouble keeping my pow experiences to myself after my return.

2035
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:06.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2036
02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:10.600
<v 0>But one aspect of the experiences I did have trouble with,</v>

2037
02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.940
and that was my dreams at night,

2038
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:17.480
almost every night when I fell asleep,

2039
02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:22.550
I found myself back in prison camp and I would think to myself and my dream.

2040
02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:26.540
How did this happen?
I was sure I had been freed.

2041
02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:31.540
It was heartbreaking to find that I was still a prisoner.

2042
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:36.460
It was just the reverse of what I had experienced in prison camp when I always

2043
02:05:36.461 --> 02:05:37.630
dreamed I was free.

2044
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.900
When I woke up during the war,
I found I was still a prisoner,

2045
02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.190
but at least when I woke up as a civilian,
I found that I was free.

2046
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.360
As good as this felt,

2047
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:59.370
it was still very disturbing mentally because these dreams lasted for about 10

2048
02:05:59.371 --> 02:06:00.204
years.

2049
02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.960
For the first few years I hated to go to sleep,

2050
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:10.960
but luckily the dreams became less frequent.

2051
02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:15.640
Even now they are not completely gone.

2052
02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:22.420
This dream tells me that in the recesses of my mind,

2053
02:06:22.630 --> 02:06:27.630
I am still haunted by my participation and experiences during the Bataan death

2054
02:06:27.761 --> 02:06:28.594
march.

2055
02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:35.620
It is something that I will undoubtedly be there always.

2056
02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:37.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2057
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:41.780
<v 0>But even though I may not be able to control my dreams,</v>

2058
02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.930
I long ago learned to live with my life.

2059
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:47.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2060
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:49.700
<v 0>As though none of this had ever happened.</v>

2061
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:57.960
The dream that keeps coming back most often is one in which I find myself across

2062
02:06:58.661 --> 02:07:00.070
a large body of water.

2063
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:07.250
I know that I must walk for miles and miles to return to where I want to be.

2064
02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:10.043
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2065
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:13.090
<v 0>In my mind,
I know I have made this long,</v>

2066
02:07:13.210 --> 02:07:18.210
long walk before and I know how difficult and time consuming it will be

2067
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:23.940
in my dream.

2068
02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.600
I feel completely dejected because I wonder what could have happened to get me

2069
02:07:30.211 --> 02:07:32.070
back to this place again.

2070
02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.393
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2071
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.120
<v 0>But in my dream,</v>

2072
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:42.100
I start walking.

2073
02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:46.990
I start walking.

2074
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:53.110
And I think that that right there,

2075
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.790
well wraps up the book.
And I think that is a,

2076
02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:02.950
a very powerful message for everyone,

2077
02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:07.840
for everyone.
No matter what you face,

2078
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:14.010
no matter how bad it is going to be,

2079
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:18.150
when there is a challenge.

2080
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:25.470
And by a challenge,
I mean Amy thing in life,
any,
any challenge,

2081
02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.930
anything that you're facing,

2082
02:08:27.931 --> 02:08:32.580
the only way to overcome the challenges that you face

2083
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:36.520
is to start walking.

2084
02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:41.230
Take that step.

2085
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:49.280
That is what James Bolek did

2086
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:57.370
and the Bataan death march,
it was absolutely ruled a war.

2087
02:08:57.371 --> 02:08:59.230
Cold War crime after the war.

2088
02:09:01.650 --> 02:09:06.650
And the Japanese Lieutenant General Houma Masaharu who oversaw the march and

2089
02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:13.350
oversaw the atrocities that took place during the march,

2090
02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:19.760
he was put on trial and he was found guilty of war crimes and he was executed

2091
02:09:22.190 --> 02:09:26.450
April 3rd,
1946 just outside of Manila.

2092
02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:31.730
But James,
uh,
Bowlick lived,

2093
02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.060
he survived the death march.

2094
02:09:35.090 --> 02:09:40.090
He survived three and a half years in absolutely wretched conditions.

2095
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:45.740
And
James Bullock survives today.

2096
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:52.190
He's still alive and he lives in Louisiana still.

2097
02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:58.160
And as a matter of fact,
on the 25th of May of this year,

2098
02:09:58.161 --> 02:10:03.161
2018 James Bullock was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal,

2099
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:11.830
the highest civilian award for the accomplishments that he achieved in his life

2100
02:10:13.491 --> 02:10:17.120
and that he has achieved in his life.
He's a retired geologist.

2101
02:10:17.121 --> 02:10:21.080
He's written 11 books,
including the one that I read from today,

2102
02:10:21.081 --> 02:10:25.910
a soldier's journal.
And actually the copy that I got,

2103
02:10:25.911 --> 02:10:30.200
which I got
from a used bookstore,

2104
02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.870
he's got a note,

2105
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:36.870
he signed it and his signature has a note and the note says,

2106
02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.530
simply respect the flag,

2107
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.010
respect the flag.

2108
02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:53.860
And I definitely recommend you pick up a copy of the book.

2109
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:59.350
And I also recommend that you take his advice every day,

2110
02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.990
no matter what you are facing,
get up

2111
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:09.290
and start walking.

2112
02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:15.070
<v 3>Yeah.
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.</v>

2113
02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.530
So Echo Charles,
I guess at this point.

2114
02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:22.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2115
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:26.630
<v 3>Maybe since we're talking about walking you,
could you tell us how to walk?</v>

2116
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:31.420
Maybe don't walk down the path a little bit.
Little bit of an easier walk.
Yeah,

2117
02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:36.470
yeah,
yeah.
Little bit that um,
there was another backs.
Yeah.

2118
02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:40.400
A few other books where this was like that,
where every,

2119
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:44.910
every situation he kind of goes through.
You just get more and more exhaust,

2120
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:48.050
like you're exhausted because you kind of think like,
okay,
it'll start to let up.

2121
02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:51.450
Yeah.
And then it's,
it's doesn't matter.

2122
02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:56.370
It's madness.
If you put this,
like if it's,

2123
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:59.050
if you put this into a movie,
you wouldn't believe it.
It's a,

2124
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:00.980
I'll know they're really going to have a storm over there.

2125
02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.910
You're gonna hit a mine.
Come on.
Like I'm not buying that.
Yeah,
no,
it's true.
Yeah.

2126
02:12:04.911 --> 02:12:05.451
It literally,

2127
02:12:05.451 --> 02:12:08.480
does it sound like something like someone would try to put in a movie.

2128
02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:12.260
To me it just seemed like,
oh,
his journey was so hard.
Yeah.
It was a real one,

2129
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:13.094
by the way.
Yeah.

2130
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:18.650
And you kind of feel when he starts talking about like for some reason,

2131
02:12:18.651 --> 02:12:20.450
I don't know,
maybe it's,
cause I'm kind of hungry right now,

2132
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.680
but when he's talking he's started men of feeling the stuff and then when he,

2133
02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:27.010
when he'd be like,
yeah,
when they switched.

2134
02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:32.020
So we're talking about a man that was lost 75 pounds of body weight.

2135
02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.780
Want to be,
he wasn't eating and you haven't eaten in four hours.

2136
02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:44.300
You're throwing that out there.
I've met comparing bro.
Compared,

2137
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:49.390
I'm saying after I kind of felt,
I felt in this situation and I,

2138
02:12:49.391 --> 02:12:53.970
and I might want to edit to South Alabama.
Hey,

2139
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:56.060
I will say this.
I will say this.

2140
02:12:56.061 --> 02:13:00.080
You know what I'm looking forward to tonight is I'm going to go,
first of all,

2141
02:13:00.081 --> 02:13:02.180
I've been traveling,
I am tired.
Sure.

2142
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:07.160
And tonight I'm going to go enjoy my mattress and my bed.

2143
02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:10.230
Yeah.
And I'm gonna think about that when I'm crawling.
I got an,

2144
02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.540
I got a pretty nice bed.
It's nothing crazy,
but it's nice.
Better than the floor.

2145
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:17.780
You know what a California king.
Yes I do.
That's the biggest bed you can get.

2146
02:13:17.810 --> 02:13:21.570
It's the longest yet eastern king is wider.
Really?
Yeah,
man.

2147
02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:26.600
Meet me and my wife spent a lot of time trying to determine California king

2148
02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.140
dangle and I'm going to get in that thing tonight.

2149
02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:34.520
We all leave that with the guest bed spread on it.
Yeah,
it is.

2150
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:37.030
So you felt you were feeling this pain a little here.

2151
02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.800
A little bit extra to then when he was talking about like the floor and all this

2152
02:13:40.801 --> 02:13:43.590
stuff and then he finally got on that mattress that he hadn't been,
you know,

2153
02:13:43.591 --> 02:13:45.910
no mattresses for years.
I think if you compare,

2154
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:49.710
if you compare anything that he literally,
anything in that book,

2155
02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:53.550
anything that he's talking about,
you can just say,
I have it good.

2156
02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:56.160
I don't care who you,
Oh yeah,
I got it.
So good.

2157
02:13:56.460 --> 02:14:01.050
I'm just in the living in the lap of complete luxury.
You have read it,

2158
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:04.410
you know the part when they were like,
oh yeah,
and then they'd feed us,
uh,
uh,

2159
02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:07.260
cookies and candy bars or whatever.
Trying to fatten them up.

2160
02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:10.170
When you were saying that,
I was thinking tonight if I want to,

2161
02:14:10.171 --> 02:14:11.960
and I'm considering to steel right now,
by the way,

2162
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:15.210
I can go to the store on the way home,
by the way,

2163
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:19.170
and just pick up as many candy bars as I want right now.
Just candy bars,
stakes,

2164
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.063
ice cream.

2165
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:24.300
You can pretty much any possible thing you could possibly imagine.

2166
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:26.990
You can get within three,

2167
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:29.690
within seven minutes of departing from this,

2168
02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:33.740
this podcast right now on your way to your California [inaudible],

2169
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:37.710
California king bed and the sheets and you have the strength to put your

2170
02:14:37.711 --> 02:14:39.820
blankets.
That's cool too.

2171
02:14:39.970 --> 02:14:43.230
It's nice to be able to pull your blankets over yourself because you're not so

2172
02:14:43.231 --> 02:14:46.950
malnutrition when they and when the blankets are on you.
That's,

2173
02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:49.450
that's kind of Nice.
Yeah,
it doesn't,
you know,
cause you pain,

2174
02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:51.690
it doesn't like suffocate cause you're gonna break your ribs.

2175
02:14:51.691 --> 02:14:55.710
This one I'm like yeah bro.
Big Time and let me and yeah,

2176
02:14:55.711 --> 02:14:59.210
but you were feeling it though,
I think,
you know.
Definitely.
Okay.
Let me for them,

2177
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:03.240
for the people out.
Definitely feeling it coheres.
Here's Jocko today.
By the way,

2178
02:15:03.610 --> 02:15:08.610
I witnessed his whole journey more or less as whole journey because I follow him

2179
02:15:08.731 --> 02:15:13.650
on Instagram.
So what three 50 recorded wake up.

2180
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:18.490
So you probably woke up at,
at the very least,
45 three 45 okay,

2181
02:15:18.491 --> 02:15:19.840
so three 45 drink up.

2182
02:15:20.250 --> 02:15:24.840
I was in Denver and then,
yeah.

2183
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:28.140
So I had to catch an early flight,
actually wasn't in Denver.
I was in boulder,

2184
02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:33.090
so I had to get a car from boulder lot for one hour.
One hour ahead.
I put one,

2185
02:15:33.110 --> 02:15:37.260
yeah,
it's one hour.
Okay,
so two 50 yeah.

2186
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:42.690
You were taking away credit nonetheless to 50 wake up travel,

2187
02:15:43.890 --> 02:15:47.160
which like I said earlier,
to trick it.
Okay.

2188
02:15:47.161 --> 02:15:51.960
So travel from Colorado to San Diego.
To me that's the day already.

2189
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:55.530
My Day done.
My work is done.
Let's face it.
I've got to recover from that.

2190
02:15:55.531 --> 02:16:00.150
That's me.
Can you come home?
You do what?
Oh,
oh,
on your way home.

2191
02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:04.020
You prep bit.
I've finished prep podcasts and then when I got home,

2192
02:16:04.021 --> 02:16:08.790
the first thing I did when I got home was finish the prep of the podcast.

2193
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:13.740
I had about another hour to do.
Okay.
And you shift mentally to a workout.

2194
02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:18.660
Yeah.
Okay,
so,
so here's the thing where you know,
I'll work out.
Cool workout.

2195
02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:21.780
I've worked up after brought what I worked at the,
at the nightclubs.

2196
02:16:21.781 --> 02:16:26.560
I'd work out after a whole day at like three in the morning and I trained you to

2197
02:16:26.561 --> 02:16:28.980
get to before work,
you know?
Celltrak hey was the thing.
No.

2198
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:33.970
You make that mental shift where you're like,
okay,

2199
02:16:33.971 --> 02:16:36.790
you wake up at 2:50 AM you travel?
To me,

2200
02:16:36.791 --> 02:16:39.730
mentally traveling just just kind of finishes me,
you know,

2201
02:16:39.731 --> 02:16:41.440
I got to kind of recover,
you know,

2202
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:43.450
unless they have something lingering or something like that.
Okay.

2203
02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:46.090
There's that and then you still working,
by the way,

2204
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:50.530
shift into workout mode still in the morning,
by the way.
Okay,

2205
02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:53.750
so workup mode,
you get your workout done,
which is,

2206
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.740
we don't have to go into the detailed ever,
but it's a mini condition.

2207
02:16:56.770 --> 02:17:01.000
It's a conditioning circuit.
I pretty much took me,
I don't know yet,
but yeah,

2208
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:04.930
basically the most solid little workout if personally.
Anyway,

2209
02:17:04.931 --> 02:17:05.920
I'm speaking for myself.

2210
02:17:05.950 --> 02:17:09.670
If I'm going to skip a workout on a day where I don't feel like it is going to

2211
02:17:09.671 --> 02:17:13.170
be one of those workouts,
one of those ones that you're doing,
like you know,

2212
02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:17.590
burpees and this and it's like the heart,
the junk ones,
they're painful anyway.

2213
02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:22.090
A little bit of get something.
Yeah.
And then so look,
it's exactly right.

2214
02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:27.200
And then you've got to Jujitsu.
Yeah.
Do bungee rounds.
Montreal.
Oh wait.

2215
02:17:27.490 --> 02:17:30.100
Over an hour of straight rolling.
Well,
I mean,

2216
02:17:30.101 --> 02:17:34.080
you know you have breaks between these two lights.
Yeah,
but it was an hour.

2217
02:17:34.081 --> 02:17:37.560
It's about an hour and 15 minutes.
Okay,
so that's a big deal.
That's way,

2218
02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:40.540
that's like maybe two or three times the amount of,

2219
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:43.890
we'll say quote unquote normal rolling depending on who you are.
Okay.

2220
02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:48.660
And we've like Andy,
I saw Taylor here in Taylor.
Oh,
okay.
All right.

2221
02:17:48.670 --> 02:17:52.000
So it's not like you're buying with some that maybe you'll catch a new girl or

2222
02:17:52.001 --> 02:17:56.190
something that like this.
Okay,
here we go.
Still on chocolate scheduled,

2223
02:17:56.191 --> 02:17:59.680
by the way.
Okay.
And then now you got it.
Now you've got to do a podcast.
Okay.

2224
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:03.460
So I'm trying to imagine your state of being in your mind.

2225
02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.580
And then when he said the part,

2226
02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.870
actually there's a bunch of parts when he's talking about on the ship and you

2227
02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:13.960
know the breeze and the,
the basically the rest parts.

2228
02:18:13.961 --> 02:18:16.750
I think you were feeling that.
What do you mean?

2229
02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:18.550
I was feeling it because you had that state,

2230
02:18:18.551 --> 02:18:22.420
you have that state of like you put it in a lot of work and now you know,

2231
02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:25.640
you're kind of on the backside to the recovery portion of the day.
Oh yeah.

2232
02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:29.500
So I think that part resonated with you is what I think.
Yeah,
I guess so.

2233
02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:32.830
All right.
Well there it is.
Boom.
See,
I know long explanation,

2234
02:18:32.831 --> 02:18:36.430
but still just saying,
you got to remember that even like,

2235
02:18:36.510 --> 02:18:37.720
like you just described my day,

2236
02:18:37.721 --> 02:18:41.560
but there's people out there that did five times more than what I did today.

2237
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:46.150
There's,
there's,
uh,
there's people everywhere that are getting after it.
Super.

2238
02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:51.030
Yeah.
More than me.
Some people every single day,
you know?
Yeah,
no,

2239
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:54.280
it's true.
It's definitely true.
And it does bread this.

2240
02:18:54.281 --> 02:18:56.710
And that's how a lot of books like this men where the,

2241
02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:01.720
you know what Kinda got me fired up was Dan Bat Dan bats here and he and the

2242
02:19:02.871 --> 02:19:07.260
family and his and his wife.
And so damn bats,

2243
02:19:07.261 --> 02:19:11.840
a guy that's been like kind of in the game for since day one.
And He,

2244
02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:16.960
and,
and so I knew him from social media and as soon as I saw him,
he's like,
Hey,

2245
02:19:16.961 --> 02:19:21.580

Yeah,

And,

2246
02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.930
but then,
you know,
him and his brother and,
and you know,

2247
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:28.880
Dan was in the Marine Corps and now he's a,

2248
02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:33.340
he's a government official still.
He's still,
uh,
uh,

2249
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:37.040
carries a gun for a living.
Right.
And,

2250
02:19:38.510 --> 02:19:41.150
and I was,
you know,
he was all just like,
he's like,

2251
02:19:41.151 --> 02:19:43.910

And I was like,
yeah.
And he was pumped.

2252
02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:50.680
That gets me,
uh,
yeah,
I'm stoked when people are stoked.
He goes,
he was walking,

2253
02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:52.580
he was already covering a book.
Can you tell me?
And I was like,
yeah,

2254
02:19:52.581 --> 02:19:54.780
I'm coming to soldiers journal.
I go,

It go.

2255
02:19:54.781 --> 02:19:57.350
It's about a guy on the Bataan death march cause I can't wait till Wednesday.

2256
02:19:57.410 --> 02:20:01.490
And I was like,
I'm going to go in there and testing.
So yeah.

2257
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:05.210
Dan Bhat thanks for coming up.
And uh,
thanks for swinging by the gym.

2258
02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:09.560
You didn't come and get me to roll though unfortunately.
Yeah.
Oh wait.
Yeah.

2259
02:20:09.561 --> 02:20:11.030
Cause he was on the,
he was doing,

2260
02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:15.660
he was doing Nogi I was doing the [inaudible] the key daggy.

2261
02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:21.170
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
But is that,
I mean,
I know,
we know and you know,

2262
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:25.550
so as like,
okay,
I'm Dan Bet I'm coming in.
I see Jack for the first time.

2263
02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:27.800
He's over there rolling with NBN Taylor,
by the way.

2264
02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:31.820
And I'm over here doing Nogi a little bit early in in the Jiu Jitsu career.

2265
02:20:32.650 --> 02:20:34.370
Jack Lew,
their training hardcore.

2266
02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:38.240
Do I walk over there and try to roll with Jocko?
That's the question.
Yeah,
well,

2267
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:41.540
some people do,
some people don't.
For us,
like yeah.
If I were to ask you that,

2268
02:20:41.541 --> 02:20:44.710
you'd be like,
yeah,
come wrong.
But like I said,
if I'm dead bad,

2269
02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:49.530
it's my first time at victory.
I see you over there.
Do I do that?
Yeah,

2270
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:53.750
maybe I overestimated the,
I feel like I know him pretty well.

2271
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:59.810
He probably feels like he knows us real well.
W he came up,

2272
02:20:59.811 --> 02:21:03.160
he was like my other friend Anthony,
he was like,
Oh yeah,
that guy,
he's,
he's,

2273
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:06.830
he's the one farm buffalo,
um,
Jiu Jitsu and all this stuff.
His name is Dan.

2274
02:21:06.831 --> 02:21:09.650
I was like,
oh yeah,
cool Dan.
I meet him.
I'll take,
Hey Dan,
cause I didn't draw,

2275
02:21:09.651 --> 02:21:13.340
I didn't make the connection then stand back,
stand back.

2276
02:21:13.390 --> 02:21:16.220
Because we all know none.
Dan back from it,
from the beginning because I don't,

2277
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:18.710
for whatever,
maybe I'm not looking at his picture close enough or whatever.

2278
02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:21.600
But um,
yeah,
when you were like,
yeah,
Dan Bet.
I was like,
ah,

2279
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:24.260
this is getting better.
And then I'm like cruising with them,
you know,

2280
02:21:27.330 --> 02:21:32.330
damn bat is on the path but still on the way on the path.

2281
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:36.200
He's away on the path.
Big Time.
And so are we.

2282
02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.320
And then we can talk about some stuff to help support the path and people's

2283
02:21:41.331 --> 02:21:45.920
path.
All right,
first one gonna talk about origin.
So origin.

2284
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:48.440
Origin is the company,
the company.

2285
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:50.990
This is where you get your gear when you're introduced to [inaudible].

2286
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:53.170
Just to real quick.
So one,
you take Jujitsu,

2287
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:57.350
you need a geek cause you're doing g and Nogi.
Yes.
That's a good idea.

2288
02:21:58.130 --> 02:22:02.410
I don't what's going to be mad at you if you just Dukie or if you just do know

2289
02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:05.750
geek,
everyone's going to be mad at you or no one's going to be mad at you,

2290
02:22:05.751 --> 02:22:10.190
but as a strong recommendation to both.
So when you do both,

2291
02:22:10.191 --> 02:22:14.740
you can need a gate origins.
This is why you get an origin.
Get no other gate.

2292
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:17.900
Don't get any more than any other gay.
You don't have to.
No.

2293
02:22:17.930 --> 02:22:22.080
I have other geese from before or while they're in my laundry room in the

2294
02:22:22.081 --> 02:22:24.920
factory.
I got scolded from my wife.
Why are those keys up there?

2295
02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:28.260
They'd been up there for your wife's in the game.
She's said,
get rid of them.

2296
02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:32.040
They're not going to wear them.
They're not welcome.

2297
02:22:32.041 --> 02:22:34.550
You're legitimately not going to wear them.
Legitimately not going to want.

2298
02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:38.340
There's no point to have them.
Yeah,
it's true.
Goodwill.
Yeah.

2299
02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:40.740
Goodwill or even you don't bring it to this,
I don't know,

2300
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:45.770
bring it to your academy and then they can use those as loaner piece.
Exactly.

2301
02:22:45.771 --> 02:22:50.400
Right.
Know,
so and rational these loaner gates too.
That is true.

2302
02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:55.270
Yeah.
And then,
yeah,
in the meantime before people get an origin.
Yeah,

2303
02:22:55.330 --> 02:22:56.720
that makes sense.
Yeah.
But yeah,

2304
02:22:56.850 --> 02:23:01.850
all made in America from the beginnings of the birth of the Geek is their birth

2305
02:23:02.161 --> 02:23:05.880
of Vicki.
Not really.
Not really the will.
The cotton is grown in America.

2306
02:23:05.930 --> 02:23:06.510
How about that?

2307
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:11.510
That's how early on the main in America situation commences,

2308
02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:12.980
um,

2309
02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:17.980
all made in America and by Pete and his team who know about Jujitsu,

2310
02:23:19.531 --> 02:23:22.980
black belt in Jujitsu in the game of Jujitsu from day one.

2311
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.070
So he knows all about and make the connection.
That's why,

2312
02:23:26.071 --> 02:23:29.130
that's why they're the best geese overall.
Right there.
Boom.
That's it.

2313
02:23:29.131 --> 02:23:32.820
They also make rash guards as well.
So [inaudible] no geek,
boom,
key rash guard,

2314
02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:38.100
rash guards,
and you can get all kinds of stuff on there too.
Tee shirts.
Um,

2315
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:42.390
they may have shorts.
Now,
do you ever pair of those shorts yet?
Broad?
No,
I don't.

2316
02:23:42.391 --> 02:23:44.920
I don't either,
but I'm going to get what I'm just,

2317
02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:50.420
I was gonna like send both of them a text group,

2318
02:23:50.461 --> 02:23:55.200
text a group to be like,
Hey,
I'm looking outside the door.
You know what I mean?

2319
02:23:55.201 --> 02:23:58.420
Like,
Oh,
I'm getting other male,
no shorts.
But then again,
the origin,

2320
02:23:58.480 --> 02:23:59.850
the emerging camps coming up,

2321
02:23:59.851 --> 02:24:02.730
I'm sure it's a thing where the boom and actually that makes more sense.

2322
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:07.570
Less packing there.
What I'm saying,
I'm not happy about it.
You know,
I'm,

2323
02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:10.200
I'm with you on that one.
Not happy but some,
yeah.

2324
02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:13.490
Some other stuff than just Jujitsu stuff.
Yes.

2325
02:24:14.170 --> 02:24:18.240
Did you just say it'd be on dance and really the shorts are starting to get into

2326
02:24:18.241 --> 02:24:21.240
like,
cause they're not even,
they're not for training.

2327
02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:24.450
There's just for straight up wearing.
Yeah.
Just for wearing around.

2328
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:28.360
Plus there's supplements on there too.
Uh,

2329
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:33.510
we got joint warfare,
which is good for your joints.
Sure.

2330
02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.890
We got Krill oil,
which is also good for your joints.
Was that the,

2331
02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.350
was that the supplement that pushed you over the edge when you mean over the

2332
02:24:41.351 --> 02:24:45.940
edge that got you to start using software?
That's Krill oil.
Yes.
Okay.

2333
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:50.170
That was like a,
what do you call it?
It was like a gateway supplement.
Anyways,

2334
02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:52.950
what,
I dunno if that in and of itself was the gateway.

2335
02:24:52.951 --> 02:24:57.720
So I think you were essentially the influence gateway,
uh,
entity,

2336
02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:00.090
if you will.
But that was the one where you,

2337
02:25:00.091 --> 02:25:01.560
when you started taking it and you were like,
oh,

2338
02:25:01.561 --> 02:25:04.050
this actually works and so I'm going to continue.

2339
02:25:04.051 --> 02:25:05.490
And then then when I was saying,
you know what,

2340
02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.480
I got something called jungle warfare and then you're like,

2341
02:25:07.481 --> 02:25:10.830
I'm gonna start cracking down so that you got your arm healed up and now you're

2342
02:25:10.831 --> 02:25:11.664
a believer.

2343
02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:16.200
And the thing about both of those things is kid glucosamine Chondroitin is in

2344
02:25:16.201 --> 02:25:18.870
joint warfare,
right?
It has other good stuff.

2345
02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:20.670
But that was kind of human he has in there,

2346
02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:23.770
which is actually as big of a deal as the other two that you just mentioned.

2347
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:26.860
Yeah.
As it turns out,
I didn't know this at the time.
So you're like,
yeah,

2348
02:25:26.861 --> 02:25:28.840
joint warfare,
Krill oil,
all this stuff.

2349
02:25:29.050 --> 02:25:32.390
And these are things that I heard about before and I was like,
cool.
But you know,

2350
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:35.670
hey man,
I don't care.
I don't need to take supplements.
You just,
you know,

2351
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:39.060
eat right and all this stuff.
We wouldn't have multiple tone,

2352
02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:43.450
joint warfare.
We've got discipline,

2353
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:48.510
which is good for just good for mission life mission getting after it.

2354
02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:50.020
Yeah.

2355
02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:55.020
Brian was explaining to me that it helps you a look,

2356
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:58.750
I'm going to get the terminology wrong,
but because I'm doing this off of memory,

2357
02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:01.480
but it's like adaptive gins or something.

2358
02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:05.070
Basically it helps you manage any stress that comes to you look at,

2359
02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:05.913
you see what I'm saying?

2360
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:12.110
Like it helps you manage stress and that goes for like physical and mental

2361
02:26:13.751 --> 02:26:16.120
stress.
So remember when everyone else is telling you?
Yeah,

2362
02:26:16.121 --> 02:26:17.470
like last time with time with Dina,

2363
02:26:17.471 --> 02:26:21.040
would everyone else saying when I took the three scoops I felt like I could just

2364
02:26:21.041 --> 02:26:26.041
deal with stuff I like my patients was in the house,

2365
02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:32.720
the adaptogens were in the house.
So Brian totally explained it.
So I was like,
oh,

2366
02:26:32.721 --> 02:26:35.230
that makes sense.
So what I'm saying,
see that's a little soft.

2367
02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:38.740
I think that that's a little subtle thing that,
you know how it's like,
yeah,

2368
02:26:38.741 --> 02:26:41.830
I can remember where is quicker and like all this stuff,
good man,
good.

2369
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:46.600
And I did have the adaptive,
I'm not saying I'd rather or not right.

2370
02:26:46.601 --> 02:26:49.420
I'm saying that's part that I think anyway,

2371
02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:52.480
we all might kind of disregard.
You know,

2372
02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.470
it's basically the opposite of having,
you know,
when you're like,

2373
02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:59.920
what do you call it when you're irritable,
you know that,
okay,

2374
02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:01.450
so consider when you're irritable.
Not,

2375
02:27:01.451 --> 02:27:03.310
I'm not going to say you're going to behave a certain way.

2376
02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:06.760
Some people do when they're irritable,
they're shorter,
they're shorter temper.

2377
02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:11.740
They,
you know,
when things don't go their way,
I consider that to be a weakness.

2378
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:14.980
Yes.
Okay.
So consider that to be weak.
So consider that.

2379
02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:17.470
Like when I snapped it somewhere,
which I,
which I,

2380
02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:21.400
I like rarely snap someone because I considered,
I don't know,

2381
02:27:21.401 --> 02:27:24.430
when I started thinking that way,
like,
hey,

2382
02:27:24.431 --> 02:27:27.940
just snapping at someone is just when I,
if I snap at you bro,
there's,

2383
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:33.150
you did some really jacked up or maybe you're just super duper irritable in

2384
02:27:34.901 --> 02:27:36.120
general.
I think you were at doe.

2385
02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:39.820
I'm literally sitting here trying to figure out the last time I felt

2386
02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:44.270
legitimately we,
you know what,
it'll be something.
It'll,
you know what,

2387
02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:45.233
you know what bothers me.

2388
02:27:45.730 --> 02:27:50.050
It bothers me if I'm trying to work and people want to talk to me about stuff.

2389
02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:55.620
So this is more of a home life scenario and normally I schedule my situations

2390
02:27:55.691 --> 02:27:59.740
that everyone's asleep or I'm separated,

2391
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:04.840
but sometimes people want to interact and,
and when I'm doing my work,

2392
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:09.260
you know,
and you kind of have with my wife where you know,

2393
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:11.920
you've seen the movie the shining,
right?
Yes sir.
I'll be,

2394
02:28:11.921 --> 02:28:16.490
I'll be sitting there and I'll be working.
I'm like,
when you hear this,

2395
02:28:17.350 --> 02:28:20.200
when you hear that it means I am typing.

2396
02:28:20.350 --> 02:28:25.350
That is my type writer and that means I'm trying to work.

2397
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:29.840
And if you here before king,
they don't,
and she starts laughing.

2398
02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:35.060
So I throw a little Jack Nicholson and she realizes that I'm trying to do what I

2399
02:28:35.721 --> 02:28:40.100
do.
Well,
I will say that that's podcast prep books,

2400
02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:42.830
whatever fully you get down and they dig it.

2401
02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:47.600
But that's not really you snapping though is nothing like on a friendly version

2402
02:28:47.601 --> 02:28:48.460
of saying,
hey,

2403
02:28:48.530 --> 02:28:53.530
it is my way of of let's say,

2404
02:28:55.610 --> 02:29:00.610
projecting my frustration into a good positive humorous thing that releases the

2405
02:29:02.181 --> 02:29:03.710
tension and gets the message across.

2406
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:06.320
Remember earlier today we were talking about getting the message across without

2407
02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.020
doing collateral damage.
If that's what I'm talking about.
Oh,

2408
02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.450
I just throw on a little bit of that here.
This,

2409
02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:16.550
well the actually that's good because men,
let's talk,

2410
02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:17.810
I don't want to deviate too much,

2411
02:29:17.811 --> 02:29:22.370
but do you mean we're talking about completely deviated so far there's not even,

2412
02:29:22.371 --> 02:29:23.420
I don't remember where we came from.

2413
02:29:23.421 --> 02:29:25.430
It has to do with getting the message across,
right?

2414
02:29:25.431 --> 02:29:27.320
You can have the greatest info in the world,

2415
02:29:27.570 --> 02:29:30.770
the most important info in the world,
but if you can't get across,
right?

2416
02:29:30.771 --> 02:29:34.760
So it's like,
yeah man in Pour,
super important potentially.

2417
02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:40.030
But here's the thing about information and what you say and how you say it's

2418
02:29:40.050 --> 02:29:42.150
like all this,
it's good.
It has to land,
you know,

2419
02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:45.530
so you can start throwing out info in it,
but if it doesn't land,

2420
02:29:45.531 --> 02:29:48.940
you might as well not have said nothing.
Be appended.

2421
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:53.630
Whatever you were talking about earlier with the discipline you were talking

2422
02:29:53.631 --> 02:29:55.220
about.
Oh yeah,
that adaptogens.

2423
02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.830
That's a whole nother thing right now we'll go back to the data that you were

2424
02:30:00.831 --> 02:30:04.490
talking about.
You being in all this stuff.
Okay.

2425
02:30:04.570 --> 02:30:07.590
I'll go actually back to the point.
Back to the point.
Okay,
so the adaptogens,

2426
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:11.030
it's the opposite of being irritable.
That's what I felt.

2427
02:30:11.430 --> 02:30:13.830
And I think when we think about like discipline and you know,

2428
02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.350
could neutral bay health,
brain health,

2429
02:30:15.351 --> 02:30:18.950
all this stuff we think about like remembering words.
I mean sharper and quicker,

2430
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:22.310
but we don't think about like the opposite of being irritable.

2431
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:25.820
I don't know if there's,
is there a word for the opposite of irritable?

2432
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:30.080
Because it's not the kind of,
oh like it's just,
okay,
I'm cruising.

2433
02:30:30.081 --> 02:30:34.280
It's not that feeling.
It's more like cruising.
No.

2434
02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:37.220
Speaking of information,

2435
02:30:37.221 --> 02:30:39.850
why don't you give us some information about molex or we can move on.
Okay,

2436
02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:44.810
well take the don't,
don't,
don't slip on the discipline anyway.
Okay.
Okay.
Milk.

2437
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:48.710
Here's mom cause you'll be the opposite of irritable.
That's a good tagline.

2438
02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:51.500
We should use that.
I was sort of irritable.
You have met and it works.

2439
02:30:51.501 --> 02:30:55.580
It worked for me.
Keep in mind when you're irritable,
that's not a good feeling.

2440
02:30:55.970 --> 02:31:00.560
Nope.
Most of us,
if we don't get like you know,
sleep or sometimes,

2441
02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:03.350
well I guess it depends on who you are,
but some people when they get hangry,

2442
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:06.110
that's what that is.
Still it is not a good feeling.

2443
02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:08.480
You feel the opposite of that is a good feeling.
So what I'm saying?

2444
02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:12.680
Check just simple math anywhere.
Milk.
Okay.
Milk.

2445
02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:17.480
If you want some additional protein,
this is a good way to get it.

2446
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:18.560
Can you imagine?

2447
02:31:18.561 --> 02:31:23.280
You remember how he was talking about if he had seen movies while he was in

2448
02:31:23.281 --> 02:31:25.230
prison camp,
you would have tried to break out and go yeah.

2449
02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:30.740
If you were in that situation and you had had Mulkey before,

2450
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:33.630
that would be our,

2451
02:31:33.631 --> 02:31:38.631
well because you'd be thinking about not only how big it is and how good it is.

2452
02:31:39.241 --> 02:31:43.080
How tasty it is.
It's like you're stuck there.
You can't have it.

2453
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:46.050
That happened to me yesterday when I was on my trip.
Oh Dang.

2454
02:31:46.051 --> 02:31:46.800
He didn't bring them up.

2455
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:50.400
I didn't bring Moke and I need to figure that situation out a little bit better,

2456
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:54.420
but because that's just an,
I do.
I do some,

2457
02:31:54.570 --> 02:31:58.770
I've branched out a little bit.
I normally always did two scoops of Mulkin,

2458
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:02.970
big glass of milk.
And now I'm kind of doing little hitters.

2459
02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:10.170
Hitters.
Well there's still,
there's still wonderful scoop.
I haven't gone below.

2460
02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:14.910
I haven't done just like a straight up shot,
but I've been doing little hitters.

2461
02:32:14.911 --> 02:32:19.170
Just one,
just one scoop.
And what's the philosophy behind the,
you know,
like what,

2462
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:20.240
you know,
why?
Cause I,

2463
02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:24.300
I'm so full when I get done with Moke like this morning when I got home,

2464
02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:28.770
since I didn't have more on my trip,
when I got home,
before I started recording,

2465
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:30.930
before I started prep prepping for the podcast,

2466
02:32:31.530 --> 02:32:35.760
I had a little hitter of milk,
which I,
by the way,
I took a hitter,

2467
02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:38.550
that whole concept of using the word hitter from the field Vaughn.

2468
02:32:40.530 --> 02:32:44.520
So,
yeah,
I think he uses it for everything.

2469
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:48.210
Like things can just be a hit or I have a little hit or what little one scoop

2470
02:32:48.211 --> 02:32:52.740
hit her head out.
That's what I hear.
Boom.
There you go.

2471
02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:57.120
No,
I don't want to say that.
The odd.
So it's the opposite.

2472
02:32:57.121 --> 02:33:00.060
There's something you have to be careful of.
If you think in the future,

2473
02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:04.530
you may be completely in a situation where you can't have milk.

2474
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:06.360
Maybe it's better to never have it.

2475
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:09.950
So you're going to have to always think about it forever.
You can't,

2476
02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:15.050
you don't know.
It's just,
yeah,

2477
02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:19.440
I'm going the opposite direction.
I'm going,
I'm making them bigger.
Just bigger.

2478
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:23.160
Like last.
It was weird.
So I went to sleep kind of early,

2479
02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.610
which is like I'm not,
you know,

2480
02:33:26.611 --> 02:33:29.850
some people that they prefer to go sleep hungry cause it's like,
you know,

2481
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:33.990
whatever their philosophy is,
I'd prefer not to go sleep hungry.
So I ate,

2482
02:33:33.991 --> 02:33:36.030
I ate dinner and then I stay up a couple of hours and I'm like,

2483
02:33:36.031 --> 02:33:40.410
oh I either eat right now when I'm not really hungry or risk being hungry at

2484
02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:43.880
some point.
Very soon.
So what I did do well in prison,

2485
02:33:45.930 --> 02:33:50.490
that would not work out for me for sure.
And the less I take the milk,

2486
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:54.030
three scoops.
Oh God.
Peanut butter,
man.
I don't know why.

2487
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:59.050
I do know what to peanut butter scope to the men total double dip.

2488
02:33:59.341 --> 02:34:03.330
You know you're going crazy.
Yeah.
The thing is,

2489
02:34:03.331 --> 02:34:05.820
I know how like the sound of that test,

2490
02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:08.580
but it's good for DJ stuff sounds.

2491
02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.050
It's going to sound good nonetheless.

2492
02:34:13.051 --> 02:34:16.710
But I've been doing it and it's the kind where it's like what?

2493
02:34:16.711 --> 02:34:20.090
I already know how it tastes.
Like why would I not even do that?
Okay.

2494
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:24.070
I've said it and you actually,
I said don't cross the streams like Ghostbusters.

2495
02:34:24.071 --> 02:34:25.740
And you said that's how they won.
Yes.

2496
02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:28.840
So maybe you got across the peanut butter and the men,
I don't know.

2497
02:34:29.650 --> 02:34:31.690
I don't even think I'm going to try it.
That's up to you.

2498
02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:33.910
And maybe it's one of those things that if I try it then I'll have to carry

2499
02:34:33.911 --> 02:34:38.170
around both types all the time for the rest of my life.
So you pour,

2500
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:42.010
you mix them up.
Oh Man.
Right.
That's up to you anyway.
Hey Mark,

2501
02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:46.090
how you want a Moke?
Moke up bulk up.
That's good.
Right?

2502
02:34:46.091 --> 02:34:50.860
That rhymes uncle.
Anyways,
so,
so like,
so I hit it.
It's a big,
you know,

2503
02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:55.420
you got to hit her.
I hit it.
So technically it maybe it was a hit her,

2504
02:34:55.421 --> 02:34:56.320
but it was huge.

2505
02:34:56.590 --> 02:35:01.590
Huge theater or you got one of those big hills pounded it.

2506
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:03.220
No problem.
I'll just smoke.

2507
02:35:03.221 --> 02:35:05.350
Is going to get consumed at the immersion camp you think?

2508
02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:10.510
I think it's going to be well considered myself alone.
I mean man,

2509
02:35:10.511 --> 02:35:14.110
I'm on the train big time.
So that's every day.
Yeah.

2510
02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.300
How many scoops while we're at emerging camp,

2511
02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:20.130
how many scoops of Moke will you consumed per day?
Well,
pretty,

2512
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:23.690
I dunno,
I just say six minimum because as we can,

2513
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:27.520
well you figured I'm just saying crazy.
Well you know,

2514
02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.360
I as much as just as good on six two scoops for one,
two,

2515
02:35:31.361 --> 02:35:35.530
three I could see maybe doing for,
for me maybe two in the morning,

2516
02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:36.880
maybe two in the afternoon,
maybe.

2517
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:42.150
Maybe have a one more hit her in the middle somewhere.
Nonetheless,

2518
02:35:42.250 --> 02:35:45.530
that small,
good,
good protein and it tastes good.
See that's the thing.
Well,

2519
02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:47.440
if he'd do it as like someone who was texting me,

2520
02:35:47.441 --> 02:35:48.940
Oh can you do it as a meal replacement?

2521
02:35:49.210 --> 02:35:52.540
Can you do [inaudible] and the day before I got that text,

2522
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:57.550
Pete was saying,
I said something,
I forget what it was.
And he said,
ha ha yeah,

2523
02:35:57.551 --> 02:36:00.170
you can use it as a meal replacement breakfast.

2524
02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:07.220
I think that's one of the reasons why I was Dixie beat.
Um,
and then so yeah,

2525
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:09.050
so when you do it as a meal replacement,

2526
02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:14.460
it's like it's not the meal,
it's like a dessert as a meal replacement.

2527
02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.630
Both.
See what I'm saying?
It's just like the treat you look forward to them.

2528
02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:23.080
Unless it's good to get all this@originmain.com this,

2529
02:36:23.961 --> 02:36:26.580
we can get all this stuff.
Cool website.
Sure.

2530
02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.850
I would talk about the emerging camp,
but it sold out.
Here's the thing too.

2531
02:36:31.850 --> 02:36:36.500
I was talking to Andy Berke,
not Dave Burke.

2532
02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:41.450
Good deal Dave.
Good deal Dave.
Not good deal.
David.
Andy Berke.

2533
02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:45.650
No relation.
And we were talking about like,
okay,
so it's one thing to be like,

2534
02:36:45.651 --> 02:36:47.740
hey,
we're getting kind of full,
we'll just get more mats.

2535
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:51.650
But then we're now we're talking about the camp being full so it's we're,

2536
02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:53.230
we're full,
we're filled up,

2537
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:58.270
can't do it unless maybe like you bring your tent or something like that maybe

2538
02:36:58.890 --> 02:37:03.050
nonetheless sold out.
So yeah,
maybe next year.
There it is.
All origin stuff.

2539
02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.490
Good way to support as well.
Shifting gears,
Jocko was a store,

2540
02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.060
it's called Jocko store.
So you go to Jocko store.com.

2541
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:14.480
This is where you can get shirts,

2542
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:20.330
hoodies,
tank tops,
some rash guards,
more rash guards.

2543
02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:23.020
Um,
good way to support it.
Like I said,
this is where a,

2544
02:37:23.021 --> 02:37:25.460
if you want to represent discipline equals freedom.

2545
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:30.380
Just the general concepts and how should I say,
uh,

2546
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:35.660
philosophies of the game.
Overall def core.
Yeah,

2547
02:37:37.530 --> 02:37:40.970
just overall.
Just overall if you want to represent,
that's where you get it.

2548
02:37:40.971 --> 02:37:44.870
Jocko.
store.com got some new designs on there.
I was,

2549
02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:48.440
I was going to send out like an email to everybody that did sign up for the

2550
02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:51.440
email.
This,
it's been a few months,
so I might as well,

2551
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:54.890
so I'll probably send out something just to indicate,
hey,
we got some new stuff.

2552
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:58.970
Boom.
There it is.
Yeah.
If boom.
Cause a lot of times it's like,

2553
02:37:58.971 --> 02:38:01.820
it's not like people are just going to be going chocolate store every day.
Boom,

2554
02:38:01.821 --> 02:38:02.890
boom,
boom.
You know?
No,

2555
02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:06.410
there's no reason to do that when you don't put new stuff up very often.

2556
02:38:06.411 --> 02:38:10.800
So how would they do that?
We'll just say this.
No,
uh,

2557
02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.280
uh,
strong reason to do it.
So Hey,
I'll send the email.
Boom,

2558
02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.900
let them know.
Anyway.
Yeah.
TACO store.com.
Good way to support.

2559
02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:25.910
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
I know,
seems obvious,

2560
02:38:25.911 --> 02:38:29.350
but I think it is obvious it's obvious guys,

2561
02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:33.760
but just to let you know if they're listening right now.
Yeah,

2562
02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:39.080
they subscribed.
Yeah,
that's true.
And when you're subscribing to that,

2563
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:41.210
also there's a warrior kid podcast.

2564
02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:46.690
So if you got kids between the ages of four and 44,

2565
02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:53.210
they can get something out of the warrior can podcast and you can subscribe to

2566
02:38:53.211 --> 02:38:57.600
that.
You can also subscribe to Youtube.
And we deal,

2567
02:38:57.710 --> 02:39:00.770
we're discussing today making some,
some these are,

2568
02:39:00.771 --> 02:39:02.960
these are not even these are in different situation.

2569
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:05.240
What I briefed you on today about what we're going to make.

2570
02:39:05.241 --> 02:39:08.720
Those are a different thing.
There are a different thing.
There are different,

2571
02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:12.300
they're not enhanced videos.
They're not excerpts.

2572
02:39:12.610 --> 02:39:15.350
Different specific thing for specific

2573
02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:21.860
lessons learned specifically topics that I've discovered that I need to cover

2574
02:39:21.861 --> 02:39:25.160
and I think the best way to cover them is through the video medium.

2575
02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:26.540
So we're gonna do that.

2576
02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:30.620
And there will be specific to youtube actually they will be very specific to

2577
02:39:30.621 --> 02:39:34.930
youtube because they're both involve graphics.
Uh,
you know,

2578
02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.230
they they involve,
yeah,
me explaining something.

2579
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:42.680
Utilizing graphics.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the right word.

2580
02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:47.230
Graphics for what I was doing charts,
charts,
diagrams,

2581
02:39:47.231 --> 02:39:51.770
dive if you will.
But this is verse.
Yeah.
And this is,

2582
02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:54.330
it was funny.
It's like you just say it like,
it's like,
yeah,

2583
02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:57.470
it'll be a cool addition to the thing.
This like what you,

2584
02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:02.500
what we talked about will you explained is if I would've known this,

2585
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:07.340
it's almost like the secret to life

2586
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.660
is not joke.
No,
I know.
I know it's so we'll put it to,

2587
02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:15.780
we get this,
this means we're gonna have to put it together.
Maybe we could do,

2588
02:40:15.781 --> 02:40:18.690
could we do it while we're in Maine or something?
Yeah,
it does knock it.

2589
02:40:18.691 --> 02:40:20.220
I don't want to,
I don't want to get crazy with it.

2590
02:40:20.250 --> 02:40:22.200
I just want to put the word out there.
I need a dry erase board.

2591
02:40:22.201 --> 02:40:23.011
I need to explain it.

2592
02:40:23.011 --> 02:40:26.100
I'll think through it a couple times and then I'll put it out there because it

2593
02:40:26.101 --> 02:40:30.860
will help.
It will definitely help fully both those,

2594
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:31.860
both those topics.

2595
02:40:31.861 --> 02:40:35.190
There's two topics that need to come out and I'll discuss both of them.

2596
02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.930
We'll put it on the youtube and then,
and then people can get them.

2597
02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:42.840
So subscribe to the Youtube Channel for that it the channel's called Jocko

2598
02:40:42.841 --> 02:40:44.970
podcast.
And

2599
02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.520
also when I said subscribe,
that's to the audio.
So you do this video.

2600
02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:52.110
The audio is like iTunes,
stitcher,

2601
02:40:52.111 --> 02:40:55.440
Google play or wherever you listen to podcasts.
But I know it seems obvious,

2602
02:40:55.441 --> 02:40:57.180
but it might smell it.
Throw it in there just in case.

2603
02:40:57.210 --> 02:41:01.730
Maybe someone's new to podcasting in general.
Okay.
You just never know.

2604
02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:04.010
I'm just going to be quiet.
It's just a fun one.

2605
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:08.790
Also also on it,

2606
02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:13.230
so on it.com/jocko by the way,
you get 10% off of what?

2607
02:41:13.470 --> 02:41:13.921
What do we get?

2608
02:41:13.921 --> 02:41:18.921
10 is so where if you want to vary up your workout,

2609
02:41:19.650 --> 02:41:22.590
I know I said it before,
but very will be work out kettlebell stuff,

2610
02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:25.620
a battle ropes stuff.
I got some rings.

2611
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:30.520
Are you bringing your rings to me?
Yes.
Yeah,
me too.
I'm bringing mine.
Cool.

2612
02:41:30.810 --> 02:41:33.960
This is where you get it on.com/jocko really good stuff on there.

2613
02:41:33.961 --> 02:41:37.860
Good Info as well.
So if you're new to certain types of workouts,

2614
02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:40.020
get the info first.
You can enter it,

2615
02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:44.310
you can enter into that workout situation educated,

2616
02:41:44.490 --> 02:41:49.200
keep yourself safe and you know,
boom.
Get the results without all that injuries.

2617
02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:53.430
You see what I'm saying?
Also,
we made a spoken word,

2618
02:41:53.610 --> 02:41:55.830
spoken word album,

2619
02:41:55.950 --> 02:42:00.660
album with tracks and it's,
it's me actually.
We made it,

2620
02:42:00.661 --> 02:42:05.661
but it's me talking and it's me just telling you not to be weak today,

2621
02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:07.560
but to go do and what you're supposed to do.

2622
02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:10.020
And we're going to make another one of those working on it now,

2623
02:42:10.050 --> 02:42:14.670
gathering the topics.
So if you have topics for psychological warfare,

2624
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:20.870
then you can put them on the social media thing and I'll get them,

2625
02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:25.440
we will assess if they are important topics or if they're important topics.

2626
02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:29.010
Either way.
Yes,
we'll figure it out.
So basically if you're struggling,

2627
02:42:29.011 --> 02:42:31.920
not struggling,
but yeah,
if you're like kind of struggling something,

2628
02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:36.000
you'd have moments of weakness.
What is it?
What scenario are you in?

2629
02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:36.930
What are you week with?

2630
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:42.470
My sister used to say a white rice is like her weakness.

2631
02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.920
Oh,
assume saying white.
Right.

2632
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:48.060
So I gotta make a psychological warfare that says the white rice that you're

2633
02:42:48.061 --> 02:42:49.830
looking at right now,
put it today.

2634
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:53.790
If she was going to get 100% sugar once it enters your stomach,

2635
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:57.810
walk away,
walk away from the white rice.

2636
02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.310
Now actually that's why that kind of would,
cause she said late at night,

2637
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:06.840
this was long time ago by the way.
She said late at night.
So yeah,

2638
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:10.580
she were to play it and you're like,
walk away,
swipe.
She'd be walking away.

2639
02:43:10.930 --> 02:43:13.710
That's all it is.
Fee.
That's how it starts.
Psychological warfare.

2640
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:17.020
It's available on Itunes,
Google play,
MP,
three platforms,
blah,
blah,
blah.

2641
02:43:17.530 --> 02:43:22.530
Jocko white tea that you can get in a can or you can get it in a tea bag and you

2642
02:43:23.801 --> 02:43:27.340
can get both those from Amazon.
That's where they're at.

2643
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:32.760
So if you want to be able to deadlift no less than 8,000 pounds,

2644
02:43:34.770 --> 02:43:37.570
100% guaranteed,
all you have to do is drink Jocko white tea.

2645
02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:40.270
You don't have to work out even,
you don't even have to lift weights.

2646
02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:43.240
You just drink it and then you can deadlift 8,000 pounds.
Don't worry.

2647
02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:48.580
It's no problem.
Uh,
books.
I wrote some books,

2648
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:52.030
wrote some kid books,
actually where the word kit,

2649
02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:56.530
that's the first one and way of the w is the second.
Okay.

2650
02:43:56.531 --> 02:43:59.960
The second one is Mark's mission,
but is it called the way of the word your kid?

2651
02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:03.520
I'm not sure.
Let's look at the cover.

2652
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:06.190
It does say way of the warrior kid marks mission.

2653
02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:08.390
So existence where the warrior King Mark's mission.
Yeah.

2654
02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:13.420
I think I should put a big one and two on them.
So that it's more clear.

2655
02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:17.620
The next book,
the next one that comes out,
April say three on it.
Yeah,
good idea.

2656
02:44:17.621 --> 02:44:22.150
Because they are kind of essentially the whole story and even the lessons by the

2657
02:44:22.151 --> 02:44:25.890
way,
are they build a lodge for sure.
See what I'm saying?
So like the first one,

2658
02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:30.790
the lessons and the struggles and the problems with whatever our nine year old

2659
02:44:30.791 --> 02:44:33.910
problems right now.
I mean give or take,
you know,
there like a certain age,

2660
02:44:33.911 --> 02:44:36.330
10 year old times problems the next and then they,

2661
02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:40.060
they get a little bit more sophisticated,
you know,
excellent.
More and more.

2662
02:44:40.061 --> 02:44:43.330
So it's kind of chronological and not to mention the story as well.

2663
02:44:43.331 --> 02:44:45.970
So it makes make sense.
You don't want to do it that way.

2664
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:51.030
And that's if you want your kids to actually get after it straight up.

2665
02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:57.340
I get the best feedback from those books.
Yeah.
So yeah,
I could see why.

2666
02:44:57.341 --> 02:45:00.780
I mean shoot,
I'm one of those people who's giving you the feedback very well.

2667
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:05.860
Very well done.
Very well done.
Is it fair as a book,
what do you,

2668
02:45:05.890 --> 02:45:09.760
what do you call critic?
Critic?
Who has

2669
02:45:11.410 --> 02:45:14.200
read a book before,
you know,
hey,
it's good.
It's a good book.

2670
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:18.430
I have it as like just an a running theme.
Like I just keep reading the book.

2671
02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:20.770
It just keep reading both of them.
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

2672
02:45:20.771 --> 02:45:23.470
That's how so it becomes the ethos.
That's why your daughter,

2673
02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:27.220
which I primarily see your daughter more.
She's like,
you know,
she gets after it.

2674
02:45:27.470 --> 02:45:30.850
She uh,
she does get it after.
It does.
It's constant work.

2675
02:45:30.851 --> 02:45:33.560
Don't matter of course is big health,
huge help.

2676
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:38.860
Also discipline equals freedom field manual.

2677
02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:44.880
Who would've thought that that book would be popular?

2678
02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:47.950
That people would be into it.
That's what's cool.
Yeah.

2679
02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:52.930
You wouldn't think most people don't think there's people that really want to

2680
02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:57.210
get after it.
Yeah.
And they do and they don't know how.
Yeah.

2681
02:45:57.220 --> 02:45:58.990
When you think about it,
it's gonna start to,

2682
02:45:58.991 --> 02:46:02.980
it kind of makes sense really when you just like,
okay,
so field manual,
right.

2683
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:04.810
You have a manual,
a manual.

2684
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:07.870
Cause that's a lot of times that's why people don't do stuff because I don't

2685
02:46:07.890 --> 02:46:10.160
know how to do it.
They don't know.
And if I do certain

2686
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:12.190
<v 0>then I've got to look into it.
Then I keep looking into,</v>

2687
02:46:12.210 --> 02:46:15.290
I wish they just had a manual.
I wish I had a manual for life.
How about that?

2688
02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:18.290
I wish I had a manual for parenting,
which had a manual for life.

2689
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:21.470
I had always had a manual for,
you know,
a bunch of other stuff,

2690
02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:25.420
but if you want like one kid after it,
whatever you want to call it,
right?

2691
02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:26.353
You've got a manual,

2692
02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.140
you want to stay disciplined and you want freedom directly from the discipline.

2693
02:46:30.170 --> 02:46:34.310
Boom.
You got a manual right here.
There you go.
Also,
extreme ownership,

2694
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:37.520
which is the first book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.

2695
02:46:37.610 --> 02:46:42.610
It takes the combat principles that we learned on the battlefield and teaches

2696
02:46:42.861 --> 02:46:47.000
you and shows you how you can apply them to your business and your life and then

2697
02:46:47.001 --> 02:46:50.120
we got a follow on book to that coming out September 25th the dichotomy of

2698
02:46:50.121 --> 02:46:50.954
leadership,

2699
02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:56.080
you can preorder it right now so that way the publishers who are pessimistic,

2700
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:58.760
that's,
that's how publishers are.

2701
02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:02.720
They're just pessimistic because for them they don't really care.
If you get,

2702
02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:04.790
if you don't get the book right when it comes out,

2703
02:47:04.791 --> 02:47:07.770
they're going to make their their money either way.
But when you,

2704
02:47:07.771 --> 02:47:11.630
when the book comes out and you order it the day it comes out and then it takes

2705
02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:13.640
nine days to get to you cause you,

2706
02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:15.830
cause they had to reprint them cause they ran out.

2707
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:20.370
But I guess I shouldn't say because they're conservative,
they're constant.

2708
02:47:20.410 --> 02:47:22.070
There'd been all conservative knowing him,

2709
02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:24.860
we're just not sure and we don't want to spend the money on money on storage if

2710
02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:27.060
these things and then you're going to have to wait to get your copy.

2711
02:47:27.061 --> 02:47:27.894
Just don't do that.

2712
02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:31.970
You can preorder it and Lafe and I just did a podcast on what it's about.

2713
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:34.820
That's podcast number one 38 if you haven't heard that one yet.

2714
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:37.340
Also speaking of life,
speaking of me,

2715
02:47:37.341 --> 02:47:42.341
we have a leadership consulting company and is not just me and life.

We solve problems through leadership.
Also,

2719
02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:59.000
if you want one of us to just come speak at your company,

2720
02:47:59.330 --> 02:48:03.860
don't call a speaking agency.
Yeah,
you don't need to call a speaking agency.

2721
02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:07.910
You don't need to call cool speakers.com no,

2722
02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:13.180
go to echelon front.com and and get the information there.

2723
02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.510

2726
02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:27.470
You like to get in the game info national on front.com if you want to just email

2727
02:48:27.471 --> 02:48:30.290
straight.
Also the muster zero zero six San Francisco,

2728
02:48:30.291 --> 02:48:34.040
California 17th and 18th it's probably going to sell out pretty soon.

2729
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:37.970
The registration for that is it extreme ownership.com and also there's

2730
02:48:37.971 --> 02:48:42.971
registration for the roll call roll call zero zero one which is for current

2731

firefighters,

2732
02:48:47.901 --> 02:48:49.430
paramedics,
other first responders.

2733
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:54.290
We put together the roll call because you lead in dynamic situations.

2734
02:48:54.291 --> 02:48:55.700
We want to do something a little bit cheaper,

2735
02:48:55.701 --> 02:48:58.760
a little bit shorter so you could get to it.
It's September 21st Dallas,

2736
02:48:58.761 --> 02:49:02.120
Texas and come on down to that.

2737
02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:05.560
Finally we have GF,

nation from threats around the world.

02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:20.610

And thanks to everyone for listening and supporting.

2758
02:50:37.231 --> 02:50:42.231
And I know sometimes it can be hard to listen to stories from atrocities like

2759
02:50:42.691 --> 02:50:45.180
the Bataan death march.
I know that,

2760
02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:48.720
but in listening,

2761
02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:51.133
<v 2>remember,</v>

2762
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:56.180
<v 0>remember that evil does exist.</v>

2763
02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:03.160
Remember those that died standing up against that evil.

2764
02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:10.300
And remember that even in the most wretched times when you face darkness

2765
02:51:13.341 --> 02:51:17.300
yourself,
no matter how bad things get,
remember,

2766
02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:23.270
remember not to stop.
Remember not to pause.

2767
02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:25.430
Remember not to hesitate.

2768
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:29.480
Remember to put one foot in front of the other.

2769
02:51:29.690 --> 02:51:32.150
Take that first step

2770
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:35.170
<v 2>and start walking.</v>

2771
02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:41.630
<v 0>And until next time,
this is echo and Jocko</v>

2772
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:43.070
<v 2>out.</v>
