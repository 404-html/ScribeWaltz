00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.470
This is Jocko podcast number 50 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.920
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.180
to be
or not to be

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.073
<v 1>okay.</v>

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.110
<v 0>That is probably the most famous of all of Shakespeare's lines.</v>

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.840
And in fact it's so famous that it's often unfortunately used as a punchline,

7
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.720
uses a joke

8
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.340
to be or not to be.

9
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.270
It becomes easy to forget.

10
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 0>What Shakespeare is actually talking about.</v>

12
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.030
He's talking about death

13
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
and more specifically in this case he's talking about suicide

14
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.540
and Prince Hamlet,

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200
the character that delivers that famous line who's often called insane,

16
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.060
but who himself says,

17
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.260
I am essentially not in madness,

18
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.260
but mad in craft.

19
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.410
Meaning he is playing the role of insanity to further his own objectives.

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.260
But not everybody even agrees on that point.

21
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.220
But here's what hamlet does say

22
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.070
to be or not to be.
That is the question.

23
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.210
<v 0>Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous</v>

25
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:00.704
fortune.

26
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.630
In other words he's talking about is it worth it to suffer through the problems

27
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.671
we have in life and he goes on or to take arms against a sea of troubles.

28
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
And by opposing
end them.

29
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.140
Meaning should we,
should we fight against the pain of life,

30
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.790
this sea of troubles.
And in that fight,

31
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.650
should we choose death,

32
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.380
which is the only alternative to life.

33
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.920
And he goes on

34
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.960
to die to sleep no more

35
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.900
and bias sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that

36
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.730
flesh is heir to.

37
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.650
So he's saying that death lets you escape all these hardships of life in these

38
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.280
thousand natural shocks.

39
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.270
And he finishes it out.
Tizard consummation,
devout B,

40
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.940
two B wished for to die

41
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.143
<v 1>to sleep.</v>

42
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.890
<v 0>He's saying that that is what we should wish for</v>

43
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.223
<v 1>to die.</v>

44
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.090
<v 0>And that is this most famous</v>

45
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.400
soliloquy is about killing yourself.
It's about,

46
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.610
it's about suicide.

47
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.070
Now we have a guest on today,

48
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360
and this is a guest who I've come to know since I sort of debuted in the world.

49
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:14.871
And in fact this guest happens to be the person that actually debuted me to the

50
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.450
world that brought me into the world.

51
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.630
His name is Tim Ferriss.

52
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.590
And in September of 2015 he interviewed me on his podcast just prior to the

53
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:35.820
release of my book,
extreme owners.
Now at the time,

54
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.940
I was certainly a a Tim Ferriss listener.

55
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.960
I'd read the four hour work week.
I listened to a bunch of his podcasts,

56
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:48.740
but I hadn't listened to all of them in.
And I think I had

57
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.100
kind of the broad view
that most people have of Tim,

58
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.250
the the Human Guinea pig,
the investor,
the author,

59
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.800
just,
you know,
Mister Smart,
successful,

60
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:08.801
healthy guy who's out there enjoying the fruits of life.

61
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.563
And,

62
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640
and with all that stuff in my mind there I was in the first ever interview I had

63
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:21.650
ever actually done with anybody ever.

64
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.900
And it's a setup.
The setup is,

65
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.340
it's an interesting setup going into this for me,
right?
We're all alone.

66
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.960
I don't know,
Tim am not the most open person in the first place.
I don't know,

67
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:36.500
Tim,

68
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.480
we meet two hours before now we're in his house alone at a table and the

69
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:45.620
interview starts going kind of Jocko wish pretty quickly and I start going a

70
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:46.970
little bit heavy on some stuff.

71
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.050
<v 0>And at one point Tim asked me about books that I've read and it brought up about</v>

73
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.670
face and,

74
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.470
and then I brought up Cormac McCarthy blood Meridian,

75
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.230
and I described how I liked that book because it captured

76
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.210
the darkness and not just the darkness of the world,

77
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:19.211
but the dark nature of human beings in the world.

78
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.370
And Tim,
after I describe that darkness,

79
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.990
you said something along the lines of like,

80
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.520
Hey Jocko,
I struggle with this.

81
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.430
How much should I voluntarily expose myself to darkness?

82
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
Because I've had my own ups and downs that I contend with [inaudible].

83
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.490
And then he kind of took that question from there and from that personal level,

84
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.020
and he really quickly transferred to into something that was more about the

85
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:01.790
world and about humanity in general.
But the initial question

86
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.310
that Tim started to ask,
it wasn't about the world

87
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.960
and it wasn't about humanity in general.

88
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.270
The question that Tim was asking was about Tim

89
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.120
and I didn't catch that during the interview.
All right?

90
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.950
It went right over my head.
But when I listened to the interview,

91
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.810
I caught it and I heard

92
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.610
and I heard that beneath this guy,

93
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:36.870
that we all see this happy go lucky exterior,

94
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.700
kind of a solid image of mental and physical and spiritual strength.

95
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.540
There was some darkness in there

96
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.820
and Tim and I were going back and forth a few weeks ago and he said something to

97
00:07:58.501 --> 00:07:59.490
me,
you know,

98
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.510
I'm not sure if I'm aligned with the types of guests you normally have on your

99
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:04.344
podcast.

100
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.390
And thinking back instantly to that moment,

101
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.640
I said,
oh no,
Tim,
you,
you definitely are.

102
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.860
Because you
are a person,

103
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.730
you're a human.
And this is a podcast about human nature.

104
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.910
And despite all the success you've had,

105
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.940
you've had some challenges in your life.

106
00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:33.480
You've had some dark times and you still do.
And we all do.

107
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.070
And people ask me

108
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.530
about suicide.
I mean,

109
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.070
most of the time at some indirect messaging or some messaging through Facebook,

110
00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:51.210
but people will,
will ask me about suicide,
whether they're having those thoughts.

111
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.690
And I haven't really addressed it directly

112
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.090
because even though it's,

113
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.150
it's suicide has definitely impacted my life directly

114
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.203
in some

115
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.070
awful and horrible ways that I'll never forget,

116
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.383
<v 1>but</v>

117
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.640
<v 0>I don't have that same</v>

118
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.820
level of knowledge.

119
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
<v 1>So</v>

120
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.810
<v 0>today we do have that level of knowledge and</v>

121
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.880
<v 1>we're going to dive into it.
So</v>

122
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.280
<v 0>without further ado,
Mr Tim Ferriss,</v>

123
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.570
welcome to the show.
And thank you for coming on.
Thanks for having me on.

124
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.430
Now I don't even want to play around here.
I want to,
I want to get right in.

125
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:58.970
Don't want to get this hard stuff done.
I want to talk about this,

126
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.240
this book that you,
you just put out.
It's called tools of titans.

127
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.520
And in this book,
and I just got done telling you this,
you know,
I,

128
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.180
I looked and found the blog posts that you had originally written that's named a

129
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:16.100
very Tim Ferriss name.
In my opinion,
it's,

130
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.370
it's some practical thoughts on suicide,
right?

131
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:23.480
Only Tim would think about practical thoughts on suicide.
So,

132
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.670
and you sent me the book and I had found that blog past post and I'd read it,

133
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.170
but when you sent me the book,

134
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.980
I saw that you had put it in the book and I think that was awesome for you to do

135
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.160
that,
to put it in this book so that people have access to it.

136
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.910
So I want to get into this piece of it right now from the book and here we go.

137
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.380
Some practical thoughts on suicide.

138
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.450
In this chapter I'm going to talk about suicide and why I'm still on this

139
00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:57.600
planet.
It might seem dark,

140
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.260
but the objective is to give hope and tools to those who need them.

141
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.590
It is a much larger number than you might imagine.

142
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.630
<v 0>I kept the following story secret from my family,
girlfriends and claw.</v>

144
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.250
I closest friends for years recently,
however,

145
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.410
I hadn't experienced that shook me,

146
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.370
woke me up and I decided that it was time to share everything.

147
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.840
So despite the shame,

148
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:28.841
I might feel the fear that is making my palm sweat as I type this.

149
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.200
Allow me to get started.
Here we go.
So you had some,

150
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.560
you had some series hesitation on putting this out there in the first place.

151
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.860
I did it sat in drafts for between six and nine months with fits and starts

152
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.950
because I had a lot of doubt about my motivations for putting it out the good

153
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.440
that it might do,

154
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.080
the bad that it could indirectly that I couldn't foresee unforeseen consequences

155
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.460
and uh,
just the embarrassment and also the fear of how my family would respond.

156
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.080
There was a lot,

157
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.340
there are a lot of factors that kept it in my drafts folder for very long time.

158
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.690
And in this story that you tell here is,

159
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.050
is the story of what made you finally decide to,

160
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.540
to talk about it in the public forum and it,

161
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.890
what happened was a guy came up to you and said,
you would end up at an event,

162
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.610
a guy comes up to you and says,
Hey,
can you,
can you sign this for my brother?

163
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.180
It would mean a lot to him.
And you're,
you know,
you give them the hey,
no problem.

164
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.360
You're kind of notice that there's something odd about the way the guy's acting.

165
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.540
But you signed the book and a little while later as you leaving he comes up and

166
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:45.640
he says,
you know,
I got to talk to you and you say,
hey,
got to leave,

167
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.391
but what he got,

168
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:51.391
let's go walk with me and you find out that this guy's younger brother who you

169
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:58.981
had just signed the book for had recently killed himself at the age of 22

170
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.090
and this guy told you,
people listened to you,

171
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.403
Tim,

172
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.090
have you ever thought about talking about these things about suicide or

173
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.030
depression?
You might be able to save someone

174
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.440
and then you say,
here in the book,
I didn't know what to say.

175
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.750
I also didn't have an excuse.
Unbeknownst to him,

176
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.720
I had every reason to talk about suicide.

177
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.460
Some of my closest high school friends killed themselves.

178
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.580
Some of my closest college friends killed themselves

179
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.840
and I almost killed myself.

180
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.570
And you held that in for a long time.
Long thin.
There you are,

181
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:59.550
a public figure and you hadn't,
you had never talked about this.
Now,

182
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.530
as I said for me,

183
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.920
I certainly have brushed up against suicide starting with

184
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.890
my best friend when I was a kid,

185
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.840
a kid named Jeff and I had joined the navy and I was in seal training and I got

186
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.350
wait until we had kind of grown apart.
And uh,

187
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.040
I talked about this when I was on your podcast,
you know,
I grew up with in,

188
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.100
in our rural area in New England and there was a lot of hippies and just kids,

189
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:36.000
you know,
dead heads and whatnot.
And I didn't go in that direction.

190
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.960
But my really good friend did and he ended up getting heavily involved in drugs

191
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.990
and booze and everything else.

192
00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:45.120
And he got involved with a girl and when they broke up,

193
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.910
be killed himself in a horrible way that I'm not even gonna talk about.

194
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.960
But I got word of it.

195
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:57.890
I was going through seal training and I get word that this kid,
you know,

196
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.450
that I was such good friends with,
killed himself.

197
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.750
And then on top of that,
now we go 1993

198
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.480
and again,
one of my best friends in the seal teams,

199
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.710
absolute stud of a individual of a human being,

200
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.090
but incredible athlete quarterback at the Naval Academy by the way,

201
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.460
record holder at the naval academy.
Just a hilarious guy,

202
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.020
leader of men,
just incredible human being

203
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.700
named Alton lead Grizzard.

204
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.660
He got murdered along with a female naval officer named Carrie O'neil.

205
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.510
They got murdered,

206
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.630
both of them by another navy officer who also went to the naval academy who then

207
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:59.170
killed himself.
So murder suicide.

208
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.973
<v 2>And</v>

209
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.560
<v 0>I'll tell you what,
anybody that knew Griz,</v>

210
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.460
I mean this was just devastating,
devastating.

211
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.610
Just damn near broke my heart.

212
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.910
And then most recently,

213
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.023
<v 2>yeah,</v>

214
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.040
<v 0>in December of 2012</v>

215
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.280
another seal that I knew

216
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.720
who was the commander of the seals in Afghanistan,

217
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.800
the commander of all the seals in Afghanistan on deployment in Afghanistan,

218
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.180
goes to a meeting,
gets done with a meeting,
goes to his room,

219
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.670
shoots himself in the head,
kills himself.
No,
no suicide note,

220
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.480
no strange behavior,
no indicators,
nothing.

221
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.490
And like I said,

222
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:00.350
this guy was in my sister pulled through and it's the whole team too.

223
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.790
I mean just a great guy,
respected,
see your

224
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.940
<v 2>and boom
gone.</v>

225
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.710
<v 0>And I guess that's why I,
I,</v>

226
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.210
I feel strongly about wanting to bring you on in and talk to you about this.

227
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:23.980
Cause I know you felt it personally.
You're talking about it and I,

228
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:26.530
but personally I actually have never wanted to go myself before.

229
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

230
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.250
<v 0>Now I will say there are times in my life where I,</v>

231
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.900
where I cared less about living than other times.

232
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.380
And it certainly in combat I definitely accepted that I could die and I was okay

233
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:42.501
with it.

234
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:46.250
And there's probably times in combat where I crossed the line a little bit

235
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:49.070
towards the just straight bring it on,
let's do.

236
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.990
<v 3>But I never seriously how had that,
you know,</v>

237
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.610
that fault.
But it's something that I know is out there.
Like I said,
I've,

238
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.820
it's brushed up against me.
It's crushed me.

239
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.070
And when you say in this book that you almost killed yourself in,

240
00:18:10.071 --> 00:18:14.310
and we'll talk about what got you there and how you ended up there.

241
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.910
But how real is that feeling when it hits you?

242
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.490
There's nothing really,
I think that the,

243
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.320
the delusion or the set of delusions that you find yourself in seem as real as

244
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.870
this table that we're sitting at as real,

245
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:38.040
as anything you see or hear and the voices in your head,

246
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.510
that internal dialogue,

247
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:44.160
that self talk is a powerful thing and it can be powerful in constructive ways

248
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:46.290
and it can be powerful and extremely destructive ways.

249
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.350
So for me it felt permanent.

250
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.930
It felt in escapable it felt concrete.

251
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.020
I felt like I had a column of evidence exhibit a throughZ to indicate that I

252
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:03.120
would be better off killing myself.
So it wasn't a desire to,

253
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.090
it wasn't a desire to end my own life.
It was a,

254
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.720
a desire to stop suffering and stop causing the suffering of others or what I

255
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:16.821
perceive to be inflicting on my loved ones and family members and so on and

256
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:21.030
feeling trapped.
I think above all it's feeling trapped and feeling alone.

257
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.790
Like you are flawed and in being flawed,

258
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.360
you are unique and you should just be just be sent back to the factory.

259
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:32.070
And that equals taking yourself out extremely real though.

260
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.050
It's definitely,
it was it,

261
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.730
it was as concrete is any emotion or any object or any interaction that you can

262
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:41.090
imagine and it's,
it's got to be weird now

263
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.260
and you say this like you're looking back at this now,

264
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.370
and of course this is so easy to see and go,
oh,

265
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:54.960
I was not thinking straight.
And right now you can tell it's not real.

266
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.330
Or those problems that you perceived,

267
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:00.930
you could tell that they weren't real problems,

268
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.770
they weren't unsolvable problems,
they weren't worth ending your life over.

269
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.240
But you get trapped in there.
And I think in particular you do get trapped.

270
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.330
And in my case there were say five or six different events that happened roughly

271
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:20.160
at the same time that caused me to spiral.
And as I spiraled,

272
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.170
I got to a point where I felt like I would never contribute anything meaningful

273
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.590
to other people or to the world because I was so handicapped by this

274
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.610
pessimistic,
dark view of the world and of myself.
And I was like,
well,

275
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:36.630
if that's the case,

276
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.470
why go through all this pain to try to solve these various problems when

277
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:47.070
clearly,
like you said,
in retrospect,
it's ludicrous.
I mean,

278
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.310
it's ridiculous,

279
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.260
<v 0>but at the time it seemed anything,</v>

280
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:54.250
but why not just control alt,
delete,

281
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.950
let's just shut this computer down.
You know,
I got,
I got,

282
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.120
I get to see this little bit right now.
Um,
you know,

283
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:05.670
I got kids and you know,
my,

284
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.970
I got teenage daughters and little things in the world that they think are the

285
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.670
most important,
great.
You know,
things in the whole world.
I mean,

286
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:17.290
literally like a dress or a pair of shoes you,
I'm like,

287
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.650
it's okay.
We can get you some more shoes or whatever.
It's,

288
00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:25.120
you get to see a glimpse of what you're talking about just with any human,

289
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.530
any human,
anywhere that,

290
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.610
even in a workplace where someone's going through some problem at work and they

291
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:32.690
didn't get the report turned in on time and,

292
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.570
and they're acting like it's the end of the world and it's actually the end of

293
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:41.350
nothing.
And actually in many cases means almost nothing.

294
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.133
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

295
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.610
<v 0>Almost nothing.
I'm gonna go back to the book.</v>

296
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.660
So you say to Silas,

297
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.840
which is the guy that had come up and asked you to sign a book.

298
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:59.740
You come up and say,
oh you,
you say,
look,
I'm sorry for your loss.

299
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.790
And then you had sort of the internal talk once again with yourself and you say,

300
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.890
I'd failed his brother by you being such a coward in my writing.

301
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.800
How many others had I failed these questions swam in my mind.

302
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.080
And then you look at Silas and you say,
I will write about this.
I promise

303
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.790
that's probably when you made your first decision to get this draft go.

304
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:31.870
And actually you said the end with that,

305
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.120
I got in to the elevator and I added my own phrase on here and you should have

306
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.710
had be edit this,
but you said,

307
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.060
and with that I got in the elevator and I added and headed down

308
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.980
because the next part of this is called into the darkness.

309
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.190
And you've got a great quote in here that I'd never heard before.

310
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:57.160
The quote is they tried to bury us.

311
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:58.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

312
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.860
<v 0>They didn't know we were seeds.
And</v>

313
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.180
I think that's an awesome quote.
They tried to bury us.

314
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:09.370
They didn't know we were seeds.
And I can tell you

315
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.900
that I didn't bury these thoughts and these feelings and I'm,

316
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.220
I'm thinking back,

317
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.450
I'm just trying to kind of deconstruct where,

318
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:25.660
where my attitude came from and all this stuff.
And I think that when I grew up,

319
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.510
I listened to some things that may,
that debt,

320
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.550
just pull those seeds right out of the ground.

321
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.460
They were plain as day when you grow up listening to kind of music that I

322
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:34.060
listened to,

323
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.040
just dark heavy music that sang about this stuff.

324
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.690
And I'll tell you there's a,
uh,

325
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.930
one of the best pieces of music that you can hear on this subject and I don't

326
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:51.650
even know it's dark,
but Henry Rollins on an album called lifetime,

327
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.870
there's a,
a song called gun in mouth blues.

328
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.840
And I saw him perform at many times live

329
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.133
<v 2>and</v>

330
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.050
<v 0>it like took me through those emotions and you'd go on Youtube and try and it</v>

331
00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:12.051
doesn't deliver the way it was when I was a kid when I was 14 or 15 years old

332
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.690
and I got a guy on stage,
a grown man to me at that time who was,
you know,

333
00:24:15.691 --> 00:24:19.440
25 or something,
whatever Rollins was at that time.
And he's singing about that.

334
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.010
And so for me,
I'm thinking to myself,
well those seeds weren't buried for me.

335
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.280
They were out.
Right.
I was thinking about that,

336
00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:30.420
but I wasn't like I was okay with me,
you know what I'm saying?
And I

337
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.710
in a lot of the music that I listened to back then talked about that stuff.

338
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:41.690
So I didn't bury those seeds ever.
Really.

339
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.633
<v 2>And</v>

340
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.560
<v 0>is that something that you did,
obviously you put the quote in here,</v>

341
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.910
but how do you see yourself,
how did you bury those seats?

342
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.320
<v 4>So the,
I included the quote for a few reasons.</v>

343
00:24:58.321 --> 00:25:03.270
The first is effectively exactly what you alluded to.

344
00:25:03.271 --> 00:25:05.670
So these internal demons,

345
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.800
these self doubts,

346
00:25:08.801 --> 00:25:13.801
the self criticisms I felt were a huge weakness.

347
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.280
And so to compete to whether that's in sports,

348
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.450
academics or otherwise,
I kept that all in.

349
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.590
So I actually grew up on the same music or similar music,

350
00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:29.580
but I was listening to slayer.
I was listening to a lot of dark music,

351
00:25:29.581 --> 00:25:33.210
which I can still appreciate the double bass and so on and slayer album.

352
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.220
But for me,
because I never,
I never chose to express any of that.

353
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.550
I had no release valve.
So it actually fed,

354
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.730
I think in a way this type of self loathing and uh,

355
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.060
it could have been biochemical in the first place.
I don't know quite frankly.

356
00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:55.530
And I mean my family at least on one side has a history of a extended depression

357
00:25:55.531 --> 00:25:57.960
and schizophrenia and so on.
Uh,
schizophrenia less so,

358
00:25:57.961 --> 00:26:01.680
but so maybe it started there.
Who knows?
I don't know what the origin is.
Um,

359
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.350
and sign include that quote is a reminder of two things.
A,

360
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.720
when you try to suffocate or Barry or district guard these thoughts and emotions

361
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.740
as opposed to contend with them or deal with them in some fashion,

362
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.770
they are seeds and you're pouring fertilizer on them when you try to neglect and

363
00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:23.334
avoid them.

364
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.570
The second reason I put that in is be to remind myself,

365
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.240
if you feel like external concert,
uh,
if you,

366
00:26:30.241 --> 00:26:34.290
if you feel like external circumstances or external actors,

367
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.640
meaning people

368
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.370
are stacking the deck deck against you or trying to bury you,
right?

369
00:26:41.371 --> 00:26:44.010
Trying to defeat you in some fashion,
you are

370
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.520
<v 3>the seed so you can recover from that,
uh,</v>

371
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.070
and their strength to be found in the struggle.

372
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.240
So I included it for both of those reasons.
Yeah,
that's,

373
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:58.830
and I've talked about that before,
this idea of battling demons,
right?

374
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:02.640
And one of the things I,
I said on the podcast,
I want an earlier podcast,

375
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:06.360
as I just said,
don't let the demons ambush you.

376
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:09.900
Don't let them sneak around in there.
You got to bring them out.
You got to,

377
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.910
you got to bring them out and confront them and deal with them.

378
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.960
Don't try and bury them,
bring them out.
And so that's,
that's very similar.

379
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.590
And also when you were a kid,
this is,

380
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.820
this is also interesting because you were an overachiever as kid,
right?

381
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.550
I was good in school.
I was very,
very small.

382
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:30.120
I got the shit kicked out of me routinely up until about sixth grade.

383
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.810
But you wrestled,
you,
you are a good wrestler,
right?
I did,
yeah.

384
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:37.620
I got up to a national level towards the end of high school.

385
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.560
I did not wrestle in college since it was title nine at Princeton where I ended

386
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:43.380
up going.
But I was a,
uh,
academically,

387
00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:47.790
certainly a high achiever and a good rest and a really good wrestler.
Academic,

388
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:51.420
we don't,
I mean you're going to Princeton,
right?
So that's pretty much,

389
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.410
and then you land at Preston and kicking ass.
No,

390
00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.990
no.
I,
I had very supportive parents did really well in school,

391
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.870
got to Princeton and realized everyone was at that level or higher.

392
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.790
And it's a different playing fields and the,

393
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.110
and is that one of the things you think that as you started thinking about this

394
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:12.840
darkness,
you're looking at these other people going,
oh,
they don't have that,

395
00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:14.190
I got to bury it because they're all,

396
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.700
they're all smart as me and great athletes and so I,

397
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:22.730
I'm competing with them and I don't want to have that chalk against me of saying

398
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:27.520
all,
you know,
I'm a little bit sad today.
That's bad.
I'm going to be positive.
Uh,

399
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.860
for sure.
I think that was part of it.
The,
on one hand,
I enjoy competing.

400
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.670
So having a bunch of stronger competitors didn't bother me at all.

401
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:37.080
I was actually pretty thrilled about it,

402
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.490
but I did feel like to compete on this higher level playing field,

403
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.300
uh,

404
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:50.300
it would not behoove me or helping me to walk around bemoaning my weaknesses at

405
00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:52.740
all.
So I didn't,

406
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.010
and I felt like particularly being the,

407
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.490
going to that school is a real stretch for my entire family and extended family.

408
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:05.670
And I felt like I had to deliver and

409
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.430
there was no pressure from my parents whatsoever.

410
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.170
But I don't need anyone else's pressure.
I can deliver plenty of that for myself.

411
00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.460
And I felt that a lot was riding on that and I had the plan,
of course,

412
00:29:19.461 --> 00:29:23.900
as many people might have in their lives is get good grades in high school and

413
00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:26.000
go to a good college,
get great grades in college,

414
00:29:26.001 --> 00:29:29.330
go to get to a fantastic job and so on and so forth.

415
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.700
So which led up to,

416
00:29:31.701 --> 00:29:36.080
I mean a lot of the catalyzing events later in college in senior year,

417
00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:39.950
that that were really the,
the straws that broke the camel's back because I was,

418
00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:41.980
I was,
I wasn't always near the precipice.

419
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.760
<v 4>I mean I was healthy for long stretches of time.</v>

420
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:48.340
Then I'd have maybe a depressive period,
but it was manageable.

421
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.850
Oftentimes coincided with winter.
I don't handle that type of weather very well,

422
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:56.110
which is part of the reason that I now live on the west coast.
And did you,

423
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:59.670
did you,
were you self aware of that are very,

424
00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:01.930
where a very weird at the time,

425
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.800
probably less aware of the weather having the impact that it did,
but,

426
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.430
but you would literally say,
Oh man,
I'm feeling down right now.

427
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:14.260
This is one of my secular things.
It'll be okay.
Definitely and used.

428
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.980
That's pretty introspective for a kid.
Well,

429
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.100
I spent a lot of time in my own head and there are benefits that come from that.

430
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.670
You can get very good at academics and then sometimes you're just your own worst

431
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:29.650
enemy.
So being trapped in my head,
uh,
is not always the,
uh,

432
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.660
the,
the carnival that you might think it to be.
Sometimes it is for sure.
Uh,

433
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:39.280
depending on what I've eaten or imbibed a as well.
But that's a separate podcast,

434
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.010
the,
the,
uh,

435
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.250
but I've learned to manage it and we're jumping a little bit ahead,

436
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:49.410
but for instance,
uh,
and we'll get to it I'm sure,
but the,

437
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.960
the writing of the senior thesis,
yeah,

438
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.030
that was a major trigger for a lot of reasons.

439
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.770
Now,
for instance,
you know,
writing the book that's sitting in front of us,

440
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.360
I flew a researcher from Canada to be with me almost 24,

441
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:08.560
seven while I was in the final six to eight weeks of writing this book.

442
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.700
Why did I need him to come from Canada to be there in person?
No,
absolutely not.

443
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.630
But I wanted another human around so I wouldn't go red room,
red room.

444
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.530
And what would you write?
700 pounds.
You're going to end up,

445
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.410
we ended up in the red dog other than the normal room.
Uh,

446
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.970
so you're right that we do start getting into this.
Um,

447
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.520
let's talk about this,
but can I,
can I,
can I say absolutely.

448
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.860
One of the reasons,
and you did give me a 20 to say this,
so in fairness,

449
00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:45.820
but one of the reasons I recommend your podcast so much is because you talk

450
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:50.650
about the darkness and you talk about how common it is.

451
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.030
And I think the reason,
for instance,
out of the blue,
one of my friends,

452
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:56.860
super handsome guy,

453
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.890
wealthy family ladies throwing themselves at him in high school kills himself.

454
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.970
Out of the blue,
no one expected it.

455
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.620
And I think that when you find people in any circumstance who end up taking it

456
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:10.780
to the that point,

457
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.730
it's because they think it is a rare flaw there.

458
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:20.110
The one in a thousand who happens to be so fucked up beyond repair that it's not

459
00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:25.000
worth continuing.
And by exposing and discussing the darkness,
you realize,

460
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.340
I mean that's 50% of the people or more 50% of the time.

461
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.570
It is extremely common no matter what you think your defect is,

462
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.650
anger,
depression,
you have plenty of people to keep you company.
So,
uh,

463
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.010
in

464
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.500
<v 5>any case crowded up there,
it's cure how it is.
So that's,
that's,</v>

465
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:49.350
that's a great point.
Um,
at,
let's go into this then when,

466
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.420
when we go into what happened and some of the things that that went down,

467
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.500
this downward spiral is what you call it.
And,
and,
and again,
in here,

468
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:02.210
I'm going back to the book in hindsight,

469
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.650
it's incredible how trivial some of it seems.
And in,

470
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.450
I put my note in there the next night,
it's like,

471
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.590
cause you're detached from it now.

472
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.350
And that's such a key thing I talk about all the time.
Right?

473
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.120
We want to remain detached from things.

474
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:15.640
We don't want to get wrapped up in the emotions.

475
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.130
It would be we want to stay back because when you detach from it,

476
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.490
every answer is so clear.
When you're not wrapped up in it.

477
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.270
This is this stuff that,
that that happened to you.
Sure it was it challenging?

478
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.600
Yes.
Did it suck it?
Was it hard?
Yes,
of course,
but detached from it.

479
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:31.130
Now you're looking at it.
You're you.

480
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.480
You might literally be laughing at this stuff now.
Oh,
I do.
I mean,

481
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:38.030
I wrote it and that's why at the end there's this part

482
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.640
towards the end.
It's like many of you might be thinking,
wait a second,

483
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:46.940
a Princeton student got a really bad grade.
Who fucking who?
Like,

484
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.600
are you kidding me?
Yeah,
but that's the whole point,
right?

485
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.030
That's the whole point is that you don't,
is that people we don't detach.

486
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.950
We get absorbed in this stuff and it becomes our world.

487
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:58.970
So you get what I'm going back to the book.

488
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.030
I include wording like impossible situation,

489
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:07.031
which was reflective of my thinking at the time and it begins senior year slated

490
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:11.120
to graduate in June of 1999 somewhere in the next six months.

491
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.600
All these things happen.

492
00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:17.601
First you fail to make it to the final interviews for Mckinsey Consulting and if

493
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:20.750
some other company and you start losing confidence,

494
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:23.300
so this is the first time you get kind of a little bit beat and your life a

495
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:25.120
little bit for sure.
I was doing it

496
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.620
<v 4>extremely well academically and all of a sudden I didn't know what I was doing</v>

497
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:34.621
wrong and just just to provide a little bit of context and it's in Doug,

498
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.230
this is like,
I have this huge smirk on my face because it's so ridiculous,

499
00:34:38.231 --> 00:34:39.100
you know,
in hindsight,

500
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.770
but at Princeton or any ivy league school,
really,

501
00:34:44.771 --> 00:34:49.150
there are only a handful of industries that recruit.

502
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.580
Primarily you find management consulting firms and investment banks.
Why?

503
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.020
Because they want to hire you and then use your pedigree Princeton so that they

504
00:34:59.021 --> 00:35:01.420
can charge their clients.
In the case of management consulting,

505
00:35:01.421 --> 00:35:03.760
$500 an hour for photocopying,
right?

506
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.990
It's not it at all,
as exotic as it might seem,

507
00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:12.160
but everyone is competing for those slots and I didn't know what to do next.

508
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.860
So I just decided being very driven in that way,

509
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.190
I'm going to compete for what everyone is going after because I think I can beat

510
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:21.640
them now.
This is the first time that I really felt like,
Hey,

511
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:24.520
I got my ass handed to me with n B.
This is important.

512
00:35:24.521 --> 00:35:28.240
If I lose a wrestling match,
I know why I lost here.
I didn't know what was wrong.

513
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.400
So that unknown variable hit me reasonably hard.

514
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.920
<v 5>I can imagine that now you're doubting everything in a wrestling match.
You go,</v>

515
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:38.280
hey,

516
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.340
<v 3>my conditioning wasn't good.
Or Hey,
my takedowns one on point in here,</v>

517
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:43.600
you're just going to what was wrong?
I don't know what was wrong.
Exactly.

518
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.510
Something's wrong with me.
And no one could tell me.

519
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.670
Even the people that interviewed me,
they wouldn't give me the feedback.

520
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.700
So that's,
that's point a,
uh,

521
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.080
very shortly thereafter have a longterm girlfriend break up with me,

522
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.343
which again,

523
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.190
in isolation I think I could have weathered and I head weathered many times

524
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:06.990
before,
but I'm kind of relying on my heels a little bit.
And then my,

525
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:07.680
hold on,

526
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.590
I'm going to go to the book here because you give some pretty good specifics on

527
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:11.424
that.

528
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.850
She breaks up with you because this is from the book because I became insecure

529
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:18.300
during that period,

530
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.220
wanted more time with her and was massively disruptive to her varsity sports.

531
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:26.280
But my point is that these things compounded,
right?

532
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.190
You get insecure and you think,
why didn't they,
why did they,

533
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:31.800
why didn't they hire me?
And then you look at your girl and to say,
well,

534
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:34.800
I'll go to her for comfort.
Hey,
but you know,
I need more from you.

535
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.130
And she's going,
which all humans do,
which is,
oh,
you're,

536
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:41.820
you want to throw yourself at me?
I don't need you.
Exactly.
It was not only that,

537
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.880
but so she wakes up like you do and I tend to go to bed when you do.

538
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.390
And so I would want to have these late night conversations and it,

539
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.300
it screwed up or a competition.
And I mean,
and uh,
it was,

540
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.420
it was extremely important to her,
rightly so.
She was a varsity athlete,

541
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.440
sell exit stage,
left girlfriend,
gone.

542
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.510
And then the,
the primary piece of this sort of the,

543
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.231
in my mind,

544
00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:12.231
the checkmate for a loss was the interactions that I had with my

545
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.280
counselor or thesis advisor.
And I was in the East Asian studies department.

546
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.530
I started in psychology,

547
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.630
then I moved from neuroscience to East Asian Studies to focus on language

548
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:28.830
acquisition.
And uh,
this,
this senior thesis,

549
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:29.820
just to put this in perspective,

550
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:33.540
not every college or university has a mandatory senior thesis.
Princeton does,

551
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.930
and it breaks a lot of kids.
So I'm not unique in this,

552
00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:39.890
but I thought I was at the time.
It breaks.
A lot of kids,
you say breaks,

553
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:42.510
like they don't graduate because they don't finish it or they just get

554
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.710
emotionally,
they go through total turmoil and it did test above.

555
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:50.940
And what I realized after the fact is a lot of kids kill themselves actually,
uh,

556
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.140
at uh,
many of these top schools and I'm sure other schools,
but it's,

557
00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:59.840
it's such a pressure cooker or the kids perceive it that way.
God,

558
00:37:59.841 --> 00:38:03.900
I feel old column kids.
But regardless,
it's such a pressure cookers for you Tim.

559
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.290
It's very,
very common.
So it,

560
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:12.780
it really does break a lot of kids but it's generally,
let's just call it,

561
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:15.150
and it varies by department,
but 60 to a hundred pages,

562
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:20.151
sometimes longer and it can count for 25% of your four year or there's just say

563
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:26.430
cumulative departmental GPA.
It is weighed very,
very,
very heavily.

564
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.440
So even if you've had straight A's,

565
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:33.470
it can really throw a wrench into the works if you want to finish with a very

566
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:35.890
strong GPA.
Now keep in mind,

567
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.490
<v 4>I had already been turned down for jobs and this is so they go together here,</v>

568
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.200
lose my smile,
crutch that's keeping me up,
which is the girlfriend.

569
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.660
And then at that point I,
I am researching for my thesis.

570
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.190
Everything's going fine so far.

571
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:59.680
And I meet with the head of curriculum design for Berlitz International,

572
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:04.330
which is New York.
Princeton had a great dinner and he said,

573
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.960
it's really too bad you're graduating and x number of months because we actually

574
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:10.900
have a fantastic job for you that I could give you right now.

575
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:13.270
You'd be a perfect fit.
So I think to myself,

576
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:15.010
well this is going to solve for different problems.

577
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.210
I don't know what I want to do.

578
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.700
I'm not getting picked up by these other companies.

579
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.750
Why don't I take some time off and figure out the job and then figure out the

580
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:28.150
thesis.
Now the thesis,
I'm going a little bit out of order here,

581
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:33.151
but the thesis was important because I had a meeting with my thesis advisor who

582
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.060
had his own research agendas and and as is very common in academics,

583
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.830
professors will utilize the help of students at times to integrate things or

584
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:47.920
research things for them and slave labor,
slave labor,
and the,

585
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:52.090
he dropped to a pile of say 50 60 pages of original Japanese research.

586
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:57.040
So this is all in Japanese to integrate into my thesis.
It wasn't fit.
It was,

587
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.410
it was a round peg in a square hole.

588
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:02.980
It would be nearly impossible to put into my thesis,
but I decided,
all right,

589
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:07.780
well he's the advisor,
he's tenured.
This is mandatory.

590
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:12.640
It's not an optional.
Then I figured out,
oh my God,
well I could take this job,

591
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.390
take a year off,
do a great job on thesis,
come back,
problem solve them.

592
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.590
So I have a meeting with my thesis advisor to tell him that I'm going to do
this,

593
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.230
not realizing at the time also that his,

594
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:28.350
his research needs of me are time sensitive and he lost it.

595
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.750
He basically,
he basically said,
oh,

596
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:34.990
you're just going to cop out and take all this time off school.
Well,

597
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:39.991
better be the best thesis I've ever seen in my life and not so subtly saying,

598
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.480
I'm going to tell you if this is what you're going to do.
I'm going to,

599
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:44.141
I'm going to tank you.

600
00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:49.141
And I don't think I was misreading that and I was completely bewildered then

601
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.280
really upset,
meaning sad,
depressed,

602
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.790
then really angry and I was like,
you know what?
This is bullshit.

603
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.240
This is Princeton University focused on the Undergrad,
this is,

604
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:02.590
this should be a solvable problem.

605
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:06.580
So I go to people in the administration and I tell them what happened.

606
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:11.581
And collectively the response was effectively he wouldn't do that because once

607
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:15.040
you have your immunity bracelet in the form of tenure,

608
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.250
you're not getting voted off the island.
And,
uh,

609
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.120
even people within the department would not pick a fight with him,
uh,

610
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.200
or even really seek to clarify it.
And,
uh,

611
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.440
that was when I felt totally hopeless.
And uh,

612
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.100
that was kind of the beginning of the end as I saw

613
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.130
<v 3>it.
At that point.
It's very important to note.
I was not suicidal.</v>

614
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.610
I just felt completely trapped and without options.

615
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:47.510
I ended up regardless taking the year off.
Uh,

616
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.340
and that is where things got particularly dark because I went from being

617
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:53.630
surrounded by students,

618
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.020
didn't have the girlfriend that I was in a social environment to working for

619
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.800
Berlitz.
But what I didn't realize it was going to be the,

620
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.730
the setup,
the logistics was working remotely.
What does that mean?

621
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:10.290
That means that I'm off campus now with two of my friends who go to work every

622
00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:11.460
day,
normal hours,

623
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.940
and I'm left in a bedroom or a living room alone to try to work on my thesis and

624
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:20.370
to do work for Berlitz completely solo.

625
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:24.540
That is where the carnival in my head is a very dangerous thing.

626
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.110
I'm outmatched right.
And um,

627
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.840
we can,
we can keep going.

628
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:36.890
So the other thing that struck me as once that happens now,

629
00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:40.590
you also start to see your friends graduated,

630
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:43.910
graduate and you're all done.
They're done.
They're gone.

631
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.640
Got the heavy burden still on you.
Yeah.

632
00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.890
That was that.
That was,
seemed to be a huge piece of it as as well.

633
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.820
And then I'm going to go to the book.
Back to the book here.
Your,

634
00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.390
your coping mechanism is to cover myself in sheets,

635
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:03.790
minimize time awake and hope for a miracle.

636
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

637
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.560
<v 3>No miracle arrives.</v>

638
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.420
One afternoon as I'm wandering through a Barnes and noble with no goal in

639
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:15.290
particular,
I chanced upon a book about suicide.

640
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.780
It's right there in front of me on a display table.
Perhaps.

641
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.730
This is the miracle.

642
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.720
I sit down and read the entire book,
taking copious notes into a journal,

643
00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.720
including other books listed in the bibliography

644
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.510
for the first time in ages.
I'm excited about research.

645
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

646
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.200
<v 3>In a sea of uncertainty and hopeless situations.</v>

647
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:47.340
I feel like I've found hope.
The final solution,

648
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.560
the idea just appears in a book.
Yeah.

649
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.670
And you go full Tim Ferriss on this thing.
Yeah.

650
00:43:59.671 --> 00:44:04.650
With the same enthusiasm and rigor and OCD that I tackle anything.
I,

651
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.370
I dove into that and uh,

652
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.110
went to Firestone library,

653
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:15.140
great library at Princeton to check out as many of those reference books

654
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:17.550
possible to do my research.

655
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.570
And one of them was not in a,

656
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.910
one of the key pieces and swipe.

657
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.920
I made a request put in a request to get notified and I was living,

658
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.100
I think it was in,
which is near Princeton

659
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v 4>at the time.
Yeah.</v>

660
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.010
<v 0>And I think it's worth noting that I was past the point of deciding,
yeah.</v>

661
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.280
I was in planning.
You say that in the book and I'll just read it.

662
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.550
It's important to mention that by this point I was past deciding the decision

663
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:48.870
was obvious to me.
I had somehow failed,

664
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.360
painted myself into this ridiculous corner,

665
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.210
wasted a fortune on school that didn't care about me.

666
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.080
So what would be the point of doing otherwise to repeat these types of mistakes

667
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:03.081
forever to be a hopeless burden to myself and my family and my friends.

668
00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:07.890
Fuck that the world was better off without a loser who couldn't figure out this

669
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:09.060
basic shit.

670
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.310
<v 1>Okay,</v>

671
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.110
<v 0>what would I ever contribute?
Nothing.</v>

672
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:17.890
So the decision was made and I was in full on planning mode.

673
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.190
In this case,
I'm a dangerously good at planning.

674
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.910
I have four to six scenarios all spaced out,
start to finish

675
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.540
or sorry,
specked out,
start to finish,

676
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.600
including potential collaborators and covers when needed.

677
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.920
So as you just said,
as you just pointed out,

678
00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:40.270
you were full on Tim Ferriss' researched,

679
00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:44.960
complete decision made going forward.
Figure out the best way to execute this

680
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:49.010
<v 4>and make it happen.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
I remember it actually.</v>

681
00:45:49.011 --> 00:45:51.380
Something that's not in there.
I recall,

682
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.850
I recall when I had the plans and then it was a matter of scheduling and I was

683
00:46:00.141 --> 00:46:04.490
waiting for that last book to see if I missed any research before proceeding.

684
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:10.180
But I had driven to Firestone taken out these books and I was very lethargic.

685
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.730
I remember,
I mean this coincides with this type of deep depression,

686
00:46:13.731 --> 00:46:17.570
just very tired all the time.
And uh,

687
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:21.530
laid down in my van,
I might eat my used minivan,

688
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:25.940
hand me down from my mom after going to Firestone and just slept for like three

689
00:46:25.941 --> 00:46:29.180
or four hours and woke up and I was like,
okay,
let's just get this done.

690
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.020
Let's figure it out and put it on the calendar.
And the,

691
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.270
what prevented that he was,

692
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.900
<v 1>yeah,</v>

693
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.370
<v 4>pure luck.
I had forgotten that instead of using my Lawrenceville address,</v>

694
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:46.440
I hadn't changed my address with the registrar.

695
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.950
So my mail was going back to my home address where my parents lived on long

696
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:54.720
island.
And so my mom gets this postcard in the mail.

697
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.140
I mean,
thank God this didn't happen a few years ago,
would've been via email.

698
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.123
She wouldn't have seen it.

699
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.570
And it said in effect a good news,

700
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.410
the book on suicide that you reserved is now available at Firestone library for

701
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:11.100
pickup.
So I got a very nervous call from my mom,

702
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:15.920
which I did not expect dangerous plans.
Did you,
did you think your mom does,

703
00:47:15.921 --> 00:47:20.310
your mom sends it?
Oh yeah,
I could tell.
I mean her,
her voice was,

704
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.890
was very shaky and uh,

705
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.770
I quickly tap danced and talk my way out of it and I said,
oh no,
no,
no.

706
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.750
It's a friend at Rutgers.
He could,
he couldn't get it at his library.
So I may,

707
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.140
I reserved it at Firestone,

708
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:37.141
but it shocked me out of my self imposed false reality.

709
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.430
And it was,
it sounds so odd to say,

710
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.790
but it was the first time that I realized my suicide would effect,

711
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.690
no matter how cleverly I laid it out,

712
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.980
it would ruin the lives of people around me because I thought,
well,

713
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:57.370
let me figure out a scenario where I can make it look like a complete accident.

714
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.310
It won't look like suicide.
It'll just look like an accidental death.

715
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.490
And then I really,
I really figured it out and

716
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.850
it didn't matter.
It didn't matter.

717
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.880
I realized after that phone call that did your mom confront you with it?

718
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:17.830
She asked me about it and I was very fast to come up with the Rutgers lie.

719
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:22.690
Did she say like,
Hey Tim,
are you okay?
She did.
She did.
She did,
and we love,

720
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:24.160
you know,
we,
we love you.
Right?

721
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.720
And it wasn't a 32nd conversation and it was a longer conversation and there

722
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:33.400
were followup phone calls.
Props to mom for picking up on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

723
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.500
So that was a
dodging.
A bullet,
metaphorically.

724
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.000
Now I a millimeter,

725
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.800
<v 5>I'm going to go into this here.
It's sort of you,
you get through that.</v>

726
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:46.540
You kind of get through what you just said.

727
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:49.630
You realize that this wasn't just about you,
this was going to hurt everybody.

728
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:51.400
You get through that and then you say,

729
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.780
the very next week I decided to take the rest of my year off,

730
00:48:55.781 --> 00:49:00.781
truly off to hell with the thesis and focus on physical and mental health.

731
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.190
That's how the entire sumo story of the 1999 Chinese kickboxing Sansar

732
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:08.380
championships came to be.
If you read the four hour work week,

733
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:12.580
so you go on a full on year off,
just complete.

734
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.070
Now my question for you on that

735
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.230
<v 4>is it,
what about normal people,</v>

736
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.370
<v 5>right?
Normal people that can't take a full on year off,</v>

737
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:28.460
they got to find another way to get their focus off the what's going on in their

738
00:49:30.691 --> 00:49:35.010
brain at their work and get out of that carnival and focus on their mental and

739
00:49:35.011 --> 00:49:38.160
physical health while they're working their job,
taking care of their kids,

740
00:49:38.161 --> 00:49:40.140
doing whatever that is they have to do for sure.

741
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.000
How's a normal person pulled that off?

742
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.920
<v 4>Well,
there are,</v>

743
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:50.010
I think a few strategies and tactics that I have used and continue to use.

744
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.770
So it's critical that people understand.

745
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.150
It's not like I summited the mountain,
slayed the Dragon,
and I'm done.

746
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.060
This is,
this is,
uh,

747
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.120
this is a movie that tends to like groundhog day repeat itself.

748
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.010
Not necessarily that intensely,

749
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.810
but if you are predisposed to periods of darkness,

750
00:50:10.811 --> 00:50:12.040
as many people are,

751
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:18.030
you need to develop coping strategies and it's not so much the year off.

752
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.340
It was a focus on other things that helped.

753
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.760
And there are a few,

754
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:28.010
I mean looking back on it now I have a better tool kit.

755
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.610
The first is people talk about mind over matter,
mind over body,
mine,
everybody,

756
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.810
this type of stuff.
I think body over mind is extremely underrated.

757
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.540
So if you can't get out of your head,

758
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:41.000
get into your body number one,

759
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.820
that is the number one get out and move.

760
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.380
And really things didn't change for me dramatically until I started oddly
enough,

761
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:49.790
getting punched in the head,
going to the,

762
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.820
the toughest boxing gym I've ever seen in Trenton,

763
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:55.010
New Jersey where I was the only guy not on work release.

764
00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.920
So I don't recommend that therapy for everyone,
but uh,
you know,
one broken nose,

765
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:05.921
a lot of bloody sparring sessions later I was feeling more like my old self.

766
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.940
So if you can't get out of your mind,

767
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:09.770
get into your body I think is very important.

768
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.870
There are a lot of good biochemical reasons for this.

769
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:16.030
<v 5>I'll back that up too.
And,
and uh,
Tim Kennedy who is a MMA fighter,</v>

770
00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:21.880
just an awesome guy.
He posted something on Instagram of a,

771
00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.700
a month ago or something like that and Facebook and whatever.

772
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:28.770
And basically he was saying he's addressing PTSD and,

773
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.980
and that sort of darkness,
right?
And he basically said,
look guys,

774
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:37.030
get out.
Go work out,
go push yourself.

775
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:41.320
And it's very similar to what I tell people like,
hey man,
do you know,
do Jujitsu,

776
00:51:41.321 --> 00:51:45.010
lift weights,
sprint surf,
go get outside,
get into your body.

777
00:51:45.011 --> 00:51:49.880
So I think that's universally,
I universally agree with that statement.
Let me

778
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.620
<v 4>lay out a couple of super concrete recommendations and I should say in advance,</v>

779
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.930
I'm not a doctor,
I don't play one on the Internet.
So you may need a,

780
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.830
certainly there are many people who need a medical interventions,
uh,

781
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.730
whether it's pharmaceutical or,
or otherwise.

782
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.040
In my case,
a few things that very much help with or without other adjuncts,

783
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.810
cold therapy.
So cold exposure and this has been studied very,

784
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:22.811
very effective as a supplemental or a singular therapy for antidepressive

785
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:26.840
purposes.
It's very,
very effective.
So I routinely,

786
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:29.380
and when I'm home in San Francisco for instance,
even in La,

787
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.110
on long island in the winter I take short cold showers,
pure cold showers,

788
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.900
and a van Gogh for instance,

789
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:39.980
when he lopped off as a year and was put into treatment,

790
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.010
he had two ice baths every day.
That was one of the treatment protocols and it's,

791
00:52:45.011 --> 00:52:50.011
it's been looked at quite closely in the last few years was a cold exposure one.

792
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.060
So even if you don't get outside of the house,
that's an option.

793
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.740
You're going to take showers hopefully.
Anyway.
Uh,
then you have,

794
00:52:58.070 --> 00:52:59.540
I,
if you can afford it,

795
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:05.020
I think a good test to have performed is conference of bloodwork,

796
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.660
look at micronutrient deficiencies in particular.
So you,
you could have,

797
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.200
this is very common with depleted,
uh,
ground soil,

798
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.490
selenium deficiency,
zinc deficiency,
copper deficiencies,

799
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:24.610
these affect hormone production and much more and can be fixed relatively easily

800
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.830
once you identify them.
I have friends,
for instance,

801
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:31.260
one was deficient in selenium,

802
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.280
was going through depressive period and he started eating Brazil nuts,

803
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.820
very high in selenium content.
And he called me,
he called me a week later.

804
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:41.670
He said,
I feel like I'm on cocaine now.

805
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.670
That's a dramatic example.
Uh,
and no,
you shouldn't use cocaine,
uh,

806
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.850
to fix your depression.

807
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.240
But bloodwork I think is if you get your car checked more often than you get

808
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.460
your body checked,
you need to rearrange your priorities.

809
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.880
Stoicism would be the next one.
Uh,

810
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.380
I find Seneca in particular,
uh,

811
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.590
moral letters to Luke Ileus.
Marcus Aurelius,
people tend,

812
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.240
if they read both,
either be full on Marcus,

813
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.650
a released guys or fall on Seneca guys.
And uh,

814
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.590
there's not a whole lot of overlap.
I tend to read Seneca,

815
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:19.380
but I will listen to say one of the letters,

816
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:23.280
letters of Luke Ileus every few days.
And if I'm going through a tough period,

817
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:27.120
I will listen to a 15 minute letter every day in the morning as I walked to say,

818
00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:31.950
get a cup of coffee.
And what stoicism helps to teach you at its core,
I think,

819
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:36.951
or what it represents is an operating system for being nonreactive in high

820
00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:41.940
stress situations.

821
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.050
And high stress is relative high stress could be going to the DMV and waiting in

822
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:50.250
line for some people.
But stoicism is also not just something you read,

823
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:55.230
it's a practice.
So there's a fear setting and fear rehearsal is very important.

824
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:59.280
So the practicing the worst case is something that I'll do regularly.

825
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:03.810
For instance,
taking a few days of every month to fast.
I do that,

826
00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.190
uh,
taking a few days,
uh,

827
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:10.500
every month or every quarter to sleep on your kitchen floor in a sleeping bag

828
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.700
and eat oatmeal for a few days in a realize even if I have to quit my job,

829
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.840
even if I get fired from my job because a lot of concerns for many people or

830
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:22.200
financial,
I'll be fine.
Things are fine,
things are manageable.

831
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.000
So I spend a lot of time defining the worst case scenarios,

832
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:32.090
not just being vaguely afraid of bad things happening and practicing them so

833
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:36.840
that I build up some level of immunity and not immunity.

834
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:39.240
But it's an inoculation.
It's like getting a flu shot.
Yeah.

835
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.120
Stress and occupations and what we did in the seal teams to each other.

836
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.020
You go through our training for all kinds of combat stress and that way when get

837
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:49.170
in these scenarios in real life,
you're kind of used to it.
Exactly.

838
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.330
And did one of my other favorite quotes,

839
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:53.190
and I'm probably not going to get the pronunciation right on this name,

840
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:57.570
but a locus,
I think it is,
it says we do not rise to the level of our hopes.

841
00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:58.980
We fall to the level of our training.

842
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.160
And that applies to a lot more of than military applies to everything.
Uh,

843
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.440
so,
so those are a few recommendations.

844
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:12.441
I do think I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some type of meditation or

845
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:16.710
mindfulness practice,
which can take dozens of forms.

846
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.450
It can take the form of exercise,

847
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:23.070
anything with a repetitive motion or anything.
Quite frankly,

848
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.280
that forces you to be present,

849
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.980
<v 5>state aware.
If you're performing Olympic lifting,</v>

850
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:28.990
I guarantee you're not thinking about your to do list

851
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.770
or the argument that you had with a coworker.
That's,
you know,

852
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:37.771
I think it was when I was doing a follow up for the first podcast that I did

853
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:40.930
with you and somebody asked me about meditation and I was like,
no,

854
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:45.280
I don't meditate.
I guess what I do do surf,
Jujitsu,
weightlift,

855
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.420
all this other stuff.
So that kind of falls into,
again,
I don't know,
cause I,

856
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:52.860
you know,
when you say do you meditate?
My answer's no,
I don't meditate.

857
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.220
You don't see me sitting in a corner with my legs crossed Indian style chanting.

858
00:56:57.221 --> 00:57:01.180
Right.
I don't do that.
Do I get those benefits that people talk about?

859
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:05.140
Do I feel them when I'm on the Jujitsu Mat or when I'm Olympic weightlifting or

860
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:08.860
when I'm doing whatever these physical activities that I do?
I guess I do.

861
00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:10.360
I guess that's where it is.

862
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.650
And I think my word that I go back to all the time is being able to detach

863
00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:18.280
already said it once a day is,
is being able to detach from these situations,

864
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:21.470
detach from these,
these stresses that are there.
And,

865
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:26.110
and actually going back to the book here,
you say,
I returned to Princeton,

866
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.710
turned in my now finished thesis to my still Sour Advisor,

867
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:34.210
get chewed up in my thesis defense and I don't give a fuck.

868
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.860
And I think that is a very powerful tool.
That is a very powerful tool.

869
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:46.210
And it got me through all kinds of things.
And I'll tell you specifically like,

870
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.670
oh,
things are going bad at work would fire me go,
go ahead you,
you,

871
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.800
you won't find me.
Do it.
Bring it on.
I'll,
I'll find another job.

872
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:57.070
I'll go do something else.
You know,
even in the seal teams,
you know,
in the,

873
00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:59.890
in my book I talked about this horrible situation that happened with the

874
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.330
fratricide and that was the beginning of deployment.
Well,

875
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:06.430
as things continued on deployment more,
no,

876
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.920
it's not like the bad thing stopped there.
Other bad things are gonna happen.

877
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:13.240
And what I knew was that I was doing the best job I possibly could do.

878
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.900
And if you guys above me in the chain of command want to call them,
fire me,

879
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.740
bring it.
And it wasn't that I actually didn't care,

880
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.560
but I kind of told myself I didn't care.
And when you,

881
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:26.200
when you release yourself of that stress of caring,

882
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.510
you can actually perform beggar.

883
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:30.850
You perform better when you say you don't want it.

884
00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:32.410
And we talk about with fighters all the time,

885
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:36.820
fighters will be in an event and maybe they have a hard match and they barely

886
00:58:36.821 --> 00:58:38.560
get through and then they go,
you know what?
Screw this,
I'm done.

887
00:58:38.561 --> 00:58:39.700
I don't even care if I went to Lewis.

888
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:41.890
They go out there and have the performance of a lifetime because they relieve

889
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:42.910
themselves with that stress.

890
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:48.090
So sometimes not caring is one of the best antidotes for do,

891
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:53.440
performing better.
But it's very contradictory because you're saying,
okay,

892
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:54.850
I've got to perform really well,
so what am I doing?

893
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.120
I'm not going to care but I want to perform well.
But you've got to,

894
00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:01.900
and I used to say this with guys would deal with girls,
right?
In the seal teams.

895
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:03.940
You got the guys they're going through,
you know they're,
they're young guys,

896
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:05.560
right?
They're 20 years old,
22 years old.

897
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.110
And so they get these relationship prompts and sometimes you've got to help them

898
00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:12.060
through that.
And one of the things I'd say,
I'd say,
listen,
I didn't listen,

899
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:15.610
but they would be sad because they whatever.
And I'd say,
listen man,

900
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:18.550
you've got to not care.
And then I'd say,
Oh,

901
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.580
you can't just act like you don't care.
You have to actually

902
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:26.990
<v 4>not care.
That's what you actually have to act to actually not care.</v>

903
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.740
And if you do that,
you're good and you can walk away.

904
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.530
And somebody asked me that the other day on Twitter,
how do you get over,
uh,

905
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.410
how do you get over someone that you love that doesn't want you anymore?

906
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:39.710
And I was like,
wish them luck.
Walk away,

907
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:45.020
don't look back,
don't look back.
You've got to not care.

908
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.960
And I think when you set,
when you wrote that in the book right there,

909
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.810
I think that's a powerful thing.
It is.

910
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.100
And a want to look at the ingredients that led to that,

911
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:56.420
or at least one of them.
Uh,

912
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480
a key component in that entire story is after deciding,

913
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.280
after having the mom intervention,

914
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.720
after deciding to focus on other things,
getting the thesis done,

915
01:00:08.721 --> 01:00:13.370
but not staring at pages on the floor in my house by myself,
12 hours a day

916
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.160
I,
I was offered an opportunity,
it was half joking,

917
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:22.160
but from a friend of mine I had wrestled with who is going to be competing in

918
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:26.540
the sand show nationals,
Chinese kickboxing.
So that became a focus.

919
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:31.541
That became a clear goal where I knew input in output out in a garbage in,

920
01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:36.530
garbage out,
good training in probably good results out.
Maybe I get knocked out.

921
01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:38.360
But there's always that chance.

922
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:42.140
And the reason this is important,

923
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.900
you don't need to have a large athletic event.

924
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:50.670
What I've realized I accidentally did then and now I always do is much like,

925
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.730
and I think you think don't care.

926
01:00:52.731 --> 01:00:57.110
Another way that maybe you could phrase it as not being preoccupied by it.
Right?

927
01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:01.340
And if you're an investor,
let's just say you're not a full time investor.

928
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:03.620
How do you create that peace of mind?

929
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:07.040
You diversify your portfolio so you don't have all your eggs in one basket.

930
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.310
You can do that in life in a number of ways.

931
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:13.040
One of them is diversifying your identity.

932
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:18.041
So the way that I had set myself up for failure is all of my worth was set up

933
01:01:18.111 --> 01:01:20.180
and whether this thesis would be a success or not,

934
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.540
and there were factors outside of my control that could affect that.

935
01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.040
What I tried to do now,
and I recommend this to startup founders all the time,

936
01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:28.401
I'm like,
look,

937
01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:33.401
if your startup is the way you measure your entire worth as a human being,

938
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.520
there are factors outside of your control that could tank,
macro,

939
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.340
economic or otherwise competitive,
et cetera.

940
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.390
You can't have it dictated by how well your company is doing that day.

941
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.960
So for instance,
why don't I show you how to do it?

942
01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:50.750
Very simple deadlifting protocol.
And therefore,
as a result,

943
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.110
even if your company is having the most difficult quarter imaginable,

944
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:58.850
if you're putting 10 pounds on your deadlift towns on a Max man,
all good.

945
01:01:58.851 --> 01:01:59.900
That's a winning week.

946
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:05.490
And so I try to have at least three primary goals,

947
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.540
which would seem to d d to distract me.

948
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:13.280
Maybe for someone who isn't predisposed to depression and darkness,

949
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.140
you can have one singular goal.
For me,

950
01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:20.070
having say three provides me with that divert that identity diversification.

951
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.490
<v 5>Yeah.
And also the,
it sounds like the,</v>

952
01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.210
you're not going to pick goals that are counterproductive.
I mean,

953
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.300
you can run a good company and still increase your dead lift hundred percent

954
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:32.390
work on your breath hold and then things are going to,
they're all complimentary.

955
01:02:32.391 --> 01:02:33.224
They're all going to help.

956
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.530
<v 4>Exactly.
They're all complimentary.
And I should also say,</v>

957
01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.370
this is going back to the meditation piece and meditation is terrible word.

958
01:02:39.371 --> 01:02:42.460
I mean,
it needs a complete brand overhaul.
It's just ludicrous.

959
01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:44.530
Carries a lot of baggage with it.
Uh,

960
01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:49.620
another option for getting your monkey mind out of your head so that you can

961
01:02:50.591 --> 01:02:54.310
function properly is to,
and we had a funny exchange on Twitter about this,

962
01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.850
but is to journal in the morning and really you can look at morning pages.

963
01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:02.140
I won't get into it now,
but the stream of consciousness writing for three pages,

964
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.500
we'll very often show you how stupidly trivial your concerns are.

965
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.440
Uh,
it makes it concrete when you try to write it out and you're like,
wait,

966
01:03:11.441 --> 01:03:12.460
that doesn't make any sense.

967
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.570
<v 5>Why am I going to take that one step further?</v>

968
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.820
You want to know what it actually does.
Well in my mind,

969
01:03:16.821 --> 01:03:18.500
what it actually does when I'm writing something,

970
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:22.100
cause I now write for my own podcast,
right?
When you write,

971
01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:26.960
your forced to detach from what you're writing,
100% forced to detach from it.

972
01:03:26.961 --> 01:03:29.780
So when I'm writing something and you're looking at it,
it's you're not,

973
01:03:29.781 --> 01:03:33.590
it's not in you anymore.
It's out there.
So that is a good way to detach.

974
01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.970
It's by writing something down.

975
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.640
That's another thing that happens when you do pros and cons list,
right?
Oh,

976
01:03:37.641 --> 01:03:39.110
I'm going to,
hey,
I don't know what decision I'm gonna make.

977
01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:43.730
I'm gonna do pros and cons.
Well,
all you're doing is physically detaching,

978
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.430
physically pulling those things,
those ideas out of your brain,

979
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.590
putting them on a paper and now you're detached from them.

980
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:52.100
And you can make a good decision.
I hate when I agree with you,
Mr Tim Ferris

981
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.410
makes they mixed the Internet so much less fun or it

982
01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:01.170
<v 4>Gary,
but a few other,
uh,
recommendations one would be,</v>

983
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:06.270
and this is something that I've used as a coping mechanism often if you can't

984
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:11.730
make yourself happy and happiness is a word is really problematic I think.

985
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:17.280
And chasing it tends to mean you're not going to catch it by the way.
But if you,

986
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:22.310
if you are in a low state or a depressive state and you can't figure out how to

987
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:27.060
make yourself happy,
just try to make other people happy.
And it seems cliched,

988
01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.080
Kumbaya,
but it's like,
look,

989
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:32.350
something as simple and this is something that I do as paying for the coffee,

990
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.300
for the coffee,

991
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:37.950
for the person behind you in line at Starbucks can actually have a significant

992
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:42.000
impact on the wellbeing they do you experience in today.

993
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:44.600
Something like that.
Or like,
sometimes I'll just walk in a bit.
All right,

994
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:47.100
it's a Friday.
There's six people in this coffee shop.
All right.

995
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.070
Round a coffee on me.
Like,
it's,
it's such a simple thing to do,

996
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:53.250
but cheapest therapy you will,
you will ever have.

997
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.890
<v 5>I don't know what I do.
What's that?
Kind of similar to that,</v>

998
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:56.850
but it's a little bit different

999
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:03.290
when I interact with some,
let's say I'm not a coffee drinker bullets,

1000
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.820
I'm in a restaurant,
but you know,
a seven 11,
right?
A seven 11,
I'm going in there.

1001
01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:12.120
I got to pick up whatever bottle of water when I interact with the person that's

1002
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:16.290
selling me a bottle of water at seven 11 who's making $8 and 25 cents an hour,

1003
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:19.300
I treat that person like a human being.
Yeah.

1004
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.030
I treat that person like a human being.
I said,
hey,
how's it going?
Yeah,

1005
01:05:22.031 --> 01:05:24.550
just this bottle water Thursday hot out there,
isn't it?
Hey,

1006
01:05:24.551 --> 01:05:25.450
hope you have a good day.

1007
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.570
I just do that because I always see people in the world that treat those other

1008
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.090
people like they're not people.

1009
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.300
And I think that just dehumanizes you as an individual.

1010
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.480
So somebody that's cleaning toilets and is coming out of the thing with uh,

1011
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:47.380
with uh,
the bag of garbage and whatever and the,
hey man,
how's it going?

1012
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.160
Everything cool,
you know,
day thanks,
stop.
Something like that though.

1013
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.770
I think those are uh,
important and I definitely did the,

1014
01:05:55.771 --> 01:05:59.230
the way you put it in the book is if you can't seem to make yourself happy,

1015
01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:02.230
do little things to make other people happy.

1016
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.330
Very effective magic trick.
Focus on others instead of yourself.

1017
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.910
Totally agree with that one.

1018
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.540
Going to the gym to your other ones you put in here is going to the gym move for

1019
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:17.080
at least 30 minutes.
I tell this,
this is like the solution to everything,
right?

1020
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.570
Yeah.
Oh you got problems in your life.
Could go to the gym.
Cool.

1021
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.920
Go get a workout on to the next night.
Let's,
let's at least start there.

1022
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:25.271
I think those are,

1023
01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:30.271
those are super powerful and to give some specific recommendations that if

1024
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:33.460
you're not particularly prone to working out by yourself.

1025
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.650
A couple of recommendations,
he's just going to sound funny,

1026
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.680
but any kind of partner or group exercise and you can take your pick.

1027
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.030
I think rock climbing is fantastic.
Any kind of belay system,
for instance?
No.

1028
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.250
Any type of dance I have to recommend dance on the Jocko podcast.

1029
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:57.850
Echo,
edit that out.
Acro Yoga even better.
I'm going to keep going here.
Okay.

1030
01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:02.800
We'll go to the black hole here
or it could be Thai boxing,
right?

1031
01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:05.380
Well somebody with pads interact with a fucking human being.

1032
01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:08.770
We like to say Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,

1033
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.200
just you just involved with Jujitsu enough to get choked out on a regular basis.

1034
01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:19.450
No,
you actually,
you got a great list in here of a practical Gremlin.

1035
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:21.820
Defense is what you call it.
You know,
you talk about,

1036
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:25.450
and these are all all in the book that you put out all these little tricks.

1037
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:29.050
They're not necessarily to combat depression.

1038
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.440
There were just things for people to maybe do better in their lives.

1039
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:36.910
Morning rituals.
You got productivity tricks,

1040
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.790
you got people,
how do you face things that you're afraid of?

1041
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:44.620
You've got the jar of awesome,
you got gymnastics,
you got acro Yoga,

1042
01:07:44.621 --> 01:07:45.860
but I'm not going to talk about that one.

1043
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:48.790
But my point is you've got a bunch of these things written about in the book,

1044
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:52.900
which I think is,
is very helpful to people.
Hey,
I got to put this out there too,

1045
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.670
just because people are listening to this.
If you're in that zone,

1046
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:04.670
one 800,
two seven,
three eight two five,
five suicide prevention line,

1047
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:08.780
if you're there,
give it a call,
24 hours a day,

1048
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.980
seven days a week.

1049
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1050
01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:16.040
<v 5>Get yourself help.
Get,
get through it brother.
And if you're prone to those</v>

1051
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.760
<v 4>cycles,
also one of my very close friends,
uh,
who by the way,</v>

1052
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.590
extremely successful CEO,

1053
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.550
so material professional success does not make you immune to this necessarily

1054
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.910
and that should be reinforcing and reassuring for people.

1055
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.090
Meaning to say the people you see on magazine covers,

1056
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.100
they might very well be fighting the same battle that you are.
Something very,

1057
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:43.280
very similar.
And,
uh,
what this friend of mine did,

1058
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:48.830
extremely successful,
uh,
I mean top 1% by any measurement.

1059
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.960
And uh,
he,

1060
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.860
he got close to the edge number of times and he realized he didn't care about

1061
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.580
himself,
but he cared about his promises that he made.

1062
01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:03.320
So he made a not an a non suicide pact with his brother because he knew that he

1063
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:06.440
would never break his word to his brother even when he didn't care about himself

1064
01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:09.210
at all.
Which is another effective yeah

1065
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:12.470
<v 0>approach.
I believe that.
I know plenty of guys,
at least in my old job,</v>

1066
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.560
we definitely all cared more about our friends,

1067
01:09:15.561 --> 01:09:18.500
our brothers in the seal teams and we did about ourselves without question.

1068
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:23.360
So that would be a,
uh,
a powerful thing there as well.
I'm going to,

1069
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.980
I'm going to take it to you,
a little section here where you wrap this,

1070
01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:29.570
this section up with a book
back to the book.

1071
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.530
My perfect storm was nothing permanent,

1072
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.960
but of course it's far from the last storm.
All face there will be many more.

1073
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:44.950
The key is building fires where you can warm yourself up as you wait for the

1074
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:49.850
temp is to pass these fires.

1075
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:55.400
The routines,
habits,
relationships,
and coping mechanisms you build,

1076
01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.880
help you to look at the rain and see fertilizer instead of a flood.

1077
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.570
If you want the lushest green of life and you do

1078
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:11.563
the grey part

1079
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.170
is part of the natural cycle,
you are not flawed.

1080
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:20.423
<v 1>You human,</v>

1081
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:24.620
<v 0>you have gifts to share with the world.</v>

1082
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:29.840
And when the darkness comes,
when you are fighting the demons,

1083
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:30.770
just remember

1084
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.850
I'm right there fighting with you.
You are not alone.

1085
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.100
There was a large tribe around you and thousands of them are reading this book

1086
01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:43.934
right now.

1087
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.100
The gyms I've found were forged in the struggle.

1088
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:56.130
<v 1>Never ever give up.</v>

1089
01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.940
<v 0>Much love to you and yours,</v>

1090
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:03.763
<v 1>Tim.</v>

1091
01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:16.530
<v 0>Well,
it would appear that once again the,</v>

1092
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:19.890
the podcast went into the darkness a little bit

1093
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.293
<v 1>and</v>

1094
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:26.210
<v 0>I think that's okay.
And again,</v>

1095
01:11:26.211 --> 01:11:29.150
I think that having you on here,
Tim,

1096
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.200
someone that certainly like you've just talked about comes across as outwardly

1097
01:11:34.401 --> 01:11:39.380
happy and successful and loving life and having you talk about these things and

1098
01:11:39.381 --> 01:11:44.340
having you put them in the book is is it real service to people I think is the

1099
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:48.290
most important thing I've ever written.
Period,
hands down,
end of story.

1100
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:51.560
And that's a bold statement.
That's a bold statement.

1101
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:57.980
And I think the other thing is that people that aren't maybe necessarily in that

1102
01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:58.430
boat,

1103
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:03.050
it's important that they learn to so that you can recognize,

1104
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.010
look for signs,
understand some solutions that you can give to people

1105
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.620
and also remember that the darkness that seems all consuming,

1106
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.070
we've seen it time and time again.
We've seen it

1107
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:23.320
<v 1>and it's not,
it's not.</v>

1108
01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.030
<v 0>It is not stronger than the forces of good.</v>

1109
01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.440
The darkness will subside and the light will win in the end.

1110
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.430
So hold on,
fight on,
drive on

1111
01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:41.893
<v 1>and look,</v>

1112
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.440
<v 0>look into the distance out there.</v>

1113
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:50.670
Somewhere in all that darkness,
there is light,

1114
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:53.383
there is hope,

1115
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.720
and there is renewal and rebirth and there is joy.

1116
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.270
And there is this thing,

1117
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:07.510
this amazing thing,
this crazy thing,
this beautiful thing,

1118
01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.490
this horrifying thing,
this magnificent thing

1119
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.470
that we call life.

1120
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.620
And it isn't easy

1121
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.200
and it wasn't meant to be easy,

1122
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.270
but it is worth
every second

1123
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.083
<v 1>to live it.</v>

1124
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.530
<v 0>And
with that,</v>

1125
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.120
I wanted to make sure that I pointed out that this book,

1126
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.740
which is 700 and something pages long,

1127
01:13:57.741 --> 01:14:01.910
actually it's 600 and after cutting back five pages long,
20 pages,

1128
01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:06.170
this book is not in any way.
This book is not about a book about suicide.

1129
01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.680
This is a fraction.
Was it?
Five pages,
eight pages,
something like that.

1130
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:12.070
I just wanted to make sure that

1131
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.480
<v 5>I covered the subject.</v>

1132
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.630
I don't think that most people are going to pick up the book and say,
Oh,

1133
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:19.990
I've covered the suicide section.
No,
they leave that for me.
That's what that,

1134
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:22.930
that's,
that's my job here.
Uh,
but the book,

1135
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:28.300
it's what it really is,
is a compilation of all the lessons that you've learned,

1136
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.050
talking to all the people that you've talked to on the podcast,

1137
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.390
which is a wide range of different people.

1138
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:37.420
And you taken that and distill that down.

1139
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:40.690
For those of you people that go and listen to the Tim Ferriss podcast and you
go,

1140
01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:43.810
man,
what am I gonna I can't give this to,
I can do it with the two hours,

1141
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.011
two and a half hours,

1142
01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:47.680
who has two and a half hours now you can get it done in 15 minutes.

1143
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:50.710
You can get it the distilled version,
the,

1144
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.090
the peak knowledge there and that,
that's what the book is.

1145
01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.160
All this information kind of distilled down into nice little digestible pieces,

1146
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.070
like a reference book that you can look at,

1147
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:07.180
which actually now we're going into questions zone.
By the way,
hot seat,

1148
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:10.390
Tim Ferriss get some roles reversed.
Uh,

1149
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.990
first question,
can I say something for her?
Yeah,
absolutely.

1150
01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.470
<v 4>So I just wanted to also note for people who might be listening to this and</v>

1151
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:18.470
thinking to themselves,
well,

1152
01:15:18.471 --> 01:15:22.100
I'm not prone to depression and not prone to these dark periods.

1153
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:27.460
The so called coping mechanisms that you would use to take yourself from bad to

1154
01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:28.490
so called normal.

1155
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:34.210
They are also the same strategies you can use to go from normal to better or

1156
01:15:34.311 --> 01:15:37.880
from better too far better.
They're the same.
It's just,

1157
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:40.820
it's just shifting into a higher gear.
That's a great point.

1158
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:44.510
And I use a lot of those strategies.
Work out every day,
wake up early,

1159
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:48.710
get after it.
Of course,
I read a lot.
Write a lot.

1160
01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.210
<v 5>Okay.
And you know what?
I feel pretty damn good right now.
How's that?
How's that?</v>

1161
01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:57.420
How that maps
I feel better.
Yeah.

1162
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.390
<v 4>And to,
and to just put a button in.
And also I,</v>

1163
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:05.380
I have with using these different approaches for those people may be listening

1164
01:16:05.381 --> 01:16:06.970
to this and still feeling somewhat hopeless.

1165
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:12.690
The dark periods have gotten shorter and then able to turn down the volume and

1166
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.210
the joyful periods,
the zone,

1167
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:21.211
like periods of productive periods have become a longer and brighter and you can

1168
01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:24.010
engineer that.
It just takes the right tool kit.

1169
01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.400
<v 5>Love it.
Uh,</v>

1170
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:33.150
this is a good piece of the tool kit right here to speak in a toolkit.

1171
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.660
Tools of titans,
um,
at speaking of the book,
this ties into it.

1172
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:43.140
The book is filled with all kinds of good ideas and enticing options and they

1173
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:46.000
all sound really good.

1174
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:51.390
How do you take and pick the right path and not get distracted by all these

1175
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:55.960
other shiny objects that are out there,

1176
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.130
especially because the path is laid out and you think,
oh,
cool,
this,
oh,

1177
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:02.020
this looks really good.
You know,
I'm going to do this.

1178
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.260
Do what Tim Ferriss told me to do in this interview and I'm going to do that.

1179
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.950
And then you get a week into it and you haven't,
you know,
you get,
it's hard.

1180
01:17:08.951 --> 01:17:10.040
You realize that it's hard.

1181
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.230
<v 4>You realize that you,</v>

1182
01:17:11.231 --> 01:17:14.630
you don't like doing that thing and all of a sudden you go look for the next

1183
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:18.350
solution and you end up jumping from solution to solution and you never get any

1184
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:21.350
progress because you're too busy trying to chase this shiny object.

1185
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:26.320
How do you resolve that?
Yeah.
Is it,
this is a common problem.
Uh,

1186
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.650
you have for instance,
in the self help world,
you have seminar junkies.

1187
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:31.670
I don't really do seminars,

1188
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:35.120
but you have people who go to a different seminar every weekend.

1189
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.300
They get all hopped up on enthusiasm,
take a lot of notes.

1190
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.300
They do nothing from Monday to Friday and they hit another seminar.

1191
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:44.180
It's like a junkie hit getting them getting a dope hit,

1192
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:48.320
but they don't put in the work.
So the,
the way that you stack the deck

1193
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:54.020
is by understanding behavioral modification in a,
in a few ways.

1194
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.850
And you don't have to do a lot of reading about this,

1195
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:57.800
but there are few unnecessary ingredients.

1196
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.390
One is if you just look at the literature,

1197
01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:06.680
do less than you think you're capable of doing.
So what does that mean?

1198
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:12.430
If you are a hundred pounds overweight and you are starting exercise after no

1199
01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:17.240
exercise for 20 years,
do not start off with five days a week.

1200
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:22.100
Have an hour of running on a treadmill.
The pass fail threshold is too high.

1201
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:26.990
So you said it first.
Let's get you to the gym.
That is priority number one.

1202
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.070
So make it five minutes of walking on a treadmill two or three times a week.

1203
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.560
Let's just say,
of course my preference would be weight training,

1204
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:37.460
but makes an easy example.
Anything beyond that is bonus points.

1205
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.120
When I write a book like this,

1206
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.160
which is just a monster and like you said,

1207
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:46.460
kind of a choose your own adventure book,
but two crappy pages a day.

1208
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:51.650
Best writing advice I ever got.
Your threat,
your quota is two crappy pages a day.

1209
01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:53.760
You don't even have to use them.
But if you,
if you ha,

1210
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.330
if you put up two crappy pages a day,

1211
01:18:56.390 --> 01:19:00.380
that is a successful day and it takes away the performance anxiety and the

1212
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:01.220
procrastination.

1213
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.050
If you've never flossed you want to floss front teeth,
that's it.

1214
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:09.860
Get those,
get those pearly whites and the front done.

1215
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:11.810
Actually I got an issue with that.
Okay.

1216
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.740
If you break out the floss and you can't floss the rest of your teeth after you

1217
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:17.360
could with your front one's got issues,

1218
01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:20.450
well get in the game and floss all your teeth people come on.

1219
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.760
So I think,

1220
01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:25.440
I think we've got to get people there with the the gingerbread trail maybe

1221
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.210
appropriate for the flossing conversation.
But so the point is though,

1222
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.340
if you want to submit a behavior,

1223
01:19:31.341 --> 01:19:33.770
you have to break that behavior down into a few pieces.

1224
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.170
One is just getting out the floss and starting.

1225
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.360
Then the other is finishing the different components to it.

1226
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:42.680
So if I can get someone to say five sessions as my general guideline,

1227
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:47.270
make it as easy as possible so that you submit the first five sessions flossing

1228
01:19:47.271 --> 01:19:50.300
to the first front.
Do your front teeth.
Generally people are going to do more,

1229
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:56.000
but you start there,
do it for five days,
don't do more.
Call me releasing Jocko.

1230
01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.840
We'll send a drone to your mum's floss

1231
01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:04.070
with shoe disease is boots.
Have Big Shoe licensed folks.
Don't let them do it.

1232
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.330
So there's that.

1233
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.720
The other piece that is very is incentives.

1234
01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:13.410
And what do mean by that is actually a guest on the podcast.
Derek Sivers,

1235
01:20:13.411 --> 01:20:17.000
who's an incredible entrepreneur and a sort of a philosopher programmer,

1236
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:19.950
made millions of dollars,
donated it all to music education.

1237
01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:22.650
He's a real character.
But he said,
if information,

1238
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.920
if more information were the answer,
we'd all be billionaires with six pack abs.

1239
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.660
More version isn't,
it?
Is not the answer generally.
Uh,

1240
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:31.890
of course there's good and bad information,

1241
01:20:31.891 --> 01:20:35.310
but I'll give you a great example and this is kind of a ridiculous one,

1242
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:37.980
but it proves a point,
which is I have a friend named Agi Jacobs.

1243
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:41.610
He's a writer and,
uh,
he wanted to get into better shape,

1244
01:20:41.611 --> 01:20:44.760
but he never been an athlete,
never really worked out.
It,
never watched his diet.

1245
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:48.840
But there he is.
He's got one kid,
another one on the way,

1246
01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:50.790
and I'm skinny Jewish guy,

1247
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:55.020
but he described his physique as a python that it's swallowed a goat physique.

1248
01:20:55.021 --> 01:20:59.450
So it wasn't morbidly obese,
but does not look enough.
Super Hot.
And,
uh,

1249
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.200
he knew what to do.
He just wasn't doing it.

1250
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:06.201
So he wrote a check to the American Nazi party for $1,000 and I believe it was

1251
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:10.020
his best friend.
It's like merciless friend.
He gave this check too and he said,

1252
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:12.840
if I don't lose 20 pounds by the end of next month,
something like that,

1253
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.200
I want you to mail this check in.
Which would put his name Aja Jacobs,

1254
01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.310
known writer and Jew on the list of contributors for the American Nazi party.

1255
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:25.410
He lost the 20 fucking pounds is the punchline and you can use sites like

1256
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:27.800
coach.me or stick STC,

1257
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:32.010
k k where you actually create an anti charity so that there's a nonprofit or

1258
01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:34.580
charity you'd rather nuke then give money to a,

1259
01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:37.800
you can actually put money into escrow and if you don't hit your goals and they

1260
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:39.450
have referees and judges and so on,

1261
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:43.680
that money goes to your anti charity and it sounds so ludicrous.

1262
01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.390
You could also do something simple like a betting pool.

1263
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.720
I know people who've never lost weight and they,

1264
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:54.110
let's say five coworkers each put in a hundred bucks and whoever changes their

1265
01:21:54.181 --> 01:21:58.360
body composition ideally rather than a scale,
right?
But using a,
uh,

1266
01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:00.030
a Dexa scan for instance,

1267
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:05.390
gets the pot at the end and it is incredible how hard people will work to not

1268
01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:08.580
lose a and then B lose money.

1269
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:13.610
I know two guys who worked at Google both fatties at the time and uh,

1270
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:15.450
one of them is since lost more than,

1271
01:22:15.451 --> 01:22:17.400
I want to say 80 pounds and run a few marathons.

1272
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:20.520
But it started with a commitment to go to the gym together.

1273
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:24.030
And if anyone missed the session they had to pay the other person a dollar.

1274
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.060
These are people who make a hundred thousand plus a year.
No problem.

1275
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.910
And it worked is the is the funny part,

1276
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.850
but incentives whenever you're like how can I change this behavior?

1277
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:35.010
You need incentives.
So give your,

1278
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.120
give your close friend who you know would love nothing more than,

1279
01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:42.090
than to see you humiliated pictures of you.

1280
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:44.460
You're like fat ass bump just making this up.

1281
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.210
But like whatever in like your tidy whities and if you don't lose x number of

1282
01:22:48.211 --> 01:22:49.440
pounds by y point in time,

1283
01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:53.880
those go on Instagram and a story like you will lose the weight I promised you.

1284
01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:59.460
But there need to be incentives.
Humans are incentive driven machines.

1285
01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:05.190
And so those [inaudible] now we're trying to narrow all this information.

1286
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.330
Do you pick one?
Do you set a certain amount of time?
Like okay,

1287
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:10.210
I'm going to stick with this program here.
Kettlebell swings at night,
right?

1288
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:11.950
I'm gonna do 75 kettle bell swings at night.

1289
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:14.440
Do you say I'm going to do this regardless of the outcome.

1290
01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:15.700
And I think you did this with podcasts too.

1291
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:18.430
You said I'm going to do eight podcasts or six podcasts,

1292
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:21.970
I'm going to record them regardless if I hate it,
it doesn't matter.

1293
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.870
I'm committing to it.

1294
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.750
So that's sort of a way to avoid distractions on other things as well.

1295
01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:30.280
Definitely.
So there,
there are two different aspects to that.
So the podcasting

1296
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:33.400
was a goal,

1297
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:38.530
but I always try to set goals where you can win even if you fail.

1298
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.150
So these are goals that have side effects that carry over,
and Scott Adams,

1299
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:46.120
creator of Dilbert talks about this and tools of titans actually he calls it

1300
01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:49.420
systems thinking,
and in the case of podcasting,
he did this with blogging.

1301
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:54.220
I asked myself,
what can I take out of this in terms of skills and relationships?

1302
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:58.150
Even if it bombs as podcast,
I can get better at asking questions,

1303
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.540
which means getting better thinking I can start to minimize my verbal ticks,

1304
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:07.200
both of which will help me to do research for books later and on down the list.

1305
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:12.220
There were maybe 10 different things that I would benefit from even if the

1306
01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:15.130
podcast failed.
So six was this critical mass.

1307
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:18.430
I tend to do things in terms of sessions five or six times.

1308
01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.510
It's usually my experimental minimum,
but for a period of time,

1309
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.040
let's just say behavioral modification.

1310
01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:28.660
So kettlebell swings or fill in the blank,
some kind of dietary intervention.

1311
01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:31.630
I'm going to start with intermittent fasting.
Okay,

1312
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:34.780
so I'm going to fast 16 to 18 hours a day.
I've done up to 10 days,

1313
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.290
but let's just say I'm starting with 16 to 18 hours a day of fasting.

1314
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.990
Then I will measure things.
It's a very,

1315
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.950
I don't want to scare people off with scientific approach.

1316
01:24:42.951 --> 01:24:45.010
It's like you have to know what affects something is having.

1317
01:24:45.011 --> 01:24:48.280
So you can do that subjectively zero to 10 how do I feel?

1318
01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:54.120
Or you can look at things like number of reps weight's lifted.
I mean I'm up,

1319
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.420
I have my mug of my mug of tea and my get after Ajiaco mug approved.

1320
01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.200
Thank God if I had an unapproved,
I look at all these knives on the table.
Uh,

1321
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:07.580
but this is one of my training logs right here.
I ended,

1322
01:25:07.581 --> 01:25:11.620
I've had these training log since I was 16 so I like to treat most of my

1323
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:13.840
behavioral experiments,
exercise experiments,

1324
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:17.370
dietary experiments as a two week experiment.
And that's,

1325
01:25:17.371 --> 01:25:21.190
that's the minimal effective dose that I'll use in cases like that.

1326
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.510
And I'll always do the fewest number of things possible.
So let's just say you,

1327
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.670
have you read a book like this or any other,

1328
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:31.540
I think I take the opposite approach.
Unfortunately.
Probably bad.

1329
01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:36.300
I'll just go as many as I can possibly get it.
Dot.
So,

1330
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.050
so for those of you who don't know,
Jackie is a Cyborg,
he has a robot.
Uh,
but no,

1331
01:25:41.051 --> 01:25:45.280
I'm actually just an idiot.
Poorly programmed robot.

1332
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:49.840
But the,
the,
the reason,
here's how I think about it.

1333
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:53.950
When I'm looking at goals or I'm looking at behaviors,
I asked myself,
all right,

1334
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.220
I'm really enthusiastic.
I have this list of 40 things that I might do.

1335
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.880
Which of these,
if done well,

1336
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.980
we'll make the others irrelevant or unnecessary.

1337
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:06.290
I'm looking for a lead domino,

1338
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:09.160
which of these will make all of the rest irrelevant?

1339
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:11.180
Meaning I don't need to do them or easier.

1340
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:16.220
And that is how I choose the behaviors or the goals to focus on.

1341
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.660
And then once I have those,

1342
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:20.660
just so I can control my variables to the extent possible.

1343
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:25.160
So I'm changing my diet and six different exercise routines and my sleep all at

1344
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:25.994
the same time.

1345
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.540
I may not know which is contributing to higher reps in the Kettlebell swing,

1346
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.110
right?
Maybe the Kettlebell swing is killing me,
but because I fixed my diet,

1347
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:36.680
I'm actually recovering properly so you don't have to take it to that level.

1348
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.350
Bj Fogg,
uh,
fog has done some very interesting work in this area.
Uh,

1349
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.720
but I would say honestly you want to get good at training yourself and this is

1350
01:26:47.331 --> 01:26:51.920
going to sound ridiculous and it gives kind of ridiculous take a dog training

1351
01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:56.000
course or train a chicken chicken's or the most interesting because they don't

1352
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:58.520
respond to negative reinforcement.
But maybe that's not jack goes away.

1353
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:02.130
You need something you can like hit with a lash.
And Trina,

1354
01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:07.140
I don't know if that would be oh wolverines to do a so that if you train a

1355
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:11.450
chicken,
clearly not,
I didn't even know that was actually a thing.

1356
01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:15.020
Well it is a,
it is a litmus test.
They're there,

1357
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.480
there's a couple that I'm blanking on their name right now,

1358
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:22.490
who trained more than 1500 species for espionage purposes at one point.

1359
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:25.640
And they started as marine mammal trainers.
So they were training dolphins,

1360
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:26.130
orchids,

1361
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:29.720
etc. And you can't just roll up a newspaper and bad orca and hit it on the head

1362
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:31.640
for a lot of reasons,
but it doesn't work.

1363
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:36.210
So they have to use a positive reinforcement.
And the,
we,
the,

1364
01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:37.910
we really get into the weeds with this,

1365
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:41.660
but they also use a reward marker or a witch or a bridge,

1366
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:45.500
which is a clicker in this case or a whistle to indicate when the animal is

1367
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:47.690
getting closer to the desired behaviors.
In the case of a chicken,

1368
01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:51.050
you could teach it to say turn counterclockwise or turn clockwise to take a

1369
01:27:51.051 --> 01:27:54.920
certain number of steps and then come back to you,
uh,
to receive feed.

1370
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:57.110
You're only using feed.
Uh,
but you know,
the,

1371
01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.130
one of the quotes that I really liked from a trainer was you shouldn't be

1372
01:28:01.131 --> 01:28:05.780
allowed to have a child until you've been required to train a chicken.
Um,

1373
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.740
and there's a lot of truth to that,

1374
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:09.140
but it's just opera and classical conditioning.
But any,
anyway,

1375
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.270
I could really go down the rabbit hole.
There's a great book called,

1376
01:28:11.271 --> 01:28:15.260
don't shoot the dog about this type of training.
Uh,

1377
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.040
but I digress so that the point being understanding that we're all incentive

1378
01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:21.530
driven I think is is,
is very important.

1379
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.060
And then trying to work on one or two things at a time because you're only doing

1380
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:29.360
it for two weeks in,
in the way that I,
the mental model that I use.

1381
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:34.580
And then you're assessing things and which by the way is why I generally

1382
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:35.900
recommend if we're talking about diet,

1383
01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:39.410
so someone who needs to lose a hundred or 200 pounds and I've had the chance to

1384
01:28:39.411 --> 01:28:43.310
interact with a lot of these people and they've lost that weight.
Uh,

1385
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.380
I will put them on a diet that has the,

1386
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.560
there are three criteria that I use when I'm trying to say you design a diet for

1387
01:28:50.751 --> 01:28:54.680
an intervention for someone,
number one,
adherence.

1388
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.630
So of a hundred people I told to do it,

1389
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:59.930
well I have the highest percentage of compliance possible.

1390
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.400
And you could tell people,
hey,

1391
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:05.250
the best workout routine for losing weight is taping bowling balls to your hands

1392
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:07.230
and doing wind sprints on but down a stadium stair,

1393
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:11.270
well not too many of you are going to stick with that.
Uh,

1394
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.710
so you look at the adherence,
then the effectiveness,

1395
01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.480
does it produce the desired result?

1396
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.420
And then the efficiency of last in terms of is it uh,

1397
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:23.610
is it time economical,
right?
Among other things.

1398
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.640
But the point being a lot of folks give me shit on the Internet.
They're like,

1399
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:30.690
what slow carb beans that'll make your intestines exploded.
I'm like,
Hey,

1400
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:33.030
if your intestines explode,
like you're training yourself to be weak,

1401
01:29:33.031 --> 01:29:36.560
you need to fix your regimen.
But B,
uh,

1402
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:39.330
you could throw a thousand people in a strict Paleo or strict veganism,

1403
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:43.940
whatever your religion happens to be and a one out of a thousand are going to

1404
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:47.040
make it.
Whereas if you use the gateway drug of say,
slow carb diet,

1405
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:51.030
which is more convenient,
little easier at work with in two weeks,

1406
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.690
let's say someone who weighs 300 pounds and has a hundred lose,

1407
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.840
they'll probably lose between five and 10 pounds in the first 10 days.

1408
01:29:58.410 --> 01:29:59.820
So treating it as a two week experiment,

1409
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:04.380
they now have the positive reinforcement and the results that will lead to a

1410
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:08.240
credibility for me where I can drive them to do more ambitious things and step

1411
01:30:08.241 --> 01:30:12.210
by step that can then lead them to strict,
say Paleo or whatever.
But when you,

1412
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:15.000
you have to start with the good program,

1413
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:17.310
you practice is better than the perfect program.
You quit,

1414
01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.080
you see this an exercise all the time.

1415
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.040
People come hot out of the gate and they quit four days later.
Really,

1416
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:23.791
I don't know.

1417
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:26.500
What you're talking about earlier is for for me is prioritize and execute.

1418
01:30:26.501 --> 01:30:28.690
We're to talk about in the book,
extreme ownership is,
you know,

1419
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.200
what's the biggest impact are going to have,
make that thing,

1420
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.370
take that thing to the top of list and start working on that one.
Yeah.
Done.
Yeah,

1421
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.770
totally.
All right,

1422
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:38.970
<v 5>next question.
All right.</v>

1423
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:43.500
There was a friend of mine that was older than me and he was always looking for

1424
01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:48.501
the right girl and the right girl to settle down with and to marry and have kids

1425
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:52.200
and all that stuff.
And it never seemed to happen.

1426
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:55.680
And the reason it never seemed to happen is cause he was always looking for

1427
01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:00.450
perfection,
always looking for perfection.
And

1428
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:06.810
I told him that,
you know,
profession doesn't exist.

1429
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:11.430
And I also had another buddy of mine that was,

1430
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.530
we were like surfing and he was always looking for like the next good time.

1431
01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.480
Always looking for,
he's looking for happiness.
Right.

1432
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:25.800
And One time we're surfing and I go,
Bro,
you keep looking around for happiness.

1433
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:31.260
This is it,
man.
We're surfing.
This is happiness right now.

1434
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.110
Do you

1435
01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.220
ever feel like your search and too much and looking for something

1436
01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:48.170
<v 4>it set of enjoying what you have?
10 years ago I would've said yes.</v>

1437
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.840
Right now I feel like I've found,
I found uh,

1438
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:55.910
a few things,
meaning realizations and

1439
01:31:57.530 --> 01:32:02.530
I view my job as testing things on the fringe and reporting back.

1440
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:08.770
Psych half like ethnobotanist might be eaten by cannibals plus a little bit of

1441
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.580
athletic stupidity

1442
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:18.280
and really trying to find the things that the extreme so I can inform the mean

1443
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.420
and as an experimentalist or an experimenter,

1444
01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:26.520
I view that as my responsibility,
my job.
And I've,

1445
01:32:26.521 --> 01:32:29.650
I've also replaced a number of words in my life.

1446
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.280
So we used happiness because it's just the easiest reference point for a lot of

1447
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:37.150
folks.
Uh,
I think that the

1448
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:43.450
better word is excitement.
So I chase what excites me.

1449
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.370
Now that's a razor's edge you got to be careful with.
But when I say excite,

1450
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:53.430
it means I wake up excited and I go to bed exhausted basically is what that

1451
01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:56.250
means.
And,
uh,

1452
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.900
I've also realized that

1453
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.310
there are things to optimize and their things to save her.

1454
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.070
And I don't have a lot of trouble with that.

1455
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:10.660
Most people would think that I'm just like speed reading poetry and watching

1456
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:15.661
every movie on like 28 x forward with subtitles just to cram in as much Mr robot

1457
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:20.090
as I can have,
whatever.
And No,
uh,
I,
I,

1458
01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:25.150
I feel like I am increasingly better at the appreciation portion of the

1459
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.910
equation.
The achievement I've always been,
I wouldn't say hardwired for,

1460
01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.170
but very well trained for.

1461
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:37.380
I'm good at putting goals in the sites and achieving those goals.

1462
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.360
But if you're constantly looking for the next thing,

1463
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:45.361
whether it's the next goal or it's the next girl or it's the next high,

1464
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:49.750
then you are never going to be operating in the present tense.

1465
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.470
Was there something that you said 10 years ago?
If I would ask you this,

1466
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.510
you would have probably been on your heels a little bit.

1467
01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:57.970
Is there something that happened when you said,
you know what,
what did I just,

1468
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:01.660
you know,
did you get home from a trip one time and say,
what did I just do?

1469
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:04.480
Or what was there a no,
I can tell you what I can tell you.
It was,
um,

1470
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.080
so this,
this is related to something that,
uh,
you know,
Robert Rodriguez,

1471
01:34:11.081 --> 01:34:15.190
who's the director,
producer,
writer,
musician,
everything is fascinating guy.

1472
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.930
Also huge.
I didn't realize how big it was.
So sin city go down the list,
right?

1473
01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:24.040
He's,
he has a,
a lot of hits.
And he said,

1474
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:27.340
I always find it funny,
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but uh,
he's,

1475
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.400
he's one of the longer chapters in the book.
He said,

1476
01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:32.830
I always find it funny when filmmakers come up to be brand new filmmakers and

1477
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:36.040
they say nothing went the way it was supposed to go.

1478
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.580
Like this happened and that happened and shit broke and then we missed this shot

1479
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:42.760
and da Da da.
And he said,
they don't realize that that's their job,

1480
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:45.430
that nothing is going to work.
Like if you're the director,

1481
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.340
your job is nothing's going to work.
Uh,

1482
01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:53.341
so at one point I was feeling maybe existentially scattered.

1483
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:53.921
I was like,
well,

1484
01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:56.710
I'm trying all these different things and doing all these different experiments

1485
01:34:56.711 --> 01:34:59.090
and what am I going to figure out my thing?

1486
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:02.120
And then at some point someone just said,
no,

1487
01:35:02.121 --> 01:35:04.640
your thing is going Metta.

1488
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:07.160
Like your thing is doing these types of experiments.

1489
01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:10.670
And what I realized is my,

1490
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:16.810
my one thing is learning things quickly and whether that is cooking or

1491
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.160
sniping,
I've taken some sniping courses.
That's a separate story.

1492
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.640
A rally car racing,
whatever,
right?

1493
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:33.650
Tango doesn't matter that the approach to deconstructing these things and learn

1494
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:36.330
them quickly compounds.
So if I get better at one,
I get better the next,

1495
01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:40.760
it doesn't matter what the subject area is.
So that's my one thing.
Uh,

1496
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:42.830
and it just gave me great peace of mind.
A,

1497
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.520
you don't need one thing in a traditionally defined sense.

1498
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:49.960
Maybe your thing is as I have found,
you know,

1499
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:54.200
being a human Guinea pig and trying to train people to be better learners is my

1500
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:58.690
one thing.
Uh,
and that,
that made me feel more confident,
uh,

1501
01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:03.080
in this sort of experimental approach.
I don't have 10 year plans and I used to,

1502
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:04.250
that used to bother me a lot.

1503
01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:10.300
I am no longer remotely bothered by that because I have two week experiments and

1504
01:36:11.721 --> 01:36:15.130
have six month projects.
And if I do my,

1505
01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:18.080
we actually talked about this and you've written about it,

1506
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:21.560
but rather than worrying about the next 17 promotions,

1507
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:25.220
you just do what's in front of you.
In my case,
I'd say it's a book project.

1508
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:29.450
If I do an exceptional job,
I knock it out of the park with this one thing.

1509
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.500
Opportunities will present themselves that I couldn't have conceived of six

1510
01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:36.380
months ago.
And then it's just a matter of paddling for the wave.

1511
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:42.070
But yeah,
but I'm a lot better at appreciation then I was along,
uh,

1512
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:47.090
say 10 years ago,
uh,
because,
uh,
10 years ago it didn't matter how,

1513
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:50.150
how will I did what I won,
what I accomplished.

1514
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.060
I was always obsessing on the next thing.
You know,

1515
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:57.260
I never took the time to actually enjoy it.
Good lesson.
All right.

1516
01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:58.430
And this is,

1517
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:01.160
<v 5>this is almost down the same line of thinking.
So we,
we,</v>

1518
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:06.230
I kind of see you as the king of outsourcing,
right?
Um,
but for me,

1519
01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.880
my whole life

1520
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:11.870
I was doing a job that I absolutely loved,

1521
01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:15.740
a job that I wouldn't outsource to anybody ever.

1522
01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:18.230
And I feel like I was really lucky.
And even,

1523
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.750
even right now I'm doing this podcast,

1524
01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:24.410
you know what I love doing this podcast and people have sent me,
hey,

1525
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:27.700
we can help you,
you know,
set up for it and help you.

1526
01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.400
I would read books for you and give you notes.
I'm like,
no,

1527
01:37:31.401 --> 01:37:34.280
I don't want you to help me read books and give me knows I'm doing that.

1528
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:35.323
That's what I'm doing.

1529
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:40.330
So is there a job that would satisfy you that you said or what,

1530
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:45.550
let me ask you this.
What jobs do you do that you took?

1531
01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.600
I own this thing and I'm not gonna let anybody else to do it.

1532
01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:49.560
<v 4>The podcasts,
for instance,</v>

1533
01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:53.910
my favorite part of book writing without the book writing,
it's fantastic.
And uh,

1534
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.090
nobody's trying tried.

1535
01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:00.310
<v 3>I don't have some like suit who's paid to manage the bottom line.</v>

1536
01:38:00.311 --> 01:38:03.510
It would with no creative bone in his body trying to tell me how the podcast

1537
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:08.360
should be run.
It's fantastic.
So I think that,
uh,

1538
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.260
the podcast I could see doing indefinitely.

1539
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.270
There are many things like that for me.
I mean,
I could see doing,
well,

1540
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.360
I'll give an example just because I have to take the opportunity to talk about

1541
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:21.600
tango on the Jocko podcast,
just to shave your nuts and we'll edit this out.

1542
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.820
So the reason I stopped doing it,
I mean I got to got to the world championships.

1543
01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:31.090
Uh,
but the reason I stuck with I was a semifinalist,

1544
01:38:31.091 --> 01:38:33.300
so the world championships,
I didn't even know,

1545
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:37.770
I can't even imagine what the world championships in tango is.

1546
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:40.620
I don't think it was a dance work.
How do you attack the other people?

1547
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.580
Like how do you get them out of the arena?

1548
01:38:44.581 --> 01:38:47.280
How do you throw them out on the right?
What happens?
It's a,
well,

1549
01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:50.220
it's a very delicate,
so there's points is their points or something.

1550
01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.160
They're judges and so on.
It's just like a,
like an odd diving competition,

1551
01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:56.520
zero to tender thing.
But the point being,

1552
01:38:56.521 --> 01:39:00.990
I stopped because I left in an environment in which it was highly competitive.

1553
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:04.170
I went from Argentina where there are dozens,

1554
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:06.710
hundreds of worldclass dancers to the u s where they're just,
uh,

1555
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:11.640
are there's like seven,
a handful,
right?
Oh,
it's,
it's,
it's Bob again.

1556
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:16.070
Okay,
great.
Uh,
so the,
the,
um,

1557
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:22.100
the one thing honestly is teaching people to test assumptions and become better

1558
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.990
learners.
That's it.
That's my thing.

1559
01:39:24.991 --> 01:39:29.310
So that's the one thing that's the constant through all the books through the

1560
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:30.270
podcast.

1561
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.590
Don't believe everything you think detached to use your word,
right.

1562
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:40.430
Assess and test the assumptions and get better at getting better.

1563
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:43.710
Ultimately,
that's it for me,
but I,

1564
01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:46.530
there are many things that I do now that I could see doing for a very,

1565
01:39:46.531 --> 01:39:50.760
very long decades,
for sure,
including the podcast.
Good.
The other podcasts,

1566
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.880
we were talking about this earlier,
the great thing about the podcast is,

1567
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:57.600
is that you can do whatever you want.
Oh yeah.

1568
01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:01.290
It can be three minutes long.
It can be three hours,
it could be 30 hours long.

1569
01:40:01.291 --> 01:40:04.440
You can talk about whatever you want.
No one's going to just do what you want.

1570
01:40:04.441 --> 01:40:06.990
And that's if you've written a book,

1571
01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:10.320
the amount of other people that start to weigh in on that thing,
it's,

1572
01:40:10.321 --> 01:40:13.650
it's can be a little bit that's not oppressive,

1573
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.460
but it's just not as nice as,
hey,

1574
01:40:16.461 --> 01:40:19.890
I'm going to turn this on and do whatever I want.
Which is a good feeling.

1575
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:24.630
All right.
And,
and speaking of doing whatever you want,

1576
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:28.650
and I know that's kind of how you set your life up,
which is awesome,

1577
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.780
but to take that,
that notion to the extreme,

1578
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:39.890
if you got diagnosed with a horrible disease,

1579
01:40:40.231 --> 01:40:42.240
and I tried to think of a better way to ask you this question,

1580
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:44.580
which isn't like majorly depressing cause this is,

1581
01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.700
but if you got diagnosed with the disease that was going to kill you in a year

1582
01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.090
or 18 months,
okay,
what

1583
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:58.000
<v 4>would you do with those months?
I,</v>

1584
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:01.150
so I role play this all the time.
Uh,
not,

1585
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.120
not because I want to dwell in the darkness,

1586
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:06.670
but this is part of the rehearsing the worst case scenario.

1587
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:09.070
So not only do I rehearse this for myself,

1588
01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:11.440
but I try to spend time around people who are going to die.

1589
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.230
And when I get back to the bay area,

1590
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:18.160
I actually want to volunteer in a hospice center to contend with that.

1591
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.713
Uh,

1592
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:20.230
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1593
01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:22.030
<v 4>there are a few things.
So I would,</v>

1594
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:24.130
I would get my affairs in order relatively quickly.

1595
01:41:24.131 --> 01:41:28.180
They're already largely in order so that my family would be taken care of.

1596
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.700
And to be honest,
there aren't many points in my life where I could say this.

1597
01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.540
I would largely keep doing what I'm doing.
Honestly.

1598
01:41:38.130 --> 01:41:39.340
I think that,

1599
01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:40.790
<v 2>okay,</v>

1600
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:41.810
<v 4>I stopped,
for instance,</v>

1601
01:41:41.811 --> 01:41:44.660
the tech investing about two years ago because I felt like I was replaceable.

1602
01:41:44.661 --> 01:41:48.890
I felt like if I in a sense didn't participate,

1603
01:41:48.891 --> 01:41:52.310
there were a hundred other people in line who are going to step up and write a

1604
01:41:52.311 --> 01:41:52.940
check.

1605
01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:57.940
And that wasn't a unique opportunity nor a unique skill that I held to

1606
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:05.820
hopefully put into the world to benefit people in some way.
But,
uh,
the,

1607
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.640
you know,
all the ludicrous experiments,

1608
01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:12.290
some more practical than others and the podcasting and so on.

1609
01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:15.530
I feel like I'm putting out the best work that I can and

1610
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:19.850
I think I'd keep doing it.
And I'd certainly,
and,

1611
01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:22.910
and in the last few years I've,
uh,

1612
01:42:22.911 --> 01:42:25.920
after reading an essay,

1613
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:29.610
I think it's called the tail end by Tim Urban on wait,

1614
01:42:29.611 --> 01:42:33.480
but why about how effectively by the time you're 18 and leave the house,

1615
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:38.400
you've spent 80% of the total hours you were ever spend with your parents.
Uh,

1616
01:42:38.401 --> 01:42:43.401
I've reorganized my calendar and my year to spend a lot more time with my

1617
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:46.860
family,
meaning my parents and my brother.
And

1618
01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:53.220
I think I'd keep doing what I'm doing honestly until,
uh,
until I slipped,

1619
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:55.620
you know,
end up in a pile of dust,

1620
01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.530
<v 5>which is where we're all ended up.
That's where we're ahead.</v>

1621
01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:03.170
Sooner or later I was listening.
I keep wanting to do this.

1622
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.990
I want to,
when I'm listening to certain podcasts,

1623
01:43:05.991 --> 01:43:07.850
sometimes I want to just live tweet.

1624
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:10.220
Like when I'm having thoughts about them and I,

1625
01:43:10.221 --> 01:43:13.520
I do it with rogue and sometimes I go,
man,
I should just be live tweeting this.

1626
01:43:13.521 --> 01:43:16.080
Cause sometimes when he had,
who do you have on?
Oh,
when?

1627
01:43:16.081 --> 01:43:18.320
When he had Sam Harris on.
I was just,

1628
01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:21.350
there was so many things that they were saying that were just hilarious to me.

1629
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:25.580
I don't want us to live tweet,
but when you had Shay,
Carl on the,
at one point,

1630
01:43:25.581 --> 01:43:28.310
I can't remember his quote,
there was this,

1631
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:33.390
you got to this topic and you know you have what you would do.

1632
01:43:33.531 --> 01:43:36.440
And it wasn't the same question it was,
but it was somewhere in the same thing.

1633
01:43:36.441 --> 01:43:39.500
Maybe it was about money and he got enough money now or something along those

1634
01:43:39.501 --> 01:43:44.360
lines and kind of at the same time,
you know,
he says,
he says something like,

1635
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:46.700
you know,
just imagine being able to spend all this time with your family.

1636
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:50.350
And then you said at the same time,
cocaine in horse,

1637
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.700
<v 4>I wanted to live.
We've done.
That's cool.
Yeah.</v>

1638
01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:59.270
Shay and I,
it's been a couple of days together

1639
01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:03.440
and which just for those people that have any context,

1640
01:44:03.441 --> 01:44:07.810
he's also raised Church of Latter Day saints,
Mormon,

1641
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:11.370
Utah.
And uh,
so I was like cocaine and whores,

1642
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:17.120
which is the nature of my podcast.
I left.
That was classic.

1643
01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:21.260
It's the little things.
It's a little bit,
that was another,

1644
01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:24.790
<v 5>I want him to live through it cause he was saying to some really classic lines</v>

1645
01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:29.560
in those as well.
All right.
Normal Day to day.
Okay.

1646
01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:35.230
No imminent death that I just placed with.
You're healed my son.
Thank you.
Demons,

1647
01:44:35.231 --> 01:44:36.064
no disease.

1648
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:40.720
It seems like you've gone through your life going from all these different

1649
01:44:40.721 --> 01:44:43.690
hobbies.
You talked about tango,
you talk about Jiu Jitsu,
you wrestled,

1650
01:44:43.691 --> 01:44:46.810
you did judo when you were in Japan.
Now you're talking here,
we show up here.

1651
01:44:46.811 --> 01:44:48.460
You're talking about archery,
right?

1652
01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.210
You've got all these different things going on.
For me,

1653
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:57.990
I've only had a couple things that have made me feel that way.

1654
01:44:58.510 --> 01:45:02.980
That thing,
right?
Number one is combat.
That's,

1655
01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:07.930
that's as good as it gets for me.
Jujitsu is the next thing down.

1656
01:45:07.931 --> 01:45:12.931
It's an empty brain and just awesome this and surfing is up there too.

1657
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:17.260
Maybe jamming with my band,
getting it on in that way.

1658
01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.270
How come you're jumping around so much and is there anything that you always go

1659
01:45:22.271 --> 01:45:23.104
back to?

1660
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:26.950
<v 4>So I jumped around.
I had a,</v>

1661
01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:31.450
I had a conversation about this with one of my very close friends,
Josh Waitzkin,

1662
01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:33.640
Josh Waitzkin,
for those who don't know,

1663
01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:37.690
he's the inspiration for the book and the movie searching for Bobby Fischer.

1664
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.650
He was a chess,
well considered a chess prodigy.
I take some issue with the name.

1665
01:45:41.651 --> 01:45:46.420
He doesn't like that label either.
Uh,
very good at learning just about anything.

1666
01:45:46.450 --> 01:45:48.880
He's also the first black belt under a,

1667
01:45:48.881 --> 01:45:53.881
a incredible Jujitsu athlete and teacher named Marcella Garcia legit who is at

1668
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:59.930
deco finally jibes in.
Yeah,
I would echo and he just wants to point out that yes,

1669
01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.960
Marcello Garcia is low digit Marcello is one of the finest grapplers in the last

1670
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
hundred years for sure.
And which,

1671
01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:14.100
which by the way makes him one of the best grapplers in the history of the world

1672
01:46:14.890 --> 01:46:19.180
and the universe.
Exactly.
Okay.
No,
this is completely true.
I mean,
I,

1673
01:46:19.181 --> 01:46:23.590
I've not to go down in the Marcello rabbit hole,
but uh,
yeah,

1674
01:46:23.591 --> 01:46:27.730
I had the opportunity to train with Marcello and it's just another planet.

1675
01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:34.280
<v 5>It actually at Josh invited me when I,
when I get out to New York,
Josh said,
hey,</v>

1676
01:46:34.281 --> 01:46:36.770
come on by the academy.
I'm like,
okay,
yeah,
no problem.
I'll be there.

1677
01:46:36.771 --> 01:46:39.080
So what am I going to get out there?
He's like,
oh,
we got ease.

1678
01:46:39.081 --> 01:46:43.350
And everybody's like,
you got everything.
Yeah,
this is like surface.
Oh,
it's,
it's,

1679
01:46:43.351 --> 01:46:45.820
it's a fantastic,
it's a fantastic school.
Cool.

1680
01:46:46.570 --> 01:46:51.120
<v 4>And,
uh,
he's applied his learning approach to Jujitsu.</v>

1681
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:55.350
He's applied it to Tai Chi,
push hands.
He was a world champion and he's,

1682
01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:58.680
he's applied to a handful of things,
but not a lot.
He's not as,

1683
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.810
as frenetic as I am,
but we've,
we've spent a lot of time together.

1684
01:47:02.811 --> 01:47:07.320
He's a very close friend and he said,
and this is his words,
not mine,

1685
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:11.220
but he feels like I am one of the best people on the planet at getting people

1686
01:47:11.221 --> 01:47:14.190
from zero to 80% of a skill as quickly as possible.

1687
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.880
And he's focused on the last 1% getting someone from 99 to 100.

1688
01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:24.000
So he works with some of the biggest names in the finance world.
Uh,

1689
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:29.090
people who are very under the radar to get them from say beating 99.99% of the

1690
01:47:32.131 --> 01:47:32.611
competition,

1691
01:47:32.611 --> 01:47:37.611
2.999 and I think those are complimentary skill sets.

1692
01:47:37.681 --> 01:47:40.860
But for me,
the high that I get is different from the high Josh gets.

1693
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:44.360
The high that I get is taking someone.
For instance,
I didn't learn this,

1694
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:45.203
we talked about this.

1695
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:48.810
I didn't learn to swim properly until I was in my thirties a for a host of

1696
01:47:48.811 --> 01:47:52.260
reasons I won't bore everybody with,
I did a Ted talk on why that is,

1697
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:56.280
as absurd as it is,
but taking someone who hasn't,

1698
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:58.140
hasn't been able to swim ever,

1699
01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:00.660
and getting them in two days to the point where they can swim,

1700
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:05.610
say open water in the ocean for a half a mile,
which is completely feasible.

1701
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:08.940
It's completely possible for someone who has some athletic background.

1702
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.793
That's my high,

1703
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.500
showing someone that the impossible or what they thought was impossible is not

1704
01:48:16.501 --> 01:48:21.420
only possible,
but in a timeframe that seems completely unrealistic.

1705
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:22.403
That's my high.

1706
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:27.000
So I think that's part of the reason I jump around is in part to learn,

1707
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:30.690
but it's also being able to teach someone in a way that saves them hundreds of

1708
01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:34.260
hours and just to see their head go and you get that obviously,

1709
01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:37.290
then you get that satisfaction yourself when you try something for the first

1710
01:48:37.291 --> 01:48:40.140
time.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
There's,
there's nothing better for me.
I mean,

1711
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:43.590
when I figure out,
for instance,
with with archery,

1712
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:48.390
a blank bail practice and I'm like,
oh my God,

1713
01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:50.520
it's just like dry firing with a pistol.

1714
01:48:50.610 --> 01:48:53.430
Like to fix your like casting or healing.
It's like mine.

1715
01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.740
It's the same fucking thing.
Oh my God.
You know,

1716
01:48:55.741 --> 01:49:00.540
and then I get all excited because I'm piecing these things together or oh,

1717
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:03.870
the way that you train someone,
figure out their eye dominance.

1718
01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:06.570
Like if you're constantly missing basketball shots by like an inch,

1719
01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.270
you probably haven't figured out your eye dominance.
It's like,
Oh,

1720
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:10.860
then you shift your center line slightly.

1721
01:49:10.861 --> 01:49:13.770
So you're raising the ball in a different way.
Oh my God.

1722
01:49:13.771 --> 01:49:15.120
It applies in the same way to bowling,

1723
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:17.610
even though no one even talked about bowling,

1724
01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:20.550
those types of things get me very excited.

1725
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.570
I always thought I was going to be a teacher because I had these coaches and

1726
01:49:24.571 --> 01:49:29.110
teachers in ninth or 10th grade who steered me from this very bad path onto a

1727
01:49:29.111 --> 01:49:31.110
much better path.
I mean,
a lot of my friends growing up,

1728
01:49:31.111 --> 01:49:35.130
long island ended up overdosing,
dying.
My best friend growing up was one of them,

1729
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:37.470
or drug addicts or alcoholics.

1730
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.530
And I got steered in this other direction and that ninth,

1731
01:49:40.531 --> 01:49:43.980
10 grade window is what I always thought I would go back and teach.

1732
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:47.890
So I love teaching,
so that's why I jump around.
But,

1733
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.630
<v 3>uh,
what,</v>

1734
01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:54.930
what creates the zone for me is partially just that Aha moment is exciting for

1735
01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:01.190
me.
So I do spend a lot of my time looking for fertile ground.

1736
01:50:01.191 --> 01:50:04.710
So it's a new skillset,
but these skillsets compounds.

1737
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.330
So the better you get at learning any skill,

1738
01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:10.420
the faster you'll learn subsequent skills.
Uh,

1739
01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:15.610
but if I had to default to a few activities,
I would say it's,

1740
01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:18.850
and I have to be trying to be smarter about this,

1741
01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:22.780
but it's a physical activity with a component of danger.
That's it.

1742
01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.940
It's a physical activity with a risk,
with real stakes of some type.

1743
01:50:27.941 --> 01:50:32.170
So that could be rally car racing,
just very physical.
It could be Jujitsu,

1744
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:35.560
it could be a different martial arts,

1745
01:50:35.561 --> 01:50:38.620
a Thai kickboxing where I probably spent the most time outside of Jujitsu and

1746
01:50:38.621 --> 01:50:40.570
wrestling.
Uh,

1747
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.350
those would be the activities that,

1748
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:48.850
that put me in the zone by necessity because the penalties are so swift and so

1749
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:52.870
immediate and so severe,
uh,

1750
01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:58.050
strongly incentivized to not think of the Alfre runs are going to hit when

1751
01:50:58.391 --> 01:51:02.440
someone's trying to kick you in the head.
Similar question.

1752
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:04.840
Next one down the down the list here.

1753
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.960
Now I was with a friend of mine the other day and we were doing some work on his

1754
01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:09.940
car,
just like bodywork,
right?

1755
01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:13.840
You're sanding and then you're polishing and then you're saying again,

1756
01:51:13.841 --> 01:51:15.970
you're polishing and you're paying priming all this stuff.

1757
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:20.410
And there's a certain level of detachment and court sort of,

1758
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:22.510
for lack of a better word,

1759
01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.920
like a zen mindset where you're doing this thing but you're not doing it right.

1760
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.050
It's the same thing with cleaning guns.
You know,
you're cleaning guns,

1761
01:51:29.051 --> 01:51:31.750
you're just very,
it's just a very calming thing,
you know,

1762
01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:34.060
sometimes when I just need to relax,
I'll just clean my weapons.

1763
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:37.810
I think everyone kind of does that.
But it do you do,
do you do that?

1764
01:51:37.811 --> 01:51:41.680
Is there anything that you do that you do that puts you in that state of mind of

1765
01:51:41.770 --> 01:51:45.250
that?
Just let's let you kind of relax?
Oh,
absolutely.
There are,

1766
01:51:45.251 --> 01:51:48.640
there are a number of them and I,
I view them as medicine.

1767
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:52.550
I need consistent dosing of these things.
Uh,

1768
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.380
the first few that come to mind,
uh,
swimming now that I do for fun,

1769
01:51:56.381 --> 01:51:59.290
which blows my mind to this day because I'm so terrified with it forever.

1770
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:00.730
But swimming laps,

1771
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:05.560
just a very repetitive left,
right,
left,
right?

1772
01:52:05.561 --> 01:52:09.550
That rhythm is hypnotic for me.
God,
somebody asked me the other day like,
Oh,

1773
01:52:09.551 --> 01:52:13.360
do you still swim?
I said,
no,
I surfed but I don't swim.

1774
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:16.420
Like I swam enough my whole life swimming.
Swimming.
Yeah.

1775
01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:21.370
And I don't swim like I'm on purpose though.
Yeah.
So,

1776
01:52:21.371 --> 01:52:25.510
and the reason somebody said why I said boredom,
right?
Yeah.

1777
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:31.000
Maybe I need to revisit that so that that boredom is,
is can be a positive thing.

1778
01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:35.710
It can be.
So I find this is Bonnie.
One of the reasons that I,
this is slightly,

1779
01:52:35.711 --> 01:52:37.840
this is different because you'd have to pay attention with this word,

1780
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:39.880
but dog training.
Uh,

1781
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:44.940
I wa I went really deep with dog training and for a lot of folks it's really

1782
01:52:45.411 --> 01:52:46.244
monotonous.

1783
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:51.340
<v 4>Shaping a behavior at a high level is extremely repetitive and I find it</v>

1784
01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.820
therapeutic.
I love it.
Uh,
so swimming would be one.

1785
01:52:55.821 --> 01:52:59.240
And here's how I make swimming a little more interesting to me.
With swimming,

1786
01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:02.860
I focus on the efficiency of strokes per per line.

1787
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:06.090
So you got little challenge.
I have a,

1788
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:10.700
I have a game or I will look at instead of say,
right,

1789
01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:13.880
left,
breathe and then breathing to the alternate side.

1790
01:53:13.881 --> 01:53:15.230
So you're breathing every third stroke.

1791
01:53:15.231 --> 01:53:19.070
I'll try to do every fifth stroke and I have these metrics that I use to keep me

1792
01:53:19.071 --> 01:53:22.190
motivated.
That's the little Scooby snack.
And uh,

1793
01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.680
so cooking,

1794
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:30.780
I find something I always hated until maybe three years ago,
no more,
five,

1795
01:53:30.781 --> 01:53:34.590
five years ago.
I find also very,

1796
01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.473
<v 2>uh,</v>

1797
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:39.560
<v 4>present state forcing.</v>

1798
01:53:39.561 --> 01:53:43.100
It's a forcing function for me when you're trying to figure out five different

1799
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:45.800
dishes going at the same time and timing everything.

1800
01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.030
You don't have any slack to think of other things.
And so I don't,

1801
01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:53.960
I very rarely cook for one person,
meaning myself,
but having groups over,

1802
01:53:55.310 --> 01:54:00.310
we had an entire pig for my birthday a few months ago and a spatchcocked for

1803
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:02.450
those who don't know what that is,

1804
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:06.170
is you basically splitting it down the middle and then spreading it out like a

1805
01:54:06.171 --> 01:54:10.640
pancake.
And uh,
we just created this raging inferno,

1806
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.890
my back yard,
uh,

1807
01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:16.490
with a pig and fish and all this stuff and everybody was involved.

1808
01:54:16.491 --> 01:54:19.190
Probably 10 different people and I was not the,
uh,

1809
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.950
the commander in chief for that one.
We,

1810
01:54:20.970 --> 01:54:22.700
that we have a friend who really knows what he's doing,

1811
01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:26.660
but just one of the most relaxing experiences that everybody had had.

1812
01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:30.380
Everyone came away from that after two days of being involved in it,

1813
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:31.940
they said it felt like a six month vacation.

1814
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:35.180
I think that this is a problem for me,
right?
In the military.

1815
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.530
You starting really early in the military.
You eat for time,
you eat for,

1816
01:54:39.531 --> 01:54:43.250
to get food and fuel in your system.
And I'm really not a good relaxed.

1817
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:46.640
Let's take some time,
prepare the meals,
sit around and eat it.

1818
01:54:47.170 --> 01:54:52.170
I'm shovel it in so we can go to more stuff as I don't enjoy that enough.

1819
01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:56.180
And I love eating.
I mean,
I love eating,

1820
01:54:56.181 --> 01:54:59.210
but I don't ever just sit and relax and eat.

1821
01:54:59.211 --> 01:55:03.020
I'm always in the game was like trying to get that food down so I can go and get

1822
01:55:03.021 --> 01:55:05.870
after it some more.
And any kind of detailed practice for me,

1823
01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:10.370
where I have immediate feedback,
uh,
is it can put me into that zone.

1824
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:15.600
Uh,
shooting,
shooting steel,
I was just shooting steals.
Uh,

1825
01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.760
particularly if I'm doing any type of drilling at close distance with a handgun,

1826
01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.760
a,
although there are different types of feedback from me.

1827
01:55:25.761 --> 01:55:27.530
If I'm doing longer range marksmanship,

1828
01:55:27.531 --> 01:55:31.760
then I'm thinking more about a lot of my breathing and so on with the,

1829
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:36.560
with pistols,
you know,
if I'm using a whatever glock 34 and then p 45,

1830
01:55:36.561 --> 01:55:38.630
whatever it might be,
uh,

1831
01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:41.810
the focusing on the subtleties of

1832
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.110
<v 5>predicting when you're going to pull the trigger,</v>

1833
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:51.140
the flinches and the sort of stutters and stammers that can affect the shot and

1834
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:54.870
then making an adjustment and then taking the next 10 shots.
I just,

1835
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.910
I find that endlessly interesting isn't the right word.
Endlessly focusing.

1836
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.530
That's another thing that the military kind of screwed up for me because the

1837
01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:08.760
shooting in the military on the best ranges in the world with all unlimited

1838
01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:11.340
ammunition and all,
that's what your genes,
your job.

1839
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:14.550
And so you get in this mode where you're just loving it and,

1840
01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.590
and then you get in the civilian world and you know,
you go to the range and the,

1841
01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:22.500
the ammunition costs money right here,
you're all angry about that.

1842
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:24.480
And then they say,
oh,
you can't shoot steel in this range.

1843
01:56:24.481 --> 01:56:26.400
And what about moving targets?
What about,
you know,

1844
01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:28.280
I want things and you just get used to it.

1845
01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.330
So you get spoiled in the military a little bit.

1846
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:33.150
And there's some great civilian ranges out there as well that offer the same

1847
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:37.710
thing that I'm love to utilize.
It's awesome.

1848
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:40.290
A good,
all right.

1849
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:46.370
I like that there's some kind of a dichotomy between zen state and shooting,

1850
01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.320
but it's all in the Irish flute.
My preferred.
I'm kidding.

1851
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:56.070
Okay,
cool.
All right,
now here's,
here's another one.

1852
01:56:56.071 --> 01:57:01.071
So when I retired from the navy and got out and started the consulting business

1853
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:06.831
working in one of my risk averse friends that was staying in the military for,

1854
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:14.430
it's
it's welfare program,
right?
It's a,
it's a paycheck.

1855
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:17.280
Right?
And he,
the guy wasn't,
you know,
he wasn't all fired up anymore,

1856
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:20.040
but he was in and so you had a mortgage to pay and kids to feed.

1857
01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:23.580
So he just staying in and he kind of looked at me when I was getting out and I

1858
01:57:23.581 --> 01:57:27.210
said,
yeah man,
I got bills to pay too,
but I'm gonna go and get after it somehow.

1859
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:30.570
And he said,
what are you gonna do with it if it,
you know,

1860
01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:32.630
if the business doesn't work and you end up in a,
you know what,

1861
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:35.040
you're going to come back in and about what,
what,
what are you going to do?

1862
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.950
You won't be able to get back in,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
And I said,
Bro,

1863
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:43.290
worst case scenario,
everything goes to hell.
Guess what I'm going to be doing?

1864
01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.010
I have an Rv,
I will be in my RV with my family.

1865
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:51.120
We'll be driving up and down the coast of California rating Jujitsu schools and

1866
01:57:51.121 --> 01:57:54.450
Training and I'll be surfing and it's all good and it won't cost me barely

1867
01:57:54.451 --> 01:57:56.220
anything to do that.
My retirement would cover,
would be good to go.

1868
01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:01.590
You got a backup plan like that?
Well,
let me,

1869
01:58:01.591 --> 01:58:05.730
let me rephrase that.
If you needed a backup plan like that,

1870
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:11.880
what would it be?
This is,
this is one of my favorite topics.

1871
01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:12.510
Uh,

1872
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:17.510
so I would say that I have an infinite number of backup plans and the way I

1873
01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:23.031
think about that is by doing what I call fierce setting.

1874
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:28.170
So much like you just said,
looking at my goals,

1875
01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:29.790
the worst thing that could happen,
the weeds,

1876
01:58:29.791 --> 01:58:34.290
I could mitigate that and the way I could get back to where I am now if all hell

1877
01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:35.124
struck at once,

1878
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:40.170
helps me to remove the fear of taking these,

1879
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.130
these steps that paralyze me.
Otherwise.

1880
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:45.970
<v 4>The second part is by say,
practicing fasting,</v>

1881
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:49.480
practicing spending no money for certain periods of time.

1882
01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.390
I don't fear,

1883
01:58:52.391 --> 01:58:57.070
I would say the top handful of things that tend to stop people from taking what

1884
01:58:57.071 --> 01:58:58.300
they perceive as risks.

1885
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:03.660
The other very important thing is that risk has a very specific meaning for me

1886
01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:10.300
and I realized early on that people talk about risk tolerance taking risks,

1887
01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.770
but if they don't define it clearly it can.

1888
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:18.610
It can end up being paralyzing and how nebulous it is.
So for me,

1889
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.020
risk is very simple.

1890
01:59:20.021 --> 01:59:24.100
It is the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome.

1891
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:29.020
That's it.
So most things I do,
even though people look at it,
they say,
oh my God,

1892
01:59:29.021 --> 01:59:31.480
this guy's in vec investing in speculative startups.

1893
01:59:31.481 --> 01:59:36.130
When it's just one guy in an idea,
man,
he's a risk taker.

1894
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:40.090
I don't view myself that way.
All I view myself as if anything,

1895
01:59:40.091 --> 01:59:44.140
someone who's very has taken a lot of time to get good at mitigating risk.

1896
01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:48.520
I'm a risk mitigator.
Uh,
and in the case of say,

1897
01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:49.570
specular investing,

1898
01:59:49.571 --> 01:59:54.130
I am only using money that I can comfortably afford to lose.

1899
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:59.350
And for me,
backup plan,
similar to yourself,

1900
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:05.030
she and I throw my dog in an RV because it get them instant oatmeal sleeping

1901
02:00:05.321 --> 02:00:07.330
bag,
you know,
seventies right in my backyard.

1902
02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:09.700
I don't know how to go find some dirt bag climbers and hang out.

1903
02:00:09.701 --> 02:00:13.390
They're good to go.
Yeah,
go hang out with my parents,
get to see more of them.

1904
02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:17.620
Go for a run in the woods while I'm trying to figure out the next step.

1905
02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:18.310
[inaudible].

1906
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:21.850
Then you had that attitude when you were taking more legitimate risks.
I mean,

1907
02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:25.740
right now,
obviously you're,
you're pretty good to go and,
but,

1908
02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:29.790
but in the beginning would you moved out to the west coast?
You have,

1909
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:32.650
you had to have the similar attitude of,
because I know I did that,

1910
02:00:32.651 --> 02:00:36.850
that that attitude for me freed me like a worst case scenario.
I lose everything.

1911
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:41.290
Cool.
I still have my RV.
It's paid for.
Yeah,
we're good.
Yeah,
totally.

1912
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.730
I had that attitude,

1913
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:47.500
surfboards and any other human should ever have and not knives and surfboards.

1914
02:00:48.610 --> 02:00:51.010
We roll deep.
I,

1915
02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.420
I think I had that realization early on and of course when I first graduated

1916
02:00:55.421 --> 02:00:59.290
from school,
went out to the west coast,
I did not have a lot of money.

1917
02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:02.770
I remember when I came out to California for the first time for a job interview,

1918
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:04.060
I couldn't afford a hotel.

1919
02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:07.150
I stayed at the Fairtex kickboxing gym on the second floor,

1920
02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:10.930
sleeping on a bunk bed with a Thai instructor sleeping above me and washed my

1921
02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:14.980
clothes in the sink.
And I was happy.

1922
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:19.480
I mean that I was fully content.
I didn't feel like I was missing anything.

1923
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:25.240
And uh,
uh,
but let's not kid ourselves.
I mean,
when I first moved out,

1924
02:01:25.241 --> 02:01:28.360
it was 1999 this is at the peak of the bubble.

1925
02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:33.420
Rental prices are out of control and I was making 40 grand a year pretax and

1926
02:01:35.471 --> 02:01:40.430
it's um,
yeah.
And My,
my office,
my desk was in the fire

1927
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:44.120
<v 3>exit.
I mean they was completely illegal.
I was,
I had to,</v>

1928
02:01:45.130 --> 02:01:47.540
I had a,
a pretty slick setup,

1929
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:50.380
but it was very low budget and uh,

1930
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:55.640
but really what I think freed me on some level is realizing in this,

1931
02:01:55.730 --> 02:01:59.030
hopefully this doesn't sound Turkish or arrogant or whatever,

1932
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:03.980
but no matter what difficulties might be follow me,

1933
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:07.310
whatever,
uh,
unemployment might come my way.

1934
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:10.070
There are people with fewer resources,

1935
02:02:10.071 --> 02:02:14.900
with less education who have figured it out before and survived.

1936
02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.200
So if dozens or hundreds or thousands of millions of people have figured this

1937
02:02:20.571 --> 02:02:25.070
out,
I'm going to come out the other end and be fine.
And,
uh,
so that,

1938
02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:28.070
that was very reassuring to me that that is a good one.

1939
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1940
02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:33.010
<v 3>We'll move to the next question.</v>

1941
02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:37.600
Any misconceptions about you that you want to clear up?

1942
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.470
Well,
uh,
you,
you actually,

1943
02:02:41.471 --> 02:02:45.340
you actually confirmed a misconception for everybody tonight.
You said,
oh well,

1944
02:02:45.341 --> 02:02:48.010
you know,
Jack,
who's going to train somebody?
He's going to need to beat them.

1945
02:02:48.011 --> 02:02:52.600
And that's like,
people always think that and it's just so wrong,
so wrong,

1946
02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:54.460
so wrong.
I mean,
I,
I don't,

1947
02:02:54.461 --> 02:02:56.590
I'm not going to go into it now cause I talked about on the podcast all the time

1948
02:02:56.591 --> 02:02:58.000
that that stuff is ineffective and you,

1949
02:02:58.150 --> 02:02:59.860
you actually have to lead people and when you,
yeah,

1950
02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.570
so that was a good misconception.
You piled on.
I'll have Dalton,

1951
02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:08.420
I'll spend another five years trying to debunk that and prove to people that are

1952
02:03:08.421 --> 02:03:13.210
not a drill instructor with a lash.
But it's good.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

1953
02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.080
Which was,
was deliberate.
I'm just done
Jocko.

1954
02:03:17.110 --> 02:03:20.350
So effective at busting my balls on Twitter and then everyone takes it
literally.

1955
02:03:20.351 --> 02:03:24.460
I'm like,
okay,
well I have this opportunity.
But the,
so first misconception,

1956
02:03:25.150 --> 02:03:28.120
so the cocaine and Horace only twice a week folks,

1957
02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:34.210
it is not disabling.
Uh,
that's a joke.
Internet by the way.
So the,

1958
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:39.220
I'd say the biggest misconception is,
uh,
and it's very understandable.

1959
02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:40.780
Look,
I mean,
my book titles,

1960
02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:44.590
I didn't expect the four hour thing to become a thing.
So the four hour workweek,

1961
02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.370
funny story behind that,
the,
the original idea for the title and I had dozens,

1962
02:03:48.371 --> 02:03:52.630
but the one that,
that I ended up testing first was the two hour work week,

1963
02:03:52.631 --> 02:03:55.450
which was about the amount of time I'm spending managing my company at the time.

1964
02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:57.183
And uh,

1965
02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:00.160
some people at the publisher like that's way too unrealistic to hours a week.

1966
02:04:00.161 --> 02:04:04.260
And I was like four.
And they're like,
that's so much better.
I was a good chin.

1967
02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.830
Perfect.
Nailed it.
And uh,

1968
02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:10.300
it sounds like a product you'd see after like the spray on hair and before the

1969
02:04:10.301 --> 02:04:11.650
rotisserie chicken at three in the morning.

1970
02:04:11.651 --> 02:04:13.270
And it sounds like a different person,
so I get it.

1971
02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:18.160
But the biggest misconception from people who have not read the book or books is

1972
02:04:18.161 --> 02:04:19.030
that I,

1973
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:20.900
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1974
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.870
<v 3>Advocate idleness.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1975
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:26.450
And that's not the case.

1976
02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.390
I have no problem with hard work as long as it's focused on the right things.

1977
02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:32.840
So I think of maximizing per hour output.

1978
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:36.800
That doesn't mean I advocate dropping a bunch of acid and like watching your cat

1979
02:04:36.801 --> 02:04:41.120
walk the House for 12 hours a day.
That doesn't do much good for anyone.
Uh,

1980
02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:43.840
so that,
that's the biggest misconception.
Yeah.
Uh,
I,

1981
02:04:43.841 --> 02:04:47.820
I have no problem with hard work.
I just am a whore doing something.

1982
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:49.140
Well that shouldn't be done at all.

1983
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:52.160
I think that's a waste of skill and a waste of energy,
uh,

1984
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:55.420
that that's the biggest there.
There are plenty of other ones,
you know,

1985
02:04:55.430 --> 02:05:00.120
something to that you need to watch out for is just because you work hard

1986
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:03.570
doesn't mean that you're doing good.
Right?
I mean,
there's,

1987
02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:05.550
there's a bunch of little sayings about that,

1988
02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:08.790
but just because you're working hard at getting up early and you think you're

1989
02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:11.460
getting after it,
you might be moving a lot,
but you're not making any progress.

1990
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:12.480
And there's a big difference there.

1991
02:05:12.481 --> 02:05:14.670
And I think that's something that people need to work watch out for as well.

1992
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:18.000
Right.
So the,
for instance,
I think the prioritize and execute

1993
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:24.210
people need to stop.
I think that's such an important starting point.

1994
02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:27.990
Like what you do is infinitely more important than how you do something.

1995
02:05:27.991 --> 02:05:31.290
If you have a list of unimportant to do's and you're killing it with the

1996
02:05:31.291 --> 02:05:35.970
unimportant to do is that's,
that's still chalking up to a loss.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1997
02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:40.930
Uh,
and you're still losing my friend.
You're still losing at,
so for me it's,
I,

1998
02:05:40.931 --> 02:05:43.260
I,
when people ask me about time management,
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.

1999
02:05:43.630 --> 02:05:47.250
Like if you don't have time,
you don't have priorities.
So focus on the,

2000
02:05:47.251 --> 02:05:49.920
what should you be doing.
And for me,
you know,

2001
02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:54.000
if the effective executive by Peter Drucker is,
is the classic there.

2002
02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.420
Don't worry about your apps and your email management and so on.

2003
02:05:57.421 --> 02:06:02.070
Just read a book that's a few decades old that just talks about prioritizing.
Uh,

2004
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:06.120
so the,
the biggest misconception.
Yeah,
just the whole four hour stick.

2005
02:06:06.121 --> 02:06:09.450
That is my blessing and my curse forever.
That part.

2006
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.030
That's another reason why this is my first book with a four hour in the title.

2007
02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:15.690
Oh.
Hopefully it'll sell.
We'll see.

2008
02:06:15.691 --> 02:06:20.220
I also lost the Timothy and went to Tim just so I don't have to feel like I'm

2009
02:06:20.221 --> 02:06:22.110
going to chastise by my mom every time.
I'm like,

2010
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:25.020
what made you interviewed Timothy on the first ones?
I don't know.

2011
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:30.210
Sounded more official.
I have no idea.
I honestly have no idea.
Oh,
awesome.

2012
02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:33.960
All right.
Uh,
we're getting,
we've got one more question here.

2013
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2014
02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.390
<v 3>You as a leader,
right?</v>

2015
02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:43.600
There's actually millions of people that follow you,

2016
02:06:44.590 --> 02:06:49.180
right?
That listen to you,
that respect what you say.

2017
02:06:50.370 --> 02:06:50.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2018
02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:55.700
<v 3>And they,
they truly follow your lead.
I mean,
clearly they follow your lead.</v>

2019
02:06:55.701 --> 02:07:00.170
We saw this with,
uh,
with the,
the launch of where the release,

2020
02:07:00.171 --> 02:07:03.120
what's it called when a book comes out,
when my book comes out.
Yeah.

2021
02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:07.090
You'd kind of predicted everything that was going to happen to a tee of like
VIP.

2022
02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:09.600
When we talk about this book,
it's going to,
you know,
can people go and buy it?

2023
02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:14.210
That's good.
And so people clearly follow you and listen to what you say.

2024
02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:15.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2025
02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:19.520
<v 3>As a leader,
and I don't know if you've for see yourself that way,</v>

2026
02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:22.370
but you are a leader.

2027
02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:24.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2028
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:28.940
<v 3>Two questions.
One,
where do you think you fall short and too,</v>

2029
02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.030
and more important?
Where are you trying to lead people?

2030
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:41.290
<v 4>Yeah,
these are good.
Uh,
so I haven't thought of myself as a leader,
but</v>

2031
02:07:46.110 --> 02:07:50.730
I think that two terms sometimes get used interchangeably and I view them is

2032
02:07:50.731 --> 02:07:53.910
very different.
So as a leader,

2033
02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:56.940
if I'm looking through that lens at myself,

2034
02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.260
I think I'm very good at

2035
02:08:03.090 --> 02:08:08.090
affecting national conversations and steering the attention of groups to one

2036
02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.470
thing for sustained periods of time.

2037
02:08:10.710 --> 02:08:13.530
I think I'm very good at that and helping people to prioritize.

2038
02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:17.280
If I were to view myself as a manager,

2039
02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:22.410
I think I have many deficiencies.
Uh,

2040
02:08:22.710 --> 02:08:25.290
and one of them would be,

2041
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:29.850
and this has been a help and a hindrance,
as many things are,

2042
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:33.090
uh,
inpatients,

2043
02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:38.960
I have extremely high standards and hold myself too,

2044
02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:45.960
a ridiculous degree of expectation for perfection,

2045
02:08:45.961 --> 02:08:49.110
which of course it leads to a lot of the problems we've talked about earlier.

2046
02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:51.090
But on the flip side,

2047
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:56.130
I get a lot done in part I think because that is a driver that can also damage

2048
02:08:57.151 --> 02:09:02.151
relationships very quickly and it can in a management environment,

2049
02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:08.070
uh,
cause hurt feelings and people to not put forth their best because they feel

2050
02:09:08.071 --> 02:09:13.071
like they're being criticized and not lauded for their successes.

2051
02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:16.140
And in part that is because as an athlete,

2052
02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:20.130
I really hope,
hopefully it doesn't sound weird.

2053
02:09:20.131 --> 02:09:23.700
I don't really care if it sounds weird actually in sports and in business,

2054
02:09:23.701 --> 02:09:26.370
my general feeling was,
and I remember a mentor early onset,

2055
02:09:26.371 --> 02:09:29.910
something like this to me,
he said,
don't tell me about the good stuff.

2056
02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:32.730
The good stuff takes care of itself.
Just tell me about the bad stuff.

2057
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:36.450
And that's always been my personal policy for myself,

2058
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:41.670
but that does not always translate well to team environments.

2059
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:47.580
So that,
that I think is my,
my,
my homework that,
uh,

2060
02:09:47.581 --> 02:09:48.210
and,

2061
02:09:48.210 --> 02:09:53.210
and a deficit that I've been working hard to correct for the last few years is

2062
02:09:54.001 --> 02:09:59.001
getting better at managing people who do not necessarily conform to that mindset

2063
02:09:59.401 --> 02:10:02.360
at all times,
which I think can be,
uh,

2064
02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:05.400
a big problem when it's,
when it's out of control,

2065
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:07.320
but that that would be the biggest deficit.
But if we're,

2066
02:10:07.321 --> 02:10:12.321
if we're defining leader as someone who can put forth a vision or an objective

2067
02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:20.760
or catalyze a movement and move attention and people in one direction,

2068
02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.070
I feel like I'm quite good at,
at,

2069
02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:27.620
at mitigating the risk of that.
Uh,

2070
02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.920
because for instance,
people think that the haters,

2071
02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:35.570
this is a very popular on the Internet and not all critics are haters of course,

2072
02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.540
important to be able to take criticism and feedback,

2073
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:43.630
but many people who were thrust into a position where they have the opportunity

2074
02:10:43.701 --> 02:10:46.790
to lead people virtually on there,
on the Internet,

2075
02:10:46.791 --> 02:10:51.350
which is a huge responsibility.
And I take it extremely seriously,

2076
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:56.090
worry about,
say their detractors causing problems.

2077
02:10:56.150 --> 02:10:58.850
It's not the detractors and my experience that can do the most damage.

2078
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.340
It's the die hard fans who get the message role,

2079
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:07.730
who get the directive and misinterpreted that that is where you have to do

2080
02:11:07.731 --> 02:11:10.130
damage control and to think ahead.
So I think,

2081
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:12.950
I think I'm quite good at that as far as where I'm leading people,

2082
02:11:12.951 --> 02:11:17.240
if I'm leading them anywhere.
Uh,
I,

2083
02:11:17.241 --> 02:11:18.890
I've always,
I shouldn't say always,

2084
02:11:18.891 --> 02:11:23.891
but for the last at least five years thought of my goal as creating a benevolent

2085
02:11:24.831 --> 02:11:26.210
army of

2086
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.280
super learners effectively who can teach intern 10 additional people each the

2087
02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:36.854
same skillset.

2088
02:11:38.210 --> 02:11:43.210
So to propagate a tool kit that enables people to be elite problem solvers

2089
02:11:44.481 --> 02:11:49.481
instead of accidental hap hazard problem creators is ha has been my goal for at

2090
02:11:52.941 --> 02:11:54.020
least the last five years.

2091
02:11:54.021 --> 02:11:59.021
Explicitly teaching people how to learn so they can teach people how to learn.

2092
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:03.710
That's right.
And part of learning is problem solving.

2093
02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:06.650
So you were by by definition,

2094
02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:10.430
getting people who are good at dissecting problems,
testing assumptions.

2095
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.800
That's where I'm leading people now.
That's,

2096
02:12:16.130 --> 02:12:16.920
that's solid.

2097
02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.990
<v 0>I mean that's obviously a really positive thing.</v>

2098
02:12:18.991 --> 02:12:20.700
I always talk about the fact that,
you know,

2099
02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:23.610
I want to help people learn how to learn.

2100
02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.120
I talk about that all the time and I've said that before on the podcast deal.

2101
02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:30.720
We will teach people how to,
not,
not what to think,
but how to think.

2102
02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:36.980
And obviously I'm not the same scale that you are in terms of volume of masses

2103
02:12:37.021 --> 02:12:37.854
of people,

2104
02:12:38.070 --> 02:12:43.070
but there's definitely some people out there that I think are following me in

2105
02:12:44.071 --> 02:12:47.250
some way.
And that might be a strong word,
but I always think of that.

2106
02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:51.090
What I'm trying to get people to do,
if you're following me,

2107
02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.960
I'm really trying to get you to follow yourself and lead yourself.
I don't,

2108
02:12:56.990 --> 02:13:01.380
I don't,
you know,
lead yourself.
Okay,
you see it my path.
That's cool.

2109
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.540
My Path was good.
I liked my path.

2110
02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:08.730
Now forger bath,
you know,
figure out where you want to go,

2111
02:13:08.731 --> 02:13:11.790
how you're going to get,
how you're going to get stronger,

2112
02:13:11.791 --> 02:13:13.770
how you're going to get faster,
how you're going to get smarter,

2113
02:13:13.771 --> 02:13:17.100
how you're going to get,
how you're going to get better.

2114
02:13:17.190 --> 02:13:22.190
And I always think that those answers work best when they don't come from

2115
02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:25.560
somebody else.
But when they come from yourself.

2116
02:13:26.190 --> 02:13:29.730
<v 4>Absolutely.
And I think also the teaching people</v>

2117
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.560
how to learn,
uh,
enabling

2118
02:13:36.230 --> 02:13:38.930
my audience to learn how to learn.
And when I say that,

2119
02:13:38.931 --> 02:13:43.850
I mean 10 a hundred times faster than would be expected in a lot of domains.

2120
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:47.090
That's only one leg of the stool.
So let's say they're three legs,

2121
02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:52.150
the other two would be teaching them to dissect and manage fear and then the

2122
02:13:52.191 --> 02:13:57.191
third leg would be teaching them to be emotionally aware and resilient in that I

2123
02:13:57.501 --> 02:14:02.501
think is covered largely by stoicism if you take it as a practice and not as

2124
02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:05.900
something to passively ingest.
Yep.

2125
02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:09.910
<v 5>And I just talked about stoicism on my last podcast because somebody hit me up</v>

2126
02:14:09.911 --> 02:14:13.690
on Twitter and says,
do you practice stoicism?
And I was like,
no,

2127
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:17.380
I just said no because you have pretty terse on Twitter.
And,

2128
02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:19.690
and the guy kind of wrote back,

2129
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:22.690
I don't want to say he was offended and I don't want to rehash the whole story

2130
02:14:22.691 --> 02:14:25.970
cause I just talked about in the last podcast,
but you know,
he said,
hey,
well,

2131
02:14:26.050 --> 02:14:29.470
you know what's wrong with stoicism?
And I wrote back,
I'm like,
man,

2132
02:14:29.471 --> 02:14:32.290
there's nothing wrong with stoicism.
I,
I get it.

2133
02:14:32.530 --> 02:14:37.530
But for me to say that I practice it or even that I learned it from studying the

2134
02:14:37.571 --> 02:14:41.170
agents is not true.
I didn't go to Princeton.
I,
you know,

2135
02:14:41.171 --> 02:14:44.650
I didn't study when I was in high school.
I wasn't an overachiever.

2136
02:14:44.651 --> 02:14:48.790
I was an underachiever.
I was,
uh,
I was up troublemaker.

2137
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.360
So I didn't learn anything about stoicism until much later in my life.

2138
02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:57.550
My roots aren't,
my beliefs aren't founded on what I read.

2139
02:14:57.551 --> 02:15:02.450
They're founded on what I lived in.
It's just,
it,

2140
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:05.320
does it make sense?
Yeah.
When I look at it now and people have always asked me,

2141
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:06.640
are you gonna do moccasin rallies on the,

2142
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:08.970
but I'm going to do Marcus Aurelius on the podcast.
And,

2143
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:10.510
and really all I'd be saying does that look,

2144
02:15:10.511 --> 02:15:14.800
Marcus Aurelius said this thousands of years before I did awesome,

2145
02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:20.020
but I would love this,
be all educated,
but I wasn't.
I was just,

2146
02:15:20.050 --> 02:15:23.530
I went down the path that I went down and experience the things that I

2147
02:15:23.531 --> 02:15:27.240
experience in my life and I came to the same conclusions that

2148
02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:28.510
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2149
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:33.180
<v 4>these ancients came to.
So it's an interesting dynamic.
No,</v>

2150
02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:33.521
it is.

2151
02:15:33.521 --> 02:15:38.440
And I think it's worth noting also that if you find anyone who is consistently

2152
02:15:38.441 --> 02:15:43.441
good at operating at a high level in stressful environments,

2153
02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:45.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

2154
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:50.510
<v 4>The tools are the same.
Exactly.
I mean,
if you read one of my favorite books,</v>

2155
02:15:50.511 --> 02:15:55.340
Musashi historical fiction,
fantastic book,
it's all the same shit.

2156
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:59.870
You read that Stoicism,
stoicism is,
Seneca was my real introduction,

2157
02:15:59.871 --> 02:16:04.871
but that didn't come into my life until 2004 so it was after graduation.

2158
02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:08.570
For those of you that want me to do Musashi on this podcast,

2159
02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.440
I'm not going to do it.
Not going to do Musashi,
not tell you why.

2160
02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:15.740
And if you've read it,
you know you can't,

2161
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:19.730
you gotta go through Musashi to get to the end.
Yeah,

2162
02:16:19.731 --> 02:16:21.560
you got to go through the whole thing to get the edit.

2163
02:16:21.710 --> 02:16:26.420
It is one of the best rewards in all of literature to get to the end and the

2164
02:16:26.421 --> 02:16:29.730
end.
This is a,
what's a,
how many pages is Musashi's 900

2165
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.530
<v 3>massive book and it's,</v>

2166
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:37.660
and you have to read the whole thing and it's all good,
but it all comes in.

2167
02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:40.390
It's literally,
I think in my copy,
because I always laugh about this,

2168
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.420
it is two or three pages from the end of the whole book is we're get to the end

2169
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:49.720
of Musashi where you go,
damn,
that just happened.

2170
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.560
Or the payoff,
the payoff is so good and the,

2171
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:55.780
Oh and I'm not going to do it on here cause I obviously I'd have to give away

2172
02:16:55.781 --> 02:16:59.890
the payoff and so I'm not going to do that.
And you have to go and read Musashi.

2173
02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:01.750
It's,
it's awesome.

2174
02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:05.520
And the ending is just as good as it gets.
It's,

2175
02:17:05.521 --> 02:17:08.810
it's as good as it gets and it's historical fiction.
But that happened.
Oh,

2176
02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:12.160
that's documented.
Oh yeah.
And it doesn't get any better.

2177
02:17:12.430 --> 02:17:15.010
So read Musashi for yourself people.

2178
02:17:15.490 --> 02:17:20.490
Maybe I'll give a like a one year lead time and then I'll do it one year episode

2179
02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.880
100 maybe we'll do give people enough heads up.

2180
02:17:24.881 --> 02:17:29.881
Episode 100 we'll go back and do Musashi if I don't give a spoiler alert at the

2181
02:17:29.891 --> 02:17:34.270
beginning because when we saw she's good when you get to the end and go,
yeah,

2182
02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.910
that kind of like the Matrix.
What's that?
The move.

2183
02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:46.320
Is there like a spoiler at the end of the Matrix?
Oh,
does it end up?

2184
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:50.770
I don't know man.
I got to watch more movies.
Echo Charles movies.

2185
02:17:50.771 --> 02:17:53.400
Highly recommended babe involves a pig.
I think you'd like a junk.

2186
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:55.570
Then where did you go?
Did you watch that a bunch of times?

2187
02:17:56.310 --> 02:18:01.140
Then you've got some saved story,
right?
Yeah,
I do.
So I,
I tend to,

2188
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:03.790
when I write books,
so then I don't feel isolated.

2189
02:18:03.791 --> 02:18:06.610
I will generally I write late at night.
That's what I do.

2190
02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:08.530
I sent this so I can do research and interviews and so on,

2191
02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:13.531
but I'll do my writing generally between 11:00 PM and 5:00 AM and so that I

2192
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:15.790
don't feel like I'm sitting in a cave by myself.

2193
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:21.870
I will generally listen to the same track or same album over and over again for

2194
02:18:23.921 --> 02:18:25.810
a given book.
That's how I focus.

2195
02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:30.490
And then I'll have a movie playing on mute in the background so that I feel like

2196
02:18:30.491 --> 02:18:34.390
there are other people in the room.
Now.
At one point I was like,
all right,

2197
02:18:34.391 --> 02:18:38.110
I've seen the Bourne identity 5,000 times.
I don't want to see it anymore.

2198
02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:41.380
I have seen,
because I was,
for the first book I've Seen Shaun of the dead,

2199
02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:43.810
which is a comedy 6,000 times.

2200
02:18:43.811 --> 02:18:45.000
I don't want to watch that anymore cause I'll just say,

2201
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:49.300
I'll just watch it on repeat.
So I might watch a movie five times a night.
Okay,

2202
02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:50.260
let's go to Amazon prime.

2203
02:18:50.261 --> 02:18:54.610
And I pulled it up in the first movie that gets displayed as baby that a little

2204
02:18:54.611 --> 02:18:59.280
pig and farmer hogget and I put it on and I was like,
oh,
this is hilarious.

2205
02:18:59.281 --> 02:19:01.660
This is all right.
Well I'll pick a real movie after this.
And then I was like,

2206
02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:06.400
good God,
this is a fine film
and

2207
02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:12.700
no renegade duck anyway.
Uh,
so yeah.
Yeah.
Baby.
I don't think you'd actually like,

2208
02:19:12.701 --> 02:19:16.870
I think you'd be disgusted with my recommendation,
but I don't watch enough.

2209
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:20.530
I don't watch a lot of movies.
Um,
I think you'd like Narcos,

2210
02:19:20.590 --> 02:19:24.430
which is a mini series.
I've heard of that.
That Pablo Escobar.
Right.

2211
02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:28.400
I think I've heard about that one then.
Then you're,
then you're jumping

2212
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:33.380
<v 4>into what,
like 30 hours of content that is own.
Yeah.
You're looking at about 20.</v>

2213
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:36.560
Then you're in the vortex.
You know what?
You don't want to watch that.

2214
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:41.180
Like when I'm 78,
I'll watch narcos.
Put that on my list.

2215
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:45.290
Did you have any questions?
Echo?
Yeah,
I have a question.
Sure.

2216
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.840
Go Charles timing in for the second time.

2217
02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:52.410
Like I'm going to go to entrepreneurship.
Sure.
You know,

2218
02:19:52.411 --> 02:19:55.010
how it feels like anyway,

2219
02:19:55.011 --> 02:19:58.040
that it's kind of become like a trendy thing to be an entrepreneur.

2220
02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:00.350
Whereas a lot of times like you might even notice people,

2221
02:20:00.351 --> 02:20:01.550
they don't know what they want to do.

2222
02:20:01.551 --> 02:20:05.750
They didn't know what problem they want to solve or product they want to
develop.

2223
02:20:05.751 --> 02:20:07.370
They just want to be an entrepreneur because it,

2224
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:10.400
it seems like it's like this cool,
the cool thing.
Now,

2225
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:14.780
do you find that to be the case and if so,
is that a good thing?

2226
02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:18.950
Yes.
Entrepreneurship.

2227
02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:23.750
I think that it is highly romanticized and uh,

2228
02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.500
it's easy to believe all you gotta do is drop out of college.

2229
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:28.334
And next thing you know,

2230
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:31.850
you're a Zuckerberg and you have a company with billions of dollars.

2231
02:20:31.851 --> 02:20:35.780
But that's not how it works folks.
And uh,
so I,

2232
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:40.880
I do think that entrepreneurship is a mindset.

2233
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:44.390
You don't have to start a company to be an entrepreneur.
It's,

2234
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:46.520
and if you were to look at the Spanish equivalent,

2235
02:20:46.770 --> 02:20:51.620
like empathy and dare to undertake it is someone who makes something happen and

2236
02:20:51.621 --> 02:20:56.450
you can innovate within a company that is not your own within an organization

2237
02:20:56.451 --> 02:20:58.760
that is not your own,
or you can create a company.

2238
02:20:59.610 --> 02:21:03.530
So someone who makes things happen at the end of the day.
So who is it?

2239
02:21:03.570 --> 02:21:05.990
Is it a,
are we in a boom cycle?

2240
02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:09.260
I think if we're looking at tech entrepreneurship,
absolutely.
Uh,

2241
02:21:09.261 --> 02:21:12.710
I think that there are certain experiences every human being should have,

2242
02:21:12.711 --> 02:21:13.640
even if they fail.

2243
02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:18.440
I do think that starting a business or enterprise,

2244
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:23.720
even if it's a side Gig that they moonlight is worth the education.

2245
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:29.330
Uh,
but there's a huge survivorship bias out there.
Meaning,

2246
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:33.230
so you open a Barron's,
let's say,
and Lo and behold,

2247
02:21:33.231 --> 02:21:36.050
you see all these mutual funds advertising.
Oh my God,

2248
02:21:36.051 --> 02:21:40.910
they've had incredible returns for 10 years straight.
Well,

2249
02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:41.360
uh,

2250
02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:46.360
maybe they're just the mutual funds that happened to survive by luck for 10 or

2251
02:21:47.241 --> 02:21:50.360
20 years.
They haven't to place the right bets.
So of the 500,

2252
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:54.040
well the other 490 or no longer advertising,
these are getting,

2253
02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:56.780
if you're getting a false sample size and you see that a lot with

2254
02:21:56.810 --> 02:21:58.970
entrepreneurship,
they don't talk enough about the failures.

2255
02:21:58.971 --> 02:22:03.260
They don't talk enough about the vast majority who will fill.
Is it good?

2256
02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:06.830
I think that it's good for certain groups.

2257
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:11.870
It's certainly good for investors if they can play the game well because even if

2258
02:22:11.871 --> 02:22:16.800
there are thousand shitty ideas,
that might mean if more people,

2259
02:22:16.801 --> 02:22:21.260
a higher percentage of say high schoolers or college students or otherwise are

2260
02:22:21.261 --> 02:22:23.570
going into entrepreneurship,
that you get an extra five,

2261
02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.030
the change in the world at the end of the,
uh,
so I am,

2262
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:32.090
I am a big fan of entrepreneurship even though much like anything else,
uh,

2263
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:37.130
that is perceived as high risk and therefore treated sometimes it with reckless

2264
02:22:37.621 --> 02:22:40.050
abandon where people are throwing hail Mary's when they should be doing risk

2265
02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:42.240
management,
you're going to have a high fatality rate.

2266
02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:48.210
And uh,
I don't view that as a bad thing necessarily.

2267
02:22:48.570 --> 02:22:49.740
But I do think that,

2268
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:55.560
and this is actually a question that Brian Johnson,
who was a friend of mine,

2269
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:57.750
he started a company called brain tree.
It was sold for I think,

2270
02:22:57.751 --> 02:23:01.950
800 million cash to Ebay.
And,
uh,

2271
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:07.030
he saddled,
Huh?
He said he,
uh,
so he,

2272
02:23:07.050 --> 02:23:11.610
he shows up in,
uh,
in tools of titans as well.
But the question that he has,

2273
02:23:11.611 --> 02:23:13.680
because he's constantly flooded with

2274
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:18.480
various questions from entrepreneurs who want to make it hundred million
dollars,

2275
02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:21.390
say,
oh,
what should I do this?
Should I do that?
What about this idea?

2276
02:23:21.391 --> 02:23:25.650
What about that idea?
And he just asks them,
is it an itch or is it a burn?

2277
02:23:26.730 --> 02:23:29.820
And he's like,
if it's just a little itch,
don't do it.
You're going to fail.

2278
02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:33.750
Because for the other people out there where it's a burn,
they can't not do it.

2279
02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:37.310
They're gonna rip your face off.
And,
uh,

2280
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:41.790
that I think is a very good question.
Uh,
and the,
you know,
the other one,
uh,

2281
02:23:41.791 --> 02:23:45.840
which I think originally came from,

2282
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:50.710
we think about this now,
Vander holy fields.

2283
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:55.730
First coach told them that he could be heavyweight or at the time they probably

2284
02:23:56.011 --> 02:23:57.300
cruiserweight champion of the world.

2285
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:03.600
And he asked Amanda if you wanted to do it.
And uh,
he said he didn't know.

2286
02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:06.720
He had to ask his mom.
So he went back as his mom.
Yes,
I would like to do it.

2287
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:09.150
And he said,
well,
is that,
is that a,

2288
02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:14.190
is that a dream or is that a goal?
Those are two very,

2289
02:24:14.191 --> 02:24:17.370
very different things.
So I think that,
uh,

2290
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.500
if you feel like you can't not do it,

2291
02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:22.620
or on the flip side as I would probably approach it,

2292
02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:26.730
if you can look at it as a short term experiment where you're doing a phase one

2293
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:30.030
to see if you can develop any traction and get 10 friends to buy whatever it

2294
02:24:30.031 --> 02:24:34.050
might be and you can cap the downside.
I always think about this first.

2295
02:24:34.051 --> 02:24:37.080
I don't think about the 800 million I might make.
How can I cap the downside?

2296
02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:39.850
Then by all means,
the you're,

2297
02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:43.290
you're taking in my opinion than measured intelligent approach.
Hey,
yeah.

2298
02:24:43.291 --> 02:24:46.500
Throw a bunch on the wall and see if anything sticks because that's not really

2299
02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:51.060
like the,
the trend,
the Fed,
you know,
that I mentioned,

2300
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:54.900
that's not really what it says.
It's like saying,

2301
02:24:55.530 --> 02:24:59.730
I mean now we kind of have this emergence of like the grind work hard and that's

2302
02:24:59.731 --> 02:25:03.750
now that's kind of cool.
You know,
the,
the working 20 hours a week,

2303
02:25:03.751 --> 02:25:08.520
like that's kind of becoming like,
you know,
uh,
uh,
Gary v how,
you know,

2304
02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:13.230
grind and 20 hours a day.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's,
it's,

2305
02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:16.230
it can work.
I think that you just have to be careful.

2306
02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:21.310
What I would suggest everybody do,
and I'm not sure if it's still on Wikipedia,

2307
02:25:21.311 --> 02:25:25.370
I believe it is study cognitive biases.
Yeah.

2308
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:28.990
Humans get themselves into a lot of trouble with cognitive biases,

2309
02:25:28.991 --> 02:25:30.460
whether it's sunk cost fallacy,

2310
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:33.940
you've put x amount of money or time into something and therefore you continue

2311
02:25:33.941 --> 02:25:37.900
to put good money after bad because you feel like you have to make it back the

2312
02:25:37.901 --> 02:25:42.670
same way you lost it.
Or the the survivorship bias that I talked about,
you have,

2313
02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:45.460
there's a big difference between correlation and causation and things that

2314
02:25:45.461 --> 02:25:48.160
happened at the same time and things that,
for instance,

2315
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:53.190
and things that cause something else to happen.
So you just have to ask like,

2316
02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:55.960
have a thousand people who do x,

2317
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:58.660
how many are going to get the outcome that is being showcased?

2318
02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:00.370
And if the answer is,
I don't know,

2319
02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:05.280
then she'd be really careful about assuming that elites to be right.
Uh,

2320
02:26:05.290 --> 02:26:09.950
and for me it also comes back to the adherence.
So if I,

2321
02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:13.750
if I'm trying to coach a hundred entrepreneurs and if I'm talking to three

2322
02:26:13.751 --> 02:26:16.090
entrepreneurs,
it's very case by case.
But if I'm talking to a class,

2323
02:26:16.091 --> 02:26:20.230
which I did for a long time,
class of high tech entrepreneurs,

2324
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:22.180
hundred students,
hypothetically,

2325
02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:27.760
I want the advice I give them to apply to the greatest percentage of people in

2326
02:26:27.761 --> 02:26:29.680
the class as possible or to be usable.

2327
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:33.670
And if I say 20 hours a day,

2328
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.580
there might be one or two mutans who can do that and sustain it.

2329
02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:38.170
The rest are going to flame out.

2330
02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:42.730
And for me in that environment,

2331
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:47.760
it's about finding first the good program you can follow as opposed to the best

2332
02:26:49.181 --> 02:26:54.181
program that will knock out 99% but environment dependent.

2333
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:59.890
Now,
if we're in buds,
okay,
that might be a different situation.

2334
02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:03.010
If you're training dogs for say,

2335
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:07.480
military or police utilization,
probably a different story.

2336
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:12.990
If you are looking for athletes for ultra endurance competition or 24 hour plus

2337
02:27:14.381 --> 02:27:18.670
competitions,
you are looking for mutants.
Make no mistake about it.
Uh,

2338
02:27:18.850 --> 02:27:23.380
but if I'm trying to encourage the greatest number of people to attempt

2339
02:27:23.381 --> 02:27:28.180
entrepreneurship and succeed,
then I'm going to adjust my advice accordingly.
Hey,

2340
02:27:28.181 --> 02:27:30.910
do you ever,
I get a lot of sleep.
For instance,
people are like,
oh my God,

2341
02:27:30.911 --> 02:27:33.370
that Ferris Guy,
he's a four hour,
you must get two hours of sleep at night.

2342
02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:37.510
I've done all sorts of weird stuff with sleep deprivation and I've done

2343
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:40.090
polyphasic sleep where I've gotten whatever it is,

2344
02:27:40.091 --> 02:27:43.630
two to four hours a night for ages on end,

2345
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:48.910
but my default is eight to nine hours a night.
I love sleep.
I'm sorry Jocko,

2346
02:27:48.911 --> 02:27:52.180
but I didn't love it.
Hey,
do you ever get like,

2347
02:27:52.181 --> 02:27:55.810
you know how like entrepreneurship as like this,
the trendy thing to do,

2348
02:27:55.811 --> 02:27:58.870
do you ever get annoyed when you see like Po Posers?
You know,

2349
02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.980
you know how they subscribe to all the things and then they always want to talk

2350
02:28:02.981 --> 02:28:04.990
about it and they use all the jargon?
You know,

2351
02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:09.790
I would say,
I'll tell you what annoys me more.

2352
02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:14.820
I don't mind people who are blissfully unaware and extremely enthusiastic

2353
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:18.640
because quite frankly we,
well,
I shouldn't speak for everybody,

2354
02:28:18.641 --> 02:28:20.020
but I think everybody's been there.
Like,

2355
02:28:20.050 --> 02:28:25.050
I remember graduating in [inaudible] 99 all my God was I excited to get into

2356
02:28:25.131 --> 02:28:27.230
tech and entrepreneurship is,
I remember this back,
I,

2357
02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:31.430
I kind of knew a friend of a friend who sold a company for some ungodly sum of

2358
02:28:31.431 --> 02:28:35.450
money,
340 million.
I was like,
what?
That guy is smart,

2359
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:38.630
but he's not that smart.
And it was a very exciting time.

2360
02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:41.630
And I don't think in that,

2361
02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:46.610
in that world that excitement can be undervalued really.
I think it's the fuel.

2362
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:48.290
I think it's,
it's a big part of the fuel.

2363
02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:55.270
The people who bother me are the B players who think they're elan Musk or the,

2364
02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:04.370
or the once you're lucky,
couldn't pull it off twice.
He didn't attempt.

2365
02:29:04.430 --> 02:29:05.600
Like once you're lucky twice,
you're good.

2366
02:29:05.601 --> 02:29:09.520
The people who had good timing and now think they walk on water like the,

2367
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:14.360
like the kind of,
they start like,
uh,
a course now.
Those kinds of guys.
Oh,

2368
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:17.600
there a million different varieties.
And I mean,
I'd like,

2369
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:19.700
I'd love to see them all around off a cliff,
like lemmings.

2370
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:23.810
I mean they make me absolutely insane because the best of the best of the best

2371
02:29:23.811 --> 02:29:28.580
when you meet them,
they don't act like dicks.
Well,
I should take it back there.

2372
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:32.210
Probably a few,
but in general,
they have nothing to prove.

2373
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:34.580
They have nothing to prove.
Like Marcello Garcia.

2374
02:29:34.581 --> 02:29:38.800
He doesn't walk around with invisible lats syndrome like mean mugging people in

2375
02:29:38.801 --> 02:29:42.530
the street.
Are you kidding me?
He could.
He could destroy all.
He just doesn't,

2376
02:29:42.531 --> 02:29:47.210
he's so far above it.
He doesn't care and he's a nice guy to begin with.
But uh,

2377
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:50.390
yeah,
the,
the folks who walk around with a lot of attitude and her acting,

2378
02:29:50.391 --> 02:29:50.871
here's the,

2379
02:29:50.871 --> 02:29:55.871
here's the description entitled people who feel like the world owes them

2380
02:29:55.941 --> 02:29:59.780
something.
Those people make me insane.
And there's a lot of,
in silicon valley,

2381
02:29:59.781 --> 02:30:03.050
as part of the reason I stopped all of my early stage tech investing two years

2382
02:30:03.051 --> 02:30:07.790
ago,
I was like,
I'm out.
I'm out.
This is no fun anymore for a lot of reasons.

2383
02:30:07.791 --> 02:30:08.810
But that was one of them.
I was like,

2384
02:30:08.811 --> 02:30:13.580
I'm sick of sitting down with people who have something sketched out on a piece

2385
02:30:13.581 --> 02:30:18.500
of paper and now they're asking for $20 million or $20 million valuation.

2386
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:19.281
And I'm just like,

2387
02:30:19.281 --> 02:30:24.281
what have you done a good on Ya rate plan.

2388
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:26.450
I know you want to change the world.

2389
02:30:26.451 --> 02:30:30.650
Like everybody I've talked to today with your photo sharing app.
Fantastic.

2390
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:32.810
What have you built before?

2391
02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:38.450
Because you walked in here and like you're levitating cause you walk on water

2392
02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:41.060
and I appreciate the confidence slash arrogance,

2393
02:30:41.061 --> 02:30:44.660
but what have you actually built?
The entitlement is what I can't stand.

2394
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:49.690
And uh,
one of my favorite answers,
I ask people a lot of the time.

2395
02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:52.460
If you could put anything on a billboard,
what would your answer be?

2396
02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:56.660
So there are a few favorites.
Discipline equals freedom.
That's one.

2397
02:30:57.530 --> 02:31:01.430
Another is no one owes you anything.
That's a good,

2398
02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:04.880
no one owes you anything.
It's from a multiple time world champion.

2399
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:10.400
And,
uh,
yeah,
I think that,
uh,
by Hook or crook,

2400
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:15.320
a lot of the entrepreneurs and otherwise who feel entitled will get served,

2401
02:31:15.321 --> 02:31:17.870
humbled by whether it's by competition or by the universe.

2402
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:20.010
So I don't have to do it myself.
Yeah.
I was

2403
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:22.590
<v 3>going to say,
I don't think it even has anything to do with entrepreneurs.</v>

2404
02:31:22.591 --> 02:31:26.830
You know,
you just get people that are accurate.
That's just the way it is.
Yeah.

2405
02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:31.440
Yeah.
It is interesting that he,
that guy.
Yeah.
My,
uh,
my brother,

2406
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:35.760
he goes to San Francisco from time to time.
He has a tech company,
um,
and they,
uh,

2407
02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:40.050
he,
he,
he said it's interesting that it's this fad now.

2408
02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:43.710
Like you have like groupies of tech entrepreneurship.

2409
02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:48.030
Like you have fanboys you have posers to be a business person.
You know,

2410
02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:50.700
it's not like,
you know,
like a rock star anymore.
It's like,
Ooh,

2411
02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:54.300
I'm a tech entrepreneur.
Oh yeah.
It's a weird environment.

2412
02:31:54.301 --> 02:31:58.170
But I'm very much of the opinion that as perverse as it might seem,

2413
02:31:59.010 --> 02:32:03.990
or as perverse as it is on many levels and weird and unsustainable,

2414
02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:08.940
there's good that will come from it.
The more entrance you have in the race.

2415
02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:12.240
It's just like the more freaks and mutans are going to find those people are

2416
02:32:12.241 --> 02:32:14.160
interesting.
So I'm cool with it.

2417
02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:16.380
I'm just going to wait until there's blood in the streets and the game's a

2418
02:32:16.381 --> 02:32:20.910
little easier for me.
All right,

2419
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:26.400
Echo.
Yes.
Anyone wants to support this podcast?

2420
02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:29.160
How should they do it?
They do by the way,
if they hurt.

2421
02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:33.650
<v 6>Yeah,
on Twitter and whatnot,
they do.
And here's the way.
First off,</v>

2422
02:32:33.651 --> 02:32:36.830
support yourself as I always say,
if you didn't know Tim Ferriss,

2423
02:32:36.831 --> 02:32:40.310
I know you know about this stuff.
What I'm gonna say it anyway.
Supplementation,

2424
02:32:41.730 --> 02:32:43.830
talk about efficiency from time to time.
I know

2425
02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:50.380
shroom tech utilizes oxygen of more efficiently in your body.

2426
02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:52.180
That's what shroom tech sport is for.

2427
02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:56.830
Did I already say that before you said it before anyway,

2428
02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:59.170
it has a bunch of stuff that's on it.

2429
02:32:59.171 --> 02:33:02.680
That's the supplementation that you want to engage in because you don't want

2430
02:33:02.681 --> 02:33:05.680
junk supplements.
So they'll go on at dotcom slash Jocko,

2431
02:33:05.681 --> 02:33:09.460
get 10 10% off and supplement your wallet as well.

2432
02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:14.500
And then of course the Amazon Click through Christmas is coming up.

2433
02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:19.510
Christmas has going
various birthdays.
I'm not going to say when mine is,

2434
02:33:19.511 --> 02:33:23.950
but it's soon.
If you shop on Amazon,
click through our website,

2435
02:33:24.310 --> 02:33:28.180
you can support this podcast in that,
uh,
in that way you,
you're in the mood to,

2436
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:30.030
um,
so yeah,
you go to the website Jocko,

2437
02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:33.610
podcast.com and click through and then do your shopping regardless of what

2438
02:33:33.611 --> 02:33:34.444
you're buying,

2439
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:38.890
whether or not you're buying Tim's book tools for titans or uh,

2440
02:33:39.730 --> 02:33:40.563
or duct tape,

2441
02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:44.520
<v 3>right?
You could buy some duct tape on there.
You can buy tools of titans.</v>

2442
02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:48.480
You could actually use duct tape to make a handle and turn it into a kettle
book.

2443
02:33:48.481 --> 02:33:52.920
As you know,
it's a big book.
You can get Jocko white tea,

2444
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:56.490
which is because it's back,
it's back.

2445
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:59.520
We're there by the time this podcast readings,
I think we'll be there.

2446
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.540
We ordered a ton this time so you can get it,

2447
02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:07.440
you can buy the book extreme ownership.
And if you don't have enough Jocko,

2448
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:11.670
Jocko does make a number of cameo appearances in tools of titans.
That is right.

2449
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:14.430
That is right.
That is a,
I am in tools of titans,

2450
02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:16.290
which is awesome and I appreciate you,
uh,

2451
02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:19.630
you throw in in there gores and um,

2452
02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:24.210
and just a ton of ton of other great information.
Um,

2453
02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:29.020
also got some mugs coming.
You can buy mugs.
It was a good month.

2454
02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:32.320
They say they,
I tried to keep it simple.
You don't,
if they say on it,

2455
02:34:32.470 --> 02:34:35.320
they say get after it because that's pretty much their answer to everything,

2456
02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:37.480
right?
Yeah.
And you can kinda tell like,

2457
02:34:37.810 --> 02:34:42.220
cause it's going to be knock offs potentially.
There's like a,
an official,

2458
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:45.670
it's been approved Jocko,
Jocko proof.

2459
02:34:45.671 --> 02:34:49.180
Some people if they get bumper stickers,
which I might mention in a bit,

2460
02:34:49.181 --> 02:34:52.750
but the envelope that comes,
some of them are Jocko approved.

2461
02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:56.770
That's all I'm gonna say.
Yeah.
These mugs,
these are manly mugs.

2462
02:34:56.910 --> 02:35:00.550
I could fit probably,
yeah.
My entire fist into this mug.

2463
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:04.660
If you get chased by a Cassowary,
you could probably crack at skull with this.

2464
02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:09.500
It's a,
it's very functional piece of porcelain were or whatever.
It may matter.

2465
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:13.300
You do carbon fiber.
Maybe that's what we'd want to purpose.
What else?

2466
02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:19.030
Well,
of course we have the store Jocko store.
If you like shirts,

2467
02:35:19.031 --> 02:35:21.160
if you wear tee shirts from time to time,
hoodies,

2468
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:25.300
winter coming up went to the United States.
Australia,
it might be different,

2469
02:35:25.301 --> 02:35:29.000
but um,
you know,
the,
the heavier hoodies,
but yeah,
sure.
It's if you like,
um,

2470
02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:31.570
shirts and whatnot,
check them out,
see which one you like.

2471
02:35:31.571 --> 02:35:33.160
And then if you buy one of those,

2472
02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.310
that's a good way to support the podcast if you're in the mood to do so.

2473
02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:41.690
And as Jocko said,
the trail,
the mugs and I'm gonna change the,
the,

2474
02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.810
the travel mugs.
Okay.
We're going to improve them.
We're,
we're,
we,

2475
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:51.670
we approved that.
There you go.
I like it.
There you go.
Boom.
Yeah.
But yeah,

2476
02:35:51.671 --> 02:35:54.520
go on there.
See what up.
Subscribe your podcast.
Yeah.

2477
02:35:54.521 --> 02:35:57.670
You described the Tim Ferriss podcast if you don't already.
Probably do.

2478
02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:02.170
Most people do.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Just past was just going to say,

2479
02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:06.040
just passed 100 million downloads the first business interview podcast to do.
So.

2480
02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:07.780
When are you going to start stepping up your game though?

2481
02:36:08.310 --> 02:36:13.120
I know every day I'm trying to step up my game and the youtube channel,

2482
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:17.140
which echo has now begun to engage in,

2483
02:36:17.141 --> 02:36:20.680
which is appreciated by all of us.
Me Over here.
I'm appreciating it.
Yeah.

2484
02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:25.330
So thank you for doing that.
There's more videos coming out.
Excerpts.
Yeah.

2485
02:36:25.331 --> 02:36:30.100
So I,
I do have to kind of disclose disclaim,
whichever.

2486
02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:33.220
Oh,
so I was going into,
uh,
uh,

2487
02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:36.220
through a camera transition phase.

2488
02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:41.470
So the excerpts,
there was a small delay on that,
but the,

2489
02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:46.200
the,
the,
the transition phase is over and we're good to go.
So we'll do more,
um,

2490
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:50.730
excerpt stuff.
I want to make another disclaimer and disclosure,
which is a,

2491
02:36:50.770 --> 02:36:52.270
for those of you see this on video,

2492
02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:55.390
I apologize for shopping at gap kids for my shirt.

2493
02:36:56.050 --> 02:36:59.860
These guys are fucking huge animals and I wanted to feel more competent

2494
02:37:01.390 --> 02:37:06.150
gap kids.
I like it.
Anything else?
Oh,
you know,

2495
02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:07.810
that's it.
Eight also,

2496
02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:13.420
we did it the extreme ownership muster in San Diego,
California.
It was awesome.

2497
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:15.980
If you want to come

2498
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.100
<v 5>and you're on the east coast,
do you want to come?
May 4th and fifth,</v>

2499
02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:24.160
2017 extreme ownership muster number two in New York City Marriott,

2500
02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:29.860
Grand Marquis.
It's going to be awesome.
And I'm going to tell you,
I've,

2501
02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:33.980
I haven't said it yet on the podcast because I wanted to give people the

2502
02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:38.600
opportunity that are already in the game and are tracking to get there,

2503
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:40.730
but it's gonna sell out.
It's selling really quickly.

2504
02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:45.050
So if you want to come by now,
extreme ownership muster,

2505
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:48.980
you'll probably come to this one.
Yeah,
it's in my back yard.
Well,
if I'm on the,

2506
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:51.710
on the east coast especially,
you missed the first one,
but it's all good.

2507
02:37:52.250 --> 02:37:56.600
Hold it against you.
I won't even get into the apology and the explanation.

2508
02:37:57.780 --> 02:38:01.490
I'm looking forward to number two.
Awesome.
Uh,
Tim,

2509
02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:03.260
you got any closing comments?

2510
02:38:05.410 --> 02:38:07.940
<v 4>Closing comment,
just to bring it back to the very beginning.
Uh,</v>

2511
02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:12.610
if you're feeling alone with whatever doubts,
challenges you might have,

2512
02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:14.500
you're not alone.
You're far from it.

2513
02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:18.820
And honestly at this point that if I've learned anything from interacting with

2514
02:38:18.821 --> 02:38:23.140
hundreds of thousands and millions of people on the blog to the podcast,

2515
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:24.890
<v 1>okay,</v>

2516
02:38:24.890 --> 02:38:29.510
<v 4>all humans have the same problems and at the very least you have a large</v>

2517
02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.550
brotherhood and sisterhood.

2518
02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:35.840
Thousands of people at a minimum who are feeling going through the exact same

2519
02:38:35.841 --> 02:38:38.570
thing that you are.
So do not feel alone.

2520
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:44.660
And uh,
that's,
that's pretty much it.
I would say a,
there's some samples up.

2521
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:49.490
People want check it out from tools of titans.
Uh,
I was,
it's,
it's surreal for me,

2522
02:38:49.491 --> 02:38:52.550
but Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the forward,
which is incredible.

2523
02:38:52.551 --> 02:38:57.340
He's in the book and that's up.
The introduction is up.

02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:28.490
I am at jockowillink and of course Tim Ferriss is t Ferris.

2532
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2533
02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:31.080
<v 5>two r's and two s's on Twitter.</v>

2534
02:39:31.350 --> 02:39:34.330
Tim Ferriss on Instagram and of course he's also on that Facebook.

2535
02:39:34.331 --> 02:39:39.060
He's not hard to find and to everybody

2536
02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:43.660
that's listening,
I want to say thanks to Tim.
Thanks Tim for coming on.

2537
02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:48.370
Thanks to Tim for actually getting me to do a podcast.
It was you and Joe Rogan.

2538
02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:52.960
You.
As soon as you press record on our first one,
you press it.
You press stop.

2539
02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.360
You looked at me and said,
you need to do your own podcast.

2540
02:39:55.361 --> 02:40:00.040
And I was pretty packed for time right then because the book was coming out,

2541
02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:03.550
but as soon as Joe Rogan said it did have you to tell me that I was in.

2542
02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:07.030
So thank you for making me do this podcast.
Thanks for coming on.

2543
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:11.980
Appreciate all the support that you've been given me and an echo and the podcast

2544
02:40:11.981 --> 02:40:14.010
and the book and everything else.
Thank you.
It's

2545
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.010
<v 0>much appreciated to everybody else that's listening.</v>

2546
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:19.710
Thanks to you for listening.

2547
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:25.020
First and foremost to the people out there in uniform,
military,

2548
02:40:25.021 --> 02:40:27.420
police,
firefighters,
paramedics.

2549
02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:31.230
By the nature of your very job,

2550
02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:35.130
you are serving all of us.

2551
02:40:35.850 --> 02:40:40.850
So thank you for that service and thank you for the freedom and security that

2552
02:40:41.791 --> 02:40:46.690
you provide us
and rest of the people out there,

2553
02:40:48.610 --> 02:40:53.200
the troopers out there that have your own battles around the world,

2554
02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:56.590
fighting against apathy,

2555
02:40:56.650 --> 02:41:01.650
fighting against mediocrity and fighting like we all do.

2556
02:41:04.721 --> 02:41:08.740
Sometimes fighting against the darkness

2557
02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:13.380
to you all remember,

2558
02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:19.400
remember that this isn't easy for anyone

2559
02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:25.770
remembered that anything worth anything is worth fighting for.

2560
02:41:26.490 --> 02:41:30.570
Remember that the battle doesn't fight itself.

2561
02:41:30.690 --> 02:41:33.900
You are the one that has to fight it.

2562
02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:39.610
Remember that there's a price for victory

2563
02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:46.130
and that price is hard work and early mornings and late nights.

2564
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:51.710
And that price is unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

2565
02:41:56.570 --> 02:41:59.720
In those times when you can't remember everything I just said,

2566
02:42:01.890 --> 02:42:03.180
just remember this one thing,

2567
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:08.230
<v 1>to get out there
and get after it.</v>

2568
02:42:11.170 --> 02:42:14.530
So until next time,
this is Tim,

2569
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:20.350
an echo and Jocko
out.
