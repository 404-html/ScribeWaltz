00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.410
As leaders,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
I see people getting caught up all the times in little things that will not

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.720
affect the outcome unless they let it.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
So I see some white belt blow them in the chain of command.

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.381
It's going all crazy.

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.610
Grabbing their sleeve and this leader on the top like gets concerned about it

7
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.810
and put time and effort into something that doesn't matter whether it's a little

8
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.660
personality rub,
a little keigo uprising.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.800
It's should we do it this way or should we do it that way?
Doesn't matter.

10
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.290
That's a little sleeve grab.
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.680
And I see people getting caught up on things that don't matter all the time.

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.650
And what I've realized is it's something that I figured out a long time ago.

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.160
I don't know when,
but a long time ago I figured out,
you know what?

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.800
That thing doesn't matter.
I'm not going to worry about it.

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.660
That thing doesn't matter.
I'm not going to worry about it.

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.900
That thing doesn't matter.
I'm not going to worry about it.
That thing matters.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.950
I'm going to focus on that thing and that makes,

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.740
that makes a big a big,
big,
big difference.
It's,

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.850
it's leadership capital because if I'm investing my leadership capital and

20
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.920
getting your hand off my sleeve or trying to do it my way instead of your way or

21
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.340
trying to keep your ego in check if that's what I'm investing my leadership

22
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.030
capitalists,
I have nothing left to invest in the thing that's actually matters.

23
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.880
Just like if you're a black belt in someone guys grabbing your sleeve and you

24
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.540
focus on pulling that and off your whole time you're going to waste energy and

25
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.010
maybe even give a position cause your,

26
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:32.550
cause you were focused on something that did not matter.

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.030
So it is important to realize and to learn to differentiate between things that

28
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.490
don't matter and things that do matter.

29
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.070
<v 1>Yeah</v>

30
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.450
<v 0>and in order to tell the difference between those two things,</v>

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.060
you have to be able to detach

32
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.670
and step back.
And obviously this is the same thing,

33
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.480
not just with Jujitsu,
not just with leadership,
not just with combat.

34
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.240
Cause it's the same thing in combat.
You're going to have things that don't,

35
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.840
things aren't happening on the battlefield that don't matter.
Little,
hey guys,

36
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.640
move in here instead of there.
That doesn't matter.
Oh,

37
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.400
this guy's moving there so it doesn't matter.
The enemy is doing this.
Okay,

38
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.390
it doesn't matter.
Oh wait,

39
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.990
the end we did that thing that matters or one of my guys did this thing that

40
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.824
matters.

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.120
So how do you learn to discriminate between the two?

42
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.180
You have to be able to detach from it.
That's what you have to do.

43
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.210
You have to be able to detach and

44
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.390
<v 1>okay,</v>

45
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.750
<v 0>if you,
if you don't learn to detach,</v>

46
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.370
you're going to constantly get tripped up on things that don't really matter.

47
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.500
And I'll tell you,
the more,

48
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.970
the better you get,
the less things matter.

49
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.900
The better you get.
The last things matter.

50
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.660
And the better you get,
the more the more important things matter.
Hmm.
So you,

51
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.680
you end up just wasting no energy on things that don't matter.

52
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.130
And focusing all your energy on things that actually matter.

53
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770
And this is the difference,
man.
This is how you win in Jujitsu.

54
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.080
This is how you win as a leader.
This is how you win in combat.

55
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.520
And this is truly how you win in life.
Think about all the things you don't,

56
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.440
what you used to talk about a lot.
You haven't done it in a while.

57
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.250
You just talk about distractions now.
Things can distract you.

58
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.500
That's totally true.
That's what I'm talking about.

59
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.280
The things that distract you from what actually matters.

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.710
So you have to,

61
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.910
you have to figure out how to detach from those things.

62
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.420
I was doing some reading as is per norm.

63
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.280
There's a guy named Keith Douglas.
He was a British soldier,
World War II.

64
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.980
He's kind of a bad ass.

65
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:43.981
He was stuck in an administrative position in October of 1942 during the second

66
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.540
battle of El Alamein.
And so he was stuck in this administrative position,

67
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.990
so he just went AWOL and went to the front line and join the fight and got after

68
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.340
it.
And one of the things.
