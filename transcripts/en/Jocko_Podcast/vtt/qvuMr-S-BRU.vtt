00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
This is Jocko podcast number one 23 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.910
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.033
<v 1>Now,</v>

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
<v 0>this podcast is the third in a series of podcasts that I've done,</v>

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600
and if you haven't listened to podcasts,

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.050
number one 21 and one 22 then go back and listen to those episodes before you

7
00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:33.520
listen to this one.
The first of those podcasts,

8
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.400
number one 21 tells the story of chesty puller.

9
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.110
The iconic and heroic Marine Corps legend that fought in five wars was awarded.

10
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:51.661
Five Navy crosses the most of any servicemen ever where he retired as a three

11
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:56.170
star general.
After rising through the ranks

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.493
<v 1>from private</v>

13
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 0>podcast,
one 22</v>

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.460
tells a much different story.
It tells the story of chesty polars son,

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.740
Lewis Polar Junior,

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.950
who also joined the Marine Corps

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.360
who fought in Vietnam,

18
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.780
who is horrifically wounded and continued to fight against pain and against loss

19
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:29.381
and against depression and addiction when he returned home from war.

20
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.540
Then in the end,
he lost that battle

21
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.730
after falling back into the downward spiral of alcohol and prescription pain

22
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:47.330
killers.
He became another statistic.

23
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.860
Rob The most dreadful kind.

24
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.860
He turned the gun on himself and took his own life

25
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.440
and as I said at the beginning of this series,

26
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:11.441
I was seriously questioning whether or not I could do this podcast.

27
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.150
<v 0>If I had the where with all to gut through the pain</v>

29
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.420
of that story and more important if it was the right thing to do for is the

30
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.180
right thing to bring this story to light

31
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.740
because clearly the story does not have a happy ending.

32
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.873
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.580
<v 0>You're not wondered if there was any good at all to be found in it.</v>

34
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.613
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
<v 0>but I also know that darkness left on checked and ignored is darkness that</v>

36
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.194
grows.

37
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.660
<v 0>And if we do not learn from the past,</v>

39
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.120
then we know we are condemned to repeat it.
Yeah.

40
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.850
There was one more compelling thing that allowed me to go forward in producing

41
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.620
this series of podcasts.
About a year ago,

42
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:18.310
I think I was in Texas and I was speaking at the Chris Kyle memorial benefit.

43
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.480
Then I met someone there.
He was a marine,
his uncle was a marine,

44
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:26.950
his grandfather was a marine.

45
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.270
Then he had been severely wounded in Iraq

46
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.100
and as I learned more about him,

47
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.420
I came to understand the hell he had been through as much more than just

48
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.940
physical.
Like many veterans,

49
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.020
the psychological wounds were also severe,

50
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.950
but he had fought against the pain,
fought against the loss,

51
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:59.750
fought the fight that so many other veterans fight and he had come out the other

52
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:04.751
side stronger and better and have dedicated his life to helping other veterans

53
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.410
win that fight.

54
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.060
His name is Jacob Shick

55
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.290
and it is an honor to have him on the podcast with us here tonight.

56
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.980
Jake,
welcome to the show,
brother.

57
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.170
<v 2>They should have me real.
Thanks for coming on,
man.
You,</v>

58
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.030
but I'm here to help.

59
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.861
<v 0>Well,</v>

60
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.790
I know you help a lot of people and I want to hopefully get you out there and

61
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.720
reaching even more people or you,
you,
you would,
you,
when I first met you,

62
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:38.970
it was just talking to you.
I don't know.

63
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:43.971
I probably spent a couple hours at some random bar in a hotel somewhere in

64
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.020
Texas.

65
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.720
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

66
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.360
<v 0>And you know,
I was like,
man,
I told you.
Then I said,
you got to call them,</v>

67
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.330
get on my podcast.
But when I was,
like I said,
when I was doing,

68
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.770
when I was reading these books,
I was saying to myself,
I gotta have,

69
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.330
I gotta show the other side,
man,
I've got to show that,

70
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.360
that you can get out of this,

71
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.740
and you'd get through it and there's no better example of that then did you and,

72
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.130
and the fight that you've been through.
So let's get into it,
man.
Let's start.

73
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:13.770
Let's start at the beginning.
Let's start

74
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.120
<v 2>with the young Jake.</v>

75
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.680
A lower did I blocked out most of my child when we talk about Louisiana,

76
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.770
Bossier city,
is that how you say it?
Back in the day,

77
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.380
but now that was what that was until you were what?
12 eight 10 is book.

78
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.180
Boser city.
Bose your city.
You could,

79
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.790
depending on what part of Louisiana here from and pronounce.
I like that.

80
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.540
The other way.
The wrong way.
No,
they're both right.

81
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.310
And both sides of Louisiana will will tell you that to nice.
Yeah.
But yeah,

82
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:46.960
I went to Texas when I was
about 12 and,

83
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:51.700
um,
moved in with my mom.
So I went from like a structured,

84
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.900
disciplined home to the antithesis of that,

85
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.050
which caught up to me pretty quick.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.

86
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.190
<v 0>And so what do you now your grandfather's marine was in the Marine Corps?</v>

87
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.511
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

88
00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:08.511
grandfather served war to fall on the wall and it survived and was,

89
00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:15.360
um,
you know,
obviously the,

90
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.370
the driving factor of my interest of being a marine and because I was really

91
00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:24.960
close to my grandmother growing up and my grandfather passed away fairly young

92
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.250
in his fifties.
And,
um,
you know,

93
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.260
there's a lot of questions about how he passed away and um,

94
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.880
you know,
but,
but we'll never know.
Right.
I mean,
so,

95
00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.910
but my grandmother would talk about my grandfather and her chest is just swell

96
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:46.900
with pride.
You know,
I was the baby of the family.
And so when I would see that I,

97
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.170
I just thought to myself,
and when she talks about me,

98
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.000
I want her to do that same thing.

99
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.470
So it looks like I need to be a marine for that to happen.

100
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.350
Because every time she would talk about him,

101
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.710
something from his time in the service in the marines would be very close to

102
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:08.730
that sentence.
And I knew I want whatever that is.

103
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.110
And at eight years old I made my mind up that I'm,

104
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.830
I'm getting that no matter what it takes,
I'm going to get that.

105
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.440
I mean the only alternative was death.

106
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.490
That was the only thing that was going to stop me from getting it.
And uh,

107
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.680
he and my grandma and my,

108
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.710
and my uncle served in a non and was the second generation marine who's still

109
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:38.180
very much alive and uh,
it,
he's,
you know,

110
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.470
pretty,
he's pretty salty and it was funny man,

111
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:46.280
because before I went to boot,
I talked to him,
was sent off.

112
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.780
Jack know I'm about to go,
what do I need to know?

113
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.750
This is all he said.
I said,
be loud,
be facet,
don't volunteer for anything.

114
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.750
That was it.
So I'm on the phone and like waiting for the follow up.

115
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.530
I was like,
okay,
that's it.
He loud be fast,

116
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.350
don't volunteer everything I got to go,
I'm hungry.
And you know,

117
00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:13.230
it's funny,
man,
as he's right.
That's really,

118
00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:16.290
you know how many young dudes I've told that to?
They're like,
Hey,

119
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.160
what do I need to know?

120
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.770
I bet you I've said that three dozen times to in front of,

121
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.200
<v 0>it's almost the complete opposite of what were the master chief of seal team one</v>

122
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.950
until we were not going to there.
And he said,
keep your,
keep your mouth shut,

123
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.470
keep your ears open.
Don't forget anything and don't be late.

124
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.760
That's what he told me.
And,
and you've,
I volunteered for everything.

125
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.690
I was dumb but fired up.
I was a fire it up kid.

126
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.610
Well not a lot.
Not Lots of changed.
No,

127
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.770
it's actually interesting because in the,
in the,

128
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.950
in polar juniors book he's talking about as,

129
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.970
as they're in there in the basic school and they're getting ready to select for

130
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.010
what they want to do and they start getting graffiti on the desks and people are

131
00:08:56.011 --> 00:09:01.011
like a motor t and out in three who gives a fuck drive a truck and they're just

132
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.420
being there like not all of them.
A lot of them started looking toward going,

133
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.620
hey man,
you know what,
I don't want them to that.

134
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.950
And very few of them were saying,
Hey,
I want to be an infantry platoon commander.

135
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.910
And that's what a lot of them got where they wanted it or not.

136
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.610
<v 2>Maria in the middle.
A lot of them got war rather they wanted it or not.
Yeah.</v>

137
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.630
Well like I was just telling you

138
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.320
<v 0>he was,
he was ocs.
Basic School,</v>

139
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.810
20 days leave in Vietnam is between the commander.

140
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.220
<v 2>Oh,
welcome to the courtroom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just when you think the green,</v>

141
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:38.140
when he can't get any harder,
you know it,
it can,
there's no limit.

142
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.570
I mean it's just true.
It's like a man with me.
It was never,

143
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.000
I never question,
you know,

144
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.860
I became a decent football player when I got to Texas,

145
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:52.750
which is basically how I graduated high school,

146
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.900
not basically that's how I got to high school.

147
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.640
I was lucky enough to be selected as a captain my senior year and I played for

148
00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:07.630
five a Texas football team,
which was,
it's the real deal in Texas,
man.

149
00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:12.631
And it's just under the NFL in terms of how many times our team would get

150
00:10:13.991 --> 00:10:18.820
together and we'd be like,
we would like list out all the college teams.

151
00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:23.440
We were totally sure we could beat just young and stupid man.

152
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.740
I'm bumming.
And it's just,
it's crazy cause you see the,

153
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.750
the athleticism difference between,

154
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.280
especially when you go to your big schools and the,
and the NFL,

155
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.260
it's the speed.
It's crazy in the strength it,
I mean all of it,

156
00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:40.480
the agility,
it's night and day.

157
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.420
It's night and day and it just goes to show these young kids,

158
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.900
you don't know shit.
You think you know a lot.
You don't know shit.
I mean,

159
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.460
I was that way and I mean we'll really,

160
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:56.170
I still don't Marcia and I'll be 36 this month and I,
you know,

161
00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:59.140
I mean anyone who comes up to me and they're like,
hey,
I got it figured out.

162
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.420
You know what I said?
Perfect.

163
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.480
You no longer need to be in my circle because I'll never learn anything from it.

164
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.260
I know I'm going to die a student of life.
But man,
I,
I was,

165
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.590
I loved football.
That was,
that's what I thought high school was for,
you know,

166
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.050
and so it,
it was the old cliche thing.

167
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.740
It was semi small city.
Um,

168
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.540
where in Texas where your top hill Cappell Copt ELL locale boys and uh,

169
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.740
you know,
had it not been for the,

170
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.030
for like my counselor and the principal and all those people,

171
00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:40.720
like I wouldn't have graduated because I was pretty spent from the,

172
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.920
the political crap by the time,
you know,

173
00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:48.190
my senior year rolled around and I just didn't know if I wanted it.

174
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.650
I didn't know if I wanted to deal with it anymore.
You know,

175
00:11:50.651 --> 00:11:51.650
I didn't know if I wanted to

176
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.320
play the game that comes with playing the game and it just got to where it was

177
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.970
like,
you know,
this is,
it's kind of bullshit cause it's like growing up,
right.

178
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:07.480
And small town in Louisiana where you go to church every Wednesday,

179
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.830
every Sunday morning and you put on your Sunday best and you go to church and

180
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.770
you act a certain way or you're out in public and you act a certain way.

181
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.810
You know,
because you get home and the doors close.
That's all bullshit.

182
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.120
I mean we're being conditioned as little kids like,
hey,
just,

183
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.710
just fake it till you make it.
And

184
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.880
<v 3>I'm all right saying that now.
So you got,
so when you were in high school,</v>

185
00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:36.300
you kind of got tired of playing the game.
You were just thinking now,

186
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.950
didn't you join the Marine Corps?

187
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.770
<v 2>Yeah,
beginning of my senior year it was,
I was already 18.</v>

188
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.990
I didn't tell anybody that was a good idea.

189
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.110
And that one over famously with my dad,

190
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.590
cause my dad thought I was going to go play ball at a small school because,
uh,

191
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.130
because I miss more days my senior year.
Then I actually went to,
well,

192
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.850
because when football season was over I was like,
sweet,
I'm done.
Yeah,
that's it.

193
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.100
I'm like,
I don't need to do this school shit anymore.
It's overrated.

194
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.350
But I knew it was not,
you know.

195
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.020
<v 3>Did you join,
were you planning to go active duty or were you in the reserves?</v>

196
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.830
<v 2>No.
So I'd signed up in my recruiter who I'll never forget.</v>

197
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.080
It was a,
he was legit,
man.
You hear a lot of like,

198
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.580
horror stories about recruiters.

199
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.710
<v 3>I literally have a question in here.
I was like,
how was your recruiter?</v>

200
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:30.130
Because so many people have good recruiters stories one way or the other.

201
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.590
They either screwed him or totally took care of him.

202
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.050
<v 2>So my recruiter,
first of all,</v>

203
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.990
he got me out of a lot of stuff where I was like,
dude,
we're nowadays,

204
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.840
there's no way it just wouldn't fly.
And I was like,
how the hell did you do that?

205
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.750
Don't worry about it.
You just better be at maps.

206
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.520
Want to tell you to be at Max my Bro,
you can drive me if you want.
But he,
uh,

207
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.190
he had,
so they,
you know,

208
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.600
most recruiting stations are like inside a shopping center or whatever.

209
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.400
So they were right next to like a big grocery store chain.
And,
uh,

210
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.580
one day some,
some dude goes and still some stuff and,

211
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.350
and uh,

212
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.360
he chases him down and like whips his ass in the parking lot.

213
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.780
So he was a firefighter in the core,
right.
So,

214
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.950
and I volunteered for infantry.
I was like,
I'm going to be on a big drunk.

215
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.490
He tried to talk me out of it for months.
It's like,
Jake,
Jake,

216
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:29.410
you really don't want to do.
I was like,
no,
that's what I want to do.
And uh,

217
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.220
but he chased the dude down and I was like,
see,
that was for me,

218
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.510
that was affirmation from God that I'm doing the right thing,

219
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.860
you know,
these are my people,
this is where I'm supposed to be,
you know.

220
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.730
But it was,
man,
I,
I,
um,
my second,

221
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.440
I think it was the second week of football season and,
uh,

222
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.150
I jacked up my right knee,
my MCL,
my right knee and,
and uh,

223
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.240
when I went and signed the paperwork,
I was on crutches and then in a brace.

224
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.980
And I opened the door and like hobbling and he goes,
what are you doing?

225
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.090
I said,
I'm sure you sign up.
And he goes,
not like that.
You're not,
you know,

226
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.770
I said,
give me two weeks.
We're playing whoever we were playing.
I said,

227
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.740
I'll be on the field,
give me two weeks.
And he was like,
there's no way.
I said,

228
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:20.030
okay,
be here in two weeks.
And he showed up and I played.

229
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.120
It hurt like hell,
but I played through it,
lied to my trainers,

230
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:26.960
lied to the coaches,
was like,
no,
I'm good,
I'm good,
I'm good.
You know,

231
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:29.860
just the young dumb like,
you know,

232
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:35.120
power before Iq,
right.
Just power through.
If you can just power through,

233
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.770
you don't really need the Iq and that's what it'd be stupid.
You gotta be tough.

234
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.920
That's it.
That's it man.
And there's a lot of truth to that,

235
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.030
which we can all attest to that.
Every person,
I don't care.

236
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.660
I don't care if you have a pecker or not.
You can attest to that.

237
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.300
If you're going to be stupid,
you better be tough for sure.
And so we,

238
00:15:56.301 --> 00:16:01.070
but I ended up playing and,
uh,
I signed up,
I didn't tell anybody.

239
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:02.580
And then it was actually,
uh,

240
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:08.590
I graduated by the grace of God and because of high school football in Texas.

241
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.120
And it was,
uh,
it was amazing man,

242
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:18.530
because my dad actually met my recruiter at the high school graduation and he

243
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:21.590
was in his dress blues,
which is,
you know,
the best uniform there is.

244
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.100
No one can argue.
And if you do,
you're just stick.

245
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:32.060
But he,
he walks up and I said,
Hey dad,
you know,
I'd like you to meet my,

246
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.043
my recruiter.

247
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.830
And he looked at me and my recruiter held his hand out to shake his hand.

248
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:39.980
And my dad looked at me and he said,
and your dad did,

249
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:44.150
was this your dad finding out?
Yeah.
Oh Dang.
Let me,
I said,
why would you do that?

250
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.190
And then he looks at marker.
It looks back at me like waiting for me to answer.

251
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.000
I said,
dad,
I would shake his hand.
You're,
you're a banker.

252
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.510
I would shake his hand.
Pretty sure he could take you.
And uh,

253
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.140
he,
he was pissed,
man.
He was pissed because he's,

254
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.910
and I didn't understand why at the time really,
you know,

255
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.320
but later on,
this is 2000,
right?
This is,
uh,

256
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.930
yeah,
2001 actually,
I was at my graduation.
So this is may,
may or June,
2001 okay.

257
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:22.580
So,
yeah,
this is [inaudible] I'm already signed up.
I'm in,
I'm going.

258
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.160
And he,
your dad's thoughts were more around like,
hey,
you should go to college,

259
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:31.850
you should get a job.
You know,
I'm a banker.
It's a good life,
that type of thing.

260
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:35.570
You don't need to go and do this other stuff.
Exactly.
And so,
and so my thing was,

261
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.110
cause there's no war going on.
You know what?
No,
I'm so,
yeah,
no,
I mean it was,

262
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.980
it was quote unquote peacetime and which we all know there's,
those are saying,

263
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:45.290
but whatever,
you know,
whatever,

264
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.860
rainbows and roses and lollipop's people want to have in their safety bubble.

265
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.460
But we,
you know,
we,
I knew that that was,

266
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.030
that's what I was destined to do.
I knew like,
I felt it,

267
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.230
as much as I know that,
like my legs never going to grow back.

268
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.830
Like I knew that much,
that this is what I'm supposed to do.

269
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.440
And I was held men on it hell bit.
And so when my dad was pissed,
I was,

270
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.810
I questioned it because maybe I didn't tell him.

271
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.620
I kept it from him in a myriad of things.
Right.
I mean,
it's never just one thing.

272
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.870
Anything is never just one thing.
Like I love people like,
well,

273
00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:24.150
I know what the problem is.
I'm like,
well,
what do you want to bet?

274
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:28.620
There's more than one because it's,
it's just the way it is.
But he,

275
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.750
I didn't realize and I didn't think about,
you know,
at the time I'm,

276
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.550
I'm 19 at this point and I didn't think about,

277
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:40.551
he had seen what war does to not only a person,

278
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.820
but someone that is his blood is flushing blood.
He's seen the after effects.

279
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.720
You know,
he used to,

280
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:52.020
he saw him with his dad and you all was that his dad was at your mom's house?

281
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.670
That was my dad's dad and his brother.
His older brother.
Yeah.

282
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.530
And so he had seen the after effects and seeing,
you know,

283
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:03.240
my grandfather was a hard man and,
um,
you know,

284
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.390
the way that he was the man when it was okay to be a man.

285
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.460
And you wouldn't get judged for being a man.
Whereas now that's a lot.
I mean,

286
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.050
don't act like you don't want to help talk about it because now it's like,

287
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.620
but you can use either bathroom.
That's okay.

288
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.570
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

289
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.040
I'm looking at you with a blank stare because I'm like detached from all that.

290
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.580
Like all that political,
I don't even,
it's weird man.

291
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:33.660
My life is weird that I don't,

292
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.230
I just kind of evolve and revolve in my own little world.
So when I,

293
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.530
when I hear like when I do,
when that kind of stuff enters my world,

294
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:41.850
I'm just kind of like,
is that really happening?

295
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:44.450
And it doesn't really compute and I move on.
I Dunno.
I don't.

296
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.940
<v 2>Well see,
but when you,
but when you're in my world,
it's almost,
you have to know.</v>

297
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.710
It's all,
I mean,
unfortunately with what we're trying to do.
Yeah.
It's,
well,

298
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.230
it's a big ass mountain.
We're trying to move man.
And it's,
but anyway,
I,

299
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.140
I go to,
I go to boot and I'm actually nine 11 happens.

300
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.780
Yeah.
I'm in my room the night before.

301
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:06.820
And the whole thing behind the reserves was,

302
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.090
so I thought about it and I was like,
okay,

303
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.580
<v 0>so when did you graduate?
In May of 2001.
Yup.
You screw around for the summer.</v>

304
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.730
Being a Texas kid that graduated from high school,

305
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:23.440
let's go into the Marine Corps.
Oh yeah.
That,
that was a real PG rated situation.

306
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.670
100% then,
then September 11th happened.
When's your bootcamp?

307
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.590
When are you leaving for boot camp?

308
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.240
<v 2>Boot camp.
I leave for bootcamp the month after nine 11 check.
So it's all,
yeah.</v>

309
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.490
And so it was,
um,
nine 11 happens.

310
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:41.560
And so the way I looked at it,
it was like,
okay,
you know,
my,

311
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.840
my grandfather was corporal Schick.
My uncle was corporal Schick.

312
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.760
I'm going to raise the bar for whoever fourth generation is.
I mean,

313
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:51.310
cause that's what we're supposed to do,
right.
For those that come after us.

314
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:54.970
And so I was like,
okay,
I'm going to join the reserves still infantry.

315
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.570
I'm always going to stay after he wanted to be a career infantry men.

316
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.710
And then,
um,
I'll pick up the five.

317
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.880
By that time I'd already had my degree.
And then I'll get up,

318
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.040
I'll get my commission,
then I'll be a Mustang.

319
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:14.020
So whoever the fourth generation is the bar set like that.

320
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:17.920
So that was my mindset,
right?
Obviously Johnny G.
Dot.

321
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.710
Had different plans but we,

322
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.720
but nine 11 happens and man it was,
I mean it became very real,

323
00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:29.080
very quick that,
oh,
okay,
well this is,

324
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.740
I mean I was gung ho about it,
but my and my buddy,

325
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.280
we wake up and um,
my,
my mother walks in my room,

326
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.390
like opens the door and beer cans,
like get pushed everywhere.

327
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.950
So first she's like,
what tiles?
And then she's like,
turn on the TV,

328
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:48.160
you were under attack.
And I turned on the TV,

329
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.780
I looked at my buddy and we went to the,
we did the buddy system and the core.

330
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:56.630
And um,
I looked at him and I was like,
Bro,
we're going to war check.

331
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.270
And it was when it,
you know,

332
00:21:58.271 --> 00:22:03.271
for a 19 year old kid you have that sense of let's rock and roll.

333
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.970
But then the smart little,

334
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:10.990
little smart person that lives in the back of your head,
it was like,

335
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.660
this may suck,
like this may suck bad.
Yeah.
But,

336
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:21.590
um,
it didn't obviously didn't deter my,
uh,
my motivation in doing that.
And so we,

337
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.000
yeah,
man,
I left the moth after nine 11,
which was,
you know,

338
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.190
I was right down the street from here and Mcrd San Diego man.
And He,

339
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.240
let me tell you something,

340
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.290
as if Marine Corps drill instructors need any more motivation to be Marine Corps

341
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:39.700
drill instructors.
They had an 11th,
they were ready to get some,
they had it.

342
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.260
It was gnarly.

343
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.980
But no matter from the time that we landed and the time that we got on the bus,

344
00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:52.150
which this was something that always cracked me up because you land,

345
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.470
you can see the depot from the runway,

346
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.280
but for whatever reason,
the bus ride takes like an hour and a half,
you know,

347
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.070
that's welcome to the military in general.

348
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.660
It didn't take long for me to completely understand why that is the way it is.

349
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.190
And so it was,
um,
but from the time,

350
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.260
the first time I stood on the yellow footprints up to him,

351
00:23:19.261 --> 00:23:23.560
now up to this point right now,
today I wouldn't question.

352
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.160
I don't question any of it.
I don't,
I wouldn't take any of it back.

353
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.080
I wouldn't trade any of it.
Um,

354
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.680
I have no doubt that everything has happened exactly the way it's supposed to

355
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:37.540
happen.
I don't believe in coincidences and I wouldn't take anything back.

356
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:37.811
I mean,

357
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:42.811
just because something that I've learned at the ripe old age of soon to be 36 is

358
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:48.530
that you have triumph without trials and tribulation.
Tragedy.

359
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.640
Those are kissing cousins.
You know,
you can't have one without the other.

360
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.530
And where do you go with it is up to you.
And,
uh,
you know,

361
00:23:57.531 --> 00:24:00.920
my life was one hell of a roller coaster ride and it started the first time I

362
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:03.120
still do on those yellow footprints.
Yeah,
I mean,

363
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.770
and it started way before that man started.
You know,

364
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.800
I definitely had trauma before the trauma,
I think.

365
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.800
I think majority of us do because we live in a very spoiled first world society.

366
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.930
And we forget that we're mere mortals.
She's on the special about us.

367
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.640
We're all the same.
We were all just living,

368
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:27.170
breathing a skin jack,

369
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.060
you know,
that's it.
And so I,
when I started boot,

370
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:34.800
it was,
it was one of those deals where the,

371
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.480
the mindset started of the NRD had some leadership skills,

372
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:41.220
thanks to football and team sports.
And I had,

373
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.660
I'd learned that growing up and then in high school I really got to hone those,

374
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:48.470
those leadership skills,
which really helped me and boot.
I mean,

375
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:52.010
I really believe in team athletics because it's,
it's like everything.

376
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.200
No matter what you're dealing with,

377
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.060
the greater good is always going to be bigger than you always.

378
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.130
And you have to hang on to that humility in that I'm just,
I'm just a dude.

379
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.580
I'm just a dude being a dude.

380
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.430
They're bench to do playing the dude's trying to be another dude.

381
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.330
But you know what,
I'm,
you know what I mean?
It's you,
you,

382
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.900
you realize often if you're really trying to do something that's worth doing,

383
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.490
you reminded often how human you are.

384
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.270
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and you know,
I used to tell my guys,</v>

385
00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:27.910
if you're doing something for the right reasons,
you're going to win in the end.

386
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.080
Like,
and that means if you're doing something that's going to help the team win,

387
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.420
you're gonna win.
In the end,
you're going to get what you want.

388
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.860
The things are gonna go the way you want.

389
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.430
If you're doing something for your selfish reasons or for the wrong reasons,

390
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.190
you're going to lose in the end.
Now you might both of those,

391
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.100
the person that's doing it for the right reasons might lose some battles along

392
00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:45.740
the way.

393
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.510
The person that's doing it for the wrong reasons might win some battles along

394
00:25:49.511 --> 00:25:52.720
the way.
But the end game person,

395
00:25:52.721 --> 00:25:54.340
if you're doing the right things for the right reasons,

396
00:25:54.341 --> 00:25:56.950
if you're looking out for the team,
if you're doing it for the good of the team,

397
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.500
you're going to win.
And if you're doing the opposite,

398
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.360
eventually you're going to lose.
That's the way it works.

399
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.620
<v 2>You're 100% right.
I mean,
and you know what?
The history books,</v>

400
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.293
they'll get it right?

401
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.490
<v 0>They do.
It's not about every time we get on it takes,
sometimes it takes years,</v>

402
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.920
sometimes it takes 10 years,
it takes decades.

403
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.890
But the people that are doing the right things for the right reasons,
they win.

404
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.880
<v 2>Yeah.
And that's like a,
it's like I tell guys all the time,
which I still,</v>

405
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.200
the,
the human reality in me still has three.

406
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.070
I have to remind every time I talked to a guy,
when I say guide me,
man or woman,

407
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:29.900
doesn't matter.
But every time I talked to him,

408
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:34.100
I usually start the conversation out with no matter what comes on her out of

409
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:35.600
this hole underneath my nose,

410
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.390
I need you to know I'm talking to myself too every time.
Yeah,
sure.

411
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.610
And I said,
it's,
I say,
you know,
it's none of our business.

412
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.400
What the hell other people think of us.

413
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.520
It is none of my business what anyone else thinks of me.

414
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.460
It should have very little impact on any decision I make every day.
All Day.

415
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.560
None.
It should,
it should have no impact.
Yeah.

416
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.280
<v 0>Yeah.
There's a,
there's an interesting dichotomy in that,</v>

417
00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:08.020
and I've talked about that on this podcast before,
because for me,
right,

418
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.760
I'm a guy that on the one hand I exact same thing,

419
00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.510
like I don't care what people think at the other end of the spectrum,

420
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.000
I absolutely care what,
what everyone thinks.

421
00:27:19.001 --> 00:27:23.530
And I'll draw you into this when you were doing something,

422
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.000
I mean,
when I was doing something in the seal teams,
I'd be thinking always like,

423
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.470
hey,
is this the right thing?
What,
what's this gonna do to my reputation?

424
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.190
What am I got?
One is what is,
you know,

425
00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:35.980
my buddy gonna think of me if I cut the corner here,

426
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.270
if I don't do the right thing.
So my reputation,
the way I was looked at,

427
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.470
I did feel that pressure all the time.
And at the same time,
if someone was like,

428
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.680
oh,
I don't like your clothes or whatever,
I don't care at all.

429
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.830
But things that I cared about and from people that I cared about and respected,

430
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.230
I always had the attitude that like,
yeah,
you know what?

431
00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.860
I do care what they think I do care.
What my,
you know,
I'll tell you what man,

432
00:27:59.861 --> 00:28:02.110
one of the hardest things I had to do what I wrote a book

433
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.400
and like here you are,
you're going to write a book.

434
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.110
You know you're going to write a book about yourself.
It's,
it's,
it's a arrogant,

435
00:28:11.111 --> 00:28:15.280
conceited thing to do.
No matter what you say in the book,
it doesn't matter.

436
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.680
It's your writing a book about,
about you and,
and you know,
lay,

437
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.160
who wrote the book with me,
same thing.
The primary concern for me was like,

438
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:28.630
what are my Bros in?
The team's going to think of me.
Right?
So

439
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.840
that's hard.
But there's,
so there's a balance between those two though,
right?

440
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.180
All right,

441
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.450
<v 2>let me,
let me simplify it.</v>

442
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.220
The people that you're never going to meet.
Yeah.

443
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.060
So I'll Barney style for you those times you need to dumb things down for this

444
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:54.090
guy over here.
Everyone at this table,
let's just be honest.

445
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.530
You,
the people you're never going to meet through,

446
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.540
we'll have little to no impact on your life and you and your wellbeing,

447
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:07.080
hence forth.
It doesn't matter.
They think they matter and that's okay.

448
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:10.640
Let them think what they want to think,
but it doesn't matter.
Yeah.

449
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.550
Now that's 100% right for sure because it's real easy,

450
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:19.650
especially in the line of work.
Then we do that.
We do day to day.

451
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:24.651
It's going to feel that it's real easy for people to sit on their self loading

452
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.950
asses behind their computer screen and pass judgment.

453
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.180
When we continue to grind onward in the face of tremendous loss,

454
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.270
there's something to be said for that.
I mean that's that.

455
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.440
That right there is a test of will and character all.

456
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:48.250
It's all in the face of tremendous loss to say,
okay,

457
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.040
we have to step back,

458
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.630
we have to reassess and we'll readdress what we engage.

459
00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:00.130
Let's adjust our left and right lateral limits,
but,
but they're still grounded.

460
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.750
Take and demons.
The sleigh we have to move forward and burn.

461
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.690
Our pain is fuel because that's what we do.

462
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.000
Cause if not us who?

463
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.490
And so that all that started when I was standing on those yellow footprints

464
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:20.491
because you had this and it's something that you would re people that know their

465
00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:24.100
stuff about the military agrees with.

466
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.000
One thing that can be said about the Marine Corps.
No other branch,

467
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.450
regardless of division,
adheres to tradition as much as the marines.
I mean you,

468
00:30:33.451 --> 00:30:36.280
you asked me about about chesty and I'm like,
yeah,

469
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:38.680
I mean we told them good night every night for three months.

470
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.970
<v 0>The Marine Corps is absolutely,
absolutely correct.
Yeah.</v>

471
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.260
The Marine Corps does not play around when it comes to tradition.

472
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.430
<v 2>And I think that there's
the proof's in the pudding,
right?
I mean,</v>

473
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.290
since 1775 we've shown that.

474
00:30:51.291 --> 00:30:55.220
We'd hear to that and that's what makes us who we are.

475
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.100
And that's why it's,
I think that

476
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:04.430
we have the success rate that we have regardless of being the bachelor children

477
00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:08.750
or the military.
Oh,
not really knowing who her dad is and being poor it,

478
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:13.760
we make it work.
We,
we have since day one,

479
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.730
been able to really define what improvise,

480
00:31:16.731 --> 00:31:19.850
adapt and overcome means we've been able to live that.

481
00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:24.851
And prove situations where outside looking in that's gonna.

482
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.850
It's a,

483
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.850
it's a total loss and come out with a w come out with a victory because of that

484
00:31:32.331 --> 00:31:36.710
very tradition that makes us who we are.
Because when all else fells,

485
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.100
all you have is your gut or,
yeah.

486
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.750
<v 0>Now when you're going through boot camp though there was,</v>

487
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.960
was there any combat veterans there?

488
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.290
I don't think we had one.
Yeah,
that's,

489
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.830
that's a testament to what you're talking about,
right?

490
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.860
Is that even though no one had been in combat in,

491
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.500
well they're probably be a few guys that went to Gulf War.

492
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.270
Maybe there's a couple of guys who went to Somalia,

493
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.830
maybe a couple of guys that went to grenade or something or,
or Panama may be,

494
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:09.650
but those are like onesies and twosies and there's a chance that like none of

495
00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:15.261
your dis had any combat experience and yet the lessons get passed on you.

496
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.580
I had a old,

497
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.580
old Vietnam on here and he was talking about when he came back from Vietnam and

498
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:26.130
he instituted this certain type of training at out in the desert.

499
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.850
And I was like,
I went through that training and he's like,
yeah,

500
00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:31.800
well I put that together like the same,

501
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.970
but it's appointment course where they put,

502
00:32:32.971 --> 00:32:35.520
we'd be traps and put targets to shoot at and all this stuff.
I was like,
yeah.

503
00:32:35.521 --> 00:32:38.640
He goes,
okay.
I made that up and I was like,
oh,
we still do it.
We still do it.

504
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.100
And that

505
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.050
<v 2>tradition in the Marine Corps is like 200 years of things being passed down.</v>

506
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.400
Right.
Solid.
I mean,
it's something that,
I mean,
he listened to it.

507
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.740
Even now it makes me swell fried,
you know?

508
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.790
Like I understand why my grandmother reacted the way she did truly now.
Yeah.

509
00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.470
You know,
and I've,
I've been able to live that.
I've been blessed enough to,

510
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.640
to live this journey that,
I mean,
yeah,

511
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:09.440
it comes with a lot of pain and a lot of hard lessons,

512
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.620
you know?
I mean,
pain is inevitable.
Suffering is optional.

513
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.080
That's something I've learned to,
you know what I mean?

514
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:19.250
It's no one's going to be harder on you than you.
Every day you wake up,

515
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.070
you should just be thinking to yourself,
all right,
today it's me versus me.
Yeah.

516
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.090
You know,
and no one wakes up and goes,

517
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.060
I'm going to go out of my way to be average today.

518
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.580
Like if you wake up and do that,
you need to have a gut check.

519
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.820
So,
so you get,
you get done with boot camp and then you go to Pendleton for,

520
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.670
for infantry China Soi went up to a Pendleton and um,

521
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.830
you know,
it's was fun man.
You know what sucks is in boot.
I was,
um,

522
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.750
I was first squad squad leader up until like a week before graduation.

523
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.950
I think it's just cause of the senior drill instructor didn't like me.
Uh,

524
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.990
I didn't like him either of those,
so it was mutual.
But um,

525
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.190
and there's one I had that I swear if I saw him on the street today,

526
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:07.940
like I'd go find them right now.
I'm not kidding it all.

527
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:13.090
There was one dude that I got had pts from that guy because he was going out of

528
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:17.560
his way to try and mentally break me and it just never happened.
And,
uh,

529
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.230
what do you,
what do you think,
what do you,
why was that?
I think it was just,

530
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:26.231
it became this personal thing to him because he saw how other recruits would

531
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:30.680
gravitate.
Three might've been like jealous of your,
my Downer batch will be your,

532
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:33.620
sure.
I don't doubt it at all.
I don't know.
I mean,
cause he was ugly.

533
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.030
He was not handsome like yourself know,

534
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.480
and obviously I mean moneymaker Bro.

535
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.120
But he,
he was,
um,
but he was,

536
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.900
you could tell the underneath it all like he was,
he was a great marine.

537
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.450
And um,
he,
he,
yeah,

538
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.420
we lied a lot for that guy and few other Duis.
But you know,
it was just,

539
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.640
I was thankful for our bootcamp with the last name,
like Schick,

540
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:05.210
you know what our guides last name was Schmidt.
Her,
that's nice.

541
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:09.080
So for three months he should or go get your brother Shit.

542
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.300
Three months,
man.

543
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:14.990
The only time I ever got emotional and bootcamp was on the parade deck and

544
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:19.991
graduation to when a is the one of the DISB had,

545
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.610
he looked at me and he,
he said,
I got to tell you,
Schick and the,

546
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:29.510
I heard the cook and I got emotional.
Like,
dude,
I got my name back.

547
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.860
I turned her back.
But,
um,
he told me what he told me.

548
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:36.220
And then my dad was there actually in,

549
00:35:36.221 --> 00:35:40.410
in walks by me on the parade deck and tosses mechanic Copenhagen.

550
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:42.450
Wonka didn't even look at me and he said,
good job,

551
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:45.900
let's go eat and like keeps walking.
So I was like,
okay,
still pissed.
I get it.

552
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.490
Yeah,
yeah,
dude.
But it was,
you know,
and like I said,

553
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.630
they're there for years.
I didn't get it.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,

554
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:57.620
go up to soi to Pendleton.
And um,

555
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.550
I loved every minute of that too.
Here's what made it awesome for me,

556
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.840
and this is something that a lot of the listeners will relate to,

557
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:11.841
is that no matter how gnarly it got and boot or how gnarly it got an Soi,

558
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:17.160
or how tired or hungry or just beat down you were mentally,

559
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:18.660
physically,
emotionally,

560
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.820
there were all you had to do was look to your left or right,
because guess what?

561
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:29.520
So are they.
Yeah,
but you go to fall down.
They're right there to pick you up.

562
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.550
No matter how tired you are.
Who doesn't want that?
Yeah.

563
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.360
You can't buy it.
You can't buy.
You have to pay for that with sweat,

564
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:43.590
blood and tears,
period.
And I learned also early on,

565
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.910
you're going to find your great leaders by following the blood trail,

566
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.470
literally and figuratively.
It's not hard to find.

567
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.870
Take off your first four blinders.
You'll find them.
Follow the blood trail.

568
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:02.430
You'll find them.
And I knew the ones that were,
and I knew the ones that weren't.

569
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.710
And now so does.
Everyone else comes out in the wash.
Right?

570
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.880
But we,
you know,
Soi was awesome.
I mean,
I remember the first,

571
00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:14.400
the first weekend that we had Lebeau

572
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.010
what's the first thing that you think that they tell us?
Young,

573
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:24.660
stupid marines and,
and uh,
and Soi Pendleton.
Oh,

574
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:28.500
you're getting your first liberty.
The one place not to go.
Tj,

575
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.760
the one place.
Let me,
where do you think like a van full of us go?

576
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you take a Marine Corps van?
No,
but we should,

577
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:41.820
I would have been impressive.
I can't,
I still to this day,
you know,

578
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:45.300
he left Friday evening.
I to this day,

579
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.910
I can't be there letting me back in the United States like I was,

580
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.520
I was throwed hard.
And uh,

581
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.540
at the time my brother,
I don't know if it was his girlfriend at the time,

582
00:37:56.541 --> 00:38:00.960
[inaudible] was excellent.
She was for some reason here and uh,
and so on cow.

583
00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:03.360
And she was like,
Hey,
come see me.

584
00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:06.510
And I saw her somewhere by the border or whatever.

585
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.700
I'm sure I smelled amazing.
Yeah.
And like the look on her face was like,

586
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.490
how are you breathing right now?
Because,
you know,

587
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:19.860
my idea was when they said turn to on liberty.
Oh yeah,
that's exactly I was,

588
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.650
I was seeking liberty.
Yeah,
no matter.

589
00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:26.220
And I wanted to find what liberty look like.
I've told this story before I was,

590
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.680
we pulled into port one time I was on a ship as a seal platoon.

591
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:32.160
We pull into port and what we used to do,
there's be aligned to get off the ship,

592
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.980
like checking liberty cars.
So when,
uh,
when the ship into port,
we'd

593
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.600
<v 3>work out that take an hour,</v>

594
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.290
then we take a shower and then the line would be gone.
We'd go out.
So we do that.

595
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.560
We're,
we've been in port for like an hour and 15 minutes.

596
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:47.820
We go up to leave and they're carrying a marine back upon this shit.

597
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.190
He's completely covered.
A Pew passed out drunk.

598
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.240
He did that in like 48 minutes,
bro.
That's impressive.

599
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.140
It's getting after it.
Chesty will love those.

600
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.090
I listen.
How do you not respect that?

601
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.850
Because back in the day I would've been like,
I want to hang out with that.

602
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.220
But it's,
I mean,
that's just what,
you know,
this is what we do.

603
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.720
That's what that is.

604
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:21.721
What that is is an 18 year old human being that's been in bootcamp s or why

605
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:27.280
hasn't,
hasn't let loose at all and has become a man by the way,

606
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.670
or at least has been told in some way.

607
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:35.671
This has become a man and that's where the boot stripe,

608
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:41.890
it's like,
Bro,
you're not fooling me.
Right?
Yeah.
I get it though.
I get it man.

609
00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:43.930
Because it's,
you get there and it's like,

610
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.300
<v 2>okay,
did boot did that?
That was you know,</v>

611
00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.000
way more mental than physical and it's,
they're good at what they do.
Yeah,

612
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.760
for sure.
They're good at what they do.
I remember my grandmother telling me,

613
00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:00.200
just remember they have a job to do.
They're doing their job.

614
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.430
Not One thing you go through is going to be personal.
She was wrong.
However,

615
00:40:04.431 --> 00:40:04.940
with that one.

616
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.740
<v 3>Yeah.
Grandma was wrong on that guy.</v>

617
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:13.960
<v 2>Same One.
And she's,
she was a hard woman,
man.
Shoes.
Um,
yeah,</v>

618
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.000
she was one of those,

619
00:40:15.001 --> 00:40:19.380
she used to always say I suffered from what comes up comes out syndrome because

620
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:24.000
there was no filter.
And I love that about her because it was,

621
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.260
it was true.
Like if she didn't like it,
you knew,
you know,

622
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.100
and she would always say,
as far as I'm concerned,

623
00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:32.640
I have one grandbaby talking about me right in front of my siblings.

624
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.200
Her given f tank was bone dry,
give none.

625
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.750
This is the same moment.

626
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.200
The first time she sees me in the hospital and I'm all banged up and she says,

627
00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:46.230
well baby,
I guess God didn't want you to double won't have you.

628
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.970
And I was like,
you know what,
I'll take it.
Me,
me.
Yeah.
I mean,

629
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.580
I had an old world war two marine and I was flying to Vegas for some event or

630
00:40:56.581 --> 00:41:00.690
something.
Maybe I was,
I had to speak at or whatever.
And he said,

631
00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:05.490
just remember young man,
bad breast by the no breath.
I said,

632
00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:09.960
Roger,
that Sir were right on.
But,
um,
then it was,
you know,

633
00:41:09.961 --> 00:41:10.794
boot was,

634
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.980
it was one of those things where you're part of the club but not like,
yeah,

635
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.980
<v 3>you know,
you're just,
when you're an soi,</v>

636
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.720
how do they figure out what position you're going to be in a platoon.

637
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.130
<v 2>So Soi,
it's um,
it's more of a numbers thing.</v>

638
00:41:26.131 --> 00:41:29.040
Such I schooled training is oh three,
11 rifleman,
right?

639
00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:34.010
And then so I go through all the o three 11 rifleman training and know you get

640
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.900
<v 4>to,
you get to finger most of the weapons throughout the,
the infantry.</v>

641
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:41.240
And then it was,
um,

642
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.130
I never understood the humps man.
I never liked him.

643
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.350
I always hated them because it was like,
hey,

644
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:50.990
let's go put on a stupid amount of weight.

645
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.300
Let's go warm up walking around motor t three or four times and look at all the

646
00:41:56.301 --> 00:41:58.940
Vietnam,
all the vehicles that we're never going to use.

647
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:00.590
Like always felt like we were screwing the tax.

648
00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.713
<v 3>No,
actually I can,</v>

649
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.740
I can honestly say I have never ever in my life done what you just said,

650
00:42:05.741 --> 00:42:10.180
which is warm up for a hot pot.
Never done that.
I was always just like,
hey,

651
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:14.050
well I'll warm up for the first eight hours of this deal.
Well,
you know,

652
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.290
some real Corey Cory,
you're gonna warm up walking around the motor t.

653
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.700
I like that.
Yeah.
I get it to the next level.

654
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:25.000
More Mind Games is Milton Bradley Brown.
But it was,
it was the,

655
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.270
the humps that were like,
I was just thinking to myself like,

656
00:42:28.271 --> 00:42:32.980
why don't we utilize all the stuff with motors and the rotors?

657
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:38.500
You're walking around the motor transform,
the vehicles are that could carry,
you

658
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.470
know,
but that was the,
you know,
that,
you know,

659
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.480
we finished Soi and we did you,
a lot of the training was,
um,

660
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.540
<v 4>there were so many times where you would hear the guys cow,</v>

661
00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:00.580
we did this 10,000 times yesterday and we're doing it another 10,000 times
today.

662
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.680
Because as you well know,

663
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.490
we're all really good no matter the caliber of warrior and the amount of

664
00:43:06.491 --> 00:43:11.260
training you have.
We are all class a bitchers.
Yeah,
yeah.

665
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:16.180
100%.
You guys complain about everything,
everything,
everything.

666
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:17.021
You know?

667
00:43:17.021 --> 00:43:20.200
Then we'd go off to these foreign places and these gnarly situations and we get

668
00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:23.010
home and we're like,
I want to go back to that.
And I said,

669
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.180
I know why that is the way it is now.
I know now.

670
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.890
And that's just because as crazy as it is,
it's easier.

671
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.270
Oh yeah.
Well you got to have some fun with it.
Yeah.
Will you come back here?

672
00:43:37.271 --> 00:43:38.104
And it's like,

673
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.720
it's just fricking Jerry Springer and the Kardashians,
like just,

674
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.420
and it's like when can we just utilize an ounce of common sense,

675
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.530
you know,
just please for the love of God and all the totally,

676
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.380
could we just call a dog a dog and a cat,
a cat and a man.

677
00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:00.310
Be a man and a woman.

678
00:44:00.311 --> 00:44:04.920
Be a woman and not worry about everything in between and all the judgment that's

679
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.510
going to follow being what God made you like.

680
00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:12.511
Could we just focus on toughening up and teaching our children who will one day

681
00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:18.550
lead this country that,
believe it or not,

682
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.790
the planet doesn't give a shit about your feelings.

683
00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.370
You're not always going to win.

684
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.550
Then Mommy and daddy are not always going to be there.

685
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.910
Definitely new with the rotor wash from the helicopter.

686
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:38.540
<v 2>Like that's going to go away jack cause this world a little punch you in the</v>

687
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:43.380
mouth and then the laugh,
what do we teach our kids?

688
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.100
One of the,
my son knows,
cause I tell him,

689
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.820
it is my job as your parent to make sure you were prepared to take said punch

690
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.960
and punch back because at some point it's going to happen.

691
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.400
And I would rather you lose,
rather you're,

692
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:06.060
you're in an MMA competition or baseball or whatever it is.

693
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.300
I would rather you lose doing everything properly at a 100% then when not doing

694
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:16.710
the fundamentals of the way you're supposed to and going 50%

695
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.400
and he looked at me like,
well dad didn't know.
Believe it or not,

696
00:45:22.401 --> 00:45:25.900
it's not always about winning because you're going to lose a lot.
Yeah,

697
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.120
it's a life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I mean it's,
it's,

698
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.300
it's something that's just start young,
start young,

699
00:45:32.301 --> 00:45:35.810
letting them know that it's not all rainbows,
roses and lollipop's,

700
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:39.640
that there's no such thing as waking up on your Unicorn Ranch and picking which

701
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.380
Unicorn you're going to ride on,
what rainbow to wherever you go.

702
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.310
<v 0>It doesn't exist.
Can you do me a favor?</v>

703
00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.580
Can you just that last part about no UNICORNS.

704
00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:52.850
Can you not tell my daughter that my eight year old daughter and she's like,

705
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.020
yeah,
she thinks that he's

706
00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:00.000
setting traps and going imagine that.
Hey,

707
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:04.580
so you had done with Soi.
Yeah.
And now and now,
where do you go?

708
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.520
So you are you in the reserves at this time?

709
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.030
<v 2>Yeah.
So at the I get don't the Soi and I go check in and uh,</v>

710
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:15.710
I was late.
No,
that's good.
Call checking in.
Yeah.
So I didn't,

711
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.210
it was a communication breakdown,
right?
Sure.
So I didn't,

712
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.050
it wasn't my fault.
No,
nothing was hell.
This recruit just don't know sir.

713
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.910
But it was a,
a situation the guy checked in with was,
where were you checking it?

714
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.560
W W what were you checking into?

715
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.870
My unit and it was in Basia also known as bowser.
Yeah.

716
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:40.550
So I was supposed to check in with a dude that I was in a boot or soi with.

717
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.210
I can't remember.
We went to booth together or not,
but uh,
he goes and checks in,

718
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:49.150
I believe it was a Friday.
And so he goes and checks on Friday,

719
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:51.890
the first sergeant and then he calls me,
he's like,

720
00:46:51.891 --> 00:46:56.150
Jake first started no where the hell you are.
And I was like,
dude,

721
00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.080
I thought
you're,
he said,
no bro,

722
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.850
he won't see like now.
So I'm there Monday morning,

723
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:10.260
first thing he looks at me and he was like,
well,

724
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:14.250
that whole worried though dog.
I was like,
uh,

725
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:19.050
sorry for sure.
And uh,
you know,
so,
so it didn't tell me that it,
he was like,

726
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.880
I see you keep her.
And I was like,
there's no easy way out of this.
You know,

727
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:28.860
I look around is his office and all of his awards and the accolades.

728
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:33.250
And I'm just like,
I just asked him like,
do you,

729
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.640
can we just go to the gym when you beat shamine just get,

730
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:37.660
let's get this over with.

731
00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:42.190
And I saw all those things where you were when your dad asks you like,

732
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.000
not do you want to be grounded for a moth or do you want the belt?

733
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.530
10 Times out of 10,
I'm like,
you want me to go get the belt for you?

734
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.070
Cause that's easier.
Right?
Let's just,

735
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.430
let's just get through the temporary pain and then move forward and with,

736
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.390
I was the same with first,
sorry,
which I think in the beginning he liked,

737
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.920
you know,
it's a little beginning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because it was,

738
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.480
I developed a bit of repetition over time,
but it was,
um,
again,

739
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.020
liberty,
liberty,
but he was,
um,

740
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.140
little did I know that I was checking in with now sergeant major of the Marine

741
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.430
Corps.
Oh Damn.
And I didn't,
I had,
of course,
you know,

742
00:48:25.431 --> 00:48:30.330
you can't present a future shout on that.
Yeah.
And so it was,
but he was the one,

743
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.960
one of the guys who's,
he's just a marine's marine man.
He's,
he's like you,

744
00:48:33.961 --> 00:48:38.130
you know,
it's like he,
he fell off a poster and there he was,
you know,

745
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.770
like three red stripe,
big matte black belt.

746
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:46.720
I mean drillmaster all,
you name it.
And he did it.

747
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.850
And so he,
uh,
we got pretty tight and you know,

748
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.690
he,
he disciplined me when he had to,

749
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:59.980
but it was one of those things where at the time my unit when I checked in was

750
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:04.360
actually in get mo and they were doing base security and all that stuff.

751
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:09.190
And then they,
uh,
he tells me,
hey,
stay close to your phone.

752
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:13.420
You're going to go meet up with your unit and get well.

753
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.920
Am I get a Roger that first?
Sorry,
are we in 2002 yet?
This is,
yeah.

754
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:21.940
So this is a x,
I was in boot deer and

755
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.970
marine corp birthday and Christmas.
And so this was a

756
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:35.100
flashback to being in bootcamp for the Marine Corp Birthday and Christmas Marine

757
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.820
Corps Birthday.
I don't know if they still do it.
I'm sure they do.
Oh yeah.

758
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.280
But they give you steak and shrimp and like cake in the Chow Hall.

759
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:47.950
So we got back to the barracks and that one day I was telling you about who I

760
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.650
pray to.
God,
here's this cause he's,
he'll know exactly what I am.

761
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.930
Come find me Bro.
And uh,
but we line up,

762
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:58.980
we'd get online in the squad bay and he makes us,
we're,

763
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.860
we just finished this epic mill.

764
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.540
We had more than like a minute and a half to eat.

765
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.810
Got to sit there for a good five or six minutes,

766
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.680
which is an eternity at the time we get back online and start pounding canteens.

767
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.580
Hold them up.
You ever had run back to the hood,
refill them,
get back online,

768
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.240
found the canteens,
hold them over your head.
Empty.

769
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.930
Do again and again and again.
And he said,

770
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.200
we're doing this until every one of you pukes up that mill that you don't

771
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:34.910
deserve.
Yay.
And so,
um,
and we did.

772
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.060
And then the first of course,
chain reaction,
the first few kicks.

773
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.190
And then that just starts like with me,

774
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.680
I would rather seriously be,

775
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.870
have like cruel and unusual punishment done to me than puke.

776
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:54.320
So I'm fighting it like,
like a Mo,

777
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.840
like I'm fighting it hard.

778
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:02.590
And then the company CEO walks in the back door and it was hilarious because the

779
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.930
said the I like goes white like Oh yeah,
cause he's hazing,

780
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:12.410
you know?
And that's when daddy walks in and sees it.

781
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.370
Just walked by all of us.
And he's like,
he had to go back behind this,

782
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:21.540
the racks because he didn't want to get puke on is us against,

783
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.190
you're just puking on the deck right in the middle school.
So yeah,
it was all,

784
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:27.740
oh yeah.
Cause we were just going to duck tail it after the fact anyway.

785
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:33.260
But then that was,
that was Marine Corps boot that was um,
I'm sorry,
uh,

786
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.470
marine corps birthday.
So then Christmas rolls around,

787
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:40.880
same Dai and uh,
it's Christmas Eve,
you know,

788
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:43.310
we do our lights out and I th chesty wherever you are,

789
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:46.610
he opens the door and we'll just say it was like Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

790
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.040
Everyone knows the song,
right?

791
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:54.070
So he opens the door to the duty hut and all you hear is Rudolph the red Bam,

792
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:58.250
the door slam.
And you just hear him go,
that's all you get pitches.

793
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.310
So you hear a lot of these one liners that I got,

794
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.140
I stayed in trouble in the Marine Corps for laughing when you're not supposed to

795
00:52:06.141 --> 00:52:08.960
lie like fat to laugh,
it's common.
I can't hold it,

796
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.260
I immediately lose it.

797
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:15.830
But one of the guys who was already in the targets of the Dei,

798
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:19.700
I started laughing and it was,
I think he was gone like a Dan half layer.

799
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:23.090
Like it was.
Yeah,
but it just,
some of these one liners,
man,

800
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:26.840
it's like you hear him,
it's like where did these dudes come up with this stuff?

801
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.230
But then you see him yelling at trees on the,
on the base and they were like,
oh,

802
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.490
like they're graded on yelling at a tree who wakes up.

803
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:37.760
Like I wanted to do that one wasn't me.
But I,

804
00:52:37.761 --> 00:52:41.930
I checked in the dude's wearing get mo and um,
I stayed by my phone.

805
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:46.070
Phone never rang.
So I got,
I was,
I lucked out.

806
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.260
What were you doing in the civilian?
I said where you live in as a,

807
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:51.680
so I started school drill one weekend a month or whatever.
I started school.
I,

808
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.360
yeah,
I mean,
and I was training,
you know,
getting ready to,

809
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:56.780
cause I knew we were going to go in Iraq or Afghanistan,

810
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.290
just didn't know which one,
you know,
it was being in align unit.

811
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.080
You knew we were going to go.
And so it was um,

812
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:08.780
the guys got home and we started training and uh,
I'm in school,

813
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.470
which went about like high school,

814
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:14.990
went and minus the football

815
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:20.810
and then a honors student.
So you're really hears,

816
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:22.070
it was funny because

817
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.940
I realized early on like,
I can do this,

818
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.100
I can do the school thing.
Huh.
The only downfall to that was,

819
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.960
is it was like,
okay,
I've have been after this for a year.

820
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.620
I've already proved myself I can do this.
I don't need to see it through,

821
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:44.040
but it's now I'm just wasting my time.
You know,

822
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.730
there's a lot of beer to drink and you know,

823
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.100
typical mindset.
But the,

824
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.880
but my unit gets home and I go and meet the guys,

825
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.440
which is like every other you show up to the first time.

826
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.740
It's like going to jail the first time.
Like you're immediately being sized up.

827
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.870
And it's like,
but I was one of those guys who like,
I was not,

828
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.400
I just wasn't going to take your shit.

829
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:14.660
And so it went well for me because I was able to use dumps,

830
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:19.110
shrinks and humor to kind of get in with the,

831
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:24.000
with the guys who outranked me.
And uh,
but they also knew that I,
I love that.

832
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.961
I love what I did.

833
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:29.961
And so the guys get back and this one guy who's a freaking mortar men go figure

834
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.990
and he's like,
Hey Schick,
you're a big dude.
You should be a gunner.

835
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.490
You're going to be governor.
What do you think about being a gunner?
Well,

836
00:54:36.491 --> 00:54:40.380
it doesn't matter.
You're going to be a gunner.
So I was like,
all right,
whatever.

837
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.940
So like 31,
okay,
go be a gunner.
And uh,

838
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.450
then we did our first hump with that system.
I like that.
And I was like,

839
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:52.710
I'm going to beat that dude within an inch of his life.
Cause I knew I could.

840
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.541
And I was like,

841
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:59.180
that son of a bitch should not tell me that th that came with like a tripod and

842
00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:04.120
then it was like,
ah,
sucked.
But it was,
you know,

843
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:06.000
I mean,
you're earning your stripes,
you know.

844
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.670
But it was one of those things where we,
we were just waiting,

845
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:12.150
but we were a tight unit.
We were a tight knit group.
And I think,

846
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:18.030
I think that probably had a lot to do with us knowing that it's a matter of
time.

847
00:55:18.031 --> 00:55:19.020
Right,
right.

848
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:23.610
And most of us weren't prior combat guys when we were young unit.

849
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.940
And um,
it was interesting man,
because it was,
it was a,

850
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:33.390
it was an eclectic group and a group,
a group from all walks of life,

851
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.410
which is something that I always really admired about the military regardless of

852
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:42.411
what branch or special whatever is that you are forced to communicate and to

853
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:47.890
adapt with other people because if you don't,
you're,

854
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:53.010
you're screwed.
Yeah.
And that's something that I always appreciated.

855
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.340
And at the same time at warned me the hell out because there was some guy,

856
00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:00.270
you know there's,
there's some guys that you're just like,
Yo,

857
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:05.250
if I never saw that guy again,
it'd be too soon.
And it's usually just because,

858
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.140
you know it's,

859
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:10.880
<v 0>well I always have to explain to civilians that I'm working with,</v>

860
00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:14.180
cause a lot of people have the impression of civilians that uh,
you know,

861
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.820
the civilians have the impression that everyone in the military is just like a

862
00:56:16.821 --> 00:56:19.930
machine that just is going to do what they're told.
And if you're the sergeant,

863
00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:22.810
the Corp was going to listen to you and it's like,
well I'm not currently,

864
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.740
doesn't like that.

865
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:27.460
Like it'll work like that for a little while and worked for a little while.

866
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:31.360
But over time those,
those,
those young guys will,
or the junior people,

867
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:33.010
if you're not leading them correctly,

868
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.480
you're not going to have to get things done.

869
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.060
<v 2>Oh,
you can turn into a shit show real quick,
real quick,
real quick.</v>

870
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.650
Because you're also dealing with a bunch of dudes that feel like that,

871
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.860
that are of the mindset I can take on this world,

872
00:56:46.861 --> 00:56:51.060
have one hand tied behind my back by myself.
You're dealing with that,

873
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.620
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Those Alpha personalities are abundant.

874
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:56.543
Yeah.
Yeah.

875
00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:01.380
And then you mix in a lot of testosterone is stupidity and you have a very

876
00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:05.540
dangerous situation.
Low Iq,
high tea counts.

877
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.530
That's basically what it is,
is it is.
But um,

878
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.020
<v 0>now did you guys,
did you guys do like the,
so you're doing one weekend,
a month,</v>

879
00:57:15.021 --> 00:57:17.490
a drill and then you do two weeks in the summertime,

880
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.740
but then in what,
2003 you guys would call it per 2004,

881
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:27.650
<v 2>I think we got,
we got the call and it'll three I believe,
if I'm not mistaken,</v>

882
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.750
I've been blown up since then and hit in the head a lot.
So I don't know.

883
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:36.820
I think we got the call and no three saying that we were going to be called at a

884
00:57:36.861 --> 00:57:39.320
certain time and it gave you like a warning order.
Like okay,

885
00:57:39.321 --> 00:57:41.570
it's common pretty much.
And then they said,
okay,

886
00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:46.100
you're going to go do your work up and a 29 palms,
California.
And so we,

887
00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:50.810
you know,
we get to 29 palms.
And I was like,
I remember man,

888
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:56.150
getting off that burden.
I was just like,
this place sucks.

889
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.410
I thought you were going to have something really profound to say no.

890
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:05.570
And you said it took 29 palms this place.

891
00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.610
It was,
I was like,
why?
Why do?

892
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:15.650
Of course the marines would have this base.
Of course it made total sense.

893
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.840
You know,
it was just like,
let the bitching begin.

894
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.460
It was abundant,
bro.

895
00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:26.480
It was abundant because unless you had money to go to palm springs,

896
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:28.340
I'll see you at 29 stops,

897
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.450
run out to get stuff and we are inevitably going to be fighting.

898
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.120
This is the amazing thing.
This is the amazing thing is

899
00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:39.870
<v 0>I get asked or I got to ask on the podcast,
you know,
how do,
how do I,
you know,
my,</v>

900
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:43.440
I,
I checked into a battalion or I think the guy was a company commander.

901
00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:46.920
That morale morale's not good.
How do we get them all good?
Like do hard things.

902
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.380
You want to improve morale,
do hard things.

903
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:52.770
And one of the things like what are you going to do at 29 stumps we can do
there?

904
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.530
Well,
you're going to hang out with each other.
That's what you're gonna do.

905
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.780
It's gonna suck.
You're gonna want to feel to go to sweats,

906
00:58:57.781 --> 00:59:00.930
going to be hot and you can do hard things and you're going to become tighter as

907
00:59:00.931 --> 00:59:05.820
a unit.
That's what happens.
Yeah.
Imagine that.
Imagine that.
Weird,
weird,

908
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:09.030
it's just weird how that works now.
Who was running the training?

909
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:11.520
They have a training cadre out there.

910
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.730
<v 2>So we,
uh,
I'm trying to remember.
It was,</v>

911
00:59:16.731 --> 00:59:17.564
um,

912
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:22.010
<v 0>or are you guys training yourselves or use your,
is your officer leading</v>

913
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.020
<v 2>the trail?
Donny.
Sergeant,
yeah.
I mean we,
we had gunny,</v>

914
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:30.000
there was kind of both,
right?
We had like,
we would go to mount town or whatever.

915
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.400
We would have some mountains truckers out there,
but it wasn't because,

916
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:38.560
I mean a lot of guys were forward deployed.
Yeah.

917
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:43.250
I mean were gone and,
but we,
we literally,

918
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:46.880
we trained,
we trained hard.
I mean it was,

919
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.430
you talk about training for the sake of muscle memory.
We,

920
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:57.520
it was gnarly what we did and it was a,

921
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.010
like he said,
we did a lot of hard things too.

922
01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:05.960
Then we only got tighter and tighter and tighter as a unit,
but we,

923
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.920
it was a,

924
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.880
I mean I remember the first time we went out to do our first training evolution

925
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.790
out at American minds and we,
we hopped out there of course,

926
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:20.240
because you don't want to use the vehicles.
And uh,

927
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.330
I remember we staged,

928
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:27.470
we stage our gear and my platoon sergeant drops us pack and there's like a,

929
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.160
like a little rattlesnake den by where he dropped his pack.

930
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.880
And so we had to go move and then he goes to put his pack on the move and

931
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:39.470
there's a black score Scorpio on his pack.
And I was like,
this is awesome.

932
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:40.863
Like this is,

933
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:45.910
and then we had a ton of bees that were go after the,
the,

934
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.430
the water buffalo and of the trailer,

935
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:53.330
the water trailers and it was like,
we can't,
yeah,
it's just,

936
01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.110
yeah,
it's inevitable.
Marine Corps Shit.

937
01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:02.740
Like it's the suck factor is going to be pegged the entire time.

938
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.430
<v 3>Yeah.
And it was just,
it's,
it's like this guy was just looking down on us,
man.</v>

939
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.930
Like,
Hey,
you're going to earn it
one day.

940
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:16.220
I'm going to have this uh,
team guy,
buddy of mine.
He's got a lot of rattlesnakes,

941
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:20.840
Norris from the desert because rattlesnakes are very amusing.
You know,

942
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.900
once you start catching them and putting them in people's vehicles and putting

943
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:28.040
them in there,
they're back,
pastor.
Just stuff like that.
Like,
yeah.
That's cool.

944
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.990
I'm telling you right now,
I'm not kidding.

945
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:38.420
We want to see someone jump though.
Yeah,
it does.
But Hey,
you know,

946
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:41.650
they don't know that the fangs had been removed.
Rip The thanks Allen.

947
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:44.000
The leatherman asked me how much I care.

948
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.900
You completely missing the point.

949
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.960
It's the principle snake season.
Get some

950
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.120
<v 2>dude.
It was the,
some of the best.</v>

951
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:02.720
The Dark Greens did do not like the,

952
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:08.260
the little creatures and the creepy crawlies and seeing some of the reactions of

953
01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:11.990
some of the dark greens was,
what's the dark greens.

954
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:15.950
They're there to be politically correct.
They're African American.

955
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.130
<v 3>Got Dark Green Marines,
Gotcha.
Calm,
dark</v>

956
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.880
<v 2>greens.
And they know and they call him.
So it's accepted,
right?</v>

957
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.030
It doesn't bother him.
Doug Greene,
they don't write their congressman.

958
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.760
It's unbelievable the way that works.
So they're there.
It's y'all.

959
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.680
And I got to see one,

960
01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:38.681
I just spoke to this a deal a couple days ago and that was yesterday.

961
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.910
And one of the marines I served was there,
his dark green and a man.

962
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:49.800
It was all,
it was pride and seen him in a decade.
Didn't miss a beat.

963
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.240
It was,
it was like seriously didn't miss a beat.
And I'm like,
man,

964
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:56.790
that was God.
Just imagine,

965
01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.840
imagine if mankind could have a taste of that just to taste.

966
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:06.660
It would be,
imagine how much better the spinning ball chaos would be.

967
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:11.670
But it's,
it was awesome.
It was just good to see him and,

968
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.100
and to see the way that he changed.
You just see the maturity over time.

969
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.430
You know,
the of,
of how life can,

970
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.140
it alters your course and alters your mindset because of the things you

971
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:30.030
experienced and you go through and in the how many times you're taught how human

972
01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:34.740
you are,
you know,
it was,
it was cool.
It was good for the soul,
you know,
and uh,

973
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.580
yeah,
it was just cool to see him and be able to embrace that dude.

974
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:43.230
And I mean that's my family.
That is,
I don't give a shit what color skin is.

975
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.920
That dude's my blood and that's just the way it is.

976
01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.160
That's the way it always will be.
But we,
um,

977
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.850
and he used to,
he used to annoy the shit out of me.

978
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.820
Like I used to thought of think like his,

979
01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:02.250
his mouth is never going to shut like one of these days,
man,

980
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.490
one of these days.
And uh,

981
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:09.870
but it was so epic cause it was like,
that's my bro,
you know?
And it was,

982
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.120
it was just awesome,
man.
It just goes to show you,

983
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:17.050
like we get these little reminders in life if,

984
01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.960
if you just shut your mouth and listen,

985
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:23.961
you get these little reminders of how worth it everything's been and what

986
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:29.790
purpose everything is served.
And it was cool to see you that I got one of those,

987
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:34.590
you know,
and it gives me,
it was a little fuel for the soul to it to keep going.

988
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.500
But um,
I remember this,

989
01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.580
our first loss was in uh,

990
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:42.930
March air force base.

991
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:48.260
We were doing how satisfying and abandoned housing unit in March Air Force Base.

992
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.920
And it was,
um,

993
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.240
it was a training laws cause if we guy that they were practicing j turns in a

994
01:04:56.851 --> 01:05:01.710
Humvee and uh,
there's a young kid,
he wasn't our company,

995
01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:06.330
he was a different company,
same battalion and the,

996
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:11.910
the Humvee flipped.
And he was just the inertia of the Humvee flipping.

997
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.050
He couldn't get out of the Turret and uh,
it was up armored.
And so when it flips,

998
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:20.500
it obviously kills the gunner.
There's no way he's going to get out.

999
01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.420
And so mandatory 24 hour safety,
stand down,
let's take our phones.

1000
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:29.740
And all that stuff and you know,
hey,
don't ride home.
Don't call anyone.
This is,

1001
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:32.310
we got to abide by the Sop.

1002
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.780
That was,
uh,
you know,

1003
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.730
that was one of an eye opening deal man.
That was like,

1004
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.580
okay,
this is the real deal.
Like this.
We're not,

1005
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.490
this is the life and death game we're playing.

1006
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.150
And I'll never forget when we got back to 29 palms,

1007
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:54.940
which I don't remember if it was a couple of days later,
three days later,

1008
01:05:54.941 --> 01:05:55.780
a day later,
whatever.

1009
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.680
But we wake up and we go to formation and we walk out to go to formation and um,

1010
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:05.740
men,
everywhere you looked,
you saw a piece of computer paper,

1011
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.630
just a regular piece of paper,
turn horizontally.

1012
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.550
They were taped all over the place.
Everywhere you looked.

1013
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:17.710
And all he said on him was complacency kills.
Everywhere you look,

1014
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:21.010
you saw that complacency kills gunny.

1015
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:25.390
It just printed out all these papers and that to this day,

1016
01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:28.420
that sticks with me.
And I think about it,

1017
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.640
not every,
all the time because we all get complacent,

1018
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.100
but it could not be more true.
Whether it's literal,
you know,

1019
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.240
or figuratively speaking.
I mean you,
and of course in most of our lives nowadays,

1020
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.390
you get complacent.
Yeah.
You might not die,

1021
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.730
but something can be irreversibly damaged.
Well,
yeah,

1022
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:54.580
I mean I talk about that all the time.
They just get complacent.

1023
01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:57.850
Even the complacency on the little things in life that's just putting you down

1024
01:06:57.851 --> 01:07:01.170
the wrong path where that's just the way it is.
That's the reality.
Hey Man,

1025
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.200
let me tell you that

1026
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.960
I could be referred to as captain complacent when it comes to that.

1027
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.470
I'll be the first to tell you that I'm much more centered than saying,

1028
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.870
I always say,

1029
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.120
you know that God gave his only son to suffer and down across as he knew there

1030
01:07:20.121 --> 01:07:25.000
was going to be guys like me.
The only differences is I'm willing to admit it.

1031
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.310
You know,
I'm on my floor.

1032
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.740
Then I say all the time that I've stood with everything from leaders of mankind,

1033
01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:36.130
the presidents to the most savage individuals you'll ever meet and everything in

1034
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:36.964
between.

1035
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.530
The one common denominator is every one of them is equally fundamentally flawed.

1036
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.640
Every single one and no doubt about that and they just have different clothes
on.

1037
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.080
That's it.
That's what I'm saying,
man.
If we could stop,

1038
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:54.160
if we could just stop with this political correctness in this

1039
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.300
false manufactured protection

1040
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.610
we could keep,
I always say if we,

1041
01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:08.290
if you took out self interest and self gain and the fight for the greater good,

1042
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:09.790
imagine where we would be right now.

1043
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:15.440
Imagine where we would be because we would be leaps and bounds ahead of where we

1044
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:16.274
are.

1045
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.880
<v 0>We'd be light years ahead of where we are if there was nothing to be gained to</v>

1046
01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:25.010
help someone that you've never met and they can never repay you.

1047
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:31.810
You just do it because we've been so conditioned to be selfish and it's

1048
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:37.841
unfortunate because that's what I love about this guy was a gift for all

1049
01:08:38.311 --> 01:08:40.610
intensive purposes.
The Godfather,
the Marine Corps,

1050
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:46.340
and people can say how he may have been arrogant or pompous or whatever,

1051
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.060
but I guarantee you he was the last one to eat.
Oh yeah,

1052
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.580
he was definitely the last one to eat.

1053
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:55.950
And actually that book's a great book and there's a,
there's a,

1054
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.840
there's a diff big difference between his reputation of what people thought

1055
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.550
about him that never worked with them.
People that worked with him,
the soul,

1056
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.780
the marines that work with them,
that served with him,

1057
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:10.370
that he would go around their foxholes at night in negative 25 degree weather in

1058
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:15.350
and,
and ask guys if they're okay and give him,
give him a shot of whiskey.

1059
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:18.800
I mean,
he,
they loved him because he cared about those.
He cared about them.

1060
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.710
That's the,
the image.
As a matter of fact,

1061
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.380
like he had this driver that was with him for a long time.

1062
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:28.220
Jones was his last name and [inaudible] Jones.
People would come up and say,

1063
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:31.100
how did you stay with chesty puller for so long?
Didn't eat,

1064
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.030
chew you out and demote you.
And he's like,
no,
the guy never yelled at me ever.

1065
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.180
That's,
that's the difference.
That's the difference between,

1066
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:42.950
that's the dichotomy between what this image was and what he was really like.

1067
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:47.990
The people who he would,
the reason he had a reputation for being,
you know,
super,

1068
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.423
uh,

1069
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.710
I guess I guess direct with people was a way he went up the chain of command

1070
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.320
when he would tell an admiral out on a ship,
like,

1071
01:09:57.321 --> 01:10:00.050
you better put those bombs where we need them right now.
Or you know,

1072
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:03.520
he up the chain of command or he'd come back to America and say,
Hey,
the,

1073
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.760
the binoculars that you're building suck.
And they,
and they steam up.

1074
01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:09.620
We can't see anything.
What's wrong with you?

1075
01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:13.100
So that's where he got the reputation.
But down the chain of command,

1076
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.450
he was not like that.

1077
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.600
There's another great story in there that cover on the podcast where he catches

1078
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:18.141
a guy sleeping.

1079
01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:21.770
I'll watch there and training and he wakes the guy up and he's the battalion

1080
01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:24.900
commander.
He wakes the guy up and he says,
Hey,
what are you doing sleeping?

1081
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.990
One of your captain would have caught you.
He would've,

1082
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:29.840
he would have had me come to court martial you had been a disaster.

1083
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:32.810
You've got to stay awake.
Old Man.
That's his nickname for everyone was old man.

1084
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:37.500
But that's the difference is he cared.
He cared so much about as men and,

1085
01:10:37.501 --> 01:10:39.290
and you know,
that's the,

1086
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.800
that's the incredibly hard part that we were talking about earlier.

1087
01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:43.634
It's like when he's,

1088
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:48.700
when his son comes home from Vietnam and you know,

1089
01:10:49.101 --> 01:10:51.080
he's like,
his heart is broken,

1090
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:54.500
it's broken and he can't even speak and he can't,

1091
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:59.390
he's just convulsing with tears.
And it's because,
you know,
he loved his son,

1092
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:03.620
but his son was representative of every marine and he said that,
you know,

1093
01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:07.250
he said that it was like the,
that the closing that book.
And he tells his wife,

1094
01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:10.850
his wife says,
what do you want to do now that it's all over?
And he's like,

1095
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:12.980
I want to see the face of every marine I ever served.

1096
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.600
<v 4>Dude.
You know,</v>

1097
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:20.870
I mean that right there in it for anyone who's listening to this and questioning

1098
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.660
what is my purpose?
Why am I,
why am I alive?
Why am I here?

1099
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.840
What's the point to things?

1100
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:35.190
And it's the same for every individual.
No matter what country,

1101
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.040
no matter what little village,
doesn't matter.

1102
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:42.690
We all have our here to do two things,

1103
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.460
love and be loved.
That's it.

1104
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:51.120
Everything else is filler love and be loved.

1105
01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:53.523
<v 5>That's it.</v>

1106
01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.100
<v 4>It's hard as shit because we make it harder.
Shit.</v>

1107
01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:59.483
<v 5>That's it.</v>

1108
01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.580
<v 4>When he saw his son,
that all came crashing down on them.</v>

1109
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.230
That's reality.
Yeah.
It was one of those

1110
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.200
liking,

1111
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.200
rather it was in Lewis's situation where when you're severely wounded or you

1112
01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:21.030
lose someone that you love tremendously.

1113
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.000
I mean with reckless abandonment,
you,

1114
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:30.110
you love all the way and if you're of the right warrior mindset or first

1115
01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:34.820
responder law enforcement and you've been around that and you're,

1116
01:12:34.821 --> 01:12:36.060
you're the real deal,

1117
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.610
you're probably just like me or you or you're incapable of loving halfway.

1118
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.420
They're incapable of it because if we did that,

1119
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:53.290
we're taking away from that in which we're supposed to be true to it to honor.

1120
01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.640
And that's,
that's the point.
It's you get,

1121
01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:03.350
you don't get a piece of humble pie you and held the factory all at once

1122
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:09.620
and that's just what it is.
And some guys don't come out of that,

1123
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.173
you know?
And if I'm,

1124
01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.600
if I wasn't surrounded by people that were better than me and that refused to

1125
01:13:18.121 --> 01:13:19.020
love me to death,

1126
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:20.930
<v 5>okay,</v>

1127
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:21.920
<v 4>I would be loose</v>

1128
01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.250
and far be it for me to sit here and look at you and say not an option.

1129
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.480
It's not an option.
Because one thing I've learned in this fight,

1130
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:39.590
this fight of mental health and of this floating noodle in between our ears is

1131
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:44.010
that no one gets a pass.
Nobody gets a pass.

1132
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.900
I don't care who you are,
what you've been through,
what you know,
who you know,

1133
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:51.030
you don't get a pass.

1134
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:57.830
And I've learned that the hard way from having to bury friends over and over and

1135
01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:03.240
over and over
and to talk myself out of,

1136
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.420
you're not worth it.

1137
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:10.830
It would be easier for them if you weren't here

1138
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:17.770
and letting the demons get the better of me.
Like it's a constant dance.

1139
01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.360
Like when people say,
Oh,
well you know Jake Friday,
a lot of pressure off.

1140
01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:26.230
You just work on your,
your,
your work and life balance.

1141
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:32.290
I think because it's,
you just got to find your balance.
Well,
okay,

1142
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:36.130
here's some news.
There is no balance.
It's a constant dance.

1143
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.190
You're constantly trying to figure it out.

1144
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:44.350
It's just like our enemies in Iraq,
Afghanistan,
it's,

1145
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.810
we changed our tactics.
They change theirs,
we change ours,
they changed theirs.

1146
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:52.060
We change ours.
It's a constant dance.
It's never finite,

1147
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.220
right?
Nothing is.

1148
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.810
That's one of the things that makes life worth living.

1149
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.500
I don't want to wake up tomorrow and know what tomorrow has in store for me.

1150
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.750
What's the point?
I just want to wake up and love and be loved

1151
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:13.660
all the way.
Not Halfway be hotter,
be cold.

1152
01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:16.390
If you're lukewarm,
get the hell out of my foxhole.

1153
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:18.100
I don't want to fight with you.

1154
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.750
Let's talk about when you went on deployment now.

1155
01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:31.650
So it's 2004 is when you deploy it like the summer of 2004.

1156
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.620
Yeah.
And where do you guys deploy to?

1157
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:40.780
So we are primary io was the Sunni Triangle,

1158
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.410
the barrack beautiful,
beautiful place.

1159
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:49.420
We landed in Kuwait.
We were only in Kuwait,
I think they called it camp victory.

1160
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:50.830
Maybe.
I can't remember the name of it.

1161
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.340
It was before the pizza huts and subways and all that.
I know that for a fact

1162
01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:00.070
what we go,
we landed Kuwait.
We were only there for a couple of days.

1163
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.630
And um,

1164
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.330
we get on the bird and I'll never forget this.
We were on the,

1165
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.190
on the tarmac and Kuwait getting ready to flow over al-assad.

1166
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:14.200
And um,
I think,
I believe if I'm not mistaken,

1167
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:16.260
it was,
I think we,

1168
01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:20.500
we were on the first three c one thirties we got on,

1169
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.990
we had to get off of,

1170
01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:27.160
cause they weren't mechanically sound or or whatever

1171
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:31.720
or just gun.
He just felt like strong with us.
Who knows?

1172
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:33.940
But we had to get off of him,
but it wasn't gunny,

1173
01:16:33.941 --> 01:16:38.440
cause I remember the fourth one and we're all sweating our asses off August.

1174
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.010
It's miserable.
Miserable.

1175
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.080
And I remember the fourth one,

1176
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:48.070
I don't know if it was the crew chief of the load master,
whoever,

1177
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:53.071
but gunny took some someone somewhere and I'm pretty sure it was a conversation

1178
01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:56.650
pretty much like if this bird didn't take off,

1179
01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.580
you're not going to go home alive anyway.

1180
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.030
It cause it sucked.
I mean,
we were all in me.
We have everything on.
Yeah.

1181
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:10.220
You know,
and were
frontline marine.
So we

1182
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.360
<v 2>were geared out and it's with stuff we'll never use ever.</v>

1183
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:20.090
But it was on the gear list.
Got Abbott.
Yeah.
And so we,

1184
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.280
but we ended up landing in outside.

1185
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:26.630
And I remember when we get off the bird now was,
and I thought to myself,

1186
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.980
man,
29 balls on it.

1187
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:36.280
Well now that I'm Asada do that two year,

1188
01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:39.520
I miss it already,
you know.
And,
um,

1189
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.210
so we,
we get off and we go to our,

1190
01:17:44.211 --> 01:17:48.930
our tent where we're sleeping with our bunk beds and,
um,

1191
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.760
we started the,
the brief the next day and I remember we were,

1192
01:17:55.761 --> 01:17:58.730
is that where you guys were going to be working out of where you guys actually

1193
01:17:58.731 --> 01:18:02.240
going to be camp at?
Stationed at all Assad primarily,
yeah.

1194
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:07.241
But I mean rarely got this stay that's where your headquarters were.

1195
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:11.970
Yeah,
it was [inaudible] battalion was,
okay.
So we start the,

1196
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:13.670
the 48 hour brief

1197
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:20.530
and we're in the middle of that and um,
captain walks in,

1198
01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.990
we're in one of the hangars and you get a look on his face that,
you know,

1199
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:27.820
something wasn't good obviously.

1200
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:31.450
And it was because during the left seat,

1201
01:18:31.451 --> 01:18:35.740
right seat of the unit we were placing got hit and they lost,

1202
01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:37.930
I don't want to misquote it,
but I'm,

1203
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:42.900
one of the guys I was just with this past weekend was there,
um,

1204
01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.250
in that unit we replaced two,
seven,
and it was a,

1205
01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.220
they had lost like a,
like an Xo.
The first sergeant,
like it was bad.

1206
01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:56.300
They guess from a [inaudible] was an IED strike.
I,
yeah,
it was,
it was,
um,

1207
01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:59.400
id with attraction.
They,

1208
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:02.510
it was just a bad situation after action.

1209
01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.170
So they took fire and it was not like,
it wasn't an isolated event.

1210
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:11.070
They hit the lady goes,
and then when they find your one hit with RPGs,

1211
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.520
there's a,
it was,
it was a gnarly situation.

1212
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:17.810
They shouldn't have been in because it happened in a police that was,
yeah.

1213
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:22.260
Friendly.
And,
um,
and at the time,

1214
01:19:22.261 --> 01:19:25.530
actually when we were over there,
I don't even,

1215
01:19:25.531 --> 01:19:27.300
I think we still call them roadside bomb.

1216
01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:28.800
I don't even think we called them ids yet.

1217
01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:33.240
I don't think we utilize that terminology yet,
if I'm not mistaken.
And again,

1218
01:19:33.241 --> 01:19:36.570
I could be wrong.
It's happened before,
but we,

1219
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.570
so we hear this and it,
I mean,
it's just like,
we're like,
oh shit,

1220
01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:46.350
that's not good.
Oh,
that stuff's not supposed to happen.
And um,

1221
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:50.550
so that was another big awakening moment.
Right.
And,

1222
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.380
but we get ready to,
to leave.

1223
01:19:56.790 --> 01:20:01.050
And,
um,
at this time I'm,
I'm a machine gun team leader.

1224
01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.710
Little that I know I'd become leader of the react team.

1225
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.980
Seems Qrf Quick Reaction Force.
And

1226
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:12.930
<v 4>so we,
we have like the 16 vehicle convoy or something,</v>

1227
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.660
which would be a huge no,
no nowadays.

1228
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:20.120
And I remember the Sir walk by and he was like,
Hey Schick,

1229
01:20:20.121 --> 01:20:23.490
we need when you someone a man that pig on the lead vehicle and you're going to

1230
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.590
get bought in at two 40 on the lead vehicle.
And I was like,

1231
01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:28.470
who's going to jump on that pig?

1232
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.930
And we were just in briefs hearing about Guidewire's they'd put Guidewire's

1233
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:37.130
across the road trying to decapitate gunners.
Yeah.

1234
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.180
<v 3>I had left my first deployment and uh,</v>

1235
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.280
I want to say April or May of 2004 so it was Romney right before.

1236
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:49.003
Yeah.
So,

1237
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.900
and I was just trying to think if we were using the term id and I'm almost

1238
01:20:51.901 --> 01:20:55.620
positive we work cause I remember,
I remember,

1239
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:58.290
but you guys are special.
Yeah,
no,
I know but I was trying to think.

1240
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:01.290
I remember like I,
I'm,
I'm actually be envisioning a slide.

1241
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:05.730
We caught an IED maker and,
and we had all this,

1242
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.330
like he had wires and he had,
uh,
like clocks,

1243
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.680
multiple clocks from,
uh,
from like,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1244
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:19.320
timers like kitchen timers.
And he said,
we had wires,
kitchen timers,

1245
01:21:19.321 --> 01:21:23.070
all this stuff.
And they're like,
hey,
this guy you caught,
he's an innocent guy.

1246
01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:25.890
And I was like,
well,
no.
And they say,
well,
no,
he's innocent.

1247
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:28.620
What evidence do you have?
And I,
I brought these pictures and I'm like,

1248
01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:31.800
look at this stuff that we took off this target.
It's all IED stuff.

1249
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:34.440
And they were like,
oh,
okay.
But it was the first,

1250
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:38.010
it was kind of first starting to assemble the idea that people were building

1251
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:41.660
these improvised explosive device.
So I think we were using it.
But you're right.

1252
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.430
Might not a spread to the Marine Corps yet.
At this point.
We're kind of slow,

1253
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:49.290
but we're Dudley,
I don't,
we might have,
you know,

1254
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:53.010
that was a long time ago.
That's a relevant cause.
Roadside bombs,

1255
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:57.300
that wasn't good enough.
It's called an night.
Well,
if it's not,
if you don't have,

1256
01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.360
don't the church don't charge it up.

1257
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:06.510
So what we,
but we're,
we're out there.
We have our convoy and um,

1258
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:08.580
so I asked the guys,
right,

1259
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:11.500
<v 4>okay,
who's going to go man,
that pig and it's crickets.</v>

1260
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:16.930
I was like,
oh,
very well.
I got it.

1261
01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.170
<v 3>I looked at him and say,
Hey sir,
I got it.
I'm going to do it.</v>

1262
01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:24.590
And then of course I know,
okay,
no.
I'm like,
no.
If,
phew,
phew,

1263
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.980
phew,
phew.
When I die.

1264
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:30.860
You just remember what you let her niece to say

1265
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:36.710
cause you were of a Jj and uh,
we'll see a lot,

1266
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.270
a lot more colorful language.
But I jumped up there man.
And it was

1267
01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.250
<v 4>look,
pucker,
factor pegged,
you know,
pegged</v>

1268
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.740
<v 3>like how do you see guidewire?
But can you see the guidewire?</v>

1269
01:22:49.741 --> 01:22:54.090
Does the sun have to be hit in a certain way?
Like what is,
what am I looking for?

1270
01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.240
You know,
you have armored Humvees.
No,
most of them weren't.
Yeah.
And do you know,

1271
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.090
did the most of them are two door soft tops?
Yeah.
Get something.

1272
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:05.060
That's where we had the turret.
Where's the turret?
Six

1273
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.760
<v 2>vehicles.
The six thoughts better isn't comfortable.
I mean,</v>

1274
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:12.700
I'd rather be in that than a Humvee.
If I'm in the lead vehicle,

1275
01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.530
I would rather be in a harrier.
Okay.
But it was,

1276
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:23.050
but we,
that's why you signed up for an infantry gets us right and we hate it.

1277
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:24.430
And you know,
the pilots,

1278
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:29.200
it was like there are a bunch of Prima donnas and we'd see him come in and land

1279
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:32.980
and go to their air condition cans and then we're like,
you know,

1280
01:23:32.981 --> 01:23:36.250
they're eating steak and shrimp.
You know,
they're,

1281
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:41.340
they're all comfortable and they're in there on their sleep number bed.

1282
01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:47.590
You know,
you make all this stuff up in your head.
I'll tell you what,

1283
01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:50.350
you made that up in your head.
We had a,
we had a World War II pilot on here,

1284
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.380
Jim Kunkel.
And he was literally saying like,

1285
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:58.300
hey though the war in Europe for me,
he was a p 38 pilot.
He's like,

1286
01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:01.920
my missions are reckoned it like 45 minutes.
He's like,
they're always backing.

1287
01:24:01.921 --> 01:24:05.020
I was back at base now of course that was 45 minutes.
We're pretty sketchy.

1288
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:07.660
You ended up getting shot down.
But uh,
you know,

1289
01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.780
a lot of missions that he did is exactly what you said,

1290
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.610
that that's the reality of being a pilot.
That's the reality of it.

1291
01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.360
You know,
and then,
but until you need them.
Oh God.
Yeah.

1292
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:23.850
Well yeah,
of course the first time that happens you're like,
oh yeah,

1293
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:27.550
we need those guys ever.
Sure.
But it's his stream because there's a,

1294
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.510
there's a line guy,
you know,
it was a grunt.
I mean you're trained from day one.

1295
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.400
Every other job in the United States military is to support you.

1296
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.990
That's true.
You know,
you're trained that which I'm not,
I,

1297
01:24:40.991 --> 01:24:44.950
I mean I won't say if I agree or disagree with it now because it's like I tell

1298
01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.690
civilians like,
think of the,

1299
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:49.900
of the military is a giant will with a lot of spokes.

1300
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:56.460
Combat guys are like a super small portion of one spoke.

1301
01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:02.260
Yeah.
It takes a lot of moving parts to make this machine turn.
That's true.

1302
01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.590
And so it's true.
It's rather it's in support.
Like,
listen,

1303
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:08.470
I'm over that I don't need,
I don't need that anymore.
Like,

1304
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:12.610
I understand why guys think that.
I understand the mindset.
There's a,

1305
01:25:12.611 --> 01:25:13.390
there's a great,

1306
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:17.650
I was listening to some Hackworth talking Colonel David Hackworth and one of the

1307
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:18.484
things that he said,

1308
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.960
he was trying to explain how many people were in combat in Vietnam in combat.

1309
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.970
And it was like 10% of the troops.

1310
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:29.971
So at the peak of Vietnam there was 560,000 people in country in Vietnam and

1311
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:34.630
like 50,000 of them were actually engaged in combat at that at any one time.

1312
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.300
And that's probably a pretty good figure.

1313
01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.650
A lot of the World War One and world to World War II statistics are the same.

1314
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:42.341
It's like 10 to one.

1315
01:25:42.341 --> 01:25:46.180
There's 10 support people for every one person that's going to like close,

1316
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.030
close with and destroy the enemy,
you know,
it's the way it is.
Yeah.

1317
01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:49.864
And I mean it's,

1318
01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:55.960
I would never look at a supply guy or of course when I was in,

1319
01:25:55.961 --> 01:26:00.190
I did it all the time.
I'm like a pug don't chose told you bait or whatever.

1320
01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.120
The stupid shit is what you say.
But I see him now and it's like,
hey man,

1321
01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:06.790
I appreciate you sir.
It's like,
oh well I could,

1322
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:11.870
I didn't do anything and I'm a k first of all there is no Richter skill on pain

1323
01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:15.794
and suffering.

1324
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.760
You know what makes it unique is that it's unique to the individual.

1325
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:23.870
You can't grade it.
So like your,

1326
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:28.460
you know,
your sprained ankle when you were,

1327
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:31.670
you roll your ankle playing basketball during your lunch hour.

1328
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.880
How do you know that didn't hurt as bad?

1329
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:39.560
Is My fibula and Tibia coming out of my left leg?
It might've,

1330
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.160
I'm going to question you a little bit on that one.

1331
01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:48.161
But the point that we get talking about this support people in the military,

1332
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.110
they do a great job.
Then we wouldn't,

1333
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.090
the frontline troops wouldn't be able to do anything without them.

1334
01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:56.480
So that's what I say.
And vice versa.
If the frontline troops weren't there,

1335
01:26:56.890 --> 01:26:59.750
the sport people would have no job.
That's the attitude I always had.

1336
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:02.630
And we were a team that had any cover move together.

1337
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:07.580
And if the Intel people didn't supply the Intel and if the CVS didn't build the

1338
01:27:07.581 --> 01:27:11.050
bases and keep the generator's running and the combat engineers weren't out

1339
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:14.480
clear.
I mean it's like it takes a truck.
Exactly.
And so that's my point.

1340
01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.330
And it's like,
listen,

1341
01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.170
if you're still in and you're a non combat role,
be proud of what you're doing.

1342
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:25.290
Yeah,
no,
try it out.
You know,
I have guys that I meet now and they say,

1343
01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:29.330
well I was in from,
you know,
84 to 90 and I never did anything.
And I was like,

1344
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:32.060
Hey,
you did what your country asks you to do.
Yeah.
You know,

1345
01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:35.390
I stopped with that mindset,
man.
You've been conditioned

1346
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.940
just to call it what it is by guys like I used to be to believe you didn't do

1347
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:47.900
anything.
Okay.
Well the more mature me still pretty dumb,

1348
01:27:47.901 --> 01:27:52.640
but the more mature me is here to tell you thank you for carrying the flag

1349
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:57.290
before I did.
Yeah.
That's another point is like who is going to train you?

1350
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.900
Who,

1351
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.280
who's the Deis to put you through boot camp and who's the guys that trained them

1352
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:05.480
in 1984.
Right.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
yeah,
it's a long chain.

1353
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:08.420
It's the gift that keeps on giving,
you know,
and it's,
but

1354
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:13.940
you served,
you're doing more than most.
You know,
you're doing more than most.

1355
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:17.440
Be Proud of that fact.
And so,
but I,

1356
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:22.400
but I remember being w we,
we leave the wire for the first time analysis.
And,
um,

1357
01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.240
so we had guys drive in the six ton that were motor t guys that weren't our

1358
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:32.000
guys.
So I didn't know him and we,
it was like a,

1359
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:36.790
I don't know if he's like a lance Cooley and then there was a staff sergeant and

1360
01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:40.640
the driver's seat and I'm up on the tour.
Right.
And so I'm just like,
all right,

1361
01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.140
well,
you know,
whatever.
And so we're coming,
we come out of the gate

1362
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:51.080
and we bang a left and we're headed to our first checkpoint,

1363
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:54.290
which by the way,
the Iraqi national guard.

1364
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:57.380
And I reckon police knew what would our checkpoints where when we were leaving,

1365
01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.410
when we were going to get there.
So that's awesome.
Yeah,
because you know,

1366
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:04.170
there's some really smart people in DC that thought that was a good idea.
Yeah.

1367
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:07.620
And um,
yeah,

1368
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:09.620
so that obviously that,

1369
01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:13.550
that standard operating procedure didn't last real long because we've,

1370
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:18.720
we knew it was a bad idea and,
but you know,

1371
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:20.940
where it had to get back to them,
like,
hey,

1372
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:24.870
bombs and stuff like just follow us everywhere we go.
It's weird.

1373
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:29.490
It's almost like they know we're going to be there.
Imagine that,

1374
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.970
you know?
And so I remember,

1375
01:29:32.971 --> 01:29:37.200
I'm like,
it took some type of contact,
right?

1376
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.790
I'm lead vehicle and the dude and the DRI,

1377
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:45.570
the driver stops on a,
in the middle of a bridge.

1378
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:51.810
And I distinctly remember in training,
do not stop on a bridge.

1379
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:54.030
And so I'm telling us,
dude,

1380
01:29:54.031 --> 01:29:59.031
like get off the bridge and he's like looking at a staff sergeant German saloon.

1381
01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:01.380
Like he's yelling at me.

1382
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.880
And so I start kicked guys kicking him in his home,

1383
01:30:04.881 --> 01:30:08.590
but like get off the Prayaj and staff sort of didn't news.

1384
01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:10.140
That's where I was like,
dude,
just get off the bridge.

1385
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.030
[inaudible] sounds like a good idea.
Yeah.

1386
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:17.050
And so it was a chick core push.
Yeah.

1387
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.810
We got off the bridge and I'm like,
hey genius.

1388
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.680
How do you know that that thing wasn't going to blow?

1389
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.590
Don't stop on a bridge ever.

1390
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:33.390
Your motor t I'm just shocked that someone didn't tell you don't stop on a

1391
01:30:33.391 --> 01:30:36.150
bridge cause you're,
you're a sitting duck.

1392
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:42.290
And it's like w that was my like welcome ty rag moment when it was,

1393
01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.660
um,
and man,

1394
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:49.730
we just started everything after that pretty much,

1395
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.300
pretty much just blurs together until the day that we got told that we were

1396
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:57.650
going to go to do lab,
which was for all intensive purposes,

1397
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.840
an Ammo dump was pretty much with Doula was,

1398
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:03.210
and that's where we were.

1399
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:08.270
The insurgents were going to get unexploded ordinance and I mean thousands and

1400
01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:13.410
thousands and thousands of Rpgs Ek's 7.62 rounds,
mortars,

1401
01:31:13.411 --> 01:31:18.270
I mean thousands.
And we had to combat engineers out there all day,

1402
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:20.940
every day,
blowing stuff.
I mean,

1403
01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:24.480
they just couldn't blow it quick enough because we would find so many of these

1404
01:31:24.481 --> 01:31:28.590
weapon cache.
It's everywhere.
It was insane.
And so,

1405
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:33.670
but we go through,
we get to up to the point of know it gets,

1406
01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.660
it's a little after a moth that were there and we get

1407
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:42.630
the order that we're going to go to do lab,
which for most of us was like,
okay,

1408
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.900
we can breathe some kickback time,
relax.

1409
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.110
I had a bad feeling about it right in my gut.

1410
01:31:49.111 --> 01:31:53.850
As soon as they told us I heard Doula and I knew it was our turn to go and

1411
01:31:53.851 --> 01:31:56.910
secure the perimeter Doula.
I had a,
I got a bad feeling in my gut,

1412
01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.930
but know what it was.
And so my role was when I left,
when I left

1413
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.610
the states and I told my family,
hey listen,
here's the deal.

1414
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.440
Don't send me anything.
Don't write me.
I'm not gonna write.
You.

1415
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.790
Don't watch the news.
And no news is good news.
I'll see you in seven months.

1416
01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:20.741
Because in my mind,

1417
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:24.250
I had a job to do and I didn't need them in my head with their first world

1418
01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:25.093
bullshit.

1419
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:30.280
And because my family puts the jury in sprayer and so definitely didn't need

1420
01:32:30.281 --> 01:32:33.670
that.
And so that was my mindset.
But I,
we get,

1421
01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:36.760
we were told we're going to do lab and so I get this weird feeling in my gut and

1422
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.860
I'm like,
dad,
why don't know what that is.

1423
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:45.120
It's the night before we head out and get a shower and a hot shower and I'm

1424
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:51.181
walking back to our tit from the shower trailer and I'll walk by gunny and

1425
01:32:52.781 --> 01:32:56.650
gunny,
he was assaulted gunny man.
He,
I mean he was like a,

1426
01:32:56.670 --> 01:33:01.660
like a 23 year gunny that he earned it.
And uh,
and I loved them.

1427
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:03.170
Everybody loved them,
you know,

1428
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.400
and he was one of those guys where if you tell them good morning and then he

1429
01:33:06.401 --> 01:33:10.300
doesn't tell you,
like if he,
if he don't,
if you don't hear something back,

1430
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:12.040
like go ask your mom.

1431
01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.160
If you hear like good morning back gun,

1432
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:19.180
he's pissed about something and it's going to be a long day.

1433
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:23.220
Like if you were like go after her mom,
you're like sweets gun,

1434
01:33:23.221 --> 01:33:27.630
he's in a good mood.
He's just,
he was that guy,
you know,
and um,

1435
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:32.080
everybody loved him.
Everybody respected him because he demanded it.

1436
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.620
Andy commanded because he would be the first guy.

1437
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:41.050
If it pops off,
he's going to be right there.
He's not,

1438
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.970
he's not ducking behind anything.

1439
01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:46.720
He's the dude walking up and down the line smoking a cigar.

1440
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:50.050
That's that gunny.
He's that guy.

1441
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:53.530
And it was just an abundant amount of respect to you that,
and

1442
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:58.840
even if even if you hated them,
you love to hate them,
you know?

1443
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.630
But I love the dude because it was for me,

1444
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:06.400
he was what the Marine Corps meant

1445
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.360
as one individual.
And I dug that about him.
I was like,
that's,

1446
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:19.090
I need to be around him all the time.
I want more of what's in his head in mind.

1447
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.740
I can learn a tremendous amount from this guy.
And so I'm,

1448
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:27.100
I'm walking back into the tent.
He's in front of the tent.
And I said,

1449
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:27.934
good evening,
gunny.

1450
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:31.600
And I walked by and he didn't say anything and he grabs like the back of my

1451
01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:36.430
skivvies shirt and pulls me back towards him.
And he hugged me and he said,

1452
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:40.900
I love you Schick.
And I was like,
I don't know dude.
My hands,

1453
01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:46.300
like,
I'm like,
what do I do?
Do I say it back?
Is this a trap?

1454
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:50.440
What do I do this?
And I was like,
screw it man.
I mean,

1455
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.460
I've been dirty before.
We'll love you to guns.

1456
01:34:56.210 --> 01:35:00.020
And I'll never forget,
he just looked at me right in my face and just said,

1457
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.560
you're going to be alright.
Surrender that.

1458
01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:08.630
So then I was like,
okay,
something's not right at this point.

1459
01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:12.080
I'm 100% convinced something's not right.

1460
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.810
I didn't know what it was,
but I knew it wasn't right.

1461
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:20.500
So I broke my cardinal rule and went to the phone to call my family.

1462
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:26.180
And the last person I called was my dad.
And you know,
you have the two,

1463
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:30.730
three second delay.
And I knew it was about 10 30 at night in Shreveport,

1464
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.610
Louisiana.
And,

1465
01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:35.810
and I knew he was home alone because my step mom and my little brother were at

1466
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:40.100
the Rancho San Antonio and he answers the phone and I said,
hey pop.

1467
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:44.240
And he knows me because I'm the only kid that calls him pop first words out of

1468
01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:45.650
his mouth or why am I talking to you?

1469
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:52.430
It's almost like he knew that I knew something wasn't right

1470
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.591
and I said,

1471
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:59.591
I just wanted to tell you how much I love you and what you being my father means

1472
01:36:00.681 --> 01:36:02.030
to me as your son

1473
01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.000
because at this point in our life and our journey is father and son was.

1474
01:36:08.001 --> 01:36:09.860
That's pretty much where it ended.
He was my dad.

1475
01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:13.190
I was a song that was it because my older brother,

1476
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.120
he was born in God just touched his forehead and said athlete.

1477
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.290
And my dad was a baseball player,
my brother's baseball player.
I always hated it.

1478
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.540
I was like,
that is a slow sport known to mankind.

1479
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.270
It's like watching paint dry and,
and so I,

1480
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:32.240
I always growing up,
felt like I was always chasing my brother.

1481
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.110
I was chasing this,

1482
01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.230
this unbelievable athlete that I was never going to be better than when it came

1483
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.510
to Athleticism,
no matter what sport.

1484
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:44.690
But I was chasing that and then I was like,
okay,

1485
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:49.220
well I'm going to go play baseball.
The try and appease my dad to show him like,

1486
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:52.310
Hey,
I can do this too.
Like I can do it,
and I sucked.
I was never,

1487
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:54.020
I was never very good at it.
You know,

1488
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:58.460
football and knowing now baseball's an art almost.

1489
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:01.550
It's a calculated art.
Whereas with football,

1490
01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:07.540
if you can run into another human with a 100% focus and 100% we'll have

1491
01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:10.851
breathing.

1492
01:37:10.851 --> 01:37:15.350
That man's will by making your body collide with his as hard as you can.

1493
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:20.210
You can play football
to a certain extent,
right?

1494
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.030
You can play football.
Why did,

1495
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:28.090
I loved it because for me it was an outlet of the aggression that I had as a kid

1496
01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:33.140
growing up in the,
the,
the antithesis of the cookie cutter childhood.

1497
01:37:34.190 --> 01:37:38.210
And so at this point that I'm leaving,
you know,
I'm at my father and I was,

1498
01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:43.550
we weren't where I felt like we should be as father and son,
you know,

1499
01:37:43.551 --> 01:37:44.384
it was just,

1500
01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:49.190
and this is a conversation that I've had with my dad since obviously,

1501
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:51.920
and so he,
when he,
when I told them like,

1502
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:56.070
I just want you to know it's important that you know how much I love

1503
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v 4>and respect you and how much I owe you for being there.</v>

1504
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:06.321
When you were dealt a shitty hand and you had us kids on your own

1505
01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.120
and you leaned in,

1506
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:15.690
you leaned in and your bolt up and I owe you till I die,

1507
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.600
I'll owe you and I needed you to know that.

1508
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:24.140
And so he said,
how long has this passion?
I said,
nine days.
And you know,

1509
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:27.390
he knew not to ask,
where are you going?
What are you doing?

1510
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:32.420
Because the people that listen to your every phone call with your call would be

1511
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:37.740
over.
And he said,
I bet I want to hear from you at nine days.
He said,

1512
01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:42.000
I better hear from you in nine days.
I said,
you will pop,
I'll love you man.

1513
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.200
And he just said,
I love you too,
and ended with,
you'd better be okay.

1514
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:50.850
And I hung up and it was one of those moments where I was like,

1515
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.810
as a,
at the time,
I'm

1516
01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.510
2121 years old and I realize

1517
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:05.550
I have,
I have no control over anything.

1518
01:39:07.210 --> 01:39:08.043
<v 5>Nothing.</v>

1519
01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:11.860
<v 4>I feel like I think I can,</v>

1520
01:39:11.861 --> 01:39:16.600
like I think I have control and in protecting my team and making sure my team's

1521
01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:19.060
okay,
I have no control over anything.

1522
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:23.590
It was one of those human moments where I realized

1523
01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:28.030
I'm just as vulnerable as everyone else.

1524
01:39:29.410 --> 01:39:34.210
There's nothing special about me.
I can be the biggest,
strongest,
toughest.

1525
01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.350
It doesn't matter.

1526
01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:37.980
<v 5>That does not matter.</v>

1527
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.000
<v 4>Because when it's your time,
it's your time.
That's,</v>

1528
01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:45.600
it doesn't matter what you know,
doesn't matter how well trained you are.

1529
01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.970
If God pulls your card,
you're done.
So it was a very,

1530
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:54.030
very sobering in,

1531
01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.970
in humbling moment for me.

1532
01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:00.870
And we left out the next morning to go to Alice or go to do lab.

1533
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:04.770
We get out to do love.
And you know we started

1534
01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:11.180
patrolling the perimeter and for reactions called Gore's me in the react team

1535
01:40:11.181 --> 01:40:16.181
which means nine Marines would go to wherever the reactors and but I always had

1536
01:40:17.331 --> 01:40:20.390
that have you feeling in my gut that

1537
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:25.970
it didn't affect my job didn't affect our day to day operations and what we were

1538
01:40:25.971 --> 01:40:27.110
doing but I knew

1539
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.510
it was something was coming and then one night we had a,

1540
01:40:33.170 --> 01:40:37.520
we had two guys come in the main gate and they were in like a white opal

1541
01:40:39.170 --> 01:40:42.740
pulled in the main gate and pretty much just laid down on both sides of the car,

1542
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:45.410
obviously not normal behavior.

1543
01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:51.100
Well these guys were high profile targets that once we find out who they are and

1544
01:40:53.321 --> 01:40:54.170
radio battalion,

1545
01:40:54.170 --> 01:40:56.140
<v 2>they were like,
Hey,
don't let them out of your site.</v>

1546
01:40:57.370 --> 01:41:01.150
And so we ended up having,
and for the react team we had two,

1547
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:06.040
two Dorsaut top humvees.
That's what we had to operate in.
And the guy,

1548
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.290
we had one guy in the back of one vehicle,

1549
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.480
another guy in the back of the second vehicle and they both had MTM argue boxes

1550
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:15.730
duct taped on their head because we were out of hoods and so improvise,

1551
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:18.970
adapt and overcome.
And um,
you know,

1552
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:23.440
had them Hawk just had had them,
they weren't going anywhere.
Well,

1553
01:41:23.441 --> 01:41:28.441
so the Iraqi national guard also got to be on the same net frequencies,

1554
01:41:29.051 --> 01:41:33.730
US radio frequency.
So they're hearing all the transmissions.
Next thing you know,

1555
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:38.731
they show up and there's a lot of them and they pull in and circle us.

1556
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.490
Obviously show of force and say,
you know these guys,

1557
01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:49.750
same thing you went through about the IED maker,
the bomb maker.
And he's,

1558
01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.920
you know,
these guys,
they're no threat.
These guys are good.

1559
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:56.700
You need to let them go.
No,
no.

1560
01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.260
And I remember one of the guys that was like the kernel of that rack,

1561
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.270
national guard and he said,

1562
01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:05.590
well you need the term interpreters there.

1563
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:08.890
And I remember him saying something along the lines of,

1564
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.720
we need to take a direct order from a superior officer.
And we were like,
hey bro,

1565
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.300
I don't know if you've been working with the army or whatever.

1566
01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.460
We don't give a shit who you are because we know that you're probably a bad guy.

1567
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:26.620
So no,
they're not leaving.

1568
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:28.450
And,
um,

1569
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:32.560
that situation got super gnarly super quick.

1570
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:34.480
And I was thinking to myself,
like

1571
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:39.610
I remember telling him,
one of the guys that,
uh,

1572
01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:44.800
had a nine to one of the dude's head and I told him if he's so much of sneezes,

1573
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000
pushes brains to the side of his head and I could hear that Beretta nine Mil.

1574
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:57.010
I could hear it rattling.
Cause he was,
it was,

1575
01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:02.020
I'm sure it was from pre Vietnam,
isn't marines,
you know,
and I could hear,

1576
01:43:02.021 --> 01:43:06.160
but I could hear this slide or rattling against the barrel.

1577
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:09.730
And I was like,
dude,
that dude is shaking heart.

1578
01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:16.150
But I knew if that dude so much just sneezed,
I knew it would happen.

1579
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:21.370
And so we were,
by the grace of God,
we had a cause.
We were,

1580
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:23.980
we were part of weapons platoon,
but weapons company,

1581
01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:28.680
it just got done doing according to knock or whatever they were doing.

1582
01:43:28.681 --> 01:43:30.820
And they're listening to this transmission over the net.

1583
01:43:31.650 --> 01:43:34.090
So we're talking about battalion saying like,

1584
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:39.091
hey this is escalating and there's about 65 of them and 10 of us.

1585
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.620
So they were heavily outnumbered obviously,

1586
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:47.260
but we need some serious shit is going to go down.

1587
01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:50.650
And so weapons company pulls in.

1588
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:53.810
I don't even remember if it's an hour later,
three hours.

1589
01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:57.770
It seemed like a fricking Aternity where they pull in and make a circle around

1590
01:43:57.771 --> 01:44:00.500
the I and g good times bro.

1591
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:04.100
And of course the weapons company are the ones with,

1592
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:08.510
you know the mark itns 50 cows,

1593
01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.560
84 we had 84 too.
But I mean they had all the big,
you know,

1594
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:15.440
when they pull in you,
you know like okay,

1595
01:44:15.441 --> 01:44:19.310
those guys have big stuff that obviously goes bang a lot.

1596
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:23.090
And so these guys pulled in and it was almost in unison,

1597
01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.020
the Iraqi National Guard guys dropping their Aka his hands in the air.
No,

1598
01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.990
me stolen.
No,
he used to and I was like,
Yep,
those are homeys,
you know,
like,

1599
01:44:32.991 --> 01:44:37.240
so let's,
and so those guys,
they take them and take them back to Alice sod,

1600
01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.210
you know,
and then they,
they popcorn fart,
disappear.

1601
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.760
There's gone.
I mean,

1602
01:44:43.761 --> 01:44:48.050
I'm sure some super secret squirrel agency came in and got him or whatever.

1603
01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.080
Well,
we finally go to bed down and um,

1604
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.400
I go up to the command post and doc was up at the command post was his turn to

1605
01:44:58.191 --> 01:45:03.191
sit in the vehicle that powers the command post and it was his turn to count the

1606
01:45:03.291 --> 01:45:08.090
flares,
Long Euphrates.
And when was it shot?
What color was it?

1607
01:45:08.091 --> 01:45:12.110
And then we turn it into Intel and then they try and crack a code decipher code.

1608
01:45:12.111 --> 01:45:16.850
And so we saw it to dock and tell him,
I'm like,
you know,
like,
hey man,

1609
01:45:16.851 --> 01:45:20.630
this was not,
he's like,
I know I was listening to it on that.
That was crazy.

1610
01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.450
And so I,
I can barely keep my eyes open at this point.

1611
01:45:26.451 --> 01:45:31.310
Drillings worn off and you know,
series of high,
high series,
a low lows,

1612
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:32.210
no gray area.

1613
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.350
That's what being a grunt is and being a warfighter is.

1614
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:43.250
And so I told Doc,
I got a bit down smoked and a good bed down.
No worries,
man.

1615
01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:48.290
And uh,
so I go and take my boots off and I'm,

1616
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:52.280
I'm so tired.
I take my boots off and lay on my cot

1617
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.760
and Iraq being Iraq,
especially in Oh for not even 20 minutes later.

1618
01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:02.570
I mean my dogs didn't even start to breathe,
react.

1619
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.700
And I'm like,
Kate Murphy,
your Dick.
You know,
it was like,

1620
01:46:07.701 --> 01:46:12.230
if that's the way Murphy Werx sued,
not a fan,
not a fan of,

1621
01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:16.810
of that Murphy.
And so,
you know,
wake up and I'm like,
all right,

1622
01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.060
gotta wake up team.
So I rub,

1623
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:22.400
rub their backs and whisper sweet nothings in their ear because that's how we do

1624
01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:27.140
it.
And we,
these guys,
they're all pissed.

1625
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:32.490
Like,
you know,
this is a bunch of bullshit.
Like,
hey man,

1626
01:46:32.491 --> 01:46:35.270
it's cause it's the paycheck.
That's why we do it.

1627
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:40.970
What was the call that came in one day?
What was going down?
It was,
um,

1628
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:44.560
I think it was someone in our,

1629
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.170
someone had gotten in the Yale wasn't supposed to be in the Eo and you know,

1630
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:52.190
neutralized type thing and I get up and I'm,

1631
01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:54.960
I'm carrying,

1632
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:59.960
I think I slide my boots on him time yet and I walk out of the tent as soon as I

1633
01:47:01.741 --> 01:47:04.620
walk out of the 10th.
That feeling I had in my gut went right in my throat,

1634
01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.910
rolls right into my throat and I knew we were about to get hit.

1635
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.070
I knew ensures I was at the sun was going to come up.

1636
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.430
I knew we were going to get it.
I didn't know how bad it was gonna be.

1637
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:19.920
I didn't know by what,
I didn't know to the extent,

1638
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:25.350
but I knew it was going to happen.
And so I buy the,

1639
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:30.900
I took measures and did things that otherwise wouldn't have done.

1640
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:34.260
And you mean call it my grandfather talked to me from beyond the grave.

1641
01:47:34.261 --> 01:47:36.150
You can call it God and call whatever you want.

1642
01:47:36.151 --> 01:47:40.760
And good news is that I can have my beliefs and you can have yours and odds are

1643
01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:44.790
not going to get our heads cut off because we live in a free society.
And so I,

1644
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:47.460
my commanding officer was out there

1645
01:47:49.770 --> 01:47:54.240
to do a report on what had went down the night before he's sleeping.
And,

1646
01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.160
but I knew he had a bomb blanket.

1647
01:47:57.350 --> 01:48:00.000
And so I took the bumbling get out of the passenger seat of the,

1648
01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:02.610
one of the only up armored Humvees you had at the time.

1649
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:07.350
And I went to the lead vehicle and I told the driver,

1650
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.470
scoot over to the lead vehicles to this day,

1651
01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:13.410
have great friend of mine put the bomb blanket down and I told the guys button

1652
01:48:13.411 --> 01:48:16.860
up if they gave it to us for protection,
but put it on now,

1653
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:23.030
which I usually wasn't real hardcore about just because when it's 120 something

1654
01:48:23.161 --> 01:48:25.230
degrees and you,
you have all that gear on,

1655
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:29.910
more gear is not optimal to the whole being comfortable thing.

1656
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:34.980
And um,
I mean,
I'm sure the guys knew something was up.

1657
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:40.150
And then I take the radio from the Aro and uh,

1658
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.070
everything's buttoned up.
Flak jacket,
Kevlar,

1659
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:51.070
Wiley acts is shatter shatterproof that they should have said kind of shatter

1660
01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.290
proof.
And then,
um,
it's,
you know,
the groin protector,

1661
01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:02.010
if they gave it,
we had it on.
And so I,
I get on the horn with my right arm.

1662
01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:06.960
I'm driving with my left,
I gassed it and I'm,
so you're driving,

1663
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.350
I'm driving,
I'm driving.
And uh,

1664
01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:15.990
just because I,
you would put the bomb blanket under the,
under the driver's seat.

1665
01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:20.880
And so I don't know,
it was just reaction.
I mean,

1666
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:25.230
it was something was guiding me to do all these things.
You know,
I'm not,

1667
01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:28.170
I can't tell you what the Lotto numbers are.
Like,
I can't tell.
I'm not,

1668
01:49:28.190 --> 01:49:31.440
I don't have VSP it Usb,
I'm not a fortune teller.

1669
01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.460
Like something was guiding me to do these things and you just put that bomb

1670
01:49:35.461 --> 01:49:39.030
Lincoln under there just cause you just told me,

1671
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.080
put it in the driver's seat and get in the driver's seat.
Take the radio.

1672
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:47.010
I did all these things,
I punch it three minutes later,

1673
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:49.240
had a triple stack pressure plate ignited.

1674
01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.840
So three,
three,
one five,
five Mike,
Mike's and layman's terms.

1675
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:59.080
What that means is the big ass bomb.
Yeah.
That's about what,

1676
01:49:59.081 --> 01:50:01.540
75 pounds of explosives.
It's a lot.

1677
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:04.360
It's a freaking big blowup directly beneath me.

1678
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:09.280
Blew me about 30 feet to the top of the Humvee.
Stuck to any with my head.

1679
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:13.810
Cause again,
marines believe in good form.
And um,

1680
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.520
I like to say because God's a comedian.

1681
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:18.520
I never lost conscious on everyone into shock.
I remember the whole thing.

1682
01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:20.800
Took the Black Hawk 42 minutes,
come get me.

1683
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:24.670
So I love to look at people when they're like,

1684
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:27.100
it's such a long day at work today.
Like,
really,

1685
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:33.460
hold on,
let me throw some perspective your way.
But that's,

1686
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:36.910
I'm only when I'm in a bad mood.
But it was a,

1687
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:42.070
I knew midair.
It was bad.
I knew it was bad.

1688
01:50:43.150 --> 01:50:47.320
I knew this was not good at all.
And when I hit the deck,

1689
01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:52.200
I couldn't breathe because the,
um,
as you know,
this,

1690
01:50:52.290 --> 01:50:55.960
this series of events and an explosion,
a million things happen in a nanosecond,

1691
01:50:56.710 --> 01:50:59.140
especially when it's that big of an explosion.

1692
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.200
And so it was when the dashboard disengaged and steer will hook me and my chest

1693
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:04.940
explode.

1694
01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.940
It all my mags hit me in my chest and temporary collapse,

1695
01:51:10.341 --> 01:51:14.860
both my lungs before I was blown out.
A whole series of things happened before,

1696
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.130
during this process causing injuries.
And,

1697
01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:23.920
and um,
I hit the deck and I knew I'm hurt bad.

1698
01:51:23.921 --> 01:51:27.250
I can't breathe,
can't hear anything.
It was just ringing.

1699
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:31.960
And first thing I do is talk to God.

1700
01:51:32.710 --> 01:51:37.710
First thing I did before I even did self assessment is it talk to guys I can't

1701
01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:41.700
see out of my right eye.
Thanks.
This shatterproof while he likes this,

1702
01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:46.410
but w because they shattered both of them by the way.
Yeah.

1703
01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:50.740
There's,
there's something called the triple stacked id.

1704
01:51:50.741 --> 01:51:54.550
I don't know what glasses are going to hang with that one saying,
hey,
listen man,

1705
01:51:54.551 --> 01:51:58.240
false advertisement.
Right.
But we,
um,

1706
01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:01.780
I'm,
they're,
they're a great company.
I'm just,
you know,

1707
01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:07.000
Kinda find light in every situation.
But we,
but I talk to God right away.

1708
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:10.870
And this is exactly what I said.
Hey big man,

1709
01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.420
I know this is bad.

1710
01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:16.600
All I'm asking is that you don't take me in front of my family.

1711
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:21.130
It's all I'm asking.
Don't let my brother's watching me die.

1712
01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:24.370
As soon as kids leave the deck,
I'm all yours.

1713
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.690
Just please don't let my brother's watching me die.
That's all I cared about.

1714
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.600
And then I started the self assessment,

1715
01:52:31.601 --> 01:52:36.601
which starts with checking your junk is the only thing that worked was my right

1716
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:38.560
arm.
Everything else was shattered or broken.

1717
01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:43.450
Go and find out all my ribs are broken.
So that didn't help anything.

1718
01:52:44.050 --> 01:52:46.310
And um,
so I go,

1719
01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:51.920
I move my drawing flap and check my junk.

1720
01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:56.030
And I was like,
okay,
that's there.
Everything else has been datable like we're,

1721
01:52:56.650 --> 01:53:00.890
we'll work through,
we will survive.
And um,

1722
01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:06.410
but then I looked at my,
uh,
my right leg look normal,
but my right,

1723
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:10.850
but my right foot and ankle hurt really bad.
So it's like,
okay,

1724
01:53:10.851 --> 01:53:13.880
it's probably broken.
Well,
I didn't know it was crushed.

1725
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:15.740
Was the firewall in the Humvee folded up?

1726
01:53:15.741 --> 01:53:19.310
Trust my right foot before I was blown out.
My left,

1727
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.760
I looked at my left arm and I remember seeing like daylight through my left arm.

1728
01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:30.080
Part of my left hand was hanging down by my elbow.
So I was like,
okay,

1729
01:53:30.081 --> 01:53:34.160
that's might not,
might not keep the left arm.

1730
01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:39.710
And I looked down at my left leg,
which was turned outward.

1731
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:43.250
Like if you're sitting down with both legs,
like you're going to touch her toes.

1732
01:53:43.251 --> 01:53:47.780
My left leg was turned outward to the left and my foot was inverted,

1733
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:51.920
like with my toes pointing at me and my boot was blown off.

1734
01:53:52.670 --> 01:53:56.360
But my,
but everything was there.
It was all over the place.
But it was there.

1735
01:53:56.890 --> 01:54:01.890
So saw my fibia and my Tibia saw all the damage that was done to my left leg and

1736
01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.980
cause my McKameys were shredded.

1737
01:54:04.690 --> 01:54:07.700
And I thought two things when I saw that first thing I thought was,

1738
01:54:07.701 --> 01:54:11.480
that's not supposed to be like that.
Second thing I thought was

1739
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:16.100
that that was confirmation that that was a very big explosion.

1740
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.810
To be able to blow a laced up combat boot off your leg and not take your leg

1741
01:54:20.811 --> 01:54:23.600
with it is a massive explosion,
was crazy.

1742
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:28.760
And so at this point I'm thinking how was the yeah,

1743
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:34.280
blown eardrums was the other worst injury man.

1744
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.380
So literally blew up straight up directly beneath Mia Straight and straight up.

1745
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:43.700
They must have had it buried a little bit enough that it projected right up into

1746
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:47.570
you.
And it was so that standoff we had the night before,

1747
01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.110
it's when they buried it.

1748
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:57.620
So all that was was a diversion because everyone was glued to the radios,

1749
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:02.120
you know,
so it was,
and it was in a perfect spot.

1750
01:55:02.121 --> 01:55:07.121
It was the one spot around that entire area of operation that you couldn't have

1751
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:11.180
ice directly on the one spot.
Yeah.

1752
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:15.290
And so at this point,

1753
01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:18.740
the guys finally make it up to me and they're

1754
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:23.240
really there a lot of freaking out.

1755
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:27.690
Cause I mean I did the Humvee move.
Oh yeah.
It was blossoms.

1756
01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:31.490
Who did get blown up.
Yeah.
But it was,
I'll tell you this,

1757
01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:34.910
if we were in a up armored Humvee,
everyone was,
would be dead from overpressure.

1758
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:38.270
Yeah,
absolutely.
There've been nowhere for it to go.
Everyone would have died.

1759
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:40.100
It would have been,

1760
01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:44.400
but it was blown up and over

1761
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:49.440
<v 4>to the right and um,
second vehicle one affected.</v>

1762
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:53.520
Um,
but the guys aren't up to me

1763
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:58.320
at this point.
I'm back to telling God like,

1764
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:02.460
hey man,
just remember our deal.

1765
01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:08.070
Remember our deal and um,
guys,
okay,
shake.

1766
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:10.200
We got you bro.
We got,
you know,

1767
01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.280
we got you hang tough and how to know where I was able to take a breath and the

1768
01:56:17.251 --> 01:56:21.810
first thing I said was developed through safety and they were like,
oh shit.
Yeah.

1769
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:25.930
It's like,
yeah,
no shit.
What's coming next?
Yeah.
I,

1770
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:30.830
how do we know we're not about to start taking fire,
which probably was,

1771
01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:33.180
was unlikely cause there was no cover in that.

1772
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:36.300
I mean there would have been nowhere for him to hide it and it would have been a

1773
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.290
suicide mission on their part.
Um,

1774
01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:42.000
because we had one still very functional to 40,

1775
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:44.310
and we knew how to employ that weapon,

1776
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:49.320
but they get me back on the second vehicle,
which was like I said,

1777
01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:53.610
it's the operational and get me back up to the command post and

1778
01:56:55.370 --> 01:57:00.000
man it,
and little did I know that that's that at that moment,

1779
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:01.260
that's when my battle,

1780
01:57:01.670 --> 01:57:05.520
my personal war started right then that day.

1781
01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:09.450
And I get up there and,
um,
doc,

1782
01:57:09.451 --> 01:57:13.220
same doc that I was talking to those in the Humvee,

1783
01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:18.990
counting the flares,
it was working on me.
And uh,

1784
01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:23.220
I was,
I was young,
I was pissed,

1785
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:27.780
I was not happy and I was yelling at dock and it was like,
doc,

1786
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:33.300
you got to hit me.
He got to hit me.
And he's like,
I already did.
And so I'm like,

1787
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:34.470
you're,
I was like,
you're,

1788
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:39.540
you're stingy bastard because you don't even hit me with two sticks of morphine.

1789
01:57:39.541 --> 01:57:42.270
And I knew he had more.
And all I knew is I was in a lot of pain.

1790
01:57:42.271 --> 01:57:45.270
He had the remedy and he wasn't giving it to me.
And I was like,
that's,

1791
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:47.590
that's kind of bullshit.
You know,

1792
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:51.900
I didn't understand that the muscles around my lungs can relax so much myself.

1793
01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:55.650
Gate,
I didn't know they didn't care.
I just knew I was in a lot of pain.

1794
01:57:56.310 --> 01:58:00.510
He had drugs and he was not giving him to me a little bit.

1795
01:58:00.511 --> 01:58:03.050
I know the guy was,
you know,
the,

1796
01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:07.380
the tip of the spirits saving my life.
And um,

1797
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:13.310
while this whole situation was really gnarly and very painful and very,

1798
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:15.060
very humbling,

1799
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.140
I wouldn't trade it at all because I got to tell every one of those guys,

1800
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:24.120
every single one of them
is just like talking to my dad.

1801
01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:25.920
But I was talking to my brothers,

1802
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:28.350
just got to tell every one of them how much I loved them,

1803
01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:32.490
how much they meant to me,
how much I respected them,
and that this is real.

1804
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.630
What we're doing is real.
Look at me,
look at me and remember this,

1805
01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:41.860
and go fight your balls off because this is what they want to do to every one of

1806
01:58:41.861 --> 01:58:42.694
us.

1807
01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.130
<v 5>Okay?</v>

1808
01:58:44.130 --> 01:58:48.630
<v 4>Don't let it happen again.
Just,
just learn from this.</v>

1809
01:58:49.530 --> 01:58:53.660
You have to fight for me now.
And that was,

1810
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:56.780
you know,
it was a situation where,

1811
01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:59.330
and they kept telling men and they kept telling me,
uh,

1812
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:04.730
you know,
he Schick is your bird home.
It's your bird home.

1813
01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.900
And it would piss me off every time they said it.
And it was like,

1814
01:59:08.901 --> 01:59:11.810
I don't want to go home,
shut up.
I don't want to go home.

1815
01:59:12.710 --> 01:59:15.230
She could get to go see your family.
You are my family.

1816
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:19.970
I'll see them when it's time to see them,
you know,
it was that.

1817
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:25.430
So there's this whole series of thoughts and emotions and uh,

1818
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.931
you know what I mean?

1819
01:59:26.931 --> 01:59:30.170
It was everything from laughing and crying and everything in between.

1820
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:35.550
The laughing again and they were scrambling to get the Med evac there.

1821
01:59:36.441 --> 01:59:40.250
And the problem was that we didn't have any fighter escorts and that's took

1822
01:59:40.251 --> 01:59:44.380
forever because they were all dispatched,
so forth.
I mean,

1823
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:47.450
there they were all scrambled.
And so it was finally,

1824
01:59:47.451 --> 01:59:52.451
it was a Texas Army Nash Air National Guard pilot that heard the transmission

1825
01:59:53.121 --> 01:59:53.391
that,
you know,

1826
01:59:53.391 --> 01:59:58.210
this marine out of Texas category for rapidly approaching category five to

1827
01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:01.490
category four is urgent surgery.
Kind of got to go with five being expected.

1828
02:00:02.630 --> 02:00:07.370
And um,
he finally got his crew and said,
screw the rules,

1829
02:00:07.371 --> 02:00:11.510
we're going to get this summary and eat loaded.

1830
02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.690
Came and got me.
And um,

1831
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:20.000
I remember when the guys were loaded me on the Black Hawk and my platoon

1832
02:00:20.001 --> 02:00:24.200
sergeant was the last one on.
And um,

1833
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:26.080
and that was,
that was uh,

1834
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:30.230
that was an emotional experience dude because it was

1835
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:36.380
anyway w two sergeants on and he kisses me on my forehead and he says,

1836
02:00:36.381 --> 02:00:37.670
we'll see you soon.
Jack London,

1837
02:00:38.370 --> 02:00:41.110
cause he always called me Jack London because my first generation marines,

1838
02:00:41.111 --> 02:00:43.770
Jak one and Schick,
second generations Jack and chick junior.

1839
02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:47.180
And so he always called me Jack London cause I guess Jake wasn't good enough.

1840
02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.550
But when he said it,

1841
02:00:49.551 --> 02:00:52.580
he was trying not to cry and I could tell in his eyes he was lying,

1842
02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:58.370
which kind of motivated me.
And I was like,
well,
I'll show you.

1843
02:00:59.750 --> 02:01:02.660
I'm going to prove you wrong and you are going to see me again

1844
02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.280
even though it wasn't my choice.
Right.
And so the,

1845
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:09.890
the bird takes off man.

1846
02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.160
And I'm out of everything I've been through from

1847
02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:21.110
day one to now.
That was the hardest moment.

1848
02:01:22.610 --> 02:01:23.443
Hands Down,

1849
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:28.430
no questions asked was leaving those guys hands down.

1850
02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:31.730
That was the hardest moment because that's when

1851
02:01:34.730 --> 02:01:39.080
I was taught just how human I am and just how irrelevant I,

1852
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.490
and it was,
um,
a very,

1853
02:01:43.491 --> 02:01:48.491
very hard experience to leave my family in harm's way and there wasn't a damn

1854
02:01:49.551 --> 02:01:50.540
thing I could do about it.

1855
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:56.180
You talk about being humbled that will humble you

1856
02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:00.110
and we get up in the,
in the air and I'm able,

1857
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:04.880
I'm able to get the attention and one of the litter crews,
a young dude,

1858
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:09.800
I mean again,
I'm 21 and he was probably 18,
19,
but military years.
That's eons.

1859
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.920
And he comes up and he gets right.

1860
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:17.730
He puts his left your right in front of my face and I yelled as loud as I could

1861
02:02:17.731 --> 02:02:20.230
exist.
You know in the back one was birds.
You don't have a headset on,

1862
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:23.450
you can't hear shit.
And I yelled as hard as I could,
how long?

1863
02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:27.260
And I remember when I did that I felt like leave my body.
I knew I was dying.

1864
02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:31.430
Did they tourniquet you already the doctor over and over.

1865
02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:35.560
I mean I was bleeding everywhere.
And so did you have,

1866
02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:40.460
did you have shell shrapnel wounds?
Yeah.
So it was not just your leg and

1867
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:46.340
add a trauma and my,
my Chin side of my face,
my,
my neck.

1868
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:51.860
Um,
when your right arm,
left arm,
left leg,
it was,
it was bad.

1869
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:56.960
And um,
had I not had that Sapi plate in my flat,

1870
02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:01.280
I'd have been dead.
There was a big,
a piece of,
there was a piece sticking out.

1871
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:06.030
It was bigger than this cable sticking out right out of the center and my gun,

1872
02:03:06.031 --> 02:03:09.830
he took pictures of my gear damn showing guys like,
Hey,

1873
02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:15.020
no matter how uncomfortable you are there,
this is why you don't cut corners.

1874
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.150
And um,

1875
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:22.490
but this dude on the litter crew radios up front to the captain and comes back

1876
02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:24.080
and he yells in my right ear,

1877
02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:28.550
12 Mike's as loud as he can or 12 minutes.

1878
02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:33.950
And so I was,
I immediately talked to God again right away,
like a big man.

1879
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:38.830
I'm going to have to renege on that original verbal agreement was,

1880
02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:43.260
I'm pretty sure I can do 12 more minutes.
And um,

1881
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:48.410
obviously,
you know,
he gave me that because I'm talking to,
but um,

1882
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:51.280
we go and we landed it and blood,

1883
02:03:52.130 --> 02:03:54.350
which is just a makeshift filled hospital at the time.

1884
02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:57.050
I'm sure you remember from seeing the no four but it was,

1885
02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:59.780
and they pulled me off the bird and I'm immediately,

1886
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:03.470
immediately started working on me.
I mean it was,

1887
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:07.970
I was not happy about the situation because they kept saying name,
rank,

1888
02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:10.460
social name,
rank,
social name,
rank,
social.

1889
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.890
Cause they wanted me alert and there were,
you know,

1890
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:15.680
and I knew what they were doing and I was like,

1891
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:18.980
but it's like if you slam your finger in the door,
right?

1892
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:22.100
And your buddies right there and he's like,
Hey,
are you okay?
Are you okay?

1893
02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.930
Are you okay?
And every time they say it,
the pain goes up.

1894
02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:31.750
Like I would be golden if you would just shut your gaffer,
you know.

1895
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:33.020
And so I just yelled,

1896
02:04:33.021 --> 02:04:36.650
finally in pointed with my right arm was only at work it that,
hey,

1897
02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.080
it's tattooed right through my ribs.
I'm done talking

1898
02:04:41.670 --> 02:04:43.230
like I'm going to show them.
Right.

1899
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:48.960
And I didn't insight into organs and they get me in the tent.
And um,

1900
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:52.020
they,
they loaded me up with some,

1901
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:55.380
with some of the good shit cause I felt it definitely helped the pain,

1902
02:04:55.381 --> 02:04:58.230
but I'll still a massive amounts of pain and I'll never forget,

1903
02:04:58.231 --> 02:05:02.320
one of the surgeons was sewing up my face and he said,
oops.
And I looked at,

1904
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.700
I was like,
well what do you mean use doc?
And he's like,
Hey,
sorry,

1905
02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:08.940
marina dicked up on your stitches are going to have start again.
And I said,

1906
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:13.290
Hey doc,
at this point I have the sheet up to my neck.
And I was,
as I said,

1907
02:05:13.291 --> 02:05:16.710
hey doc,
I don't know if you've seen seen my body from the neck down,

1908
02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.460
but I'm fairly certain the scratches on my face or the least of our worries.

1909
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:22.870
And I think he had the,
uh,

1910
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:26.530
the analysis is not mad at that moment because I don't,

1911
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:31.290
that's the last thing I remember until I was woken up by nurse Jax who,
uh,

1912
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:37.370
she had told me,
she woke me up and you know,
I'm coming out of the or and um,

1913
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:42.060
and that's still on ballade.
Yeah.
And she says,
I'm a marine.

1914
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:45.240
I'm sorry to tell you this,
we had to take your right foot.

1915
02:05:45.690 --> 02:05:49.920
It was dead when you got here.
There's no blood flow.
And it was crushed.

1916
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:54.030
And I remember thinking to myself like,
Shit,

1917
02:05:54.031 --> 02:05:57.580
they took the wrong foot because it was my left one.
That was really cool stuff.

1918
02:05:58.290 --> 02:06:01.630
And so then I think like,
you know,
it's good enough for government work,
right,

1919
02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:06.170
whatever.
And I'm just,
it's bloods.

1920
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:08.820
I'm just like,
you know,
in a long day just got long.

1921
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:12.900
So you're completely contorted and twisted and backwards and left foot.

1922
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:14.010
It was,

1923
02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:18.720
was the one that made it well and that looked pretty normal.

1924
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:22.830
Do you look completely normal?
With my boot on looked everything was normal,

1925
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:26.430
but then she described it to me.
She,
she said when we,

1926
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:28.410
when you got here,

1927
02:06:28.411 --> 02:06:33.411
imagine like a surgical glove but in the shape of a foot as opposed to a hand

1928
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:38.580
being filled with sand,
that was your right foot.

1929
02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:42.990
She said everything.
It was everything and it was completely crushed.

1930
02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:47.970
It was to the point to where there was it cut off the blood supply.

1931
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:53.580
And so somehow none of my major arteries and my left arm or left leg got hit.

1932
02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:00.000
And so there was still hope for my left leg and my left arm.

1933
02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:05.110
But,
um,
she ended up,
we ended up blowing up,
um,

1934
02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.780
on the bird to go to Germany and she flew with me to Germany because I was,

1935
02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:14.910
I was not out of the woods by any stretch.
It was going to be a,

1936
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:18.360
this was going to be a long and arduous recovery process.

1937
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:21.210
And I remember getting to Germany

1938
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:29.520
or no,
I'm sorry,
before we left,
this was four days after I talked to my,
my dad.

1939
02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:35.810
So I called my dad from the sat phone and they'd given me and my dad answered

1940
02:07:36.251 --> 02:07:40.240
the phone and
said,
hey pop.

1941
02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:45.910
And he said,
why am I talking to you?
I said,
they got me.
He said,

1942
02:07:45.911 --> 02:07:49.810
what do you mean they got me?
So they got me dead and I'm hurt.
He said,

1943
02:07:49.811 --> 02:07:54.250
how bad are you hurt?
So they'd take my right foot.
And there was a pause.

1944
02:07:54.251 --> 02:07:58.780
And then he said,
are you gonna make it?
And I said,

1945
02:07:58.810 --> 02:08:01.720
I don't know.
He said,

1946
02:08:01.721 --> 02:08:05.770
we're waiting first verdant green and you know,
we'll meet you in Germany.

1947
02:08:06.630 --> 02:08:10.990
And at this point,
man,
I'm
on that four year old kid again.

1948
02:08:11.370 --> 02:08:14.310
It just needs his dad.
And I are,

1949
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:18.370
the last thing I told him was,
um,
was I love them,
but right then I said,

1950
02:08:18.371 --> 02:08:22.960
please hurry.
And he said,
we're going to be all right.

1951
02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:24.220
I love you and love you too.

1952
02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:29.980
That was the hardest phone call I've ever made in my life
because I just see him,

1953
02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:35.200
it might as well graduation saying,
why would you do that?
And I'm like,
dammit,

1954
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:40.420
dammit.
He may have had something there like,

1955
02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:43.840
and I'm still thinking like a young,
immature kid.

1956
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:49.390
But I knew one thing I wanted my dad.
And so I get to Germany and um,

1957
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:55.180
one of my best friends from high school was a little brother who was like,

1958
02:08:55.181 --> 02:08:58.350
my little brother growing up was in the army and um,

1959
02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.640
he was a scout and he was there in Germany and was able to get word that I was

1960
02:09:03.641 --> 02:09:07.900
on my way and he was right there and the ambulance doors open

1961
02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.330
and he put his head on my chest and he lost.
It started bawling.

1962
02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.450
And I just remember Thomas,
Hi Josh.
It's all right man.
And um,
you know,

1963
02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:21.670
he just kept saying,
not you,
not you.

1964
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:26.260
Not you and he wouldn't leave my side,
you know,

1965
02:09:26.261 --> 02:09:30.430
but he had a cell phone and I got to call other people and even when they're

1966
02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:34.260
trying to take me to the or to wash me out and reset my left leg and left arm

1967
02:09:34.261 --> 02:09:38.060
and Redo the
external fixators use,

1968
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:42.070
like he's walking right next to the bed,
like he's going into the or with me.

1969
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:44.980
And I remember them saying like,
so you can't cut.
And he was like,

1970
02:09:44.981 --> 02:09:47.170
the Hell I can't,
what do you,
and I was like,
John,

1971
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.460
you can't do like just come on man.
They don't have no drugs for both of us.

1972
02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:56.370
But he was,
it was just the girls to show you man.
Like it's,

1973
02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:01.380
there were so many experiences throughout this process that just reassured me of

1974
02:10:02.471 --> 02:10:07.471
how very real that something bigger than us out there is.

1975
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:13.150
You know,
that they're,
you know,
I was a believer growing up man,
but this was,

1976
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:18.360
there was things that happen that no one could explain that had to be from a

1977
02:10:18.641 --> 02:10:22.420
higher power.
And that was just one of them.
One of those moments where I was,

1978
02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:29.190
that was a part of me living was Josh being there and me not having to be alone

1979
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:34.310
in that situation.
So I ended up leaving Germany

1980
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:36.060
<v 2>and I was on,
I was only there for me.</v>

1981
02:10:36.130 --> 02:10:38.900
I wasn't even there a full day before they send me to Bethesda.

1982
02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:44.630
And um,
I,
I laugh because my family was supposed to meet me in Germany,

1983
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:48.980
but the turnaround is so fast.
The,
you know,
the marines were like,
no,

1984
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:53.720
we're just going to send you to Bethesda.
And I got to Bethesda and um,

1985
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.610
man,
those flights,
both flights from Iraqi,
Jeremy,
Jeremy to Bethesda,

1986
02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:04.100
every little like bit of turbulence,
every little bump,

1987
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:08.780
every little movement,
it was like being blown up all over again.
It was gnarly.

1988
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:13.190
It cause your,
your body was under,
it was in so much pain.

1989
02:11:13.191 --> 02:11:17.300
It was just,
I'd never puked so much because of pain in my life.

1990
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:22.550
And it was one of those things where I was,
again,
every little jar,

1991
02:11:22.551 --> 02:11:26.750
every movement was just like yours,
human as they come.

1992
02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:31.880
Like there's nothing special about you.
This is not going to get easier.

1993
02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:36.560
And I remember the getting there and they're waiting over by the emergency

1994
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:40.340
entrance and
the doors open.

1995
02:11:40.341 --> 02:11:42.870
And of course thing of the liaison.
I told my family like,
hey,

1996
02:11:42.871 --> 02:11:47.870
Jake's on the runway just touched down and my dad is there and I'm sure I looked

1997
02:11:47.871 --> 02:11:48.704
amazing.

1998
02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:54.730
My head was the size of a watermelon and I was black and blue and purple and I'm

1999
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:59.510
sure I smelled amazing too.
And my dad put his hand on my chest and he said,

2000
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:00.500
Bubba is that you?

2001
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:04.400
And all I could get out was get your damn hand off my chest because all my ribs

2002
02:12:04.401 --> 02:12:05.690
were broken.
And it hurt like hell.

2003
02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:11.410
And he looks at my family cause yet that's Jake,
Jake.
And so they load their,

2004
02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:13.160
their rolling me on the Gurney and this,

2005
02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:18.220
this young sailors pushing me and I remember every little like in the grout that

2006
02:12:18.351 --> 02:12:21.470
separates tiles,
like every little bump,

2007
02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:25.250
it was like getting blown up again.
And it would just make,

2008
02:12:25.251 --> 02:12:30.251
it wouldn't take my pain from six to as much as you could think in the snap of,

2009
02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:32.450
I mean,
it was gnarly.

2010
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:37.520
And so I remember he's going to push me on the elevator to take me down to the

2011
02:12:37.521 --> 02:12:41.640
ICU.
And you know,
the big gap is separate,

2012
02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.430
separates the floor and the elevator.

2013
02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:47.660
We goes across that and we're in the big elevator where they take the Gurneys,

2014
02:12:47.661 --> 02:12:48.830
take the patient's on gurneys.

2015
02:12:48.831 --> 02:12:53.831
And so my family's in there with us and he goes across that bump and this dude

2016
02:12:54.161 --> 02:12:58.030
is
so young and just,

2017
02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.310
he was the epitome of a boot.

2018
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:05.080
And so it goes across that gap.
And,
and I,

2019
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.410
I knife hand with my right hand and I look up and I say,
if you do that again,

2020
02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:14.260
I'm going to take you out.
And my dad last and it looks as a family,

2021
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:16.910
like he's going to be okay.
You know,
and um,

2022
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:22.630
like the dude's meaning to hit gaps,
right.
It's just,
you know,
the,

2023
02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:25.700
the problem was,
is I was never trained to be a severely wounded marine.

2024
02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:29.960
It wasn't in the handbook.
And so I didn't know what the hell to do and um,

2025
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:32.130
let's just get this

2026
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.930
<v 4>out of the way.
I was never a good patient,
ever.
Not one time.</v>

2027
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:41.520
It was something that I just didn't have in me.

2028
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:45.690
All I knew to do was to be a dick and fight like hell.

2029
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:49.290
And when I fight like hell,
it's,
I'm usually a dick.

2030
02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:51.940
That was my survival magazine.

2031
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:53.400
<v 3>Were you just like angry?</v>

2032
02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:56.700
Were you angry or you were hurt and pissed off that you were,

2033
02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:00.030
your leg was gone and you're like just pissed.

2034
02:14:00.210 --> 02:14:02.730
And so every nurses you're pissed at.

2035
02:14:03.850 --> 02:14:07.890
<v 4>I'm not mad.
Listen,
I'm not angry that my legs gone.
I'm not angry.
I'm angry.</v>

2036
02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:12.220
I'm up at that time.
At that time,
I'm not angry that my legs,
I'm not angry.

2037
02:14:12.221 --> 02:14:16.180
I never did the why me.
I never not want to this day,
not,
don't have,

2038
02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.080
I don't believe in that.

2039
02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:21.660
I'm angry because my family is back in a god forsaken,

2040
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:26.690
Lynn fighting and there and here I am sucking up oxygen in,

2041
02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:30.610
in a hospital bed.
That's why I'm angry.

2042
02:14:31.330 --> 02:14:34.690
I'm pissed off at God because it's like,
hey,

2043
02:14:35.170 --> 02:14:39.070
you had a perfectly good chance.
Perfectly good chance.

2044
02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:43.250
What the hell?
You know,

2045
02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.830
what the hell that's,
I mean,
what am I supposed to do right from here?

2046
02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:51.640
Right now?
What am I doing?
I'm doing no good.

2047
02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.850
None.
That's why I was angry.

2048
02:14:55.940 --> 02:15:00.940
I was angry because I could not contribute to what I was trained to contribute

2049
02:15:01.811 --> 02:15:04.780
to with,
with my brother's.
Like that's,

2050
02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:09.910
they were there and I was back home in an air conditioned room with a bunch of

2051
02:15:09.911 --> 02:15:14.470
people waiting on me.
Hand and foot,
pun totally intended like that,

2052
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:19.570
you know?
That's why I was pissed.
No,
they couldn't understand that.

2053
02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:24.640
And I,
and I don't blame them for that to this day.
I don't blame them for that,

2054
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:29.230
but it was,
um,
I don't know for,
we had a lot of guys getting hurt,

2055
02:15:29.231 --> 02:15:32.110
a lot of guys getting wounded and I mean,

2056
02:15:32.111 --> 02:15:36.370
the hospital was full of guys.
I wasn't the different,

2057
02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:39.730
I wasn't special.
I wasn't any better or worse,

2058
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:42.310
or I was just a guy who had a bed.

2059
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:46.260
<v 3>They work.
So what are they doing?
What are you going through at this point?</v>

2060
02:15:46.890 --> 02:15:51.840
You know,
obviously you're going through surgery,
surgery.
It was gnarly.

2061
02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:54.000
Yeah.
I mean it was every,
for the first

2062
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:58.800
<v 4>two and a half,
I guess months I was home.
I was in the,</v>

2063
02:15:58.801 --> 02:16:03.020
or every 48 72 hours.
And some of those operations

2064
02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.080
<v 3>were like 18,
1920 our operations and their piece and you back together.</v>

2065
02:16:07.081 --> 02:16:10.660
And the man robbing from Peter to give to Paul to try and save my left leg and

2066
02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:14.660
my left arm and stuff.
It was crazy.
Crazy,
crazy.

2067
02:16:14.661 --> 02:16:17.750
How many surgeries do you have stateside?
At 46.

2068
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:21.800
And I had 23 blood transfusions.
I've had a couple surgeries,

2069
02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.720
had a neck surgery and I had a hernia surgery.
So when you get,

2070
02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:30.100
when I got those surgeries right,
like you just feel like

2071
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.840
<v 0>complete crap is there,</v>

2072
02:16:31.841 --> 02:16:36.040
you're just going through that every just like almost on a permanent level.
Yeah,

2073
02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:39.660
the anesthesia,
the blood loss,
all that stuff.
It's just a,

2074
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:42.063
it's

2075
02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:48.050
<v 2>wake up,
suck,
go to bed,
repeat.
It was nothing.</v>

2076
02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:52.970
There was nothing fun about any of it.
And,
um,

2077
02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:56.630
I mean it was so bad that

2078
02:16:58.550 --> 02:17:02.360
it was like the nurses at the nurses station,
the night nurses,
I'll never forget,

2079
02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:07.370
and it happened every night.
They,
they would do paper,
rock,

2080
02:17:07.371 --> 02:17:09.020
scissors to see you had to take my chart.

2081
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:15.920
It was that bad in a,
God forbid a psychologist walk or

2082
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:21.950
God forbid it was,
cause I was,
I had nothing to say

2083
02:17:22.890 --> 02:17:26.970
<v 0>so I'm,
I'm kind of,
I just realized I laughed at this.
Right.
And we're at,</v>

2084
02:17:26.971 --> 02:17:31.080
you're telling it in a funny way because you're like,
hey,
I was a bad patient,

2085
02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:36.060
but the point I was getting at before,
like why you were angry,
but like we're,

2086
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:39.720
we're laughing about it right now,
but you're not kidding like this.

2087
02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:41.970
Like you were fucking pissed,
right?
Yeah.

2088
02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.390
And when someone would come in you'd be like,
you don't get that off me.

2089
02:17:45.391 --> 02:17:47.820
I don't want,
if you don't,
what you that like just agro with Pete.

2090
02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:52.450
<v 2>So I,
I had,
this is the rule that I had as a patient,</v>

2091
02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:58.560
you're not allowed in my room unless we share DNA or your United States marine.

2092
02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:01.930
And that goes for the president on down.

2093
02:18:03.310 --> 02:18:06.490
I don't give a shit what your title is or who you are.
Those are the rules.

2094
02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:10.150
If you don't have the same DNA as me and you're not United States marine,

2095
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:13.030
don't come in my room because I'm going to let you know you're not allowed.

2096
02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:19.660
And that was because I'm in survival mode and survival mode and I didn't know

2097
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:23.260
what that looked like.
I was making it up as I go,
as I went.
You know what I mean?

2098
02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:26.500
It was,
it didn't matter what surgeon was talking to me,

2099
02:18:26.501 --> 02:18:30.490
what professional with a bunch of letters after his or her name.
I didn't care.

2100
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:34.690
I did not care because my mindset was like,

2101
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:38.560
I'm trying to figure out how to get to the next breath.

2102
02:18:40.330 --> 02:18:40.790
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2103
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:43.250
<v 2>In the least painful way as possible.</v>

2104
02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:44.780
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2105
02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:48.050
<v 2>And it was something that it was,
um,
like I said,</v>

2106
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:51.500
I went from being one of the most,

2107
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:55.010
the part of one of the most elite fighting forces known to mankind,

2108
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:58.100
to not being able to use the bathroom on my own.

2109
02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:02.210
Now I was in a hospital bed for months over night.

2110
02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:06.740
I mean it it the drop of a hat that's not humble pie that's in hell on the

2111
02:19:06.741 --> 02:19:10.640
factory.
Knowing that my guys,
I knew Fallujah,

2112
02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:13.400
we were already drawn the war path or plan for Fallujah.

2113
02:19:14.630 --> 02:19:17.330
And so it's like here I am

2114
02:19:19.970 --> 02:19:20.690
<v 5>and</v>

2115
02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:24.080
<v 2>not broken.
I hate that terminology.
But here I am completely fractured</v>

2116
02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:28.160
<v 5>and,
and</v>

2117
02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:33.290
<v 4>these guys are hooking and jabbing and they're asking me what kind of,</v>

2118
02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.520
what color Jello I want.
And it's like

2119
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:43.940
I don't need,
I don't need to eat.
I need to get through the next minute.

2120
02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:49.970
And then the minute after that I get and nothing else matters.
Nothing.

2121
02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:54.860
I just need to survive second by second,

2122
02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:56.480
minute by minute and breath by breath

2123
02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:02.480
and continue to believe I'm worth this thing called life.

2124
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:07.610
I need to keep fighting.
And a byproduct of that is it.

2125
02:20:07.611 --> 02:20:11.150
I was a giant Dick,
but I kept fighting.

2126
02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:17.150
It wasn't pretty,
but I kept fighting.
And how long were you in Bethesda for?

2127
02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:22.190
Some only been says a few months and then the move me,

2128
02:20:22.850 --> 02:20:23.970
matter of fact,
my,

2129
02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:29.220
my dad goes to a Walter Reed and then he comes back and he says,

2130
02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:35.000
Yo Jake,
this is your deal and let me back up a bit.

2131
02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.120
My Dad,

2132
02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:40.430
my brother are both pretty squeamish when it comes to blog and stuff like that,

2133
02:20:40.431 --> 02:20:41.540
like it was just don't do well with it.

2134
02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.770
My Dad was an executive,

2135
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:49.930
may just retired last year and executive Baker started as a window,

2136
02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:51.680
a teller at a bank.
He worked his way up,

2137
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.390
did not leave my bedside for 62 days.

2138
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2139
02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:03.840
<v 4>Didn't leave my side no matter how hard I was on him or they did not leave my</v>

2140
02:21:05.591 --> 02:21:06.424
side.

2141
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:11.040
And I like to say that if had it not been for this explosion,

2142
02:21:11.041 --> 02:21:13.650
I would not be nearly as close to mine.
You can't,

2143
02:21:14.130 --> 02:21:18.720
I don't think I could possibly be closer to my dad as I am now or my brother.

2144
02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:24.120
Same thing,
same relationship that before just didn't,

2145
02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:26.610
we just didn't have it.

2146
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:31.470
And I think it was because there was always that Alpha struggle whereas it had

2147
02:21:31.471 --> 02:21:36.471
to take one of the office having a thumb war with the grim reaper for everyone

2148
02:21:37.261 --> 02:21:42.150
to say,
what the hell are we doing
and why are we doing it?

2149
02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:44.610
Yeah.

2150
02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:49.180
That's why I was just one of the reasons I wouldn't trade it cause that that's

2151
02:21:49.181 --> 02:21:49.841
beautiful man.

2152
02:21:49.841 --> 02:21:53.590
And I got to experience something that a lot of people don't get to experience

2153
02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:58.630
that they die wondering,
did I send everything I needed to say?

2154
02:21:59.830 --> 02:22:01.630
Did I love as hard as I needed to love.

2155
02:22:02.530 --> 02:22:07.240
I don't have to wonder about that now and neither did the love and be loved.

2156
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:08.410
Everything else is filler.

2157
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:10.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2158
02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:12.210
<v 4>So that's why I would not trade it.</v>

2159
02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:17.060
But I remember my dad told me with my left arm one night they,

2160
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.830
they were telling me,
okay Jay,
can we have this?

2161
02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:24.330
We have to reconstruct your left arm.
And the bottom graph took the first time,

2162
02:22:24.331 --> 02:22:25.770
but the top graph take

2163
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:30.090
<v 2>and the second time they tried doing it,
I remember that I woke up all,</v>

2164
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:33.290
they were cutting the graft off.
And um,

2165
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:37.830
that was an early experience when I was a week for like literally 0.5 seconds

2166
02:22:37.831 --> 02:22:42.750
before they knocked me back out.
And uh,
did you hit anybody in that point?

2167
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:47.540
Five seconds.
I tried to hit people all the time.
I think it was stupid.
I mean,

2168
02:22:47.541 --> 02:22:51.600
I messed up stitches and staples and stuff all the time and I took them,

2169
02:22:51.601 --> 02:22:53.040
I took my own out all the time.

2170
02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:56.790
I got in trouble drugged up or you during this time,
dude,

2171
02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:03.360
I was on enough drugs to like kill a herd of elephants because everybody's body

2172
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:04.890
reacts differently to drugs,
right?

2173
02:23:04.891 --> 02:23:08.760
Either you're except him and you'd doesn't take a lot with mind fights,

2174
02:23:08.761 --> 02:23:13.680
everything.
You know what I mean?
Which is not surprising,
but my,
it takes,

2175
02:23:13.681 --> 02:23:17.790
if it takes you,
are you one pill,
it's going to take me five.

2176
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:22.720
And so every operation I had,
because these were major movies,

2177
02:23:22.721 --> 02:23:26.010
were intrusive operations.
These weren't like,
hey,

2178
02:23:26.011 --> 02:23:30.300
we're going to go and take the staples out of the,
no,

2179
02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:34.950
these were were going in and cutting you back open and we're going to power wash

2180
02:23:35.130 --> 02:23:37.050
this part of your body out.

2181
02:23:37.051 --> 02:23:41.070
And I mean they were intrusive operations or we're going to go and take skin

2182
02:23:41.071 --> 02:23:45.120
from this part of your body and put it on this other part of your body.
And so,

2183
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:48.210
or we're going to take this bone out here and we're going to try and craft it

2184
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:49.044
over there.

2185
02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:53.790
And so it was one of those things where I knew like,
okay,

2186
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:59.670
these are some serious things were for six months to a year.

2187
02:23:59.671 --> 02:24:03.090
Like I didn't know if I was going to keep my left leg and my left arm because

2188
02:24:03.130 --> 02:24:03.781
they were,

2189
02:24:03.781 --> 02:24:07.770
I was going through all these operations to save these two appendages that we're

2190
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:12.270
in.
For all intents and purposes,
I was a Guinea pig for a lot of stuff,

2191
02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:15.390
which I'm okay with.
It was a better me than my brothers.

2192
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:19.710
I'm all right with that small price to pay.
It'd be one of the world's finest.

2193
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.030
Right.
And so they,
I remember the night before,

2194
02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:26.220
um,

2195
02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:31.220
I had this major operation on my left arm and this was when the graph didn't

2196
02:24:31.561 --> 02:24:35.060
take the second one and they were doing a bone graft and,
uh,

2197
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.350
they amputated my right,
like again,

2198
02:24:37.351 --> 02:24:40.860
to take some of the Tibia from my right leg to try and grafted in my left arm

2199
02:24:40.861 --> 02:24:45.760
because five inches of my own on my left arm was blown out.
And,
um,

2200
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:50.640
my dad asked the doc,
I'll never forget it.
He said,
hey doc,

2201
02:24:50.641 --> 02:24:54.880
how'd you sleep the next morning?
And he said,
I didn't.
My Dad said,
well,

2202
02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:55.960
why didn't you sleep?

2203
02:24:56.660 --> 02:25:00.870
Cause I did Jake's operation about a thousand times in my head.

2204
02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:06.030
And my dad was like,
okay,
I think I'm okay with that.
And then,
um,

2205
02:25:07.290 --> 02:25:10.500
he,
I remember him asking me,
Hey Schick,
do you,

2206
02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:14.280
do you mind if we amputate your fourth digit on your left hand because I don't

2207
02:25:14.281 --> 02:25:17.400
think it's going to be of any use to you.
And it gives,

2208
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:20.220
my metacarpal was blown out from my ring finger.
I said,

2209
02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:22.620
if I wake up and there's anything else,
cut off my body,

2210
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:25.570
don't be on the right side of my bed because I will choke you out in front of

2211
02:25:25.571 --> 02:25:26.404
God and everybody.

2212
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.350
And he been knowing me all two worlds at the time.

2213
02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:33.160
Said,
all right,

2214
02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:37.660
I'm going to take that as a no and a everybody got a good laugh and then they

2215
02:25:37.661 --> 02:25:39.880
knocked me out again.
But um,

2216
02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:46.140
so that graft didn't take and they're not in the back out then they call in a

2217
02:25:46.601 --> 02:25:49.600
specialist.
And so what they had to do was

2218
02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:56.340
put me in an induced coma and cut my abdomen open and then put my left arm in my

2219
02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:02.290
abdomen and then sold my happen and shot to grow skin over my left arm.

2220
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.430
So much interestingly,
same,
uh,

2221
02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:09.860
Lou Lou polar junior had the same cause he had severely,
uh,

2222
02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:13.930
got his hands jacked up and they did the same thing multiple times to him.
Yeah.

2223
02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:17.890
And it's,
you know,
who would have thought that's a thing,
you know,
and then they,

2224
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:21.820
so my dad and I had this thing where I would wake up every morning cause he was

2225
02:26:21.821 --> 02:26:25.920
always there during the day.
Then someone else come at night.

2226
02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.710
And so I would say,
you know,
hey dad,
it's

2227
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:33.300
Monday,
April 16th,
whatever.

2228
02:26:34.170 --> 02:26:39.170
And just to make sure I still had somewhat reliable cognitive function functions

2229
02:26:42.450 --> 02:26:43.290
going on.
You know,

2230
02:26:43.291 --> 02:26:47.590
and I'm trying to exercise as my frontal lobes as much as I can and making sure

2231
02:26:47.591 --> 02:26:50.680
these executive functions are still working the way they are because I was

2232
02:26:50.681 --> 02:26:54.340
already told you've got post traumatic stress track ran injury,
which I was like,

2233
02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:55.174
whatever,

2234
02:26:55.210 --> 02:27:00.040
no that's made up stuff by people in white coats with too much time on their

2235
02:27:00.041 --> 02:27:03.880
hands.
That do will not affect me.
I'm a marine.
No.

2236
02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:09.510
And um,
so I'm coming out of this,
uh,

2237
02:27:11.470 --> 02:27:16.280
this coma,
that was the first time that I,

2238
02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:21.370
my brother came in for the first time and I remember he,

2239
02:27:22.390 --> 02:27:25.120
he came in and uh,
I could see,

2240
02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:29.740
cause what sucked was as early on in the induced coma.
Like,
I could be alert,

2241
02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.650
but I couldn't obviously couldn't say anything cause I was intubated.

2242
02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:34.720
So I did machine breathing for me.

2243
02:27:34.721 --> 02:27:39.460
I was completely paralyzed from the neck down,
couldn't move anything.

2244
02:27:40.570 --> 02:27:42.550
And it only lasted at first.

2245
02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.890
They only did it for a day or so because it was so gnarly that my,

2246
02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:47.900
my BP and everything would freak out.

2247
02:27:47.901 --> 02:27:50.450
My blood pressure go up when I would see someone in my family because I felt

2248
02:27:50.451 --> 02:27:53.510
like I was trapped in my own.
I'm a prisoner in my own body.

2249
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:58.040
Somebody get me the hell out of this coma.
You can't move and can't talk.
Nothing.

2250
02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:02.810
And yet your conscious,
yeah.
Isn't the purpose of being an induced coma.

2251
02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:05.900
So in concert,
right,
so they,
they,

2252
02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:09.950
this is just prior to them and deucing the coma.
Oh,
okay.

2253
02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:12.170
And so it was just before it,

2254
02:28:12.171 --> 02:28:16.760
but then my brother came in and it was the first time that my brother had been

2255
02:28:16.761 --> 02:28:17.271
able to see me.

2256
02:28:17.271 --> 02:28:22.250
He was in college at the time and playing ball and brother came in and sat down

2257
02:28:22.251 --> 02:28:23.690
in the chair.
So we'll first,

2258
02:28:23.691 --> 02:28:28.400
when he goes to walk in and I see him come in the door in the ICU and he leaves,

2259
02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:31.670
he,
he like took a half step in.
He turned around,
he bolted.

2260
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.410
And this is the queasiness factor?
No,
I think this is,
no,

2261
02:28:36.411 --> 02:28:38.960
I think it,
for him it was an emotion.

2262
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:42.680
He didn't want to be emotional and me,
no,
he was emotional,

2263
02:28:42.681 --> 02:28:46.800
which I knew exactly why I had to leave the room.
So it's like,
it's obsolete.

2264
02:28:46.801 --> 02:28:50.510
It might as well just come all the way in.
I know what you're doing.
And so,

2265
02:28:50.511 --> 02:28:55.511
but then he comes back in and he sits down in the chair on the right side of my

2266
02:28:56.331 --> 02:28:59.570
bed and grabs my right hand and he puts his,

2267
02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:03.920
his forehead on my hand and he just starts crying and he just starts repeating

2268
02:29:03.921 --> 02:29:07.670
over and over again.
Thank you for not died.
Thank you for not dying.

2269
02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:13.070
And I was like,
dude,
anytime you want to shut up about that,

2270
02:29:13.071 --> 02:29:17.510
like it would be awesome.
Because it was getting,
I mean it was getting too,

2271
02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:20.960
right.
So my BP started going up and they're like,
hey,
you gotta leave.

2272
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:24.980
Like you can't stay in here.
So then they realize like,
okay,
we gotta,

2273
02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:27.310
we gotta knock them out.
And I mean,

2274
02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.680
cause they tried taping the windows so I couldn't see it,

2275
02:29:29.681 --> 02:29:31.400
but then it just was too much.
And so they,

2276
02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:34.670
that's when they completely put me in the coma.

2277
02:29:34.671 --> 02:29:39.200
And that was for,
it was like 30 days or something.

2278
02:29:39.201 --> 02:29:42.410
And I remember coming out of it and telling my dad,
like,

2279
02:29:42.411 --> 02:29:47.411
we didn't do scores for 30 days to grow that around my arm.

2280
02:29:47.781 --> 02:29:52.250
And so they cut it out and then it took,

2281
02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:56.060
thankfully it did.
That was the last resort for my left arm.
It was,

2282
02:29:56.061 --> 02:29:58.490
if that didn't take,
they're going to have to amputate below my elbow,

2283
02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:02.720
within my dad weeks or a week of I'm coming out and I looked at my dad and my

2284
02:30:02.721 --> 02:30:07.210
dad,
it's Monday,
April 16.
And he was like,
well no,
it's,
uh,
what,

2285
02:30:07.211 --> 02:30:09.700
what happened was,
and then I'm like,

2286
02:30:09.701 --> 02:30:13.520
it did no one want to run this by me.
He was like,
no,

2287
02:30:13.521 --> 02:30:17.390
they figured you'd be against it.
So it's like whatever shit,

2288
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:21.980
just,
uh,
put it on my tab.
It's like,

2289
02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:27.020
but I remember my dad going over to Walter,
he,
it was time my dad told them like,

2290
02:30:27.021 --> 02:30:30.380
hey,
listen,
I can afford to fly up here and see my son every week,

2291
02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:33.440
most of his family,
because I'm still not out of the woods.

2292
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:37.970
Most of his family can't afford to come to Maryland from Louisiana or Texas to

2293
02:30:37.971 --> 02:30:39.380
come,
you know,
see them often.

2294
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:45.140
And so he goes to Walter Reed and came back and he told me,
he said,
Bob,

2295
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:50.540
this is your deal.
This is,
but no son of mine is going to go to that hospital.

2296
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.230
That's what I mean.
Obviously I'm going to take your word for it.

2297
02:30:54.231 --> 02:30:58.400
It's not like I can skip over there and go check it out.
And they said,
okay.
Well,

2298
02:30:58.401 --> 02:31:03.401
we had a friend that worked at the Pentagon who was a one star and my dad and my

2299
02:31:03.951 --> 02:31:06.110
step mom contacted him and just said,
hey,
listen,

2300
02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:09.770
we got to get Jay closer to home.
And so I actually went to,

2301
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:13.760
they sent me to BMC in San Antonio.
And,
um,

2302
02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:18.980
I like to say that's accounts for 50% of my potion.

2303
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:23.220
Nitris cause I was the only marine and army facility and sorry,

2304
02:31:23.221 --> 02:31:24.330
I'm not sorry about that,

2305
02:31:24.331 --> 02:31:29.331
but it was a great hospital that they did just a good work is Bethesda and um,

2306
02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:32.880
you know,
but when they,
when they shipped me,

2307
02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:36.270
they moved me way too soon and I just,

2308
02:31:36.271 --> 02:31:41.040
my body wasn't ready for it and we had to stop and I believe it's called Scott

2309
02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.950
Air Force Base in Illinois.
Three flying.
Yeah.
I'm a bird.

2310
02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:48.030
And so we stopped and Scott and um,

2311
02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:54.120
I guess we didn't know that we were stopping and I had only had enough,

2312
02:31:55.570 --> 02:32:00.570
well enough medications in my nerve blockers for set amount of time to get to

2313
02:32:01.171 --> 02:32:04.890
San Antonio.
Well that stuff was,

2314
02:32:05.130 --> 02:32:09.660
they wanted to do a little layover.
Yeah.
So I'm pissed.

2315
02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.670
I wake up when we're there and this gun,
he walks up to me and he's like,
hey,

2316
02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:19.260
hey corporal.
Sure.
He get a welcome with Scott Air Force base,
um,

2317
02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:23.700
gunny schmuck and telly.
And I was like,

2318
02:32:25.050 --> 02:32:29.170
where the Hell Scott Air Force Base and who the hell are you?
Um,

2319
02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:33.360
because my,
my tax at this point is gone way out the window.

2320
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:37.860
Did Not matter your rank like it did not matter.

2321
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:41.190
And because I'm at the point where I'm like,
what are they going to do?

2322
02:32:41.191 --> 02:32:45.450
Shave my head and send me and I rack please,
you'd be doing me a favor.

2323
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:49.080
But so I'm pissed.
And I called my dad and I'm like,

2324
02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:54.081
I don't know who fucked this up but I need you to unfuck it right now.

2325
02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:58.770
And he got pissed.
I was pissed at him.
Something was out of his control,
you know,

2326
02:32:58.771 --> 02:33:02.700
and he was like,
Jake,
oh,
you'll fine.
Go back to go back to Bethesda.

2327
02:33:02.701 --> 02:33:06.050
I don't care what you know.
And it was,
you know,
I,

2328
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:12.120
I was owed that in a lot more.
And so they get me in the hospital and my,

2329
02:33:12.121 --> 02:33:13.590
and my buddy just starts to shut down.

2330
02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:16.910
And so the next thing is in the hospital and Scott Scott,

2331
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:21.660
and this is not like a major,
like a legit,
like they stopped,
stopped like,

2332
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:27.120
so then it's a delay for me to even go to San Antonio because bigger to get you

2333
02:33:27.121 --> 02:33:31.890
to recover kind of.
Yeah.
And so that series of events happens there,

2334
02:33:31.891 --> 02:33:33.180
which was crazy.

2335
02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:37.920
So I go into this shock effect where,
you know,
I'm,

2336
02:33:37.930 --> 02:33:39.520
I'm unconscious and uh,

2337
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:43.650
this is another one of those moments where the higher power thing,

2338
02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.440
I'm coming out of it.
And,
uh,
my,
my left head,
my turns,

2339
02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:53.010
my head is turned to my left and the door to my room opens.

2340
02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:56.550
I knew whoever was about to walk in the door.

2341
02:33:56.551 --> 02:34:01.551
Like I just felt like a spiritual presence.

2342
02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:06.720
Like I just felt,
I knew whoever that was was a person of faith,
like personally,

2343
02:34:06.721 --> 02:34:10.470
God knew it,
knew it,
no doubt about it,
felt it.
When the door opened,

2344
02:34:11.410 --> 02:34:15.870
the dude comes around the corner and introduced himself and it's the base

2345
02:34:15.871 --> 02:34:18.100
chaplain.
And I was

2346
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:22.750
<v 4>like,
okay,
well that's,
that's that.
And uh,</v>

2347
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:26.590
and he said,
hey,
I'm chaplain.
So,
and I said,
I knew,

2348
02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:31.060
I knew before you even for,
I saw you as soon as the door opened.
Like I felt,

2349
02:34:31.450 --> 02:34:36.100
I felt the presence of a higher being.

2350
02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:36.934
Like I felt it,

2351
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:41.710
I knew it and like this really like he,

2352
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:46.390
you could tell he was moved by it.
I wouldn't say it to blow smoke up his ass.

2353
02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:51.220
I just knew the dude was a man of God.
And I mean it again,
can't explain it.

2354
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:54.910
It's the whole thing.
The whole word faith comes in,
look it up.

2355
02:34:54.911 --> 02:34:58.420
Sometime you got to utilize it.
But the um,

2356
02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:01.630
so then he walks in and starts talking to me.

2357
02:35:01.631 --> 02:35:06.130
So we have this long conversation of which I can't remember most of the next,

2358
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:10.540
the next day is when I'm leaving and he brings his whole family.

2359
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:15.540
He had like four or five kids and as we brought his wife and the all the nurses

2360
02:35:18.821 --> 02:35:23.821
and I mean the airmen and the reserve marines and army guys like made this line

2361
02:35:25.871 --> 02:35:29.550
on either side of the back doors of the bird.
And it was like,

2362
02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:34.690
like I don't rate what you guys are doing but appreciate it.

2363
02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.770
Like I can dig it right.
But I didn't,
I was just thinking like,

2364
02:35:40.390 --> 02:35:45.310
it's a little much,
but thank you.
You know?
And it was,

2365
02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:46.690
but it was like,
you know,

2366
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:51.870
who the hell am I to take away from their right to honor their brother and like,

2367
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:57.640
you know,
who am I to do that?
They're just showing love all the way,

2368
02:35:58.570 --> 02:36:03.240
not halfway.
And I,
and so of course me being me at the time,

2369
02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:05.530
I didn't look at it that way.
I was just like,

2370
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:09.400
I'm naked in front of everyone type feeling.
I'm just uncomfortable right now.

2371
02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:12.960
And so they,
they load me up and we fly from um,

2372
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:17.260
Scott to we're going to Bam cu and we stop over.

2373
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:20.870
And,
uh,
I was,
uh,

2374
02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:24.170
it was all Pasa and on the way I can see the,

2375
02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:28.870
the load master mouth to one of the other,
one of the crewman,

2376
02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:33.880
we're about to fly around a tornado.
I read his lips and I'm like,

2377
02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:39.930
Hey God,
like,
come on man,
throw due to bone like robot.

2378
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:42.700
I'm going to survive all the stuff I've survived.

2379
02:36:42.701 --> 02:36:46.480
And if you let me get taken out by a tornado,
like we're,

2380
02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:49.420
we're going to be fighting.
This is bullshit.

2381
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:55.000
I'm just thinking like Murphy back off Bro.
Just back off.

2382
02:36:55.750 --> 02:37:00.160
But it's just these little moments where you find light in these heavy

2383
02:37:00.161 --> 02:37:03.710
situations and I didn't know that we were stopping and I'll pass.

2384
02:37:03.710 --> 02:37:05.710
So we stopped and I'll pass on.
I'm pissed.

2385
02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:08.440
Why are we stopping and why aren't we in San Antonio?

2386
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:14.190
Well cause we had to drop off someone who's gay and there's return in the body.

2387
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:21.130
And I was like,
okay,
I'm a major dick and I get it.
You know,

2388
02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:23.690
it was like,
well shit could you told me that?

2389
02:37:23.691 --> 02:37:27.560
And they probably did tell me but I'm on so many drugs I'm going to remember

2390
02:37:27.561 --> 02:37:31.040
about 0.2 seconds of an hour conversation I had with you.

2391
02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:34.640
So we get to San Antonio again,
my body,
it was bad.

2392
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:37.040
I mean my buddy does the same thing I did at Scott.

2393
02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:42.940
And then next thing I know I'm in the ICU again and now the Olr and I ended up

2394
02:37:44.031 --> 02:37:44.864
doing

2395
02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.450
15 months and Banksy and um,

2396
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:54.560
man,
every operation it was just more drugs,
more drugs,
more drugs,

2397
02:37:54.561 --> 02:37:57.180
more drugs and a series of events happened to Bamf.

2398
02:37:57.180 --> 02:38:01.180
See I'm the only marine there,
which I stayed in.

2399
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:05.240
It was bad because I mean you can only call a marine and soldier so many times

2400
02:38:05.241 --> 02:38:08.750
before.
I'm going to let you know that that bothers me.

2401
02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.540
And if I wanted to be a soldier,
I would have joined the fricking army.

2402
02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:15.950
Stop calling me a soldier.
That's just the marine thing.
It's a pride thing.

2403
02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:20.990
Absolutely.
A fricking pride thing.
If you don't like it would you,

2404
02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:25.790
would you call chesty puller soldier?
Cause if you would,
you're ignorant.

2405
02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:30.890
And my thing was is like just utilize some tact

2406
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:34.790
and so they ended up putting the,
the Ega,

2407
02:38:34.791 --> 02:38:39.791
the Marine Corps sill on my door and just to let people know a little heads up.

2408
02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:42.350
Yeah,
same rules though.

2409
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:47.900
You don't share my DNA and your 99 states marine don't come in my room

2410
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:52.940
still.
So I didn't meet,
I missed,

2411
02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.240
I missed out on meeting a lot of quote unquote famous people and politicians

2412
02:38:59.511 --> 02:39:03.920
that I'm sure there because they care and a bunch of other people and it was

2413
02:39:03.921 --> 02:39:05.000
because of that role.

2414
02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:10.150
And then the secretary of the army or the surgeon general,
I'm sorry,

2415
02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:13.900
surgeons,
German was coming and they were like,
corporal shake,
we really,
you know,

2416
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:18.560
we need you to wake up and shave and you're going to come see the surgeon

2417
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:22.880
general.
And I was like,
okay,
yeah,
yeah,

2418
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:26.780
I'm going to do that.
Obviously I didn't.

2419
02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:30.050
And so I have people coming up to my room and they're like,
corporal shack,

2420
02:39:30.051 --> 02:39:31.760
the surgeon general's downstairs,

2421
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:35.000
you were supposed to be in your electrical wheelchair down there meeting them.

2422
02:39:35.001 --> 02:39:39.290
And I'm like,
what?
Part of my face says I give a shit that they're here.

2423
02:39:39.890 --> 02:39:44.420
I don't even know if it's a man or a woman and I don't care if they want to see

2424
02:39:44.421 --> 02:39:46.970
me.
You know where my room is.

2425
02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:51.740
Do I go to his or her office and say,
Hey,

2426
02:39:51.741 --> 02:39:55.970
I'm going to need you downstairs cause I'm coming.
No,

2427
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:58.760
no I don't.
They're a person just like me,

2428
02:39:59.630 --> 02:40:02.660
except they prob something tells you that pain level's probably not where mine

2429
02:40:02.661 --> 02:40:06.740
is right now
and no,
I'm not going to shave either.

2430
02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:11.090
So you can just just eat a whole bag of dicks cause I don't care.

2431
02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:16.890
And so again,
great patient.
Really,
really good patient.

2432
02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:20.660
<v 0>So you're the drugs at this point that they're putting,</v>

2433
02:40:20.661 --> 02:40:23.820
you amass all kinds of pain killers and

2434
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.670
do you even do,
is there any point where you start realizing like,

2435
02:40:29.730 --> 02:40:32.940
oh I'm not going to be okay without these things.
I want them all the time.

2436
02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.770
Not once.
So at this point,
no.
So you're just thinking that's just the way it is.

2437
02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:41.330
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Hey look,
I'm,
I'm badly wounded.
I need painkillers.

2438
02:40:41.350 --> 02:40:46.260
Part of the game.
Yeah.
Right.
Part of the game.
At this point I'm thinking I have,

2439
02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:52.800
<v 4>this is probably the operation like 35 36 and it's so bad that they have me now</v>

2440
02:40:54.401 --> 02:40:57.880
I'm having to recover in the ICU after every operation because they're having a

2441
02:40:57.881 --> 02:41:02.170
monitor,
my breathing and my heart rate because I'm on so many drugs.

2442
02:41:02.890 --> 02:41:07.210
And so at this point they've given me what they feel like,
okay,

2443
02:41:07.211 --> 02:41:10.780
we cannot just give them more of any,

2444
02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:14.950
we can't give him more dilaudid,
demerol or fentanyl or et Cetera,
et cetera.

2445
02:41:14.951 --> 02:41:15.820
And so they give me,

2446
02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:19.900
this was the first time that I had experienced after one of these operations,

2447
02:41:19.901 --> 02:41:22.600
ketamine and

2448
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:26.610
I was such a,

2449
02:41:26.830 --> 02:41:31.630
this is bad because of the guy comes in and start administering the ketamine and

2450
02:41:31.631 --> 02:41:35.230
uh,
I'll never forget this.
And he goes,

2451
02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:36.940
he starts to administer it through my,

2452
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:41.930
one of my view that come into my picc line and he says,
Hey,

2453
02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:46.870
you fill it yet?
Like,
nope,
keep pushing,
fill it yet.

2454
02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:50.240
No,
I started to fill up the second time you asked,
but I was like,
nope.

2455
02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:54.400
All right Phil,
yet,
nope,

2456
02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:57.040
nothing this time.

2457
02:41:57.070 --> 02:42:01.240
I definitely feel it when I'm lying because again,
if one pill is good,

2458
02:42:01.241 --> 02:42:06.190
I bet you tins.
Awesome.
My mindset.
Right?
And this,
the fourth time you asked me,

2459
02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:10.500
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
all right,
I feel it.
And he was like,
okay,
cause that is,

2460
02:42:10.570 --> 02:42:12.640
I don't think I've ever given anyone that much,

2461
02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:16.480
but they say your tolerance is really,
really high.
So you know it is what it is.

2462
02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:19.570
Well,
I mean I sorted the door,

2463
02:42:19.571 --> 02:42:23.730
didn't even shut all the way and I started hallucinating my balls off and I'm a,

2464
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:27.650
I'm on so much cadamine
it on the street.

2465
02:42:27.770 --> 02:42:29.950
Apparently the street terminology for Special K

2466
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:36.070
and I didn't even know,
like that was a thing and it was,

2467
02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:41.680
it was gnarly.
I mean I was seeing things that weren't there.
I was,

2468
02:42:41.710 --> 02:42:43.420
it was bad.
And I,

2469
02:42:43.850 --> 02:42:48.640
and I came out of that and I told my lease physician that came.

2470
02:42:48.641 --> 02:42:52.740
I said,
don't ever,
I don't want that stuff anymore.
Like that was not like,

2471
02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:57.370
that was not a cool,
hi.
I think it was bad.
I don't like it.
And they were like,

2472
02:42:57.371 --> 02:42:59.710
well,
we're going to have to put you back in the ICU.
I was like,
I do not care.

2473
02:42:59.711 --> 02:43:04.330
I'll live in the ICU.
It's not like I'm in the Ritz.

2474
02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:07.700
Okay.
If I'm in the ICU or I'm in this room with four other dude,

2475
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:12.010
like it doesn't matter,
whatever.
Right.
And,
um,

2476
02:43:12.670 --> 02:43:14.310
obviously I'd develop,
uh,

2477
02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:19.310
develop a bit of a reputation at Babsi and um,
I'm,

2478
02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:20.830
I'm attached to fourth recon.

2479
02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.390
It was there at the time and it's right out right by Bamsee.

2480
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:30.070
And there was one marine there that the day I got there,
he was right there.

2481
02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:33.430
It was,
I'm a staff sergeant at the time and

2482
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:37.840
he told me when I got there was like a brother,
I'm gonna come see you every day.

2483
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:41.980
I'm in this with you.
Well,

2484
02:43:41.981 --> 02:43:46.981
so did the Harlem River views the first time or major at the time said the same

2485
02:43:47.981 --> 02:43:50.880
thing?
Well there was a lot of cameras there,
you know,

2486
02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:54.870
CNN and Fox and crap cause um,
you know,
the only marine or facility,

2487
02:43:54.990 --> 02:43:58.750
it's got some attention.
And so that guy says the same thing.

2488
02:43:59.230 --> 02:44:02.020
Well I didn't see him again,
but the first guy,

2489
02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:06.070
the staffs are every day man,
every day.

2490
02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:08.170
And he started mess.

2491
02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:12.220
Like he would walk in and like tickle where my right foot should be and it would

2492
02:44:12.221 --> 02:44:15.820
tick.
It was crazy cause it would tickle and it wouldn't contact Vic come on Bro.

2493
02:44:16.810 --> 02:44:19.900
And he would,
he would just laugh and laugh.
You thought was the best thing ever.

2494
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:23.140
And it was just those little moments though,

2495
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:28.590
those little nuances of time that would lighten make me forget that I was who I

2496
02:44:29.381 --> 02:44:34.381
was and I was in the situation I was in that would make me realize,

2497
02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:39.850
you know,
if,
if I think it's that bad

2498
02:44:42.010 --> 02:44:44.290
I would get when I was able to get mobile,

2499
02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.370
I remember actually I was in isolation when Todd showed up,

2500
02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:52.090
who was the second marine?
It bancy and um,

2501
02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:58.420
they told me,
hey,
there's another marine on deck.
Just he's getting,

2502
02:44:58.510 --> 02:45:02.650
he just got here but they don't think he's going to make it my side.

2503
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:06.490
I need to see,
I need to go see them right now.
Like while you're in isolation,

2504
02:45:06.491 --> 02:45:09.580
I do not give a shit.
I'm going to go see him right now.

2505
02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:14.710
We're going to have to kill me.
It's the only way I'm not seeing.
So they're like,

2506
02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:16.533
okay.

2507
02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:22.120
And they get the little human crane and train me up and put me in my black

2508
02:45:22.121 --> 02:45:24.880
electrical wheelchair.
I call it my black Cadillac thing.
It was legit.

2509
02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:26.710
They took it from you though,

2510
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:31.790
is that I put one too many holes in the walls of the don't drive your electric

2511
02:45:32.470 --> 02:45:34.930
wheelchair and heavily,

2512
02:45:36.010 --> 02:45:38.350
heavily medicated folks.
It's not safe,

2513
02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:43.630
but I go see ty Dui.
Right.
I'm one of those too.

2514
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:47.590
Yeah.
Believe it or not,
I don't want to us and uh,

2515
02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:51.610
but I go see ty or mind you this time,

2516
02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:55.390
at this point I still haven't gotten like emotional one time

2517
02:45:57.970 --> 02:46:01.030
since I left Doula.

2518
02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:03.610
Like I haven't gotten the motion from my family or otherwise.

2519
02:46:04.010 --> 02:46:07.810
I'm still pretty squared away with them.
Whole emotion thing.

2520
02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:13.470
I go see ty and I go into his room and he's completely wrapped up in the

2521
02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:19.130
front.
Half of his cranium was blown off.
I mean it was,

2522
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:23.150
he was blind in one eye.
Severely burned.

2523
02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:25.840
I mean bad.
I mean,

2524
02:46:25.850 --> 02:46:30.410
it looked like a mummy when I saw no ears were burning off eyelids,
nose,

2525
02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:33.530
lips.
And uh,

2526
02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:37.720
I remember I had to yell at his nurse who was this giant black dude,

2527
02:46:38.270 --> 02:46:39.170
black army guy.

2528
02:46:40.430 --> 02:46:45.430
And I had to yell at him who had to then lean down and yell and the side of Ty's

2529
02:46:46.521 --> 02:46:49.760
head so he could know what was going on.

2530
02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:52.610
And I just told them,
I told the nurse when I got,

2531
02:46:52.611 --> 02:46:57.611
and there was like a brother just wanted to come see my family because I heard

2532
02:46:58.551 --> 02:47:00.170
another marine was on deck and I was like,

2533
02:47:00.171 --> 02:47:04.880
right on and now we can take over this hospital.
And uh,

2534
02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:08.360
so he leaned down and he said,
hey ty,

2535
02:47:08.370 --> 02:47:13.190
another marine and tie like put up as it's not like hell yeah,

2536
02:47:13.310 --> 02:47:18.140
marines and,
and tie whispered to the nurse.
And he said,

2537
02:47:18.141 --> 02:47:21.930
he wants to know like,
what are your injuries?
And I told him,

2538
02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:27.230
told him my injuries and uh,
started of course with a loss of her right leg,

2539
02:47:27.231 --> 02:47:29.030
did lose it.
I mean obviously I know where it went,

2540
02:47:29.031 --> 02:47:34.010
but total started with that and he was with,
he was telling ties,

2541
02:47:34.011 --> 02:47:36.830
I'm telling the injuries and as soon as the civil loss,

2542
02:47:36.831 --> 02:47:40.340
right leg like ty holds up his right leg,
like still got mine,

2543
02:47:41.310 --> 02:47:44.090
was it down the left leg up,

2544
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:49.150
banged up Bob that holds up his left leg and it was like do this typical typical

2545
02:47:50.571 --> 02:47:55.571
marine banter right there considering the conditions were in yet we're just

2546
02:47:58.221 --> 02:47:59.270
going to smoke and joke

2547
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:04.670
because that's what family does to get through the arts times you've got to find

2548
02:48:04.671 --> 02:48:09.320
light and regardless of how dark the situation is,

2549
02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.450
because if you don't it will kill you.

2550
02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.820
But I remember having this interaction with ty and I left the room

2551
02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:22.700
and I'm facing the nurse's station and when I come out and the door shuts and I

2552
02:48:22.701 --> 02:48:26.300
just completely and utterly broke down

2553
02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:32.540
to the point of anger like I was,
I was sobbing and angry.

2554
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:37.630
I was so angry seeing him that way and I just like just yell like those,

2555
02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:42.950
those bastards like,
you know what?

2556
02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:48.980
Why?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

2557
02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:52.580
What are we gonna do about that?
And it pissed me off.

2558
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:57.260
Well not only because here I see my brother that is never,
ever,

2559
02:48:57.261 --> 02:49:01.100
ever going to be remotely the same as he ever was before.

2560
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.320
But then it reminded me

2561
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:09.360
in a very abrupt manner,
who the hell are you

2562
02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:13.020
to be acting the way you're acting?

2563
02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:16.013
<v 5>Because</v>

2564
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.720
<v 4>they're telling his family,</v>

2565
02:49:18.721 --> 02:49:22.410
you better call anyone who wants to tell him goodbye because he's probably not

2566
02:49:22.411 --> 02:49:24.240
gonna make it through the next 48 hours.

2567
02:49:25.050 --> 02:49:28.680
And here I was acting like a complete ass hat,

2568
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:33.080
very much alive,
not having,

2569
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:36.440
they weren't having to call anyone on my family or any of my friends cause I was

2570
02:49:36.441 --> 02:49:41.240
gonna make it at this point I'm going to make it
in.

2571
02:49:41.241 --> 02:49:44.900
That reminded me of it's not about you.

2572
02:49:46.930 --> 02:49:49.030
He just thought it was about you.
It's not about you.

2573
02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:56.160
And then that,
that one interaction taught me right then,
okay,

2574
02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.240
I need to go see every wounded person in this hospital as often as I can

2575
02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:09.010
because that's where I found healing.
So that's what I did.

2576
02:50:09.130 --> 02:50:14.130
I saw everyone had person talked to all of their families and that is when I

2577
02:50:15.761 --> 02:50:20.761
realized that gather there's really something to this service above self because

2578
02:50:22.001 --> 02:50:26.230
not only does it feed my soul if he's there's,
it's mutually beneficial.

2579
02:50:28.190 --> 02:50:29.023
<v 5>I learned</v>

2580
02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:33.920
<v 4>if you're not willing</v>

2581
02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:35.613
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

2582
02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:42.700
<v 4>to use whatever platform you find yourself in and to make yourself 100%</v>

2583
02:50:43.220 --> 02:50:46.070
vulnerable for whatever may come,

2584
02:50:47.330 --> 02:50:48.680
you will never make a difference.

2585
02:50:51.250 --> 02:50:53.810
You were waking up and choosing to be status quo

2586
02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:59.750
and choosing to be average and I learned right then

2587
02:51:01.490 --> 02:51:03.110
the great,
the great ones,

2588
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:07.970
the ones that the history books are going to rave about and that do rave about,

2589
02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:11.240
we're consistently uncomfortable

2590
02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:14.810
and consistently vulnerable.

2591
02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:19.370
That was a great lesson for me to learn.

2592
02:51:21.350 --> 02:51:23.450
They didn't make me any better than anyone else.

2593
02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:27.140
It just made me more susceptible to judgment,

2594
02:51:29.350 --> 02:51:33.490
which already had a ton of,
so I didn't care.
Mean.

2595
02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:38.810
I remember being in thinking about this pride of being a United States marine

2596
02:51:39.341 --> 02:51:44.220
and representing what that means and thinking about gunny,
you know,

2597
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:49.230
the salty gunny back in Iraq and thinking how would he behave?

2598
02:51:50.201 --> 02:51:54.160
How would he react?
How would,
what would he do?
Same thing about first or,

2599
02:51:55.250 --> 02:51:57.640
I'm actually,
let's back up,
back to,

2600
02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:03.520
I'm going to give an example of what being tribal truly means that you can't

2601
02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:08.560
buy.
So I'm back in Bethesda and my dad tells me,
hey Jake,

2602
02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:13.720
first green's going to come see you.
And I just remember thinking,
shit,

2603
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:15.450
he's,
he's,

2604
02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:19.750
I'm sure he's pissed cause I got hit and like he's probably just going to finish

2605
02:52:19.751 --> 02:52:22.900
the job.
And so I was terrified.

2606
02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:28.280
I'm terrified because I not only do I respect this man to the nth degree,

2607
02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:34.120
but I love this man
and I was like,
ah,
fuck.

2608
02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:37.450
I don't want to experience what I'm about to have to experience.

2609
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:40.900
I'd rather take the coward's way out.
So I was like,

2610
02:52:40.901 --> 02:52:43.630
I'm just gonna act like I'm passed out when he walks in and I'm on a lot of

2611
02:52:43.631 --> 02:52:45.850
drugs that will work.

2612
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:49.480
So you're knock on the door and I'm like,

2613
02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:53.650
I hear the door open on dad.
Say you're getting your first Soren,

2614
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:56.650
how are you at first?
Sort of walks in.
So I'm like,
all right,

2615
02:52:56.651 --> 02:53:01.651
I'm passed out as soon as he busted the hatch and walks in my freaking heart

2616
02:53:02.411 --> 02:53:03.480
monitor dimes now

2617
02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:09.550
cause it goes from like the slow steady beat to the boo boo to the rapid beep.

2618
02:53:09.551 --> 02:53:10.660
And I'm like,
son of a bitch,

2619
02:53:10.661 --> 02:53:14.650
obviously this isn't going to work and there is no plan B.
I'm awake.

2620
02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:20.640
And he looks at my family and my dad's in there and my mom,

2621
02:53:21.881 --> 02:53:25.770
my step mom,
my aunt,
my cousins,
my brother and my sister,
I'm like,

2622
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:30.040
and he says,
uh,
hey miss Schick,
how are you doing?

2623
02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:32.710
He's got that raspy voice.
I mean,

2624
02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:37.330
I'd imagine being on the drill field as long as it was,
didn't help.
And he said,

2625
02:53:37.331 --> 02:53:40.630
um,
no,
we're doing our,
we're hanging in there first.
Sorry.
He said,
good,
go.

2626
02:53:40.631 --> 02:53:44.350
Good to go.
Hey,
you want to have a minute with my brother?
And my dad was like,

2627
02:53:44.351 --> 02:53:48.310
sure,
no,
go ahead.
For a shorter,
like he was going to turn around,

2628
02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:49.871
come talk to me.

2629
02:53:49.871 --> 02:53:53.080
They're buying in the room and he looks right at my father and says,
yeah,

2630
02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:57.700
I'm gonna need y'all get the hell out.
And I was just thinking,

2631
02:53:57.701 --> 02:53:59.440
he's about to kill me right now over.

2632
02:54:01.050 --> 02:54:04.660
And he comes up to the side of my bed and remember the only thing worse than my

2633
02:54:04.661 --> 02:54:08.080
right arm firsthand leans down,

2634
02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:13.350
he puts his right arm out,
is it to like pick me up?
And so I grabbed like I,

2635
02:54:14.590 --> 02:54:18.940
I claps hands with him as if he's going to pick me up right.

2636
02:54:20.290 --> 02:54:25.290
And he puts the back of his hand on my heart and the back of my hand on his and

2637
02:54:28.031 --> 02:54:32.740
he leans down further and puts his forehead on my forehead and he sits there for

2638
02:54:32.741 --> 02:54:36.130
about three minutes.
He stands up,

2639
02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:39.580
he pats me on my face and he walks out

2640
02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:42.213
to this day,

2641
02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.750
it was one of the most powerful conversations I've ever had in my life and not

2642
02:54:46.751 --> 02:54:51.160
one word was spoken.
That's being tribal.

2643
02:54:51.970 --> 02:54:56.890
That's tribal,
that goes much deeper than team.
You can't train that.

2644
02:54:58.490 --> 02:55:02.860
And he walks out of the room and obviously gets emotional when he walks out.

2645
02:55:02.861 --> 02:55:06.560
Cause Dad walks in and I get emotional as soon as he walks up because God forbid

2646
02:55:06.561 --> 02:55:08.960
we tried for a one another.
You can't do that.

2647
02:55:09.210 --> 02:55:12.350
And my dad walks in and sees me emotional and he went,
hey,
first sergeant.

2648
02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:16.520
And he looks at me and like it with a puzzled look on his face and he just goes,

2649
02:55:18.290 --> 02:55:21.610
you marines are fricking weird.
I was like,

2650
02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.280
get out banker or you're a banker.

2651
02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:28.760
And it was one of those moments,
man,
that

2652
02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:32.853
<v 5>okay.</v>

2653
02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:37.950
<v 4>Only people who have bear the burden of a purpose much greater than themselves.</v>

2654
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:39.410
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2655
02:55:39.410 --> 02:55:43.910
<v 4>Willingly and openly knowing what the odds could be,</v>

2656
02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:46.130
what the odds are,
what the outcomes could be.

2657
02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:50.630
Only the people that are willing to love all the way.

2658
02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:52.810
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:55:52.810 --> 02:55:54.130
<v 4>Regardless of the amount of pain.</v>

2660
02:55:55.330 --> 02:55:55.680
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2661
02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:57.750
<v 4>Can understand and appreciate that moment.</v>

2662
02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:00.811
I mean,

2663
02:56:00.811 --> 02:56:05.580
and I'm proud to say that that is now the sergeant major of the United States

2664
02:56:05.581 --> 02:56:06.390
Marine Corps.

2665
02:56:06.390 --> 02:56:07.223
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2666
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:09.260
<v 4>There's not a mortgage serving.</v>

2667
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.620
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2668
02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:12.120
<v 4>Individual I can think of.</v>

2669
02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:14.270
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2670
02:56:14.270 --> 02:56:19.080
<v 4>Cause that guy,
that guy is one of the guys I found following the blood trail</v>

2671
02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:24.540
that taught me,
if you're going to love,
do it all the way.

2672
02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:26.150
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2673
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:28.790
<v 4>Don't waste anyone's time doing the halfway thing.</v>

2674
02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:30.630
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2675
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:35.370
<v 4>That was an amazing moment that I will take to my grave.
Cherishing,</v>

2676
02:56:36.330 --> 02:56:37.163
knowing that,

2677
02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:38.870
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2678
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:42.020
<v 4>that guy just told me without telling me,</v>

2679
02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:44.510
it's okay to not be okay.

2680
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:48.463
<v 5>It's okay.</v>

2681
02:56:54.430 --> 02:56:59.430
<v 4>At what point did you realize that the drugs were a legit problem?</v>

2682
02:57:03.370 --> 02:57:06.670
The day?
How's leaving San Antonio?
The,
um,

2683
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:12.930
the commanding general,
the hospitals I ended up getting,

2684
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.770
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2685
02:57:13.770 --> 02:57:15.150
<v 4>pretty close to it.</v>

2686
02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:19.310
My time during my time there said came out and he's,

2687
02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:22.530
we're walking out or,
well,
he's walking,
I'm rolling.

2688
02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:25.330
I'm still not walking well at this point.
And he says,
uh,

2689
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:30.150
I'm going to check out over it,
four,
three con.

2690
02:57:30.151 --> 02:57:33.240
And he says,
you know,
you know,
Jake,

2691
02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:36.270
I feel like we should name a hall or something after you,

2692
02:57:36.271 --> 02:57:39.660
after all the shit you put us through.
And I was like,
Hey sir,

2693
02:57:39.661 --> 02:57:42.570
let me do the infamy thing.
I'll,
I can let you let me handle.

2694
02:57:42.571 --> 02:57:47.520
I got it all my lonesome.
I don't need your help,
you know?
And uh,

2695
02:57:48.410 --> 02:57:49.243
<v 5>okay.</v>

2696
02:57:49.270 --> 02:57:54.270
<v 4>He was like,
you know,
it's
sad to see you go,</v>

2697
02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:55.690
<v 5>okay.</v>

2698
02:57:55.690 --> 02:57:58.840
<v 4>Um,
it's,
I said,
well,
I've,
I'm,</v>

2699
02:57:58.950 --> 02:58:00.790
I'm scared to death to leave.

2700
02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:07.700
And I remember I basically got a giant bag of drugs before I went over to four.

2701
02:58:09.210 --> 02:58:13.590
Three con is the last thing I did with them was signup page 11.
And um,

2702
02:58:15.150 --> 02:58:18.960
look,
as I,
the the higher up the told me,
you know,
I'm going to be here every day.

2703
02:58:20.250 --> 02:58:21.690
I told them when I thought about that,

2704
02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:26.780
when I thought about him and so he showed me by making me sign up page 11 and I

2705
02:58:27.421 --> 02:58:31.830
was like,
put it on my tab,
Bro.
What's the page 11 slap on the wrist?
Pretty much,

2706
02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:36.050
but you can't be promoted for,
I think it's 12 months with a page 11.

2707
02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:39.150
And so I was just like,

2708
02:58:39.930 --> 02:58:44.760
he was in DC at the time when I checked out and the gunny there was like,

2709
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:46.560
you know,
hey,
he said he wanted to talk to you.
And I was like,

2710
02:58:46.561 --> 02:58:49.830
get him on speaker phone was talk.
And I said,

2711
02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:53.970
I told them when I thought about him,
it was inappropriate and I'm not sorry.

2712
02:58:54.870 --> 02:58:58.470
Um,
but then he's like,
give him a page 11 and gun.
He was like,

2713
02:58:58.990 --> 02:59:02.250
do you want to contest this?
Was like,
Hey,
I'll know.
Put it on my tab bro.

2714
02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:07.530
On my way out.
And um,
man,

2715
02:59:07.531 --> 02:59:10.570
I had this bag of drugs and my brother met up there with me and my brother's

2716
02:59:10.590 --> 02:59:12.870
going to drive me to Florida.

2717
02:59:12.880 --> 02:59:17.040
World's going to check in with Matt Sick 21.

2718
02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:23.010
And I knew right then because I was like,
okay,

2719
02:59:23.070 --> 02:59:25.700
at this point I had already started.
Like if I was eating one fence,

2720
02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:27.610
if I had a family member or friend,

2721
02:59:27.630 --> 02:59:31.220
give me a fentanyl pop out of my bag of goodies,
like I would chew,

2722
02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:32.430
I bite it off this thick,

2723
02:59:32.431 --> 02:59:35.730
trued up and swallow it and just lay on the stick and I be like,
Hey,

2724
02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:39.360
who's going to grab me a fentanyl?
[inaudible] they'd be like,
Jake,

2725
02:59:39.361 --> 02:59:42.690
we just gave him,
no you didn't.
You thought you did.
But she didn't.

2726
02:59:44.700 --> 02:59:48.780
I knew like,
because I was like,
hey,
listen,
if I just can't feel,

2727
02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:54.360
nothing matters
if I'm completely numb,
nothing matters.

2728
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:59.880
And then when they gave me that giant bag,
I was like,
ah,
Shit.

2729
03:00:00.600 --> 03:00:05.260
I knew how it was going to end.
I was like,
yeah,
well this,

2730
03:00:05.390 --> 03:00:08.820
that this is a,
I don't remember,
they told me like a three months supply.

2731
03:00:08.821 --> 03:00:13.260
And I was like,
no,
this is like a three weeks,
blah.
And um,

2732
03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:15.300
man,
I started,

2733
03:00:16.290 --> 03:00:21.290
that's how I integrated back into civilian society was high as a kite,

2734
03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:28.440
knowing that if I don't have to feel,
and I can do,

2735
03:00:28.441 --> 03:00:32.820
go through this thing numb,
nothing matters because if you can't fill it,

2736
03:00:33.450 --> 03:00:36.090
who cares?
You know?
I mean,
who cares?

2737
03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:41.820
And it was something that really was,
um,
it just got worse and worse.

2738
03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:45.900
I mean,
essentially what I did for a year and a half was chased my first high.

2739
03:00:47.290 --> 03:00:50.940
So what I did,
and I was finally

2740
03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:53.670
for about a year there,

2741
03:00:55.410 --> 03:00:58.590
I slept with a an over and under 12 gauge shotgun.

2742
03:00:58.591 --> 03:01:00.520
It was condition next to my bed
every night.

2743
03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:06.180
And every day I talked myself out of utilizing it that in my own life too,

2744
03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:14.173
to where I,

2745
03:01:15.610 --> 03:01:20.610
I was almost to the point where I had decided why it was okay to do it and I had

2746
03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:27.430
justified it in my head and why it would be better

2747
03:01:29.980 --> 03:01:32.830
for everyone in my life

2748
03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:36.220
and around my circle if I was gone.

2749
03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:43.430
And so I,
but then I was told by family that,

2750
03:01:45.090 --> 03:01:47.800
you know,
Jake,
the differences between,
at this point,

2751
03:01:47.801 --> 03:01:51.610
I'm taking about 55 pills three times a day and I was eating between eight and

2752
03:01:51.611 --> 03:01:53.590
12 400 milligram fennel pops a day.

2753
03:01:53.950 --> 03:01:58.450
I was on enough medications to kill a village in Africa.
It was gnarly.

2754
03:01:58.630 --> 03:02:02.950
And the fact that I'm never roadied and I mean there's no medical explanation

2755
03:02:02.951 --> 03:02:06.970
for that.
And so where were all the drugs coming from?

2756
03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:12.700
It's easy.
You get them,
make a phone call and get them home.
Yeah.
And so it was,

2757
03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:17.730
that was the least of my worries on how to get the drugs cause,
but,

2758
03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:21.670
and to be fair,
because I was on so much as I came out of the hospital,

2759
03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:26.860
it took a lot to keep me where I was.
I mean,
if I,

2760
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:31.390
if I'm even 10 minutes late,
10 minutes late on one dose,

2761
03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:35.680
I'm starting to withdraw.
I mean it was bad.

2762
03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.700
And so finally I pray,
I get told,
you know,

2763
03:02:39.701 --> 03:02:41.920
the difference between you living the way you're living

2764
03:02:43.570 --> 03:02:47.710
and eating a bullet is his time.
But the outcome's the same.

2765
03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:49.870
You're just slowly killing yourself.

2766
03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:52.960
You owe it to your brothers didn't come home.

2767
03:02:52.961 --> 03:02:57.010
And those that didn't still love and respect you to not only live but live well

2768
03:02:57.230 --> 03:03:01.300
because that's the only way you can truly honor them is by living well.

2769
03:03:03.490 --> 03:03:08.320
I mean that hit me hard and I realized I'm being a selfish bastard.

2770
03:03:08.770 --> 03:03:11.750
So what I'm,
what I'm doing,
um,

2771
03:03:12.310 --> 03:03:17.310
I'm carrying out every day like a victim and I'm not a victim.

2772
03:03:17.471 --> 03:03:20.380
I'm a victor.
I need to start acting like it.

2773
03:03:21.310 --> 03:03:24.070
And so I called my lead physician the next morning.
I said,

2774
03:03:24.090 --> 03:03:27.040
good news.com getting off all the drugs.
She said,
how are you going to do that?

2775
03:03:27.890 --> 03:03:32.320
So I'm just not taking the first dose,
just stop.
And she said,

2776
03:03:32.321 --> 03:03:35.870
I'd highly advise against that.
So why is that so?

2777
03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:39.760
Cause you'll probably have a massive heart attack and die.
I said,
Roger,

2778
03:03:39.761 --> 03:03:43.900
that planet is and no go.
What's Plan B look like?
And she was like,

2779
03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:46.540
you're going to have to come back to Betsy and we're going to have to wean you

2780
03:03:46.541 --> 03:03:47.374
off the drugs,

2781
03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:52.180
which is not what I wanted to hear because it was like when I left MCRD San

2782
03:03:52.181 --> 03:03:53.350
Diego,
I was like,

2783
03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:58.820
no need to ever come back here done d u n done.

2784
03:03:59.870 --> 03:04:04.760
And I was like,
Gosh,
all right.
And I went back there and started that process,

2785
03:04:04.761 --> 03:04:08.930
man.
And let me tell you something I consider until you with conviction.

2786
03:04:08.931 --> 03:04:10.400
I know why addicts,
they addicts

2787
03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:17.080
because that slow withdrawal process of getting clean.

2788
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:22.310
I mean this wholeheartedly.

2789
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:28.150
I don't know what was harder being blown up or getting clean.

2790
03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:35.660
I honestly don't know what was harder because I mean hell,
come on off the drugs.

2791
03:04:35.661 --> 03:04:39.020
They gave you drugs to help you come off the drugs and it's like

2792
03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:45.070
I just,
you know what the frick in there,

2793
03:04:45.071 --> 03:04:48.260
a shot or something you can give me and I can get the hell Outta here,
here and,

2794
03:04:48.680 --> 03:04:52.190
but there's not,
how long was the process?
Supposed to be?
Six months.

2795
03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:58.820
So I did two and a half.
I was clean because I was like,

2796
03:04:58.821 --> 03:04:59.241
I'm not,

2797
03:04:59.241 --> 03:05:04.040
I can't continue to be the sick that hardcore about face though.

2798
03:05:04.100 --> 03:05:06.560
I mean that,
that comment about,
look,

2799
03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:09.410
which I've said on this podcast many times like,
look,

2800
03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:14.870
we got to live to honor our brothers that didn't come home.
That's the way it is.

2801
03:05:14.910 --> 03:05:18.410
Live.
Well,
and yet you've got to live the best possible life you can.

2802
03:05:18.890 --> 03:05:20.210
They don't have that opportunity.

2803
03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:24.950
That thought right there is what did it?

2804
03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:31.940
Um,
no,
because again,

2805
03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.430
it was a myriad of things man.
Cause again,
you,

2806
03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:38.990
that was the,
the tipping point.
But again,

2807
03:05:38.991 --> 03:05:40.570
it's like the people that come over and he's saying,

2808
03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:43.940
you know what the problem is?
Yeah.
It's like,
Hey,
I bet you there's more than one.

2809
03:05:44.780 --> 03:05:45.920
So that tipping point,

2810
03:05:45.921 --> 03:05:49.250
what are some other contributing factors and the reason I'm asking you this,

2811
03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:52.430
so people are listening this right now and they're feeling the way you were

2812
03:05:52.431 --> 03:05:55.570
feeling.
Yup.
I got a phone call about the our,

2813
03:05:55.571 --> 03:05:59.600
our first loss from our unit by his own hand

2814
03:06:02.660 --> 03:06:03.590
and I was like,

2815
03:06:06.050 --> 03:06:08.990
that's done more than I thought that would sting

2816
03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:15.450
and I can't do that to the tribe.
On top of that,
there's,
I can't,

2817
03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:21.370
I need to get my shit together and it's going to be ugly and it's going to be

2818
03:06:21.371 --> 03:06:24.730
sloppy and it's not going to be,

2819
03:06:26.110 --> 03:06:30.550
it's going to be the antithesis of what it should look like,

2820
03:06:31.810 --> 03:06:33.730
but I owe that to them.

2821
03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:37.930
I owe that to him.

2822
03:06:40.780 --> 03:06:45.070
That is when I decided that,
you know what,
I'm going to,

2823
03:06:46.930 --> 03:06:50.320
I'm going to try really hard

2824
03:06:51.970 --> 03:06:56.210
to do this life thing
the way that

2825
03:06:56.480 --> 03:06:57.770
<v 1>I'm supposed to do it.</v>

2826
03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:01.180
<v 4>I mean,
I'm going to go out of my way,</v>

2827
03:07:03.520 --> 03:07:04.270
<v 1>okay.</v>

2828
03:07:04.270 --> 03:07:08.940
<v 4>To be
to where when my brother's here,
my name,</v>

2829
03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:14.400
they can smile on their chest,
can swell with pride and they can say,
yeah,

2830
03:07:15.240 --> 03:07:16.080
that's my brother.

2831
03:07:17.340 --> 03:07:17.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2832
03:07:17.930 --> 03:07:18.763
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2833
03:07:19.850 --> 03:07:23.060
that right there is that thing that I was talking about earlier.

2834
03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:27.290
Right now I don't care what anybody thinks when it comes to my brothers and what

2835
03:07:27.291 --> 03:07:31.770
they think.
Yeah.
That means a lot man.
Yeah.
That's curious shit done awake.

2836
03:07:32.790 --> 03:07:36.600
<v 4>Yeah,
that's,
that's the stuff.
It's the stuff that will change the world.</v>

2837
03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:39.633
<v 0>So you,</v>

2838
03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:45.100
so you go through the two and a half months and you get clean.

2839
03:07:46.840 --> 03:07:50.560
What's the temptation like once your queen are you,
are you feeling like,

2840
03:07:50.980 --> 03:07:52.540
I mean is it always there?
What is it

2841
03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:57.550
<v 4>for awhile bro?
For Awhile it's all day.</v>

2842
03:07:58.030 --> 03:07:58.863
Every day.

2843
03:07:59.410 --> 03:08:04.410
Every time I leave my room or I have to talk to someone rather than I'm related

2844
03:08:04.691 --> 03:08:08.140
to him or not,
or God forbid I have to go to like the mall or some shit.

2845
03:08:09.250 --> 03:08:12.820
All I thought about for a while was,
man,

2846
03:08:12.821 --> 03:08:17.430
this would be so much easier if files are right now
all the time.

2847
03:08:17.490 --> 03:08:22.200
So I thought about for a while.
What about booze?
Yeah.
Right.

2848
03:08:22.201 --> 03:08:27.150
So that's an easy,
uh,
that's a,
that's a pretty,
that's a pretty

2849
03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:30.190
<v 1>okay.</v>

2850
03:08:30.190 --> 03:08:31.450
<v 4>Pretty good safety net in it.</v>

2851
03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:36.700
Go from one bad habit to another.
And you know,

2852
03:08:36.701 --> 03:08:41.140
my family doesn't need help in that arena either.
And so yeah,
I was like,

2853
03:08:41.470 --> 03:08:46.220
hey listen,
you know what I mean,
I'm not on enough drugs to kill her,

2854
03:08:46.221 --> 03:08:50.530
her elephants anymore so I can,
I could probably just start drinking now.

2855
03:08:53.660 --> 03:08:54.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2856
03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:59.260
<v 4>So little did I realize how awesome food was when I got off all the drugs and I</v>

2857
03:08:59.261 --> 03:09:03.580
was like,
oh my God,
food is amazing.
And I love it cause I was a Macy's.

2858
03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:06.940
Did anybody,
when I went to Iraq I easily weight,

2859
03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.580
I was probably like 222 pounds solid.
Awesome.

2860
03:09:09.581 --> 03:09:14.510
Some of the best shape of all zipper into my life.
I love Banksy.

2861
03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:16.770
I think I weighed 162

2862
03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:22.230
and then cause all I did was no shit.
It was drink,

2863
03:09:22.231 --> 03:09:23.460
Gatorade and cappuccinos.

2864
03:09:23.730 --> 03:09:28.260
I didn't eat ever because you feel like you're starving.
I like really hungry.

2865
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:33.420
That's why there's the saying good luck.
You'll never meet a fat drug addict.

2866
03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:38.040
It's true because you,
your mind is going to tell you like,
oh my God,

2867
03:09:38.041 --> 03:09:38.874
I'm starving.

2868
03:09:39.010 --> 03:09:42.360
Then you eat one bite of something and it's like you ate an entire cow by

2869
03:09:42.361 --> 03:09:45.220
herself and it just full.

2870
03:09:45.330 --> 03:09:48.540
And then so I immediately,

2871
03:09:48.580 --> 03:09:50.460
because we need to remember too,

2872
03:09:51.540 --> 03:09:55.480
they're a yet,
uh,
forms of self medicating,

2873
03:09:56.980 --> 03:10:01.780
not just drugs and alcohol.
I mean,
it can go on and on and on.

2874
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:03.430
Well,

2875
03:10:03.430 --> 03:10:07.450
that's something we need to remember because there's gonna be some people out

2876
03:10:07.451 --> 03:10:09.850
there that hear this and they're like,
oh,
well,
you know,

2877
03:10:10.610 --> 03:10:15.420
I don't drink excessively or I'm not on drugs.
Well,

2878
03:10:15.421 --> 03:10:18.480
there's a lot of other happy news.
What else?

2879
03:10:20.100 --> 03:10:21.400
Food.
Oh God.

2880
03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:26.400
I mean,
porn,

2881
03:10:29.530 --> 03:10:34.000
let me exercise.
I mean,
there's a million things that you could do and access

2882
03:10:36.140 --> 03:10:39.410
that you think is going to save you from your own head.

2883
03:10:40.740 --> 03:10:41.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2884
03:10:41.370 --> 03:10:42.750
<v 4>Yeah.
It's like an escape,
right?</v>

2885
03:10:42.751 --> 03:10:47.751
Like an escape and it brings like that pleasure for that exact kind of thing.

2886
03:10:48.030 --> 03:10:52.950
Yeah.
You get the same,
you get the same endorphins released the same,

2887
03:10:53.730 --> 03:10:58.140
that same dopamine and get that same feeling of all this.
Okay.

2888
03:10:58.141 --> 03:11:02.370
This horizon,
because in all it is all it is

2889
03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:07.860
is a protection mechanism to keep you from having

2890
03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:13.470
to look inward and go deep into the thing underneath the thing,

2891
03:11:13.471 --> 03:11:17.160
underneath the thing.
It's all it is.
That's all it is.

2892
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:22.560
And it's easy.
It's very,
very easy to do.
I mean,

2893
03:11:22.561 --> 03:11:26.010
because just being humans alone,
we were all addictive by nature.

2894
03:11:26.130 --> 03:11:27.000
I mean we were all,

2895
03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:32.300
we get to whatever it could be and so we have to be cognizant of the fact that,

2896
03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:36.493
you know,
there's,

2897
03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:41.640
we have to consistently remember that

2898
03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:48.830
we are all
always going to be human,

2899
03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:53.130
are always going to be uncomfortable with change.
Most,

2900
03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:55.530
most people like regimented schedules.

2901
03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:58.120
They'd like to get up a certain time and like the drink certain thing,

2902
03:11:58.150 --> 03:12:01.650
eat a certain thing,
work out a certain time,
go to lunch at a certain time.

2903
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:07.360
By nature,
all of us hate change.
Anyone who's in a boat,

2904
03:12:07.440 --> 03:12:10.160
in a company that goes through a big transition or a big change,

2905
03:12:10.830 --> 03:12:12.180
you know what I'm talking about.

2906
03:12:14.390 --> 03:12:18.320
But we always have to remember that
just like in the marines,

2907
03:12:18.321 --> 03:12:19.610
we always say semper gumby.

2908
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:26.470
The more comfortable you get being uncomfortable,

2909
03:12:27.550 --> 03:12:28.720
the happier you're going to be.

2910
03:12:31.430 --> 03:12:31.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2911
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:36.650
<v 4>So at what point in this,
uh,
you get clean,</v>

2912
03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:38.780
what point do you decide

2913
03:12:40.370 --> 03:12:43.790
you're going to do something significant to try and help other people?

2914
03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:47.900
And you start,
yeah.
Currently to kill.
Great question.
Well,

2915
03:12:47.901 --> 03:12:50.930
I didn't decide it.
It was my grandmother told me,
Hey,

2916
03:12:50.931 --> 03:12:52.910
I you to come speak to my rotary club.

2917
03:12:54.270 --> 03:12:56.330
And you know,

2918
03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:01.130
being a man from the south,
you don't tell your grandmother now.

2919
03:13:02.180 --> 03:13:06.710
So I was like,
okay,
I'm going to reluctantly do this and hate it the entire time.

2920
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:07.783
And I did.

2921
03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:12.200
And I showed up and I was easily 40 years by at least 40 years,

2922
03:13:12.201 --> 03:13:13.490
the junior in the room.

2923
03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:20.260
So I started telling my story and I'm sweating grenades so uncomfortable.

2924
03:13:21.261 --> 03:13:22.550
All I could think about was like,

2925
03:13:22.580 --> 03:13:25.910
I would love to just crush like 10 fentanyl pops right now.

2926
03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:30.770
And,
uh,
it was,
it was horrific.

2927
03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.640
I mean it was a freight train screwing on abortion.
It was bad,

2928
03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:39.950
but so it was one of those things that like,
but you can't look away type thing.

2929
03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:41.413
It was one of those,

2930
03:13:42.140 --> 03:13:44.600
but I remember walking out of there and I walked out of the building,

2931
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:50.120
I'll never forgive the side of the building and I took a deep breath like,
okay,

2932
03:13:50.890 --> 03:13:55.880
I mean you made it.
And then when I took that deep breath,
I was like,

2933
03:13:55.881 --> 03:13:58.640
Huh,
I feel lighter.

2934
03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:03.350
You're not physically there.
My soul felt lighter.

2935
03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:07.400
And I was like,
oh.
Then it clicked.

2936
03:14:08.660 --> 03:14:13.310
That's what she was doing.
It's tactical therapy.

2937
03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:18.170
I get it.
That fricking broad.

2938
03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:22.730
She got mad because I was,
I was,
I refuse to talk to,

2939
03:14:23.420 --> 03:14:28.340
I talked to a psychiatrist once when I got to the hospital and then when I left

2940
03:14:29.580 --> 03:14:33.320
then when I was getting out of the Marine Corps for the VA process and that was

2941
03:14:34.350 --> 03:14:39.350
since two or three times because I had nothing to say to them because that pts

2942
03:14:39.411 --> 03:14:43.430
and Tbi thing,
it's not whatever,
it's not a real thing.

2943
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:48.950
When I got clean
and started to drink and

2944
03:14:50.660 --> 03:14:55.380
I was like,
Oh shit,
this pts and Tbi I think are very,
very rural,

2945
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:59.390
like very real.
And um,

2946
03:15:01.260 --> 03:15:05.320
uh,
move,
came back,
went back taxes and I was introduced to

2947
03:15:07.870 --> 03:15:10.430
a couple of guys who started a foundation down there

2948
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:15.140
and they were a couple of sills are to this day,

2949
03:15:15.141 --> 03:15:19.160
great friends of mine and mentors of mine,
brothers for sure.

2950
03:15:19.850 --> 03:15:24.800
And uh,
I call him flip her one and flip her to,
and uh,

2951
03:15:26.420 --> 03:15:31.130
that's when I was kind of introduced to the nonprofit world and working with

2952
03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:37.480
warriors and their families and first responders and law enforcement officers

2953
03:15:37.941 --> 03:15:41.000
and their families.
And you know,
it was like,

2954
03:15:42.050 --> 03:15:46.220
it clicked with me like,
like I,
I like this,

2955
03:15:47.870 --> 03:15:51.000
I'm never going to get rich wealthy doing this.
And that's not the point.

2956
03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:54.930
It was,
that gave me more,

2957
03:15:56.850 --> 03:16:01.850
that put more of my soul tank than any pill or any bottle ever did.

2958
03:16:04.410 --> 03:16:06.660
Then it made me realize like,
oh,
all right,

2959
03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:12.570
this is the same reason I went and visited all the wounded
every time I could.

2960
03:16:12.600 --> 03:16:17.570
Even when we lost guys in the hospital,
like,
this is why I'm doing this,
this,

2961
03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:18.660
it's greater than me.

2962
03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:24.500
They're reminds me daily how insignificant I am.

2963
03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:27.960
I'm just another guy

2964
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:33.670
that just choosing to do stuff that's out out of the norm.

2965
03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:39.760
It's hard stuff.
We had anything that doing should be,
it shouldn't be hard.

2966
03:16:40.220 --> 03:16:44.350
It's not worth doing alone.
And when I was working with this organization,

2967
03:16:44.351 --> 03:16:46.930
I was surrounded by people better than me.

2968
03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:49.960
By default I was better

2969
03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:54.740
and consistently pushed harder and harder because

2970
03:16:56.630 --> 03:17:00.710
I wanted to be held to a different standards again.

2971
03:17:00.711 --> 03:17:02.330
Because even then I wasn't waking up like,

2972
03:17:02.331 --> 03:17:05.690
I'm going to go out of my way to be average today.
No,

2973
03:17:05.691 --> 03:17:09.080
because I had to fricking navy seals that,

2974
03:17:10.290 --> 03:17:11.390
you know,
we're worried.

2975
03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:16.370
They had that really good tans and their hair had to be great and they had to

2976
03:17:16.371 --> 03:17:21.170
have this one type of really cool sunglasses and I was like,

2977
03:17:21.171 --> 03:17:25.940
Hey,
what I'm going to do is just,
I'm just going to out work these dudes.

2978
03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:30.500
Yeah,
I can't use a weapon anymore.
I'm not going to outrun them.

2979
03:17:30.860 --> 03:17:32.680
God knows I'm not going.
I'll swim,
im

2980
03:17:34.560 --> 03:17:38.420
a PRI can out shoot him.
My body's completely dicked up.
But

2981
03:17:40.130 --> 03:17:43.050
I could probably hone,

2982
03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:48.290
I could probably work with the most important tool.
We all have,

2983
03:17:49.430 --> 03:17:53.450
most important weapon we all have.
I could probably get to where I could,

2984
03:17:53.451 --> 03:17:58.130
I'll thank them.
So I started,
uh,

2985
03:17:58.820 --> 03:18:03.350
to this day it's,
it's a toss up but well with one of them,

2986
03:18:03.410 --> 03:18:07.220
one of them,
I pass them a long time ago,
but uh,

2987
03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:11.000
they know who they are too.
That's what makes it even even more beautiful.

2988
03:18:11.720 --> 03:18:14.480
But that's when I realized like,
all right,
I need to be,

2989
03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:20.150
this is what I gotta do.
This is,
this is what I'm going to be called to do

2990
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:26.950
is to talk to other members of society who have been dealt whatever hand or been

2991
03:18:29.901 --> 03:18:34.370
dealt a blow to let them know like,
Hey,
yeah,

2992
03:18:34.371 --> 03:18:37.580
right now it's sucks,
but she can come out the other side

2993
03:18:39.460 --> 03:18:43.890
cause don't get in that deep dark rabbit hole.
Don't do that.

2994
03:18:44.670 --> 03:18:46.290
Because very few people come out of that.

2995
03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:52.210
I know because I tried it over and over again and I never got out of it on my

2996
03:18:52.211 --> 03:18:54.130
own.
Always took help.

2997
03:18:55.330 --> 03:18:58.450
And so at the time in 2012,

2998
03:18:58.451 --> 03:19:03.190
that's when the study came out from the VA
on average.

2999
03:19:03.191 --> 03:19:07.270
22 veterans a day die by suicide.
And so

3000
03:19:08.770 --> 03:19:12.300
another marine and um,
couple marines,

3001
03:19:12.301 --> 03:19:17.200
a business guy got together in Dallas and they're like,

3002
03:19:17.201 --> 03:19:20.800
hey man,
we got to do something.
This is,
you know,
this is,

3003
03:19:21.850 --> 03:19:25.930
this is our family.
Cool.
No one even knows this is a thing.

3004
03:19:26.140 --> 03:19:29.710
What the hell are we doing?
And um,

3005
03:19:29.780 --> 03:19:32.260
it's the time I'm working at a,
at a place

3006
03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:38.110
that focuses completely on the brain.
I mean,
I'm surrounded by

3007
03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:43.150
neuroscientists,
PhDs,
MDS,

3008
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:47.350
and I'm learning a lot of things that

3009
03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:53.110
just reiterated the fact that posttraumatic stress rag,
brain injury,

3010
03:19:53.111 --> 03:19:54.820
these are very,
very rural things.

3011
03:19:56.050 --> 03:20:00.010
And I worked there for three years while 22 kill started.

3012
03:20:00.100 --> 03:20:03.640
And it basically started as an awareness movement and that's where the,

3013
03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:05.260
the pushup challenge was born.

3014
03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:10.390
The 22 pushup challenge that was started by 22 killed in 2012.

3015
03:20:10.980 --> 03:20:13.480
Just for those listeners that went viral in 2016

3016
03:20:15.130 --> 03:20:18.760
so you know,
overnight success is not a real thing.

3017
03:20:20.380 --> 03:20:21.213
And so I,

3018
03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:26.460
I'm working at this center the whole time and then there's some change up in

3019
03:20:27.101 --> 03:20:28.390
leadership at 22 kill.

3020
03:20:28.391 --> 03:20:33.340
And I kind of found myself drifting away from the work I was doing at the center

3021
03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:35.590
because it just wasn't,

3022
03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:41.680
it wasn't getting to the part of the soul that I wanted to be in and it wasn't

3023
03:20:41.681 --> 03:20:45.210
getting to that like people I've been asked,
you know,

3024
03:20:45.220 --> 03:20:48.430
how long are you going to speak because you give the travel schedule,

3025
03:20:48.431 --> 03:20:53.140
you knows it's brutal.
Right?
And I,
I thought about it for a nanosecond.

3026
03:20:53.141 --> 03:20:57.430
I thought,
okay,
well
when I walk off the stage,

3027
03:20:58.420 --> 03:21:01.660
the first time I walk off the stage and I feel like I didn't leave a piece of my

3028
03:21:01.661 --> 03:21:04.210
solar.
That's the last time I'll do it

3029
03:21:06.520 --> 03:21:11.020
because again,
it's mutually beneficial.
And if it's not,

3030
03:21:11.170 --> 03:21:13.360
then you're a presenter.

3031
03:21:14.720 --> 03:21:18.640
You're only going to fake it for so long.
People don't really,

3032
03:21:18.660 --> 03:21:22.270
that's why I feel like I ran a marathon when I'm done presenting for an hour,

3033
03:21:22.630 --> 03:21:25.570
I'm mentally,
physically and emotionally exhausted.

3034
03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:32.140
And if you're not,
you're faking it.
And so that's when I,

3035
03:21:33.580 --> 03:21:34.331
I left there and,

3036
03:21:34.331 --> 03:21:37.260
and you know what I learned after three years of working at that place that's

3037
03:21:37.270 --> 03:21:41.950
completely centered around the brain and the mind.
And it's unfortunate,

3038
03:21:41.951 --> 03:21:46.250
but essentially I learned after three years at that place,

3039
03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:47.720
so we don't know shit about the brain.

3040
03:21:48.900 --> 03:21:49.733
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

3041
03:21:50.820 --> 03:21:54.160
<v 4>I mean again,
I mean I,
I,</v>

3042
03:21:55.050 --> 03:21:57.510
I'm not going to candy coat it.
It just is what it is.

3043
03:21:59.130 --> 03:22:03.690
Why do you think we're still still spending billions and billions of dollars on

3044
03:22:03.691 --> 03:22:06.390
all this research and all these studies and trying to figure it out?

3045
03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:11.010
Cause we just don't understand it.
That's why we,
you know,
we,

3046
03:22:11.100 --> 03:22:13.800
you talked about Alzheimer's and Cte,

3047
03:22:14.370 --> 03:22:18.390
we don't even have the technology and the imaging to recognize these things in a

3048
03:22:18.391 --> 03:22:23.300
living human.
We put a man on the moon in 1969

3049
03:22:26.010 --> 03:22:29.490
can't tell you if you have CT while you're alive.

3050
03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:34.380
For me.
It's like,
Hey,
let's step back and look at our priorities.

3051
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:40.380
Because one thing everyone's got isn't brain
everyone.

3052
03:22:42.540 --> 03:22:46.230
And the problem with the brain,
there's no prosthetic for that.

3053
03:22:48.020 --> 03:22:49.500
You get the one you got and that's it.

3054
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:55.910
Why are we not hyperfocused on honing this weapon that makes us who we are?

3055
03:22:58.770 --> 03:23:02.040
And so the 22 guild approached me and said,
hey,

3056
03:23:02.041 --> 03:23:04.320
we would love for you to come run 22 kill.

3057
03:23:05.700 --> 03:23:08.250
We can keep the lights on for about another month and a half.

3058
03:23:09.570 --> 03:23:09.880
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

3059
03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:14.290
<v 4>and you don't get health insurance and you're going to have to take Pika.</v>

3060
03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:18.490
And I was like,
let me think about it.
Apps a freaking lutely.
Yes,

3061
03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:23.020
because I want to be able to talk

3062
03:23:24.610 --> 03:23:29.610
and share what I've been through with warriors at first responders and law

3063
03:23:30.791 --> 03:23:33.580
enforcement officers and their families and say,
hey listen,

3064
03:23:35.380 --> 03:23:40.120
you see that scar?
Like that one's worth it.
This one over here.

3065
03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:42.100
Don't do that.
That one's not worth it.

3066
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:46.480
You're going to have to fight these demons.
There's no way around it,

3067
03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:48.513
but you can win.

3068
03:23:50.020 --> 03:23:53.080
You just have to keep fighting because no matter what,

3069
03:23:53.081 --> 03:23:56.860
no matter where you find yourself in life,
you're going to have to fight.

3070
03:23:57.910 --> 03:24:00.070
Cause none of us are getting up and picking out our Unicorn.

3071
03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:03.193
<v 5>We're just not.</v>

3072
03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:07.540
<v 4>Yeah,
you wake up every day and it's you versus you.</v>

3073
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:12.460
And so that's why I was drawn to that.

3074
03:24:12.490 --> 03:24:17.490
And we had a really big first couple of years I was there

3075
03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:24.310
and not all cousin is gay.
Had to do with a myriad of the people,

3076
03:24:24.311 --> 03:24:25.450
the people that support us.

3077
03:24:25.451 --> 03:24:29.680
The people that say one of my biggest regrets was never sure of it.
And I'm like,

3078
03:24:29.681 --> 03:24:30.430
Hey,

3079
03:24:30.430 --> 03:24:35.260
who told you who lied to you and said that you have to wear a uniform to be a

3080
03:24:35.261 --> 03:24:36.220
service to your nation?

3081
03:24:38.450 --> 03:24:39.283
<v 5>Cause you don't.</v>

3082
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:43.310
<v 4>You don't.
That's a,
that's a misnomer.</v>

3083
03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:48.610
I don't wear a uniform anymore and neither do you.
Neither do you.

3084
03:24:49.800 --> 03:24:51.090
Doesn't mean we're not serving.

3085
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:55.530
I don't do what I do because it's easy.

3086
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:59.390
I do it because it's hard.

3087
03:25:01.220 --> 03:25:05.450
The employees that worked for 26 you'll do it because it's hard.

3088
03:25:08.060 --> 03:25:10.790
And then the face of tremendous loss they fight on.

3089
03:25:13.470 --> 03:25:14.370
That's character

3090
03:25:16.950 --> 03:25:20.470
they're doing their dash justice does.

3091
03:25:20.471 --> 03:25:23.700
They're moving a mountain that our own government looks at and says,
Hey,

3092
03:25:24.180 --> 03:25:27.300
pick up the corner of that rug and start sweeping and look the other way.

3093
03:25:28.410 --> 03:25:32.430
And maybe it'll go away.
It's not going away.

3094
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:41.550
What can people that are listening do to help the cause?

3095
03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:45.580
You know,

3096
03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:50.380
I got this from a buddy of mine who was actually an officer officer in the army

3097
03:25:52.210 --> 03:25:56.670
who was severely wounded,
um,
years ago and,

3098
03:25:57.970 --> 03:25:58.803
and he's,
he,

3099
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:03.520
I'm going to echo it just cause he's right.
It's,

3100
03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:10.590
you hear all the time like I want to help.
Oh No.
Right.

3101
03:26:10.690 --> 03:26:14.710
I mean,
you hear it a lot from rather it's,
you know,
I want to,

3102
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:17.860
I want to help save the puppies that don't have a home.

3103
03:26:18.470 --> 03:26:19.690
I tell people all the time,

3104
03:26:19.691 --> 03:26:23.830
if we were trying to raise money for dogs that died by suicide,

3105
03:26:23.831 --> 03:26:28.060
we'd be sitting on $1 billion.
That's true.
I mean,
it's just true.

3106
03:26:28.780 --> 03:26:30.760
I mean,
how many dogs are screwed over a person?

3107
03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:33.953
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3108
03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:37.730
<v 4>very few.
Right?
Well,
it is what it is.</v>

3109
03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:44.440
But if you want to wake up and you want to serve or you want to help,

3110
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:48.620
we all have three things of value.

3111
03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:53.680
Every human on this entire spinning ball of shit as three things about you,

3112
03:26:55.820 --> 03:26:57.890
time,
talent,
and treasure.

3113
03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:02.780
And if you're not willing to sacrifice some of one of those three things,

3114
03:27:03.530 --> 03:27:08.340
you're just talking.
That's it.
You're talking.

3115
03:27:09.270 --> 03:27:12.960
If you want to help start sacrificing one of those three things.

3116
03:27:14.190 --> 03:27:15.720
I don't care if it's 22 kill,

3117
03:27:15.810 --> 03:27:20.070
I don't care if it's to the humane society.

3118
03:27:20.100 --> 03:27:22.800
I don't care.
Sacrifice

3119
03:27:24.810 --> 03:27:29.810
because every time we put on that uniform and our firefighters and our

3120
03:27:31.411 --> 03:27:34.380
paramedics and our EMT and our law enforcement officers,

3121
03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:39.660
let me tell me if you would feel as confident as you did going to a foreign

3122
03:27:39.661 --> 03:27:44.530
country,
going to Hook and Jab.
I find the bad guys and kill him.

3123
03:27:45.580 --> 03:27:48.970
Tell me if you would have felt as confident doing that.
Knowing

3124
03:27:50.220 --> 03:27:50.660
<v 5>okay.</v>

3125
03:27:50.660 --> 03:27:54.350
<v 4>That there are people back here whom you've never met,</v>

3126
03:27:55.310 --> 03:27:59.240
willing to kick in the door to your house while it is a blaze and save your

3127
03:27:59.241 --> 03:28:00.074
family.

3128
03:28:03.760 --> 03:28:06.520
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean,
I,
I think all those people,</v>

3129
03:28:06.521 --> 03:28:08.490
every single time I do this podcast and that,

3130
03:28:08.491 --> 03:28:12.340
that's exactly what I say for taking care of our home while we were gone.

3131
03:28:12.460 --> 03:28:14.980
That's it.
That's,
that's absolutely,

3132
03:28:15.090 --> 03:28:19.710
<v 4>and so for,
that's,
that's why it's for me.</v>

3133
03:28:19.711 --> 03:28:24.360
If you're not willing to sacrifice just like these men and women do on a daily

3134
03:28:24.361 --> 03:28:28.230
basis,
you're talking,
you're talking,

3135
03:28:28.770 --> 03:28:32.490
if there's people out there that can write a check and that's enough and that's

3136
03:28:32.491 --> 03:28:36.180
okay.
That's okay.
You're doing your part,

3137
03:28:37.290 --> 03:28:39.960
you're doing your part.
That's all right.

3138
03:28:40.290 --> 03:28:43.620
There are people that want to share talents.
There are people that say,
Hey,

3139
03:28:43.621 --> 03:28:46.500
I want to volunteer.
I'm a body.
Use me.
I'm here.

3140
03:28:48.450 --> 03:28:49.650
That's service.

3141
03:28:49.651 --> 03:28:54.150
That's sacrificing and we have a myriad of ways to do it.

3142
03:28:54.210 --> 03:28:59.070
And it's a beautiful thing because we're getting better and better at what we're

3143
03:28:59.071 --> 03:29:02.790
doing because we're not doing research and studies.

3144
03:29:03.330 --> 03:29:05.070
We're implementing the things that work

3145
03:29:06.750 --> 03:29:11.360
and we're able to tell these men and women because it's an notorious in,

3146
03:29:11.361 --> 03:29:14.940
in the warrior community.
And you're going to know,
right when I said,

3147
03:29:15.870 --> 03:29:18.300
when you see your brother,
you know,
like,
hey bro,
you good?

3148
03:29:20.310 --> 03:29:24.930
How are you?
I'm good.
Okay,

3149
03:29:25.740 --> 03:29:26.820
how do we get you great?

3150
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:31.910
Cause I want you great

3151
03:29:34.520 --> 03:29:38.630
because greatness but gets greatness.
That's,

3152
03:29:39.080 --> 03:29:40.670
that's the living well piece.

3153
03:29:41.530 --> 03:29:42.140
<v 5>Okay.</v>

3154
03:29:42.140 --> 03:29:44.150
<v 4>And we have to do it as a tribe together.</v>

3155
03:29:45.050 --> 03:29:48.380
I don't give a shit if you ever put a uniform on the a day in your life,

3156
03:29:49.010 --> 03:29:51.050
if you're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder

3157
03:29:52.840 --> 03:29:57.840
with people that experienced trauma before the trauma and they know they've got

3158
03:29:58.511 --> 03:30:02.410
a thing underneath the thing,
underneath the thing,
and you're willing to say,
hey,

3159
03:30:03.370 --> 03:30:06.430
let's go start picking up pebbles and moving them because we'll move this

3160
03:30:06.431 --> 03:30:10.090
mountain and it's going to be long and arduous and the painstaking process,

3161
03:30:11.230 --> 03:30:15.290
but look to your left and right.
That's what makes it worth it.

3162
03:30:17.080 --> 03:30:20.530
And we're doing that and we're just getting better at it.
And yeah,

3163
03:30:20.740 --> 03:30:24.930
it's stressful.
And yeah,
I hate fundraising and yeah,
I hate it,

3164
03:30:25.090 --> 03:30:29.230
but it all comes with it.
It comes with the territory.

3165
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:32.240
<v 0>So some people are going to want to,</v>

3166
03:30:32.250 --> 03:30:36.140
so what 22 kill.com is that the best place to go?
Look?
Yeah,

3167
03:30:36.141 --> 03:30:40.370
go to [inaudible] dot com read about,
learn about what we're learn about

3168
03:30:40.970 --> 03:30:45.970
<v 4>the things that we've decided to really engage our focus on and why we're</v>

3169
03:30:51.130 --> 03:30:51.531
and we're,

3170
03:30:51.531 --> 03:30:56.531
we're not just helping and treating the warrior or the first responder or the

3171
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:59.990
law enforcement officers.
That's the,
we want the entire family.

3172
03:31:01.520 --> 03:31:04.670
Because
when you have,

3173
03:31:04.700 --> 03:31:08.990
when you pull up to the tire shop and you have four bad tires,
you can't,

3174
03:31:08.991 --> 03:31:12.230
you're not going to change just one tire.
Right?

3175
03:31:12.820 --> 03:31:17.330
He got to change it all for her.
We got to treat the family as a unit

3176
03:31:19.090 --> 03:31:22.870
because I'm speaking from experience,
when I say we leave a big wake in our path

3177
03:31:25.390 --> 03:31:26.223
<v 5>and</v>

3178
03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:31.840
<v 4>I would not be surprised if my family has posttraumatic stress just from dealing</v>

3179
03:31:32.391 --> 03:31:37.070
with me.
And the sad thing is,

3180
03:31:37.071 --> 03:31:39.710
is I'm not joking.
You know,

3181
03:31:39.740 --> 03:31:43.070
I was thinking about the nurses and doctors you left at the hospital as well as

3182
03:31:43.071 --> 03:31:46.580
you mentioned earlier,
if they are better people because of dealing with me,

3183
03:31:47.060 --> 03:31:51.440
so it's,
but I mean listen man,
we're in in just so people know,

3184
03:31:52.160 --> 03:31:57.050
22 kill.com another quote,
don't you have to be.org no,

3185
03:31:57.530 --> 03:32:00.890
no,
that's you listening to the media.

3186
03:32:01.850 --> 03:32:05.120
God forbid,
do your own homework and figure it out.
It's,

3187
03:32:05.450 --> 03:32:08.750
you can have that org.com.net doesn't matter.

3188
03:32:08.751 --> 03:32:12.980
That does not denote if you're a five o one c three or not just for the record

3189
03:32:14.060 --> 03:32:18.680
and we have our saying 22 kilo.
When I came on,

3190
03:32:18.700 --> 03:32:22.220
I changed it to one tribe,

3191
03:32:22.221 --> 03:32:25.850
one fight because you hear all the time in the military,
especially one team,

3192
03:32:25.851 --> 03:32:30.530
one fight,
one team would find
when I was around,

3193
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:33.260
some guys are users use the word tribe and

3194
03:32:34.820 --> 03:32:38.360
thought about it in the more and more I thought about it.
I'll speak in one time.

3195
03:32:39.740 --> 03:32:43.220
I don't remember where I was,
but I went to see one team,
one fight,

3196
03:32:44.780 --> 03:32:49.130
but I said one tribe,
one fight sim,
because it's too easy to be a team.

3197
03:32:50.760 --> 03:32:52.520
If you,
if you have the same letterhead

3198
03:32:54.260 --> 03:32:59.260
on your business cards or you have the same in Sydney on your shirt,

3199
03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:02.000
that makes you a team.

3200
03:33:04.430 --> 03:33:06.110
The tribe goes way deeper than that.

3201
03:33:07.270 --> 03:33:11.900
The tribe is when my first daughter was putting his forehead against mine and

3202
03:33:11.901 --> 03:33:12.800
doesn't say a word

3203
03:33:14.550 --> 03:33:15.383
<v 5>yet,</v>

3204
03:33:16.320 --> 03:33:17.970
<v 4>I learned a life lesson</v>

3205
03:33:19.850 --> 03:33:24.850
and I get the acceptance that I was longing for without even speaking.

3206
03:33:25.100 --> 03:33:29.300
That's true.
Tribe is driven by the same ideals,
the same conviction,

3207
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:32.990
the same passion.
I get asked all the time like,
why do you think,

3208
03:33:32.991 --> 03:33:37.820
why are we still at war in Iraq and Afghanistan?
Osira oh,

3209
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:39.900
because you can't kill your way out of an idea.

3210
03:33:43.090 --> 03:33:47.980
That's why
that's what it is.

3211
03:33:49.150 --> 03:33:53.980
God forbid we call it that,
but just with us,
we,

3212
03:33:54.820 --> 03:33:56.690
so we have programs like Camp [inaudible],

3213
03:33:56.980 --> 03:34:01.720
which is a program where we can add,
we take a words first responders,

3214
03:34:01.721 --> 03:34:03.010
law enforcement officers.

3215
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:08.290
The most gnarly side of it is we'll take him up in the helicopter and take them

3216
03:34:08.500 --> 03:34:12.460
to go kill hogs out a helicopter.
Because if you don't like that,

3217
03:34:12.490 --> 03:34:16.840
then you don't like freedom.
But we,
you know,

3218
03:34:16.841 --> 03:34:21.520
we also,
you can take him fishing,
we can take them to the range we can,

3219
03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:24.550
but there it's always followed up by fireside chat.

3220
03:34:26.540 --> 03:34:30.980
That's where the money's made.
That's where you gotta be vulnerable.

3221
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:36.910
You'll get your adrenaline kick and then be willing to lower your wall and talk

3222
03:34:37.461 --> 03:34:41.990
about the real shit,
you know?
Then we have stay the course,

3223
03:34:41.991 --> 03:34:45.200
which is,
that's a traditional therapy.
That's the,

3224
03:34:45.201 --> 03:34:47.990
this is the you camp Bahal it'd be nontraditional stay.

3225
03:34:47.991 --> 03:34:49.150
The course is very traditional.

3226
03:34:49.151 --> 03:34:53.030
It's the one on one therapy with the warrior first monitor his or her family

3227
03:34:55.130 --> 03:34:55.581
and listen.

3228
03:34:55.581 --> 03:35:00.581
The reason that that was an attractive approach was because if you look back on

3229
03:35:02.601 --> 03:35:06.740
what is the most successful outcome measures as far as therapy goes and as far

3230
03:35:06.741 --> 03:35:11.150
as treating matters of the mind that has the best track record.

3231
03:35:12.370 --> 03:35:13.203
The one on one,

3232
03:35:13.310 --> 03:35:16.990
I think everyone on the spinning ball a k I should talk to a professional way at

3233
03:35:16.991 --> 03:35:20.050
least once a month.
Every single person,

3234
03:35:21.520 --> 03:35:25.690
and I'm saying that as the guy that I would launch my piss bottle in the

3235
03:35:25.691 --> 03:35:30.460
hospital at one if they came in my roof,
and I'm telling you right now,

3236
03:35:30.670 --> 03:35:35.110
I wish I'd have started that a long time ago because it would've saved me from a

3237
03:35:35.111 --> 03:35:39.820
lot of Shit I've had to deal with because I let my pride when,

3238
03:35:41.270 --> 03:35:41.800
<v 5>yeah,</v>

3239
03:35:41.800 --> 03:35:45.760
<v 4>that's it.
I mean don't be afraid to say what it is.</v>

3240
03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:48.400
And we started a thing called the brief program,

3241
03:35:48.401 --> 03:35:52.240
which is women's specific because believe it or not,

3242
03:35:53.290 --> 03:35:58.240
neither sex and everything
that just don't,

3243
03:35:58.660 --> 03:36:03.580
there's power in numbers,
but women,
when you break it down,

3244
03:36:03.610 --> 03:36:05.590
you break the numbers down to the bare bones.

3245
03:36:05.690 --> 03:36:09.130
They're leading the charge in everything in a negative light.
And that's,

3246
03:36:09.400 --> 03:36:10.690
I think it has a lot to do with,

3247
03:36:10.691 --> 03:36:13.840
they're a much smaller population when it comes to the service community.

3248
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:19.350
So they're more apt to be ice to Dylan self-medication,

3249
03:36:19.351 --> 03:36:21.610
isolation,
you know,

3250
03:36:21.900 --> 03:36:26.900
and they don't have nearly as big as of an immediate tribe to depend on is we do

3251
03:36:28.090 --> 03:36:31.420
because there's just way less of them.
And so that's,

3252
03:36:31.690 --> 03:36:36.400
that's our brave program and they can go do all the things all the guys do,

3253
03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:40.840
but it's women's specific because they need to be empowered to,

3254
03:36:41.620 --> 03:36:44.290
and it's our job to help them do that without judgment.

3255
03:36:45.290 --> 03:36:48.670
And we also have the white SAR families program that we're building out,

3256
03:36:48.671 --> 03:36:52.890
which is basically you have the gold star families was started by the dod.
Well,

3257
03:36:52.891 --> 03:36:55.670
unfortunately the white star families don't have a seat at that table.
Why?

3258
03:36:55.671 --> 03:36:58.390
Star families?
They are family,

3259
03:36:58.480 --> 03:37:00.850
family members who fallen victim to suicide.

3260
03:37:03.010 --> 03:37:06.640
And we want to give them a table.
They deserve a damn table.

3261
03:37:07.300 --> 03:37:11.220
As you talk to those kids,
they don't give a crap out of their mom or dad died.

3262
03:37:11.300 --> 03:37:14.650
They just know they don't have a mom or dad.
That's enough for me.

3263
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:19.560
Far be it from us to not honor someone like Lewis Puller.

3264
03:37:21.270 --> 03:37:22.140
Who the hell are we?

3265
03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:24.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3266
03:37:24.020 --> 03:37:27.740
<v 4>I don't give a crap what society says.
The the how.</v>

3267
03:37:27.741 --> 03:37:31.280
I should feel about that as,
let me tell you something.

3268
03:37:31.970 --> 03:37:34.070
This is something that everyone,
he's known unfortunately.

3269
03:37:34.071 --> 03:37:37.910
I bet a lot of your listeners do know already suicides,

3270
03:37:37.911 --> 03:37:40.010
just a word until it affects you personally.

3271
03:37:41.010 --> 03:37:41.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3272
03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:42.480
<v 4>she was the word</v>

3273
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:48.610
and I hear a lot where there's some corporations are owners of a mom and pop

3274
03:37:48.611 --> 03:37:49.620
shop while Jake,
no,

3275
03:37:49.630 --> 03:37:53.020
we would love to support you with 22 kills a pretty strong name.

3276
03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:55.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3277
03:37:55.240 --> 03:37:59.700
<v 4>Souls,
cancer and AIDS
supposed to get your attention.
That's the point.</v>

3278
03:38:00.420 --> 03:38:05.310
Start the conversation
cause you know you hear,
we hear all the time,

3279
03:38:05.311 --> 03:38:08.190
knowledge is power.
It's not,
knowledge is power.

3280
03:38:08.191 --> 03:38:13.191
When it's shared then it becomes powerful and I tell people dislike it.

3281
03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:18.510
I'll tell you if you can't support us because of a name,

3282
03:38:18.570 --> 03:38:22.140
if you can't look that,
pass the name to get to the root cause of an issue.

3283
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:24.480
Consider yourself part of the problem,

3284
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:32.630
said all you're doing is feeding a stigma that's killing the best men and women.

3285
03:38:33.001 --> 03:38:34.770
This nation's got the offer.

3286
03:38:37.660 --> 03:38:41.020
<v 0>Well,
I'll tell you what,
I think that's probably a pretty good place to wrap.</v>

3287
03:38:41.021 --> 03:38:44.650
We've been going for a while and especially

3288
03:38:46.930 --> 03:38:47.763
because you just

3289
03:38:49.870 --> 03:38:54.760
made very clear the reason why I wanted to have you come on this podcast now

3290
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:58.060
because you know,
again,

3291
03:38:58.061 --> 03:39:01.120
this ties everything together that I've been talking about for the past three

3292
03:39:01.121 --> 03:39:01.954
podcasts.

3293
03:39:04.140 --> 03:39:06.480
Do you know you got a guy like Louis polar jr

3294
03:39:10.980 --> 03:39:11.813
<v 1>and</v>

3295
03:39:17.650 --> 03:39:19.860
<v 0>we got to do something.
Yeah.</v>

3296
03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:25.120
Cause it's still going on and you're out there and your,

3297
03:39:25.180 --> 03:39:27.700
your people on the front lines fighting it.
And you know,

3298
03:39:27.701 --> 03:39:30.730
I was watching a video that you had on your youtube channel

3299
03:39:32.320 --> 03:39:37.280
and it's just pictures,
pictures of soldiers,
pictures are marines,

3300
03:39:37.760 --> 03:39:42.680
pictures of service men and women and they're just coming up on the screen and

3301
03:39:42.681 --> 03:39:47.380
it's all them,
you know,
in their uniforms and overseas and back home.
And

3302
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:51.700
they had,
I know what each one of those pictures is.

3303
03:39:56.310 --> 03:39:57.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3304
03:39:57.670 --> 03:40:01.370
<v 0>Right.
So I thank you for coming on obviously.
Um,</v>

3305
03:40:03.340 --> 03:40:05.510
thanks for your service and thanks for everything you've done.

3306
03:40:07.060 --> 03:40:07.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3307
03:40:07.770 --> 03:40:10.590
<v 0>Thanks for your sacrifice and thanks for what you're doing right now.</v>

3308
03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:17.620
<v 4>Well,
let me tell Ya,
I learned a long time ago,
um,</v>

3309
03:40:20.890 --> 03:40:25.320
is your guys like us,
you know,

3310
03:40:25.321 --> 03:40:29.380
the media ads and the knuckle draggers,
the,
oh Geez,
I'm sick of hearing.

3311
03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:32.010
Thank you for your service.
You know,

3312
03:40:32.011 --> 03:40:37.011
it was impossible for me for a long time to go in a public place because if I'm

3313
03:40:37.411 --> 03:40:39.600
wearing shorts and a tee shirt,
it's abundantly apparent.

3314
03:40:39.601 --> 03:40:41.790
I had a shitty day at the office.
Somewhere along the line.

3315
03:40:42.870 --> 03:40:44.820
It was impossible for me to get anything done.

3316
03:40:45.270 --> 03:40:49.670
Go Buy bread and go home without someone stopping me.
Hey,

3317
03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:54.600
that happened over there.
Yeah,
thank you for your service.
And I was like,
man,

3318
03:40:55.980 --> 03:40:58.620
it's so annoying.
I don't want to,
I just want to get bread and go home.

3319
03:41:00.010 --> 03:41:03.360
You will never dawned on me until a few years ago.

3320
03:41:03.810 --> 03:41:05.400
Maybe they're doing that for them.

3321
03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:09.340
Maybe it's as much for them as it is for me.

3322
03:41:11.180 --> 03:41:11.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3323
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:16.630
<v 4>And then I thought about why I signed up because it's cause I thought they were</v>

3324
03:41:16.971 --> 03:41:19.940
worth it,
thought their families,
we're worth it.

3325
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:24.800
So I was told one time,
I thank you,
I said you're worth it.

3326
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:31.730
Two things happen.
The conversation ended there and secondly

3327
03:41:34.010 --> 03:41:36.800
they probably walked out of there a little taller than they walked in.

3328
03:41:38.580 --> 03:41:42.110
I was like,
oh thanks God,
I get it now.
It's not about me.

3329
03:41:44.040 --> 03:41:47.450
I'll tell you just like I tell all of them,
you're worth it.

3330
03:41:47.860 --> 03:41:51.800
Your family is worth it.
All your listeners,
I feel the same way.

3331
03:41:52.850 --> 03:41:55.880
Even though I guarantee you I'm going to have a million differences with a

3332
03:41:55.880 --> 03:41:59.630
million different album,
you're worth it.
Don't do it all again.

3333
03:41:59.631 --> 03:42:04.631
The moral set of bad day at the office and you know it's,

3334
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:10.010
I,
I just want to leave your listeners with this is that there's power.

3335
03:42:11.240 --> 03:42:13.790
Just trust me when I tell you there's so much power.

3336
03:42:15.340 --> 03:42:15.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3337
03:42:15.770 --> 03:42:17.930
<v 4>We're about to start this thing called the tribal council,</v>

3338
03:42:17.931 --> 03:42:22.780
which I think is going to,
it's a peer to peer support group and I think,

3339
03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:25.733
<v 1>okay,</v>

3340
03:42:26.040 --> 03:42:29.790
<v 4>I'm praying to God that it has the power behind it that I think it does</v>

3341
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:33.600
where,
and I'm going to lead the charge.

3342
03:42:33.601 --> 03:42:35.910
I'll be the first one to stand up on the soapbox.

3343
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:38.550
I'm just going to open up my chest cavity,

3344
03:42:38.551 --> 03:42:42.510
pour my soul out in front of a group of people I've never met and say,

3345
03:42:43.350 --> 03:42:46.560
here's the Shit I dealt with.
Here's what I've been through.

3346
03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:48.720
This is what I'm doing to address it,

3347
03:42:49.530 --> 03:42:53.790
and this is how you can hold me accountable.
Who's next?

3348
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:57.440
There's a lot of power in that

3349
03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:02.600
because we have to remember in our community,
you hear all the time,

3350
03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:07.010
be accountable to yourself.
Be Accountable.
Dear brothers,
he old are your sisters.

3351
03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:11.730
Well,
unless you have brutal honesty first

3352
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:15.550
you have manufactured accountability.

3353
03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.520
So when I ask you how you doing?

3354
03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:25.410
Don't tell me good to appease me because I'm going to call you on your shit.

3355
03:43:28.170 --> 03:43:29.003
<v 5>Be Great</v>

3356
03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:32.620
<v 4>know.
So thank you.
I'm going to turn it back on you.</v>

3357
03:43:32.621 --> 03:43:37.120
Thank you for doing what you're doing.
Cause Dude,
your,

3358
03:43:37.150 --> 03:43:41.740
you,
your tip of the spirit just like anyone else.
Uh,
you are leading the charge.

3359
03:43:42.190 --> 03:43:43.690
This wasn't easy for you to do.

3360
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:49.350
Well what you had me come here do and do.
When you talked about Jesse,

3361
03:43:49.360 --> 03:43:53.260
when you talked about Lewis Jr,
I mean you had me,

3362
03:43:54.100 --> 03:43:56.110
this is not the popular thing to do,

3363
03:43:58.540 --> 03:44:02.500
but you said,
I've never been okay with the status quo.
Why start now?

3364
03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:06.220
So thank you for everything you've done and continue to do.

3365
03:44:06.650 --> 03:44:08.390
<v 0>Well,
I'll tell you how this is a,</v>

3366
03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:12.140
it's literally an honor to be able to do this.

3367
03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:15.200
People throw that word around all the time.
It is an honor for me to sit here.

3368
03:44:15.201 --> 03:44:16.790
It's an honor for me to sit here with you.

3369
03:44:17.090 --> 03:44:21.710
All the guests I've had on here to be able to tell these stories that I,

3370
03:44:22.980 --> 03:44:26.540
I'm sick sometimes that they're,
they're not carried on.

3371
03:44:27.140 --> 03:44:28.340
And um,

3372
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:33.050
it's an honor from Yale to be able to pass on these stories so that people know

3373
03:44:33.051 --> 03:44:36.620
and people can learn.
And it's,

3374
03:44:36.650 --> 03:44:41.650
it's a humbling experience to do it as well because being in the shadow of

3375
03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:47.470
people like these guys,
people like yourself,
it's,

3376
03:44:47.610 --> 03:44:52.610
it's a humbling experience to be around warriors like that from all phases of

3377
03:44:53.580 --> 03:44:54.413
history.

3378
03:44:55.130 --> 03:44:55.963
<v 5>Okay.</v>

3379
03:44:57.040 --> 03:45:00.700
<v 0>And we're going to keep doing it.
And when you get that program rolling,</v>

3380
03:45:01.780 --> 03:45:03.970
get your ass back on here.
We'll talk about it.

3381
03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.150
We'll talk about how it's going and we'll get the word out on that thing too.

3382
03:45:07.520 --> 03:45:10.190
<v 4>Right on.
Awesome.
Don't threaten me with a good time.</v>

3383
03:45:12.230 --> 03:45:17.120
<v 0>Echo Charles.
Yes.
You got quickly,
quickly,</v>

3384
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:22.410
if anybody wants to support themselves.
I have a question first,
man.

3385
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:27.320
I knew that was coming.
Is that,
is that a common stereotype about navy seals?

3386
03:45:27.350 --> 03:45:31.870
They got to go tanning.
They need the cool side.
They need a nice here.

3387
03:45:32.260 --> 03:45:36.130
Not Really Jocko though.
You don't go,
you go tanning or no,
no.

3388
03:45:36.370 --> 03:45:38.560
The stereotypical seal thing was,
uh,

3389
03:45:39.130 --> 03:45:43.280
something that I didn't like.
You know,
I didn't like it.

3390
03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:48.790
And the older I got,
the more I disliked it.
And it's,

3391
03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:51.730
you know,
but it's a reality of,
you know,

3392
03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:55.620
especially during that during the eighties and nineties Bro,

3393
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:58.750
during the eighties and nineties which is where that reputation,
but you know,

3394
03:45:58.870 --> 03:46:01.270
the guys in Vietnam to man those guys,
like,

3395
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:04.840
like in Vietnam they wore blue jeans in the field,
you know,

3396
03:46:04.841 --> 03:46:06.940
because they kept off leaches and they were tougher and,

3397
03:46:07.090 --> 03:46:11.400
but then you don't guess what that turns into like something where guys,

3398
03:46:11.540 --> 03:46:15.520
some guy in 1992 is wearing blue jeans with his cammies and it's like,
oh

3399
03:46:17.150 --> 03:46:20.590
bro,
I showed up at the teams.
It was like,
Hey,
we,
you know,

3400
03:46:20.650 --> 03:46:25.650
I wanted to have long hair and be like a cool guy.
What you did?
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3401
03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:26.470
for sure.

3402
03:46:26.470 --> 03:46:30.280
There's somebody just put a picture out on the interwebs of me with long hair

3403
03:46:30.530 --> 03:46:35.290
like circa 1990 whatever,
sideburns and everything.

3404
03:46:35.291 --> 03:46:39.790
Cause I wanted to be Joe cool.
And,
but what happened was,
well,
number one,

3405
03:46:39.791 --> 03:46:40.960
the war started.
Number two,

3406
03:46:40.980 --> 03:46:45.640
I started working really closely with conventional forces on my first

3407
03:46:45.760 --> 03:46:48.520
deployment,
a little bit on my second film and a ton.
Also,

3408
03:46:48.521 --> 03:46:53.380
I did multiple shipboard deployments where I worked with marines very closely,

3409
03:46:53.410 --> 03:46:56.620
even when I was young.
And yeah,
so I just,

3410
03:46:57.610 --> 03:47:02.610
it was one of those things that like when I would hear it at first I'd be like,

3411
03:47:03.251 --> 03:47:06.650
oh,
that's no big deal.
But then what I realized was it was a real thing when you,

3412
03:47:07.050 --> 03:47:11.260
when you were stereotype me as I moved into leadership positions and I would

3413
03:47:11.261 --> 03:47:15.300
hear that sear stereotype and I realized it was a real thing and that,

3414
03:47:15.310 --> 03:47:19.510
that real thing wasn't it?
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny because when you,

3415
03:47:19.511 --> 03:47:21.550
when you read or Meta a Marine Corps,

3416
03:47:21.551 --> 03:47:25.900
battalion commander and you have long hair or your uniform doesn't look right,

3417
03:47:25.901 --> 03:47:27.140
or you meet an,
uh,

3418
03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:30.980
an army battalion commander or an army brigade commander or,

3419
03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:36.010
or a senior or a gunny Sargent or company first sergeant,

3420
03:47:36.371 --> 03:47:37.240
when you meet one of them,

3421
03:47:38.050 --> 03:47:42.940
somebody that's been in the Marine Corps for 23 years and you can't put on and

3422
03:47:42.941 --> 03:47:44.920
blouse your,
your,
your pants and your boots.

3423
03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:47.890
It doesn't matter how good you are in the field.

3424
03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:50.410
They're looking at you and thinking,
oh,
this guy can't even blouse the boots.

3425
03:47:50.411 --> 03:47:53.740
I don't want them around.
That's that stereotype.

3426
03:47:54.580 --> 03:47:58.930
Even though it,
it had definitely was rooted in truth.
Like,
hey man,

3427
03:47:58.931 --> 03:48:01.390
when we got to Ramadi,
everyone had shaved heads,
everyone had squared away.

3428
03:48:01.391 --> 03:48:04.070
Uniforms didn't allow patches.
We've talked about that before.
You know,
we,

3429
03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:05.710
we had guys,
like if we could,

3430
03:48:05.711 --> 03:48:09.100
we put our whole element in army camouflage uniforms,
so ACU.

3431
03:48:09.101 --> 03:48:13.960
So they just look like army soldiers.
So I was against it.

3432
03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:16.750
Uh,
but I,
I get the humor of it and I,
you know,

3433
03:48:16.751 --> 03:48:19.920
I don't take anything that personally.
Okay.

3434
03:48:19.950 --> 03:48:23.440
So it's a stereotype like in at work kind of,

3435
03:48:23.470 --> 03:48:26.950
I thought he meant maybe like out at the club or whatever.
Like you know,

3436
03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:28.040
navy deals tend to be

3437
03:48:28.130 --> 03:48:31.190
<v 3>more into it.
Yeah.
You know what's funny is,
you know who made a joke about this,</v>

3438
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:34.010
Tim Kennedy,
we were,
here we are recording the podcast.

3439
03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:38.840
Tim Kennedy was literally doing a photo shoot.
He was like,

3440
03:48:38.841 --> 03:48:42.860
and he's got long hair and he was like all,
you know,
I'm not like a Hollywood.

3441
03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:44.180
And I was like,
Dang Dude,

3442
03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:51.590
I'll tell you why.
Let me give it,
give you the,

3443
03:48:51.610 --> 03:48:54.050
the Barney version of everything he just said.

3444
03:48:54.380 --> 03:48:58.370
This is one of the things I dig about Jocko and it has nothing to do with this

3445
03:48:58.530 --> 03:49:00.320
following or what he did.
It's because,

3446
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:02.310
<v 5>okay,</v>

3447
03:49:02.310 --> 03:49:03.270
<v 3>cause he ever,</v>

3448
03:49:03.450 --> 03:49:07.560
he's authentic and he's intentional and everything that he does

3449
03:49:09.490 --> 03:49:10.323
<v 5>and</v>

3450
03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:14.060
<v 3>we should long to be around that a lot more.</v>

3451
03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:19.070
Yup.
I'm going to have to go ahead and agree with you on that one.

3452
03:49:19.340 --> 03:49:23.930
So that's when you sort of learned,
hey,
heres just to look good.

3453
03:49:23.931 --> 03:49:28.610
This is after you shaved your head,
by the way.
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.
Dude,
for sure.

3454
03:49:28.720 --> 03:49:33.180
It doesn't mean anything else.
I'm here to win.
That's what that was.
It's cool.

3455
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:37.970
That was me growing up in the teams.
Yeah,
I know.
That's why Tim,
Tim Kennedy,

3456
03:49:37.971 --> 03:49:41.510
he's going to hear this leaky funnel making fun of my,
well,

3457
03:49:41.511 --> 03:49:45.790
he was making fun of my,
uh,
people.
Yeah,
your people.

3458
03:49:46.430 --> 03:49:50.000
My people having long hair,
but he had long hair and doing a photo shoot.

3459
03:49:50.930 --> 03:49:54.830
You know who said that?
You Know Matt best or I met Beth on one of his videos.

3460
03:49:54.831 --> 03:49:58.840
He's the,
he,
he,
he alluded to that.
Oh,
it's no,
it's real.
No,

3461
03:49:59.310 --> 03:50:04.130
it's a real thing.
And Tim Kelly does 100% right,
because,
because yeah,

3462
03:50:04.131 --> 03:50:07.470
there's,
there's some seals where you're like,
oh,
oh,
I know Brian.

3463
03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:09.470
Hundred percent let me tell you one thing.

3464
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:13.620
I just object to it in a,
you know,

3465
03:50:14.780 --> 03:50:15.800
real strong way

3466
03:50:16.260 --> 03:50:17.093
<v 5>what</v>

3467
03:50:18.440 --> 03:50:21.770
<v 3>somebody's using some kind of hair product,
right?
Like,
that's,</v>

3468
03:50:22.060 --> 03:50:25.680
that's a no more than Tanny.
That's a no,
no one actually Tan.

3469
03:50:25.681 --> 03:50:27.800
So that's not a real thing.
Oh,
it's the real thing.

3470
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:33.610
I was allowed on the org in the 90s and there was the,

3471
03:50:33.611 --> 03:50:38.611
there was the marine recon guys and they straight up had the foil like

3472
03:50:39.731 --> 03:50:43.600
reflectors under their chins out when they were suntanning.

3473
03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:46.060
I got a kick out of that,
but it doesn't matter.

3474
03:50:46.090 --> 03:50:49.930
It doesn't matter if they that there was a dozen recon marines out in,

3475
03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:54.940
in Speedos,
right.
Straight up tanning with baby oil.
It doesn't matter.

3476
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:58.770
They're,
the reality was the seals were default Hollywood tanning guys got,

3477
03:50:58.780 --> 03:51:01.870
that's the way it is.
That's okay.
That's what you gotta deal at the same time,

3478
03:51:01.871 --> 03:51:02.480
Bro,
too.

3479
03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:07.300
Let's be very clear that it's

3480
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:13.870
me saying it or Tim Kennedy or Matt or that's one thing.

3481
03:51:13.871 --> 03:51:14.704
Okay.

3482
03:51:15.010 --> 03:51:20.010
But if like if Joe public civilian says something,

3483
03:51:21.430 --> 03:51:24.410
it's like,
hey bro.
Yeah,
I don't know that that's,

3484
03:51:24.430 --> 03:51:26.430
I don't know that Joe would actually

3485
03:51:26.430 --> 03:51:30.120
<v 6>know that.
That's why if we rolled out,
oh,</v>

3486
03:51:30.121 --> 03:51:35.100
if we rolled out all the stereotypes for the services,
like marines,

3487
03:51:35.101 --> 03:51:38.820
dumb jarhead,
a cradle to cradle,
the cran thing,

3488
03:51:38.821 --> 03:51:42.700
that's the big marine corps one Crayon,
crayon heater.
Yeah,
they eat crayons.

3489
03:51:42.960 --> 03:51:47.800
I said that's like legit thing.
The,
the army's got there,
you know,

3490
03:51:48.090 --> 03:51:50.780
who are things and you know,
we don't have that kind of all,

3491
03:51:50.781 --> 03:51:55.350
all that kind of thing going on.
A Green Berets,
you know,

3492
03:51:55.351 --> 03:51:58.680
smoking cigarettes,
you know,
that's what the seals would say.
Like,
Oh yeah,

3493
03:51:58.700 --> 03:52:02.430
they're over there smoking cigarettes and eating donuts.
You know,
so it,

3494
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:05.580
there's just little stereotypes that have some,

3495
03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:09.630
some basis of reality,
but you know,
you can't put a stair.

3496
03:52:09.631 --> 03:52:12.830
So that's why stereotypes are stereotypes or some level of reality to it.
Um,

3497
03:52:12.840 --> 03:52:13.673
but there,

3498
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:18.060
the reality is that you can't blanket a whole organization with any of those.

3499
03:52:18.690 --> 03:52:22.680
So that's the way it goes.
Right.
The next time you go tanning

3500
03:52:24.900 --> 03:52:26.920
you solid juggling 10

3501
03:52:29.940 --> 03:52:34.840
cleared that up.
Thank you for that course.
And I,
yeah,

3502
03:52:34.980 --> 03:52:39.030
I can talk about some ways to support the podcast as well.
Do you know?

3503
03:52:39.300 --> 03:52:41.370
Do you know what this is?
I'm going to teach you something right now.

3504
03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:45.030
You ain't got when the train?
No,

The,
the big,

3505
03:52:45.031 --> 03:52:49.950
the big grill in the field.
It means or pick it up.
Pick up the pace.

3506
03:52:50.360 --> 03:52:53.280
Gotcha.
Alright,
let's do it.
Alright,

3507
03:52:54.240 --> 03:52:56.730
Well if you want support the spot.
Yes.

We're doing a double thing.

you know what you're starting to sound like,

3511
03:53:08.280 --> 03:53:12.990
just so you know what?
Not the radio guy.
100% but I sound like a radio.

3512
03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:16.320
That was 100% thanks Jake.
Redo it here.

3513
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:23.330
You were like,

Okay.

This is where you can get Jocko supplements.

3516
03:53:32.611 --> 03:53:37.470

Important.
Super important.
Yup.
That was good.

3517
03:53:37.890 --> 03:53:40.680
Solid proof and it's true by the way.

3518
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:43.280
Also another to supplement called discipline.
That's what's this?

3519
03:53:43.440 --> 03:53:47.220
This one is right here.
It's like a cognitive enhancer,
amping,
you know,

3520
03:53:47.221 --> 03:53:49.530
some caffeine in there,
some good stuff.
Some is there.

3521
03:53:49.531 --> 03:53:53.440
There's some vitamins in here.
This is a good one,
is a really good one.
I mean,

3522
03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:56.820
take before you do some something that you gotta use your brain and your body,

3523
03:53:56.821 --> 03:54:00.990
which is cool.
All so
milk,

3524
03:54:01.920 --> 03:54:06.600
milk,
milk is out.
It's a protein powder.
Jocko.
What?
Believe it or not,

3525
03:54:06.601 --> 03:54:11.400
I did two and two.
I did two and two.
I got it.
I put it together.

3526
03:54:11.480 --> 03:54:15.750
One that crafty.
Wow.
There it is.
Boom

3527
03:54:17.430 --> 03:54:21.750
and monk.
Tasty.
Yeah.
Mint chocolate chip.
And wait,
wait,

3528
03:54:21.751 --> 03:54:23.470
you're coming out with a new uh,

3529
03:54:23.730 --> 03:54:25.660
but that we're working that those won't be out for a little bit.

3530
03:54:26.890 --> 03:54:30.790
There's new discipline coming out.
It's a new flavor.
One of the flavors.
Yeah.

3531
03:54:31.180 --> 03:54:34.180
One of the flavors is it's,

3532
03:54:34.540 --> 03:54:36.760
I don't know if this is okay,
right.

3533
03:54:36.970 --> 03:54:40.120
We might have to rebrand it something else because it can't be Jocko.

3534
03:54:40.180 --> 03:54:42.790
If it is coconut,

3535
03:54:42.791 --> 03:54:47.080
pineapple is tasty.
Okay.
So here's,
so here's one of those.

3536
03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:51.370
I can't believe it.
So anyway,
so Jocko was hardcore,
right?
Authentic,

3537
03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:55.150
authentic,
hardcore.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.

3538
03:54:55.240 --> 03:55:00.240
So one of the main important issues with developing these supplements,

3539
03:55:01.871 --> 03:55:06.030
which are good supplements by the way,
is taste.
Does that hardcore,

3540
03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:09.490
does that seem hard?
Cornea?
He thinks that I would like eat.

3541
03:55:09.580 --> 03:55:12.760
When I originally was making supplements,
he thought that that my,

3542
03:55:13.450 --> 03:55:16.540
I would have no priority on tastes.
Like if it tastes bad,
doesn't matter.
Right?

3543
03:55:16.541 --> 03:55:20.430
Does it matter?
It's actually better if it tastes
okay.

3544
03:55:20.650 --> 03:55:25.300
I wasn't thinking,
but you could think that in order to drink this,

3545
03:55:25.301 --> 03:55:26.260
you just got to get,
like,

3546
03:55:26.500 --> 03:55:29.350
you just gotta Grit your teeth and get some intentionally like,
hey,

3547
03:55:29.351 --> 03:55:30.700
if that happens,
it happens.
Kind of like,

3548
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:33.280
I don't feel that way because the reality is when,

3549
03:55:33.460 --> 03:55:37.330
when supplements tastes like crap,
you don't need it.
So then what's the point?

3550
03:55:38.130 --> 03:55:41.050
So there you go.
A flank.
That's what he did.
That's what that is.

3551
03:55:41.051 --> 03:55:45.940
The flank with the taste nonetheless tastes good.
And I think Pina Colada,

3552
03:55:46.420 --> 03:55:51.070
pineapple,
coconut,
whatever.
I think that's a good idea.
Wait,
homage to,

3553
03:55:51.071 --> 03:55:55.690
uh,
our Hawaii route route,
all my people in Hawaii.
Yes.

3554
03:55:56.110 --> 03:56:00.280
And Mark,
by the way,
is a mint chocolate chip.
Mint chocolate.

3555
03:56:00.670 --> 03:56:02.930
There's no chips,
no chips.
Good point.
Same,

3556
03:56:02.980 --> 03:56:06.290
same kind of feel your I've never heard without the chips.
It's Kinda

3557
03:56:09.130 --> 03:56:13.980
tough to deal with it.
It will taste good though.
We can,
we can call it test.

3558
03:56:14.010 --> 03:56:18.310
Good reports are in good.
Very good also.
Oh,

3559
03:56:18.311 --> 03:56:22.750
I hear good things about the mixability too.
No,
just all great deal by the way.

3560
03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:24.730
Yeah,
it's a pain in the ass.

3561
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:28.270
Also gies in rash guards were still an origin main by the way.

3562
03:56:28.310 --> 03:56:31.510
Dot Com where didn't mean Daca?
GIEVES and rash guards.
If you're into Jujitsu,

3563
03:56:31.900 --> 03:56:34.930
when you get into Jujitsu you can have the question and I still,

3564
03:56:34.931 --> 03:56:39.010
we still get that going.
What?
Gee,
should I get?
Get on word you and G,

3565
03:56:39.130 --> 03:56:43.390
There you go.

03:58:23.671 --> 03:58:28.450
episodes.
Got them all listed there by episode.
Click through there,
boom ticket,

3593
03:58:28.470 --> 03:58:29.303
Amazon shop.

3594
03:58:30.090 --> 03:58:34.770
Buy those books or a leaf blower or whatever.
He isn't going to buy.

3595
03:58:34.771 --> 03:58:39.420
Just carry on shopping.
That's your thing.
Good way to support.
Very good,

3596
03:58:39.660 --> 03:58:41.340
very good.
Also,

3597
03:58:42.160 --> 03:58:47.160
<v 3>the alternative is we do like 40 minutes of advertisements in the beginning.</v>

3598
03:58:47.260 --> 03:58:50.890
I don't have a problem with that.
That's not happening.
Well,
yeah,
you're kind of

3599
03:58:51.180 --> 03:58:55.710
<v 6>ty advertisements as far as advertisements go.
Even like on you,</v>

3600
03:58:55.711 --> 03:58:57.780
you know how when you're watching youtube videos of the ads in the,

3601
03:58:57.781 --> 03:58:58.770
in the beginning of the video

3602
03:58:58.980 --> 03:59:02.730
<v 3>I have youtube red.
Do you have youtube red too?
Is that what's going on?
I don't.</v>

3603
03:59:02.940 --> 03:59:06.330
Youtube red is the best $9 and 99 cents a month.

3604
03:59:06.331 --> 03:59:09.480
You can spend your press click and it just starts playing the video.

3605
03:59:09.481 --> 03:59:13.710
No advertisement.
It's,
here's the thing,
I don't mind the advertisements.

3606
03:59:13.770 --> 03:59:16.620
That's how I find out about like a bunch of the new movies that come out.

3607
03:59:16.621 --> 03:59:21.600
A lot of like,
um,
intermittent.
This guy's weird.
I had a guy the other day,

3608
03:59:21.601 --> 03:59:22.800
he was like,
I was watching,

3609
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:26.880
he was watching one of the podcasts and it was one of the heavy podcasts,

3610
03:59:26.940 --> 03:59:30.330
which I guess doesn't really narrow it down too much,
but he's,
he goes,

3611
03:59:30.331 --> 03:59:32.790
you got to walk into podcasts and all of a sudden there's a big advertisement.

3612
03:59:32.791 --> 03:59:36.270
Oh,
you know what?
This is what youtube will do.
Sometimes with longer videos.

3613
03:59:36.300 --> 03:59:40.740
They'll just put that in where this guy was angry and you know what can do.

3614
03:59:40.780 --> 03:59:44.640
It was in the youtube comments,
which we know we don't respond to,
but we do read.

3615
03:59:45.210 --> 03:59:47.040
But I almost responded bro.

3616
03:59:47.310 --> 03:59:50.670
Nine 99 90 99 that thing's gone.

3617
03:59:51.480 --> 03:59:55.050
I was watching videos series for,
for old shit.
Right.

3618
03:59:56.070 --> 04:00:00.530
It is,
it is.
It is fee.

3619
04:00:01.020 --> 04:00:05.670
But it was going great.
And then the commercial pop check into my life.
I'm never

3620
04:00:09.430 --> 04:00:13.100
<v 6>again when I did,
I did the ads.
I get it though.
You know,</v>

3621
04:00:13.101 --> 04:00:16.040
cause sometimes you look,
you're listening to his deal,
his thing,

3622
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:17.480
whatever it is he's talking about.

3623
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:22.020
It takes you mentally and kind of this face it emotionally into a certain spot

3624
04:00:22.350 --> 04:00:26.100
and then the feeds out into some,
hey do you want to,
I don't know,

3625
04:00:26.101 --> 04:00:28.140
whatever the ad is,
you know,
you want to get more color.

3626
04:00:28.141 --> 04:00:29.430
It kind of puts the brakes on that.

3627
04:00:29.460 --> 04:00:32.700
There's been some unusual things in the podcast,

3628
04:00:33.970 --> 04:00:37.410
<v 3>especially for Echo.
I'll say ACLU has been very,
and Ed,</v>

3629
04:00:37.420 --> 04:00:40.840
we didn't talk about it cause it was actually not the right time to talk about

3630
04:00:40.841 --> 04:00:43.570
it.
But on the last podcast,
one 22,

3631
04:00:44.230 --> 04:00:48.550
there was an emotional moment for echo and a amen.
You got through it.

3632
04:00:48.730 --> 04:00:52.810
I know and I'm like super hardcore and everyone knows that,
you know.
But Hey man,

3633
04:00:53.340 --> 04:00:55.750
you've been the strongest.
There are moments of fatigue.

3634
04:00:55.780 --> 04:00:58.720
No one else maybe just fatigued that time.
Maybe.
Anyway,

3635
04:00:59.300 --> 04:01:00.390
we're going to change this

3636
04:01:00.930 --> 04:01:04.230
<v 6>two sub,
uh,
a support is subscribed to the podcast.</v>

3637
04:01:04.231 --> 04:01:07.080
If you haven't already on iTunes,
stitcher,
Google play,

3638
04:01:08.430 --> 04:01:11.790
and any other place or wherever you listen to your podcast with a new podcast

3639
04:01:11.791 --> 04:01:15.870
apps all over now.
So boom,
subscribe.
No shame.
Can't keep up on them.

3640
04:01:16.500 --> 04:01:17.730
Yeah,
and when I say no shame,

3641
04:01:17.731 --> 04:01:20.880
that's not a in Hawaii or actually here's something a little interesting thing

3642
04:01:20.890 --> 04:01:22.800
starts super interesting.
It's kind of interesting.

3643
04:01:23.100 --> 04:01:25.320
You know the expression no shame,
right?

3644
04:01:25.321 --> 04:01:29.950
It usually means like by this guy has no shame.
Like he's kind of low.
Like he,

3645
04:01:30.090 --> 04:01:32.850
he has his moral standards may be kind of low,
something like that.
Right?

3646
04:01:33.420 --> 04:01:36.360
In Hawaiian,
no shame means don't be shy.

3647
04:01:37.630 --> 04:01:41.920
<v 3>I like in South Africa when I was in South Africa,
they say shame,
shame.</v>

3648
04:01:41.950 --> 04:01:44.860
It's just a word that they use for all kinds of different things.
I'm like,
Oh,

3649
04:01:44.861 --> 04:01:49.330
shame.
No kidding.
It's,
I liked the way they used it.
Interesting.
Yeah.

3650
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:50.590
I'll try and bring it back.

3651
04:01:51.640 --> 04:01:55.030
I'm telling you right now with those two pieces of information,
right?

3652
04:01:55.120 --> 04:01:59.020
I'm prepared to change.
It'll help.
It'll help communication.

3653
04:01:59.021 --> 04:02:00.940
You get a guy from boy and he says,
no shame.

3654
04:02:01.440 --> 04:02:04.470
<v 6>Does it mean it in a bad way?
Cause it's,
they're very subtle differences,</v>

3655
04:02:04.500 --> 04:02:08.280
but one is kind of on the bedside like,
oh this guy,
no shame,
you know this guy,

3656
04:02:08.281 --> 04:02:09.400
no shame if a hole,

3657
04:02:09.420 --> 04:02:12.060
the guy from Hawaii says no shame is he's just saying don't be shy.

3658
04:02:12.570 --> 04:02:17.250
Or if he's telling the story,
say,
Hey,
this person wasn't shy at that point.
Like,

3659
04:02:17.760 --> 04:02:21.560
like if he says,
and here it is,
here's the example.
Okay,
I'm telling a story,

3660
04:02:21.570 --> 04:02:25.830
but a guy who went and talked to a girl and said by this guy,
no shame,

3661
04:02:25.831 --> 04:02:28.770
he just went and talked to her on the mainland or you know,

3662
04:02:28.771 --> 04:02:31.350
outside of Hawaii or whatever.
They'd be like,
wait,
what was wrong with him?

3663
04:02:31.390 --> 04:02:33.120
Was that his friend's girlfriend or something?

3664
04:02:33.390 --> 04:02:35.040
Or was that his cousin or something?
You know what I mean?

3665
04:02:35.130 --> 04:02:36.690
So it sounds like a whole different story.

3666
04:02:36.930 --> 04:02:41.580
So saying do that in text message there.
Then if it's a Hawaii guy,

3667
04:02:41.581 --> 04:02:45.080
you can go for same problems.
Yeah.

3668
04:02:45.220 --> 04:02:45.941
<v 3>Well,
well,</v>

3669
04:02:45.941 --> 04:02:50.941
which you may not know if he could probably do it because he is very proactive

3670
04:02:53.080 --> 04:02:56.530
and aggressive in his use of emojis.
This guy.
Yeah,

3671
04:02:56.860 --> 04:03:01.150
rainbow spirit like Google's brings it.

3672
04:03:01.600 --> 04:03:06.160
I incorporate the palm tree to very recently so watch out for that one.
Yes.

3673
04:03:06.490 --> 04:03:09.520
<v 6>Nonetheless.
Back to support youtube channel.</v>

3674
04:03:09.640 --> 04:03:13.660
Also along with the podcast plastic and platforms and apps you do.

3675
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:18.340
We do have a youtube channel where kid podcasts that you do panel now.
Oh boom.

3676
04:03:18.341 --> 04:03:23.060
Just released warrior kid Youtube Channel podcast where the blood gas,
yes.

3677
04:03:23.090 --> 04:03:27.270
Can kind of deal but just work.
It's hosted yet.
It's up and running live.
Okay,

3678
04:03:27.520 --> 04:03:30.400
so I kept you on the lookout for that one.
But yeah,
Youtube,

3679
04:03:30.401 --> 04:03:33.760

3680
04:03:33.761 --> 04:03:34.990
some good looking guy.

3681
04:03:35.020 --> 04:03:38.230
He talks about their moneymaker during the podcast and I want to come check it

3682
04:03:38.231 --> 04:03:42.700
out.
Guys got curious.
You could don't deny it.

3683
04:03:43.690 --> 04:03:46.510
One of the first things I did was ask somebody in my family,
I was like,

3684
04:03:46.511 --> 04:03:50.580
I need a mirror.
I haven't seen my face.
And I was like,
I it,
how bad is it?

3685
04:03:51.550 --> 04:03:56.230
I saw it and I was like,
Nah,
we're good.
You can still work.
Boom.
Yeah,

3686
04:03:56.320 --> 04:03:59.980
so if you guys curious,
curious about that bone.
We got the youtube channel.

3687
04:03:59.981 --> 04:04:04.030
Perfect.
All Scott excerpts on there and enhanced excerpts.

3688
04:04:04.031 --> 04:04:08.080
I take little extra and put music on it.
It's nice,
I think.
Nice chocolate fix.

3689
04:04:08.081 --> 04:04:12.730
Nice.
Yeah.
Yeah,
and I good.
Some of them.
Hell yeah.
Also,

3690
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:16.450
Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store.
Creatively enough,

3691
04:04:16.900 --> 04:04:21.610
Jocko store.com this is where you can get tee shirts and whatnot,
whatnot,

3692
04:04:21.611 --> 04:04:26.470
meaning rash guards as well.
Hoodies,
hats,
all kinds of cool stuff.

3693
04:04:26.740 --> 04:04:31.450
I think they're cool.
I love it.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's good.
Jocko.

3694
04:04:31.451 --> 04:04:36.120
store.com on the year it's Jocko gear on Jocko stores.

3695
04:04:36.340 --> 04:04:40.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fully nonetheless.
Look with this one.
I'm not saying,
Hey,

3696
04:04:40.841 --> 04:04:42.610
go to Joel store.
Buy some time.
I'm not saying that.

3697
04:04:43.360 --> 04:04:46.360
I'm saying just go there and look.
Check it out.
You like something,
get something.

3698
04:04:46.390 --> 04:04:50.090
That's a good way to support.
That's all I'm saying about,
because store also,

3699
04:04:50.500 --> 04:04:53.950
I love it.
It's good.
Yeah.
Also psychological warfare.
Okay?

3700
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:58.480
You're going to know what that is,
is what it is.
It's an album with tracks.

3701
04:04:58.690 --> 04:05:01.840
Chocolate tracks,
not a song.
They're not songs and singing.

3702
04:05:01.870 --> 04:05:05.980
You don't want other than that,
no,
no,
we don't.
Playing Guitar.

3703
04:05:05.981 --> 04:05:08.860
Maybe that's kind of quite than he played guitar.
None the less.
It's not that.

3704
04:05:08.861 --> 04:05:12.010
It's chocolate talking and here's what he's saying,
Kate.

3705
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:15.670
We call it our campaign against weakness,
right?
Just you know,

3706
04:05:15.671 --> 04:05:17.830
you're on the program,
you're on the path that you can get me in shape.

3707
04:05:17.831 --> 04:05:20.440
You're staying in shape.
You're whatever you're doing right.
You're reading more.

3708
04:05:20.441 --> 04:05:23.530
I Dunno.
Waking up early,
right?

3709
04:05:23.560 --> 04:05:26.410
Impose the discipline first thing in the morning,
whatever,
whatever you do,

3710
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:29.140
and do that every day.
Those days where you're feeling weak,

3711
04:05:29.141 --> 04:05:33.160
you might skip the workout,
but asleep in whatever,
whatever the weaknesses,

3712
04:05:33.190 --> 04:05:36.670
there's a track for it and it's Jocko telling you why you shouldn't give in to

3713
04:05:36.671 --> 04:05:39.790
that weakness.
Just for that time.
It's not him yelling,
nothing like that.

3714
04:05:40.170 --> 04:05:42.460
It's just kind of explaining to you why you shouldn't,

3715
04:05:42.520 --> 04:05:45.790
shouldn't give in through effective too,
by the way,
a hundred percent effective.

3716
04:05:46.300 --> 04:05:49.970
I'm not mistaken.
That was the last numerical report.
Percentage wise.

3717
04:05:51.580 --> 04:05:56.390
Well,
you know you just mentioned very quickly the warrior kid podcast.
Yeah,

3718
04:05:56.710 --> 04:06:01.030
and that has a youtube channel and in order to have a youtube channel for the

3719
04:06:01.031 --> 04:06:03.670
warrior kid podcasts,
there has to be a warrior kid podcast,

3720
04:06:03.671 --> 04:06:05.590
which there is now for your kid.

3721
04:06:05.591 --> 04:06:10.591
Podcast is out and in it it is questions for Uncle Jake,

3722
04:06:11.500 --> 04:06:14.860
by the way,
not this uncle Jake,
but a different uncle Jake.

3723
04:06:15.330 --> 04:06:16.163
I'll tell you it's similar

3724
04:06:17.180 --> 04:06:19.370
<v 0>and it's on a separate channel.</v>

3725
04:06:19.371 --> 04:06:23.330
The reason I put it on a separate channel is so that your kids aren't sitting

3726
04:06:23.331 --> 04:06:28.331
there streaming podcasts or your kid podcasts and all of a sudden they jump into

3727
04:06:29.450 --> 04:06:33.290
machete season or the meal masker so it's totally separate channel.

3728
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:38.150
Uncle Jake's got some lessons learned for kids.
Yes,

3729
04:06:38.151 --> 04:06:41.450
definitely for parents.
Very true.

3730
04:06:41.780 --> 04:06:45.740
Hundred percent coming from Echo Charles for teachers.
Yes.
Coaches.
Yes.

3731
04:06:45.800 --> 04:06:46.633
Human beings.

3732
04:06:46.640 --> 04:06:50.610
I'm going to go ahead and say yes real quick about what else think do well is

3733
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:53.480
listening to it where it's okay,

3734
04:06:53.481 --> 04:06:58.481
this is why it's for like a parent because these kids like that asking you the

3735
04:06:58.581 --> 04:07:01.320
questions.
They're questions.
They probably asked their parents.

3736
04:07:01.980 --> 04:07:05.210
Maybe the parents would be like,
oh,
I'm not sure.
Maybe,
or,
okay,

3737
04:07:05.211 --> 04:07:08.540
I'll just kind of spontaneously answered the question.
Meanwhile,
it's like,

3738
04:07:08.541 --> 04:07:13.490
Kinda Yerba is good man.
It's good.
It's getting,
there's no,

3739
04:07:13.491 --> 04:07:17.780
that happens to be number one.
Number one,
kids,
podcasts,

3740
04:07:17.810 --> 04:07:20.800
kids and family,
Pumpkin,
so that's cool.
All right.
Uh,

3741
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:23.390
speaking of way of the warrior kid,

3742
04:07:24.170 --> 04:07:28.490
there's the book way of the Warrior Kid and there's also the new book.
Boom.

3743
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:32.480
There.
It is hardcover way.
The warrior kid to Mark's mission,

3744
04:07:33.380 --> 04:07:37.880
Uncle Jake continues to help mark with some of his problems,
losing his temper,

3745
04:07:38.300 --> 04:07:40.220
how to handle being made fun of.

3746
04:07:40.280 --> 04:07:43.280
Don't you wish somebody told you how to handle being made fun of when you were a

3747
04:07:43.281 --> 04:07:48.260
kid?
I know I would've liked that.
Fear of failure.
How do you overcome that?

3748
04:07:48.261 --> 04:07:52.010
Also learns about the value of money.
A lot of people don't know that these days.

3749
04:07:52.040 --> 04:07:53.860
A lot of kids don't know that for sure.
Yeah.

3750
04:07:54.230 --> 04:07:58.490
Mark in the book actually gets a job,
makes money.

3751
04:07:58.550 --> 04:08:01.490
Refurbishes a bike basically gets after it,

3752
04:08:02.450 --> 04:08:07.450
so give the children that you know the ultimate gift and that is the gift of

3753
04:08:08.391 --> 04:08:12.140
discipline.
Show him the way of the warrior kid and you will be stoked.

3754
04:08:13.110 --> 04:08:15.140
Speaking of warrior kids and soap,

3755
04:08:15.141 --> 04:08:17.270
what you mentioned earlier or you could get from on it,

3756
04:08:17.271 --> 04:08:21.650
you could also get soap from Aiden.
He's a warrior king.
Very good on that.

3757
04:08:22.100 --> 04:08:26.660
Irish oaks ranch.com stay clean.

3758
04:08:26.720 --> 04:08:27.553
That's the motto.

3759
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:31.550
I'm sure don't forget about this clinic was freedom field manual and y'all,

3760
04:08:31.570 --> 04:08:35.750
I'm actually glad I wrote this book.
You want to know why?

3761
04:08:36.140 --> 04:08:40.790
Because I actually have to refer to it.
Oh Dang.
That's kind of reacting to I.

3762
04:08:40.800 --> 04:08:42.880
You're going to it like Dang.
Like you didn't think I had to refer to.

3763
04:08:42.900 --> 04:08:44.180
Did you think I didn't have to refer to it?

3764
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:47.250
I think I never thought about whether or not yet to refer to,

3765
04:08:47.300 --> 04:08:49.830
but now that you mentioned it's kind of like,
oh I get it.

3766
04:08:50.230 --> 04:08:52.070
You know how you got to write your to your to do list.

3767
04:08:52.100 --> 04:08:54.230
Look boy you to remember that.
It's kind of like that.

3768
04:08:54.610 --> 04:08:58.910
I I have to refer to the manual.
It's a good book man.

3769
04:08:58.911 --> 04:09:01.940
It's you open it up for your pitch is good.
Read two pages.

3770
04:09:02.430 --> 04:09:03.440
That's the way I wrote it.

3771
04:09:03.470 --> 04:09:07.460
I wasn't even thinking about like the effectiveness of it.
It's pretty cool man.

3772
04:09:07.461 --> 04:09:10.880
If you want the audio version,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

3773
04:09:10.940 --> 04:09:15.750
It's not on audible because olive oil wouldn't work for a book like this.

3774
04:09:15.960 --> 04:09:20.730
It needs to be an album with tracks so it's available on iTunes,
Amazon music,

3775
04:09:20.731 --> 04:09:23.370
Google play,
other MP,
three platforms.

3776
04:09:23.640 --> 04:09:28.640
Then there's extreme ownership of course combat leadership applied to the

3777
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:33.510
battlefield,
applied to business,

Do you do overs?

3778
04:09:33.570 --> 04:09:36.810
1 million copies sold right now.

3779
04:09:37.620 --> 04:09:41.880

Impressive.

We're stoked on that and it's been,

3780
04:09:41.881 --> 04:09:46.170

3781

leadership books since its release or something like that.

3782
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:51.090
I forget what the actual thing but it sounded pretty cool.

3783
04:09:52.020 --> 04:09:54.840
They sent me a stat thing today.
That's why I know this stuff.

3784

Get it for your business in life and also you can right now order the follow on

3785
04:10:00.901 --> 04:10:04.410
book two extreme ownership that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.

3786
04:10:04.800 --> 04:10:06.540
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

3787
04:10:06.570 --> 04:10:10.860
It is finding the balance as a leader and I talk about this all the time on the

3788
04:10:10.861 --> 04:10:12.960
podcast,
I actually said,

3789
04:10:12.961 --> 04:10:17.580
I actually talked about this in the first public interview I ever did with Tim

3790
04:10:17.580 --> 04:10:19.810
Ferris.
He asked me about the qualities of leaders.
As I said balance.

3791
04:10:19.811 --> 04:10:24.090
So while that's what I'm talking about as we continue to work with companies and

3792
04:10:24.091 --> 04:10:26.370
businesses,
people like the hardest thing people have,

3793
04:10:26.760 --> 04:10:28.590
the hardest challenge people have is balance.

3794
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:32.800
I talked to ton about that with the talking about chesty puller.
So much balance.

3795
04:10:32.801 --> 04:10:37.801
He balanced perfectly between between being hard and being gentle.

3796
04:10:38.311 --> 04:10:41.160
He found that perfect balance cause you know if you're gentle,
gentle,

3797
04:10:41.170 --> 04:10:44.160
as a leader,
you're a pushover.
No one respects you cause too hard.
As a leader,

3798
04:10:44.940 --> 04:10:47.090
you drive people to hard.
You're slave driver.
No one likes it.

3799
04:10:47.091 --> 04:10:50.040
No one respects you.
You got to find that balance.
That's what this book is about.

3800
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:56.400

3862
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:06.970
hey listen,
it
just keep grinding,

3863
04:15:07.660 --> 04:15:10.250
so it's all about you know,
you.
I've learned

3864
04:15:10.250 --> 04:15:15.250
<v 4>that I've learned this in my well versed and experienced 36 years of life.</v>

3865
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:21.350
Three things.
This lives absolutely worth living.

3866
04:15:21.920 --> 04:15:24.440
What makes it beautiful is you get to share it with people that you love,

3867
04:15:24.441 --> 04:15:28.640
all the way your successes and your failures,
and three,

3868
04:15:28.820 --> 04:15:29.653
it's not about you

3869
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:36.280
<v 0>live wall check.
Well Jake,</v>

3870
04:15:36.281 --> 04:15:40.720
as I said before,
thank you for coming on the show,
but more importantly,

3871
04:15:40.721 --> 04:15:43.060
thanks for your service in the Marine Corps.

3872
04:15:43.420 --> 04:15:46.300
Raw thanks for your sacrifice.

3873
04:15:46.301 --> 04:15:51.301
Thanks for fighting so hard and thanks for what you are doing now to help

3874
04:15:51.400 --> 04:15:56.400
veterans continue to live the lives they deserve to live

3875
04:15:58.780 --> 04:16:02.140
and to everyone out there,
whether you're a veteran or not,

3876
04:16:04.330 --> 04:16:06.520
I said at the beginning of this series

3877
04:16:08.450 --> 04:16:13.450
that this was a story of war and love and pain and death.

3878
04:16:14.540 --> 04:16:17.750
Life is hard.
It is tragic.

3879
04:16:19.230 --> 04:16:20.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3880
04:16:20.040 --> 04:16:21.030
<v 0>Immerse merciless.</v>

3881
04:16:23.680 --> 04:16:26.290
And when you are caught in that storm,

3882
04:16:27.900 --> 04:16:28.390
<v 1>okay,</v>

3883
04:16:28.390 --> 04:16:31.630
<v 0>you might not see anything else beyond the darkness,</v>

3884
04:16:35.980 --> 04:16:40.450
but there is light beyond the darkness.

3885
04:16:40.720 --> 04:16:42.280
But you have to hang on,

3886
04:16:42.580 --> 04:16:47.580
you have to hang on and you have to move forward and you have to fight.

3887
04:16:53.000 --> 04:16:53.833
You have to fight,

3888
04:16:54.080 --> 04:16:58.280
fight through all that pain and fear and darkness

3889
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:02.560
and get to the other side.

3890
04:17:04.800 --> 04:17:05.633
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3891
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:08.120
<v 0>Where the darkness subsides</v>

3892
04:17:11.640 --> 04:17:13.950
and where you can once again

3893
04:17:16.220 --> 04:17:17.053
<v 1>live.</v>

3894
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:24.040
<v 0>Thanks for listening.
Thanks for living</v>

3895
04:17:26.930 --> 04:17:31.430
and thanks for getting out there
and getting after it.

3896
04:17:33.680 --> 04:17:34.880
So until next time,

3897
04:17:36.080 --> 04:17:39.920
this is Jake Schick and deco and Jocko

3898
04:17:41.740 --> 04:17:42.070
<v 1>out.</v>
