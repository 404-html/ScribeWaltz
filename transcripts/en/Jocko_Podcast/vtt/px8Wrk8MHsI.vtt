This is Jocko podcast number 46 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.150
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.020
There is a little survival instinct.

4
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.230
It's,
it's very subtle,

5
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.180
but I would notice it sometimes in a combat situation.

6
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.930
<v 0>When guys are thinking that enemy fire at any time could open up</v>

8
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.690
and kill them,

9
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.550
you'd see some guys subconsciously,

10
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.980
they just did just try and make themselves a little bit of a smaller target.

11
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.710
It just Kinda slouched their backs down a little bit and they just kind of bow

12
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.570
their head just a tad.

13
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.400
<v 0>It's not a,
it's not a bad thing to do.</v>

15
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.130
I don't think guys actually think about it.
I don't think they consciously do it.

16
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.260
I think it just kinda happens.

17
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.580
Make it happens when you think you could get shot at any moment

18
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.070
ready.
It's likely a good instinct to have

19
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.250
in.
When we first got to Ramadi,

20
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
we were out on patrol and I saw one of my guys on a real patrols my first time

21
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:44.710
seeing this particular guy on a real patrol,

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.360
and it was in the [inaudible] district of Ramadi,

23
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:54.361
which was just an enemy controlled cesspool of violence

24
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.670
with threats everywhere.

25
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.640
And as I saw this guy,

26
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.700
he was standing straight up,
just standing straight up.

27
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.090
His head was held high as a weapon was at the ready.

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.760
He was scamming,

29
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.693
he was hunting.

30
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.750
There was no slouch in his back,

31
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.490
there was no lowering of his head.

32
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.840
There was no fear apparent on his face or in his posture.

33
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.950
He was just boldly facing the threat

34
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.770
standing tall.

35
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.980
Now you've heard me talk about some of my guys in task unit bruiser

36
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.090
that I worried about
are just some of the guys I,

37
00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:04.091
I thought that they basically had too much courage,

38
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.620
too much bravery and it,

39
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.860
and it just didn't seem like that kind of attitude

40
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140
was survivable day after day after day after bloody day in Ramadi,

41
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.040
but somehow some way through some divine providence,

42
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
this particular brave soul did survive and actually thrived in that environment.

43
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.960
In the battle of Ramadi with task unit bruiser.

44
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.300
Yup.
Tasking,
a bruiser was made up of two seal platoons,

45
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.650
Charlie Petunia and Delta Platoon Charlie Batoon we've talked about before.

46
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.860
Leif Babin was the platoon commander,

47
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.360
Tonia fratty who's been on the podcast BTF Tony.

48
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:09.361
He was the platoon chief and the lead sniper for Charlie platoon was was Chris

49
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
Kyle

50
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.680
and in the other platoon Delta platoon where Andrew Paul,

51
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.930
who's also been on the podcast,
he was the assistant platoon commander

52
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.940
and the point man and sniper.

53
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.650
The lead point man and lead sniper for Delta platoon was,

54
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.710
was that guy was the guy that I just described walking through the literal

55
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:40.790
valley of death

56
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.370
with his head held high

57
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.170
and his name is Jeremiah Danelle.

58
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.750
<v 0>Also known as j p Denelle.
That's what I always called him</v>

60
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.170
and we have him as a guest on the podcast tonight.
Now

61
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.590
when JP was in tasking at bruiser,
he was a kid when we,

62
00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:17.240
when we were in workup,
I think he was 22 years old when we deployed.

63
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:22.241
He was 23 years old and I love Jp.

64
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.040
He was like a brother and to be quite honest with you,

65
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:27.140
it's like a little brother to me.

66
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.260
And I loved his aggressiveness and when we were going through workup,

67
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:38.910
he would just,
just straight up execute anything.
I told him to do anything

68
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.030
like a,
like a hyper aggressive terminator robot.
I will look at him and say,
JP,

69
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:48.870
take that room or JP get on that high ground or JP get those prisoners out of

70
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:52.980
here and he would just get after it and make it happen and just destroy your

71
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.680
outmaneuver.
Anything that was in his way?
Well,

72
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.130
one

73
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.450
<v 1>time we were going through mount training,
which is urban warfare,</v>

74
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.530
so we're in kind of a fake city with buildings and all this and there was a

75
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.700
building across the street and we were taking massive pink ball fire.
Again,

76
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.910
it's just training,
but we're getting shot up with paint ball.
Yeah,

77
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.580
<v 0>and in my mind I'm thinking,
okay,
we're where if this is real,</v>

78
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.540
we're getting killed and I know that we need to get aggressive to stop this and

79
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.640
say I'm kind of give the command of,
hey,

80
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.350
we need to hit that building across the street.
And it like,

81
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.400
as the last word is coming out of my mouth,
I see JP just bust out of the door,

82
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.380
the building we're in,
just go running across the street with his gun blazing.

83
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.580
Just caveman smashed through the door of the target building.

84
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.200
You goes in there and I just see muzzle flashes.
He's just machine gunning people

85
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.320
and I thought to myself,
okay,

86
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.503
<v 1>yeah,</v>

87
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.330
<v 0>j p can bring it.</v>

88
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.770
At least he can bring it during training

89
00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.420
because courage against paint ball in training is actually not that big of a

90
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:05.650
deal at all.
In fact,
it's borderline meaningless,

91
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.930
but it is an indication.

92
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340
Now,
courage in sustained combat is another thing.

93
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.090
And J P proved himself as a true warrior over and over and over again during the

94
00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:28.420
battle of Ramadi.
Great.

95
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:31.300
I'm honored to have my brother

96
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.420
Jp Tyndale on the podcast today.

97
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.030
<v 1>JP,
welcome to the show.
Thank you for having me here.</v>

98
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.860
<v 0>And we have to start with trying to understand</v>

99
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.980
<v 1>where are you come from,
how much time do we have,</v>

100
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.800
<v 0>where you grew up and,
and all that.
And it's pretty cool.
I mean,</v>

101
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:01.130
I know,

102
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.130
I know your mom and dad and I've actually grappled against your dad.

103
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.910
Yeah.
It's one of his highlights.
He loves that.
He talks about it all the time.

104
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.350
What's wrong?
Strong man.
Scary.
Strong.
Yeah.

105
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.030
Like what and how will,
so how old is he now?
Um,

106
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.170
he is 54 55.
No kidding.

107
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.280
Yeah.
So 10 years ago he was my age.
Yeah.
So what I grappled with him,

108
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:29.400
he was my age.
Yeah.

109
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.040
And I thought he was all old now and right now if you call me old,
I'd be pissed.

110
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.590
Yeah,
I know you would be.
So Mr Denelle,
I apologize.

111
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.040
I thought you were all back in the day.
Nope.
He grabbed a hold of my head.

112
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.880
They were in line with that.
I am right now.
Oh,
that's crazy,
isn't it?
Yeah.

113
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.430
Sorry to interrupt.
Yeah,
no,
that's true.
