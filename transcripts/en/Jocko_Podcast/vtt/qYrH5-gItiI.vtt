This is Jocko podcast number 89 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.800
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200
<v 0>I was sitting in my tactical operations center in Ramadi</v>

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.660
alone.
I was staring at a document

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.450
on my computer

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.100
and I had to keep wiping tears from my face as I read it.
Yeah.

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.900
The document had been submitted to me by the Delta platoon commander.

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.240
There was an award recommendation

10
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.030
for Michael Monster

11
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.730
when the award was the metal of honor

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.303
for Mikey.

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.200
He'd been sitting on an outcropping of a roof in south Ramadi on an Overwatch,

14
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.290
and a grenade,
which had been thrown from an unseen location,

15
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160
actually hit him in the chest and fell to the ground in front of him.

16
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.400
And he could've jumped away from the grenade and he could have saved himself.

17
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.660
<v 0>But if he had done that,
his teammates,</v>

19
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

20
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.280
<v 0>That we're positioned next to him,</v>

21
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.830
they would have been exposed to that blast.

22
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.700
So instead of moving away from the grenade,
Mikey jumped on the grenade.

23
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.423
You smothered it

24
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.930
and he absorbed it's lethal explosion.

25
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.680
<v 0>Thereby saving our teammates</v>

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.970
and at the same time sacrificing his own life.

28
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.950
The morning that it happened,
September 29th,

29
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.950
2006 I got a call from the battalion commander from the first of the five oh six

30
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
an outstanding officer and leader that I respected and admired

31
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.820
and this element from Delta platoon had been in the field receiving fire and

32
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:50.210
returning fire motion the morning,
which was nothing new or nothing unusual,

33
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.280
but it had escalated

34
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.050
and I knew that there had been trouble.
And when the colonel called me,

35
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.580
he told me that there had been a,
a bad fight.

36
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.350
And then he went down the list of my men describing quickly what their wounds

37
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.470
were and what their status was and,

38
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.010
and pretty much telling me that they were going to be okay

39
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.910
until he got to Mikey

40
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.220
and I could hear a shift in his voice.

41
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.950
You became very grave and very serious and that could hear the,

42
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:43.290
this sympathy in it.

43
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.440
And I knew what was coming.

44
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.920
Mikey got hit bad.

45
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.870
You got hit really bad Jocko.

46
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.833
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.180
<v 0>right.
I don't think he's gonna make it</v>

48
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.150
in my heart.
Jumped through my chest and then it sank

49
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.650
back down to my stomach and then erupted into my brain in a maddening rush of

50
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:26.660
anger and horror and gut wrenching sadness.

51
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.740
And I grabbed all that insanity and all that emotion and I pulled it back into

52
00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:41.741
my mind and I held it down there while I uttered the only words that I could

53
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:42.704
muster,

54
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.190
Roger that sir.

55
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.490
And when the Delta platoon commander,

56
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.270
who's one of my best friends and a very close friend of Mikey's,

57
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.750
when he called me,
we were mechanical.

58
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.640
We had work to do.

59
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.740
He debriefed me,
I listened,

60
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.090
we discussed the followup and the next steps and the resupply in the operational

61
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:17.590
impact of the casualties.

62
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.190
<v 1>We held it together.</v>

63
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.860
<v 0>And the next day I talked to one of the seal officers that Mikey had saved.</v>

64
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.010
I talked to him on the phone because he was in Germany already with the other

65
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.290
seal that had been wounded badly on the rooftop,

66
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:46.980
both of whom would have been dead if it hadn't been from Mikey.

67
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.380
They were only wounded.
And because of that,
they weren't heading home.

68
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.980
And when I talk to

69
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 1>this young officer,</v>

70
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.980
he explained to me what happened with perfect clarity.

71
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.090
<v 0>Mike,
he could've jumped away and saved himself,
but he did not.</v>

72
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.040
He's only movement was toward the grenade.

73
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.200
Mikey did not hesitate

74
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.530
what kind of a man
does that,

75
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.380
but when I was a brand new guy at seal team one,

76
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.970
I began to learn and understand what kind of man did that

77
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
you see as a young enlisted seal at seal team one.

78
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.820
There were two pictures on the quarter deck

79
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.013
<v 1>just to</v>

80
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.110
<v 0>the pictures were of seal team ones,
medal of honor recipients,</v>

81
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.820
Lieutenant Bob Kerrey
and petty officer.

82
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.620
Second Class Mike Fortner

83
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.180
and we young guys,

84
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.950
we memorize their names as well as the name of the seal team.

85
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.800
Two Medal of honor recipient,
Lieutenant Tom Norris,

86
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.930
and we read their citations over and over again and debrief them amongst

87
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:43.530
ourselves.

88
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.970
But we young enlisted seals

89
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.390
we focused on on Mike Thornton.

90
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.780
He was an enlisted man
like we were

91
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.140
and we had heard about him

92
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.250
then he was a legend,

93
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.360
not only for his actions but for his reputation as a seal,

94
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.610
as an operator,
as a leader,

95
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.790
as an all around bad ass frog man that we all aspired to be

96
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.490
as a young enlisted seal.
He was the mark.
He was the example.

97
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.270
He was Mike Thornton

98
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.480
and a few months after checking into seal team one,

99
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.300
I was in Virginia Beach.

100
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.410
I was going to a school at the navy base there on little creek and one day after

101
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:57.480
work we to a place called Papas pub.

102
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.400
Now mind you,
I wasn't even old enough to get in,
but the,

103
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.490
the chief snuck me in there and as we were sitting there having some food and

104
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.363
talking,

105
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360
a handful of other seals walked in and they were wearing their full dress choker

106
00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:16.984
whites

107
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.320
and one of them was a big monster of a man and he had a rack or ribbons up to

108
00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:26.900
his shoulder and the metal of honor around his neck.

109
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:28.580
And I knew exactly who it was.

110
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.700
It was Mike Gordon
right there in front of me,

111
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.630
the ultimate seal,
the ultimate hero standing there in the flesh.

112
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.350
They're my chief looked and he,

113
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.010
he saw how Austrac I was and he told me to go over there and say hi,

114
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.650
which I did.
Now again,

115
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:59.270
I was a new guy and you'd have my trident yet and at seal team one at the time

116
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:00.920
as I have accounted over and over again,

117
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:05.300
we knew guys pretty much got treated like worthless scum.

118
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.620
But when I introduced myself to Mike Thornton,

119
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.120
slap me on the back and said welcome to the teams.

120
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.330
And then he told me I'm from team one too.

121
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.230
I'm from team one too.

122
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.990
And then he bought me beer and treating me like I was his brother,

123
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.220
the man himself treating a pathetic new guy like me.

124
00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:38.320
Like why wasn't one of his long lost buddies

125
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.300
and I never forgot that attitude and that humility

126
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.900
and I would see Mike fort and occasionally over the years and I and I square,

127
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:57.610
it always seemed like he remembered me,
at least in my mind.

128
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.230
But years later,

129
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.010
he actually did get to know me a little bit when Mikey monsters parents received

130
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.250
the medal of honor from President Bush in the White House.
I was

131
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.310
with Mike Thornton again.

132
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.920
<v 0>And after that solemn ceremony,</v>

134
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.453
well,

135
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.520
we went and we drank and we raised hell and we raised our classes to Mikey into

136
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:33.530
the rest of our fallen brothers and Mike Fort and treated me and the rest of our

137
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.394
task unit

138
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.430
the same way he treated me when I first met him,

139
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.910
like we were all brothers.

140
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.543
And that night

141
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.160
now that I had seen combat myself and seen with my own eyes,

142
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.170
the bravery and the selflessness and the sacrifice that is the very core of our

143
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.554
community.

144
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.270
I finally understood why Mike Thornton treated us all like brothers.

145
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.560
It's because we were
and we are

146
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.263
<v 1>okay.</v>

147
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.130
<v 0>And with that it is on absolute honor to have here tonight</v>

148
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.990
I hero legend,
a Patriot

149
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.530
and someone I'm so proud to be able to call brother retired seal and medal of

150
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.093
honor recipient,

151
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.343
<v 1>Mike Thornton.</v>

152
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.450
<v 2>Sir,
welcome aboard.
Thanks shark goes.
Thanks.
So,</v>

153
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.300
and it's my honor to be here too.
Um,

154
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.850
you are unbelievable warrior as Mikey months or I tell Ya,

155
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.510
my love goes up to George and Sally and then everybody there.

156
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:18.354
But,
uh,

157
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.830
that was an unbelievable day to have taught me and me there and call on.

158
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.910
And then Todd stuff and uh,

159
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.260
all the other team mates there,

160
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.910
it was a lot different than when I received my medal.
So,
uh,
but it,

161
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.340
it was an honor that these young men are getting their respect that they deserve

162
00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:39.174
so much.

163
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.990
And then to bring the whole team on when I received my metal was only Tommy and

164
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.630
Tommy received his mail is only me.
So God bless 'em the navy,

165
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:50.730
they're finally getting it right.
And um,

166
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.770
honoring these great young men like my [inaudible] sore and ed buyers.

167
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.290
<v 0>Uh,
so you recently had a book come out,</v>

168
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.460
which is awesome,
and you wrote it with your fellow teammate and,

169
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.420
and fellow metal of honor winner,
Tom Norris,

170
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.650
and also with another seal Dick Couch.
And,

171
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:18.390
and the book is called by honor bound.
And you know,
for me,

172
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.570
you know,
I was talking about this before the podcast,

173
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.850
before we started recording you,
even though you want to know the,

174
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.370
get to these really good debriefs in the seal teams and you'd think that there

175
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:30.050
was a uh,

176
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.720
a fault with all these great debriefs and that explained to you everything that

177
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:37.290
happened on certain missions,
especially highly important missions,

178
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.620
you'd think that that existed,
but it actually doesn't exist.

179
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.870
And for me this book was like the,

180
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.840
the detailed debrief that I always wanted to have.
You know,

181
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:52.160
not only of the operation that you did with Tommy,
but also

182
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.570
<v 3>the one that Tommy conducted by himself and,</v>

183
00:14:55.571 --> 00:15:00.571
and both of them are just so well detailed in here and it's just a phenomenal

184
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:05.921
book to get that kind of granular detail of what you live through.

185
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.010
That,
like I said,
even being in the seal teams myself for 20 years,

186
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.480
I never had as good of an understanding at all as I have with these operations

187
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.250
now.
So thank you for writing it and you don't want to dive into it a little bit

188
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:22.460
because that's kind of what I do on this podcast is dead,
these books.

189
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.960
And so it's,
you know,
I had to jump around a little bit,

190
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:31.961
but just talking about your background and where you came from growing up in,

191
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.000
in South Carolina.
Yeah,
correct.

192
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.170
I was born and raised in the hills of South Carolina and my,
uh,

193
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.950
my father was my hero of all times.

194
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960
You only had a sixth grade education and my dad was in the Philippines from 39.

195
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.760
And you've got lift in the Philippines after MacArthur pulled out.
And,
uh,

196
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.160
he was one of the Raiders over there.
Uh,
they did a movie and,
uh,

197
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.270
I see you only had a sixth grade education,

198
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:03.950
but he was a guy that everybody respected.
He had his own company.
And,
um,

199
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.240
I used to ask guys what,
he had been worked for my father for 30 years.
You know,

200
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:12.890
you said it because he and my dad always told me this and that's what I tried to

201
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:15.380
do when I was in the team.
Should take care of your people,

202
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.210
your people will take care of you.

203
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.410
And My mother gave us love and religion and,
and uh,

204
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.950
but daddy was hard as rocks and uh,
but uh,

205
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.420
you had the greatest respect for that man and everybody else that knew my father

206
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:30.770
had the same respect for them.

207
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.900
Now you mentioned that your dad had a six get education.

208
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:36.710
Obviously he was,

209
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.790
he was a hero to you in a successful guy and was able to put things together in

210
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.720
his life and well,
did he ever talk about what he did in the pie?

211
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.020
Not until I had been wounded several times and during my second tour overseas.

212
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:54.380
And uh,
he said,
he said,
I think you'll understand this.
And I said,
Daddy,

213
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:58.250
I understood the first time I was ever a wounded.
So,
uh,
you know,

214
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.280
wounded in 1939 or wounded in 1969 or wounded and today's war,

215
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.290
I think it brings her a reality.

216
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:13.370
That war sucks where you look at it.
Yeah.

217
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.260
There's no doubt about that.

218
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.400
I guess your dad wanted you to earn being able to hear good stories from him,

219
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.080
but you got to get wounded before.

220
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:26.081
I'm going to tell you that fan more than one cause that's a hard man right now.

221
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.370
I'm going to the book a little bit.
This is you talking.

222
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.110
I didn't do that well in school.

223
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.650
I couldn't read and I still have problems with it.
I'm dyslexic.

224
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.550
Back then they didn't call it that.
You are just dumb.

225
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.860
For me it meant that I simply couldn't keep up in school.
I did okay in math,

226
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:47.240
but that was probably the only thing.
I loved history.
Otherwise I did poorly.

227
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.100
I had to repeat my sophomore in high school and

228
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.420
<v 0>that really hurt my pride,</v>

229
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.530
so it's no wonder I got in with the wrong crowd and started getting into
trouble.

230
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.731
Nothing serious,

231
00:17:56.731 --> 00:18:01.731
but we were mischievous southern country boys drinking beer and making bad

232
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.730
decisions.

233
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.440
The sheriff was out to the House a few times and there were was a time or two in

234
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:10.560
juvenile court and I caught a lot of classes.

235
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.890
I had 72 absences in my senior year in high school.
That's a,
that's a pretty,

236
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:20.600
pretty,
pretty legit record oil.
You could only miss 30.

237
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.000
<v 2>You automatically.
We failed,</v>

238
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:26.540
but I didn't think they would want them to see me coming back.
So,
uh,
uh,
you know,

239
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:30.250
uh,
to that,
the slug Shia and thank God,
uh,

240
00:18:30.251 --> 00:18:34.570
we found out what he really is and uh,
uh,

241
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.160
actually I've never even read the book.

242
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.930
My wife shred it to me five times and I'd make the changes and stuff like that.

243
00:18:40.931 --> 00:18:44.530
But I do have it on tape and if I hear something,
I understand it,

244
00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:49.300
but what I'm trying to say in that is like young men,

245
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.140
no.
Uh,
you may have it tough,

246
00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:57.130
but you can redo this fall.
I've been a successful businessman.

247
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.690
I went all the way through the ranks and I got a commission and I did this and

248
00:19:01.691 --> 00:19:04.030
I'm just trying to say there's only one.

249
00:19:04.031 --> 00:19:06.700
And that's what I tell these kids when they're going through training and
looked,

250
00:19:06.701 --> 00:19:10.390
you know,
that I was only with one person at school.
Stop you and not sure.

251
00:19:10.391 --> 00:19:14.290
So there was always to get across that obstacle,
under it,
around it.

252
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.130
I'll top of it one way or the other.
So don't let something stop you and,
uh,

253
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.590
and for you to move forward and make a better life for yourself in your family.

254
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.490
<v 0>Awesome,
awesome words right there.
Now,</v>

255
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.810
speaking of moving forward,
it is,

256
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.590
you had like the classic case.
If the judge telling you,
all right,
son,

257
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.590
you can either,
uh,
join the navy or we're going to find a,

258
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:40.770
a place that you're not going to like so much as home.
Well,

259
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:43.960
I didn't know this for 20 years later.
My father

260
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.320
<v 2>told me,
him and the juvenile judge was,
uh,</v>

261
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.090
there were friends with each other and he said,

262
00:19:49.091 --> 00:19:52.750
I'll let you make your first major decision.
You go to juvenile hall,

263
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.970
uh,
basically six months in juvenile hall,

264
00:19:57.971 --> 00:20:01.600
or I could turn around and make their first major decision in my life.

265
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:07.180
And I had saw that crazy movie,
the five Solomon Brothers during World War II.

266
00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:10.300
Then I saw the movie,
the Navy Frogman with Richard Work.

267
00:20:10.301 --> 00:20:12.670
Mark and I turned around and I said,

268
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:17.640
I've always wanted to be a UDT frogman and saluted and,
uh,
uh,

269
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.440
guide.
Uh,
the guy that,
uh,

270
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:26.010
enlisted me was a second class machinist mate and nad his name was Ned Johnson.

271
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.770
And when he retired he was back as an 89.

272
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:34.210
He was the senior enlisted for recruiting the state of South Carolina.

273
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.600
And he tells everybody he made Mike Thornton who,

274
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.700
<v 0>which today that's outstanding.</v>

275
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.010
So you come in and did you,

276
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.950
did you just went bootcamp and then straight to buds or you guys didn't have

277
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:48.190
bugs?
You guys called it trading

278
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.430
<v 3>replacement underdog on underwater demolition recruit training.</v>

279
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.540
I was supposed to go,
I was trying to go straight from there.
They said,
no,
we,

280
00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.760
you have to go to outside.
I like I say my dislike,

281
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:05.761
she was pretty bad and I had to get a 10 point waiver just to get into the teams

282
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.630
and they must have needed people pretty damn bad because I finally got my waiver

283
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.940
and I was in Hawaii and I,

284
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.810
I came back to core and auto went through training and I was thinking about,

285
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.940
you know,
going through training,
here's a,

286
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.450
here's a quote from you coming through training.

287
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.110
We had some instructors who were not only good teachers,

288
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.630
but they were real characters.
There was Vince,

289
00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:34.631
a live era who is part American Indian and a plank holder at seal team one.

290
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:40.110
He called us Pale faces and we student on fear of instructor Olivia.

291
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.160
Then there was Dick Allen,
a black seal who was the navy boxing champion.

292
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.110
He wants sparred with Mohammed Ali.

293
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.900
When Ali was asked once who hit him the hardest,

294
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.580
he said it was a chief petty officer in the,
in the u s navy named Dick Allen.

295
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.380
And then there was instructor Terry Moe,
who we called mother and boy,

296
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.050
it seemed as if he was always watching us,

297
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.260
making sure everything we did was that we put out 100% so when I was thinking

298
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:10.570
about during,
this was like when I went through,

299
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.040
I went through in 1991 and there was clearly,

300
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.630
there were some rules in place,

301
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.720
but also the instructors kind of did what they want it to and then what the

302
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:24.250
command wasn't watching him.
There's clearly,
there's more rules and oversight.

303
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.680
Now,
I,
I've seen that with my own eyes,

304
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.590
but I can't even imagine what it was like when you were going through them.

305
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.760
The instructors must've just been able to do whatever the hell they wanted to do

306
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:34.594
to you guys,

307
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.680
to events all over the most sadistic son of a bitch I've ever met in my life.

308
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.620
And I was just with Terry Moore the last two days.
Of course,

309
00:22:42.621 --> 00:22:46.690
this is reunion weekend.
Terry still looks like a,

310
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.490
as he did back then.

311
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:53.130
And Dick Allen used to hang those from the pull up bar and he'd punch you,

312
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.500
us in the stomach.
But I tell you,
if he didn't keep her hands loose,

313
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.690
I mean if you need to keep your hands loose,
he'd kill you.
And,
uh,
of course,
uh,

314
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.290
Dick and Vince and Duke both have passed and,
uh,

315
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.040
but their memories,

316
00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:11.620
and there's a funny thing about life itself,
you know,
and,
uh,

317
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.500
it's not what you've done.
This,

318
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:19.501
the respect you want to gain from the team mates and Dick and Terry and Vince

319
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:26.610
all grain gained my respect and my love and they'll all the longest might forums

320
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.490
alive in the stores will continue going on.
So that's what I,

321
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.300
that's all I want from,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

322
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.190
my peers to remember who Mike Thornton is us.

323
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.840
And that's what those guys taught me.
Yeah.
We're those guys.

324
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:46.160
One of those guys,
Vietnam vets.
Were they Korean War vets?
Both.
A

325
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.390
<v 0>little bit of everything.
Uh,
Vietnam beds.
Then there was Tommy had right.</v>

326
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.330
<v 2>Get in there too.
They used to call Tommy and I,</v>

327
00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:53.410
after I got in the teams of salt and pepper guy,

328
00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:58.290
he's great big old black guy and a stronger as one a ox.
And uh,
you know,

329
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.143
uh,

330
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.870
actually Vance was the one of the original seals in 1962.

331
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.370
And,
uh,

332
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.700
he went over to nom of course back then they didn't know what they will do with

333
00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:10.530
the seals during that period of time.

334
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.590
<v 0>So you get a,
you get done with buds and I'm going to the book here.</v>

335
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:17.810
There were 22 guys who graduated in my class,

336
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.060
18 from the original hundred and 29.

337
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.130
I remember how lucky and proud I felt as I was given orders to seal team one.

338
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.120
Even back then it was no small thing being a navy seal,

339
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:34.510
but it's one thing to be a seal and yet another to do the work of the seal.

340
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.990
I thought that was an important little highlight there of like when you get done

341
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:45.200
with buds,
it's just the beginning really correct.

342
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.770
<v 2>Just,
just you just cracked open the door.
Uh,</v>

343
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.160
then you got to go through the damn door and then after we get through the door

344
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:54.890
that you got to prove yourself and like,
like you were saying,

345
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.940
we're nobody back then,
you know,
if you hadn't had a couple of tours of Vietnam,

346
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:01.220
you were just trash as far as they were concerned.

347
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.830
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
so going to the book,
my first platoon was Charlie platoon.</v>

348
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.030
We were in country from 1969 through from December,

349
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.260
1969 through July,
1970.

350
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.370
We worked out of a place called Dong island and it was a great deployment.

351
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.570
We had solid platoon officers and our platoon patio leading petty officer was

352
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.900
Barry.
He knock one of the finest seal operators at team one.

353
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.020
When I made my first deployment,
he was my see Daddy.

354
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.820
It was the same for all of us on our first combat tour and it was an active
tour.

355
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.720
Seems like every other night we'd be out in most of the time we made contact.

356
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:40.010
I remember we took down a few province level Vietcong cadray types and one time

357
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:41.120
we had a good intelligence.

358
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:45.410
We were able to take down an entire VC grenade factory.
It was great.

359
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.470
So that was your first deployment.

360
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.040
W when you talk about Barry and Barry Knock and actually,
uh,

361
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.590
how Kook Nell talks about as well.
It says us as new guys,

362
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:57.050
even the veterans we worshiped Barry knock.

363
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.580
He was a great leader and a great teacher.

364
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.380
What was it about him that made him just,

365
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.530
that made you guys remember him and revere him so much?

366
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.570
<v 2>Like you were talking about me and you're grading an introduction,</v>

367
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.980
which I don't deserve that,
but a very,
was a leader.

368
00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:15.900
He took care of everybody and uh,
he's the guy kind of like,

369
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:17.250
I looked up to my father,

370
00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:22.251
he was my see daddy and he was always there for all of us and me and La last

371
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.300
night,
Tom boy hin and me and Wayne Hampton and might look Foz and uh,

372
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:28.980
and how Kirk and DOL,

373
00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:33.420
we're all getting a picture together and then remembering the,
the great guys.

374
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.180
And we were all,
we're talking about barrier course.
Barry.

375
00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:40.360
Phil passed away a few years ago and uh,
he,

376
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.840
he's another guy,
you know,
it's like I say,

377
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.260
he'll always be in all our conversations and um,

378
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.120
was somebody we all looked up to,
you know,
so,
uh,

379
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.430
it's the great leadership.
I mean,
he showed us,

380
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.520
and not just the leadership as a leader,

381
00:26:56.521 --> 00:27:01.150
but the leadership he showed us to try be a better person.
And,

382
00:27:01.151 --> 00:27:03.510
and that deployment,
what were you guys doing?
You guys were doing,

383
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.590
we got a point off of boats where you guys going in helicopters.

384
00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.550
You guys went on foot patrols,
a little bit of everything,

385
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:13.230
a little bit of everything.
Foot patrols,
basically.
Sam Pans a whalers.

386
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.190
By that time we finally got the Lss cs,
which were in the late.

387
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.330
And then the medium support sales support craft.
Of course we had the mighty Mo,

388
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.720
a lot of our stuff.
What was the mighty mouth?
Oh,
it was,
uh,
uh,

389
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.450
Mike Big Mike Aa and then had the,
a Uc,
it had all the,

390
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.970
the rebarb about 20 inches out.

391
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:37.950
So if he got hit by an RPG,
explode there and instead of going through the whole,

392
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.650
uh,
we did a lot of,
uh,
like I was working down that done,

393
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.490
see float with Steve Fris with the KCS has cause back then we didn't have that

394
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:51.840
many sales,
so we would help each other.
We knew if they say we need help,

395
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:56.530
we converse are people right around.
And the uh,

396
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:00.450
Tom would send,
uh,
the guys that he felt should be going.

397
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:04.530
So we'd like rich Salono and myself and a bunch of other guys would go out and

398
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:07.500
help other platoons and stuff.
And where you a 60 gunner?

399
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.350
I was a 60 out of stone or 60,

400
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.380
and I and I carried a car 15 but always carried a Swedish k with me all the

401
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:20.880
time.
And a pistol is that a backup,
backup,
backup,

402
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.610
backup,
backup.
So,
uh,
uh,
you know,

403
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.560
we have funny things,
you know,
and,
and you learn from each other.

404
00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:33.450
So it's like that,
um,
that uh,
uh,

405
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.950
when we hit that a grenade factory,
Mikey sands jumped out and he had a 16.

406
00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.490
He didn't lock down,
he didn't lock down is a hitch and is,

407
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.590
is he jumped out of the boat,
is barrel,

408
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:49.920
fell out in the water and the river and he's down there digging and he's
yelling,

409
00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:54.290
give me one of your guns.
And I said,
hell no,
I'm keeping all my guns.
Cause so,
uh,

410
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.300
you know,
we all learn.
And Mike was a great [inaudible] guy.

411
00:28:58.301 --> 00:29:01.760
He saved our ass as many times.
Uh,
but,
um,

412
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.240
everybody did their,
did their job is just a,
as you were saying while ago,

413
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:10.920
it was a team effort and my life was saved by people like it might look cause

414
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:12.810
and other people in my platoon.

415
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.000
And we backed each other up all the time and,
and that was a super active,

416
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.470
um,
actually how,

417
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.150
how Kurkendahl it was talking about you here in the book.
This is how talking,

418
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.010
I can remember more than one firefight where we were shooting and ducking,

419
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:30.720
sometimes more ducking than shooting,

420
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.370
but Mike would be right there working that 60 with a big grin on his face.

421
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.040
There were plenty of times when I was really scared,

422
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:42.280
but I'm not sure Mike ever was.
He was reliable and brave,

423
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.700
<v 0>but I'm not sure he ever knew or understood fear.
Like the rest of us,</v>

424
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.970
he was a great teammate and my God,
he was strong.

425
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.730
None of us could believe how much ammo he carried.

426
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.560
Sometimes he'd go out with a thousand rounds or more that's close to 80 pounds

427
00:29:56.561 --> 00:30:00.130
of just ammo and he'd swim canals with that load.

428
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.810
He'd just shrug and say,
you don't want your 60 gunner to run out of Ammo,
do you?

429
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:10.090
We got through a pretty active deployment with no one getting killed.

430
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:15.250
Then a couple of guys stayed behind to break in the new platoon while the rest

431
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.600
of us packed up and left.

432
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.520
They were two of our best and one of them was killed in a Hilo crash with three

433
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:25.720
other seals.
We took it hard when rich Solano was killed.

434
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.580
But I think Mike took it the hardest.

435
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.210
Mike was a guy who really cared for his teammates.

436
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.170
So even with all that action,
you guys,

437
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.650
when you guys went through the deployment with,
you know,
what did you take?

438
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:43.510
A few wounded guys,
but he got killed

439
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.760
<v 2>but nobody was killed.
And actually we were,</v>

440
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:50.761
I was down at you float and rich Solano was working with the Gulf platoon,

441
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:55.770
I think.
And then that was when the helicopter and went down.
And,
uh,

442
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.330
of course when you come off a hot Lz,

443
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:01.690
you're supposed to shut down your aircraft and check the rotor blades because

444
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.000
back then the rotor blades could have a whole,

445
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:09.000
and it could last for 30 minutes or 45 or an hour.
And,
uh,
the,

446
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.470
uh,
the,
the,

447
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.790
the pile of the Hilo wanted to get back for a birthday party or something.

448
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:21.250
And,
uh,
the Hilo Fountain and actually rich was killed and,
uh,
uh,

449
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.170
Deralin was killed and Toby Thomas was killed.
Uh,

450
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.310
um,
uh,
who else was there?

451
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.300
Gardner was killed.
So that was one of our biggest,

452
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:39.190
we lost five guys that do not four,
we lost five.
And I went down and,

453
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:43.630
uh,
and identified the bodies and,
uh,
it was,

454
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.780
you know,

455
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.850
I've only had one bad dream of my whole life and it was after identifying that

456
00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:52.780
cause rich whole face was completely gone.
And the only way I could identify me,

457
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:56.410
he had a scar on his arm.
And,
uh,
but you know,

458
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.410
a loss of any team mate is,
you know,

459
00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:04.100
as well as I do like Mikey and uh,
and every time,
you know,

460
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.670
every time I lose a,
even a new kid today,

461
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:09.910
which I've been out speaking to their class and stuff like that,

462
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:11.740
you lose a little bit more your heart.

463
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.760
I don't know how much more of my heart I got to lose,
but,
uh,
it,

464
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.470
it takes it out of it.
I mean it a,

465
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.960
I don't want to see anybody ever get hurt or especially a loss of a loved one.

466
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.420
And they're all there.
The,

467
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.910
their lives are just as important to me with the new kids today has rich and all

468
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:33.520
those guys were in port to me back then.

469
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.593
<v 0>You,</v>

470
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:41.210
you come home from that deployment and you go into a seal team,

471
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:47.150
one cadre,
which we actually have talked about on here with Roger Hayden.

472
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:51.560
Cause we still,
we,
when I was,
uh,
uh,
at seal team one and I was in training sale,

473
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.100
we still called it cadray and that was,
I don't know,
20 something years later.

474
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.260
And I never even made the connection.
And,

475
00:32:58.261 --> 00:33:00.710
and Roger and I talked about the fact that,
you know,

476
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:04.880
some of the training that you guys implemented back there,
the,
the uh,

477
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.030
the point man course where you're walking through and the trip wires are there

478
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:12.950
and all that.
We still did that.
A lot of the demo we still did.
Um,
and,

479
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.920
and so that's what,
that's what you did when you got home.

480
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.690
You went into that training cell being Kadri and teaching.
And you know,

481
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.360
you mentioned here that you learned a lot being an instructor.
And I always,

482
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.290
I always agree with that.
In fact,
when,
when I was in the seal teams,

483
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.850
no one wanted to go to the training department,
right?

484
00:33:28.851 --> 00:33:30.970
We all want it to just deploy,
just employed,
just deploy.

485
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.480
So when I took over the training,
I always told guys,
look,
if you want to be,

486
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:40.380
you know,
if you want to master what you do,
you got to go and teach it.
And,
um,

487
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.650
you also mentioned Al Huey in here.
And when I went through buds,

488
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.850
when we were at San Clemente island,
every night when the sun goes down,

489
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:54.050
we'd sing the song.
Good night owl,
Huey,
good night out.
Huey,
good night owl,
Huey,

490
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:55.070
wherever you may be.

491
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.510
And I never knew and still don't know who Al Huey is.

492
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.990
Well I'll you then the camp has called out here.
It's called camp out.

493
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:06.770
Huey out there.
And,
and honestly,
I make my kids sing this song.

494
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:12.050
We don't have sun goes down.
Uh,
my,
me and my kids,
we,
we sing this song.

495
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.750
<v 2>Well,
I'm sure you've heard of the day shy,
a commodore Shively and uh,</v>

496
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.200
Al and uh,

497
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.480
and Dave were best of friends and Al was a,

498
00:34:22.481 --> 00:34:25.850
another mentor like Barry,
not to me.
And uh,

499
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:30.640
they went through class two of Udt back in the fifties and there were all in

500
00:34:30.641 --> 00:34:35.020
Korea and stuff.
And uh,
he led by example again,
you know,

501
00:34:35.021 --> 00:34:38.920
but I mean,
it's kind of like a,
when he talks better be like,

502
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.070
ef Hutton better be listening,
keeping your ears wide open.

503
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:45.580
And just as I'm out told me one day,
he says,
you know,

504
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.940
good Lord gave you one mile,
two ears and two eyes.

505
00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:53.920
So you use 80% of that and the other one is shut for a 20% it would be all
right.

506
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.860
And then you,
you

507
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.210
<v 0>from cadre,
you had a chance,
you went back and deployed again.</v>

508
00:35:01.211 --> 00:35:03.750
But you went to Thailand and teaching the Thai seals.

509
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.930
<v 2>We took the train,
the tie sales.
I was along with,
uh,</v>

510
00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.180
Dick Flanagan and one of the finest officers as Tom boy hand was great officers,

511
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.600
great leader and hours with us on that.
And that's the reason why Alan are,

512
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:19.790
we're so close.
And we trained the,
uh,

513
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.430
Udt into seal team tactics and then they went up in the work off the borders.

514
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.650
So that's all I can say about that.

515
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.840
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and understood.</v>

516
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:33.870
And then you got home from that and now it looked like the war in Vietnam was

517
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:37.200
kind of winding down and there weren't full seal platoons deploying anymore.

518
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.430
No more.
So petunias

519
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.640
<v 2>on the,
basically what we're doing over,
uh,
we were sending,
uh,</v>

520
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.860
enlisted LDN and advisers and uh,
like a,

521
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:50.960
a bunch of the guys that over over there with me on that tour was a,

522
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.660
it was at the reunion and uh,
yes,

523
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.180
it's kind of funny to get together and talk with all of them,
you know,

524
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:59.070
and talk about,
uh,

525
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:03.990
but we've lost a lot of those guys which have passed in through age or cancer or

526
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:08.580
something.
And you know,
it's one great thing about the reunion,
you know,

527
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:10.200
none of us are getting any damn younger,

528
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:13.560
so you better get out and sees your shipmates anytime you get a chance.
So,

529
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.730
<v 0>Eh,
um,</v>

530
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.280
the LDN n you mentioned and just to everyone knows what that,

531
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.010
that those are like Vietnamese,
South Phoenix,

532
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.933
<v 2>he seals,</v>

533
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.970
seals and the LD nuisance for Louie and die is what it actually in Vietnamese.

534
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.130
I mean like a warrior from the sea or something like that.
Yep,
Yep.

535
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.520
<v 0>Uh,
so you get a chance to go back again.</v>

536
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.750
And this is funny because typical seal,
you know,
it's like,
oh,

537
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.930
we need you to go back on deployment again.
Yes,
I'll go send me.

538
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.000
Uh,
I'm going back to the book.
So when I got to Vietnam this time,

539
00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:53.530
I spent close to a week at Nha Trang working with the LD and ends.

540
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:57.250
They're getting a feel for the,
what they were doing in the field.

541
00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.620
I'd work with the Vietnamese seals on my first tour back in 1969 s and I saw a

542
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:06.730
few familiar faces.
You have to hand it to those guys.

543
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.970
For them.
There were no combat rotations.

544
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.890
Life was combat 24,
seven year in,
year out.

545
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:20.670
They fought until they were killed or as it worked out in the end we lost the

546
00:37:21.101 --> 00:37:24.760
war.
So those are the guys you're working with.

547
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.370
And um,
I think it's,
I mean,

548
00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.200
you get into the relationship that you formed with these guys,
which was,

549
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.700
you know,
they were all their brothers.

550
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.640
<v 2>Yup.
There were that.
You took care of them,
they took care of you.</v>

551
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:41.140
And of course the reason I to fill that time in our still love to do is cause of

552
00:37:41.141 --> 00:37:43.810
Dane and Quan,
which I explained in the book.
They were,

553
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.400
I'd worked with him on previous chores and many operations and uh,

554
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.030
there were there,
there's just like one of us.
I mean they took care of me.

555
00:37:52.031 --> 00:37:54.250
So that's the reason I handpicked those two guys.

556
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.240
<v 0>Yang and Quan.
Those were those guys that you had worked with before.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

557
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.990
Vietnamese seals and so you get to a two.
We non,

558
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:07.440
am I saying that right?
29 asks for on.
Okay.
So you get to,
to lean on,

559
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:09.750
this is where you're going to be working out of,
and again,

560
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:12.840
you're not in a seal platoon.
This is a totally different situation.

561
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.760
And what you had there in to lean on,
if I gathered it all correctly,

562
00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:21.761
he had five enlisted seals from seal team one and then you had to seal team two

563
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:27.780
officers and in plus with those to seal team two officers who were,

564
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.900
it sounded like they were more junior guys.
Maybe it was our first deployment,

565
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.010
but then Tommy Norris showed up as well as,
oh,
I

566
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.750
<v 3>see.
Yeah.
Uh,
Shively captain shot,
Commodore Shot.
We had all the seals.
UDT,</v>

567
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.584
ELD

568
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.840
<v 2>divers,
everybody.</v>

569
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.160
And then Tommy Nelson was our lieutenant commander in an o three,

570
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:49.350
and he was the head of all the sills.

571
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.880
Tommy was the senior seal operator and country.

572
00:38:53.881 --> 00:38:58.590
Then we had Ryan Combi and a another lieutenant.
It was there.

573
00:38:58.591 --> 00:39:02.940
Then there were all,
they were all east coast guys.
We had

574
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.790
<v 3>actually,
I think we had,
um,
more like,
um,</v>

575
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.033
<v 1>okay,</v>

576
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.510
<v 2>18 enlisted guy.
And then we,
and we broke it up.</v>

577
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.170
Uh,
uh,
and,
uh,
Gary,

578
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:23.650
Gary Chamberlain and Harry Connick Cola went with a lieutenant youth down one

579
00:39:25.941 --> 00:39:30.770
thing.
Then Ryan McCarthy was our boss and I stayed up.
So,
uh,

580
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.830
everybody had had many tours that went down south and I had the most tours and I

581
00:39:38.271 --> 00:39:41.810
stayed up north,
uh,
with a Ryan McCombie.

582
00:39:41.811 --> 00:39:45.680
Then Tommy would go back and forth,
uh,
to run the operations.

583
00:39:45.681 --> 00:39:50.210
Of course it was hard to get a aos approved because,
uh,
you know,

584
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.100
it was pretty,
at that time we were fighting.

585
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:54.590
And Quan tree and waste city and all that stuff.

586
00:39:54.591 --> 00:39:57.590
And they were trying to overtake it,
but we're still,

587
00:39:57.591 --> 00:39:58.700
we're able to get our opposite.

588
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.660
<v 3>And um,
you had what,</v>

589
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:08.140
two squads of LDN and what made up a squad of LDN?
Uh,

590
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.410
approximately I think we had a,

591
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.750
we had more LDNs and we did,
but we separated those guys too.
Uh,

592
00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:20.070
I know when we went on the operation,
uh,
woody was,

593
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:24.000
we always had a seal as you know,
on an insertion extraction craft.
And Woody had,

594
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:28.110
uh,
uh,
we only had three El Nino was on the with us,

595
00:40:28.111 --> 00:40:32.190
but he had another six or eight on,
on the boat,
the boat,

596
00:40:32.191 --> 00:40:35.630
if we knew this recent blog or something.
So,
and,
and,

597
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.770
and I got to mention this because again,

598
00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:42.771
it's half the book of by honor bound is we've been throwing Tommy Norris,

599
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:46.830
his name around here.
And when he showed up to work with you guys,

600
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.820
he had been in country for some period of time and he had done this,

601
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.660
this multiple pilot rescue operations,

602
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.880
the bat 21 mission.
And Tommy was,
uh,
uh,

603
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.650
will say that I knew about his reputation and he knew about my reputation.

604
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.900
And,
uh,
it was kinda funny.

605
00:41:06.901 --> 00:41:10.140
Tommy and I only operated one time and that was an operation,

606
00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:13.270
but we were of course,
still best of friends.
And,

607
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:18.260
<v 2>uh,
uh,
I know when,
uh,
we,
uh,
resubmitted,</v>

608
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.370
Tommy was putting in for a muddle and it was resubmitted.
Uh,

609
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.420
and then he was upgraded to the medal of honor later on and a greatest friend in

610
00:41:27.421 --> 00:41:29.410
any man could ever ask for.
And,
uh,

611
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.670
I look back on the officers at the leadership we had on,
like I was saying,

612
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:38.660
Tom boy hen and captain Shively and,
and Tommy and,
and,
uh,

613
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:42.170
Ryan McCombie and,
and then norm Carly.
And,
um,
you know,

614
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:46.640
even when we were in six with Marcinko and stuff like that,
it was,
um,
uh,

615
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.530
we had some great leaders,
you know,
and all those guys took care of their people.

616
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.090
That's what I really looked up to them for,

617
00:41:55.091 --> 00:41:59.660
for always being there for the troops.
You know,
they may chew your ass out,

618
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:03.770
but nobody else is going to.
Now,

619
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.610
<v 0>once Tommy shows up,
they,
uh,
you get the,</v>

620
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:10.760
started getting the mission tasking for this mission and that becomes,
you know,

621
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.590
the mission and the Paris peace talks were going on.

622
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.880
But you know,
Tom,

623
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.820
Tom was saying that there's no at the operational level that you guys are like,

624
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:22.760
oh,
that's great,
but it's not changing anything for us on the ground.
Meanwhile,

625
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:26.450
they're,
you know,
they're,
they're attacking way city and,
uh,

626
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.060
it's just hard.

627
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:33.350
And so Tom goes down,
he gets called down by,
uh,

628
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.800
by the commodore Schively Schively too,

629
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.820
to get a mission tasking.
And this is,
this is,
uh,

630
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:45.380
Tom Norris talking.
Uncle Dave had me take a seat in his office.
That's what,

631
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:46.740
that's what you guys called the commodore.

632
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.280
I never called any of my commodore as an uncle,
at least not to their faces.
Uh,

633
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.400
uncle Dave had me take a seat in his office and I could tell he had something on

634
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:57.080
his mind.
Tom,

635
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:01.310
he said the Vietnamese commander of the LDN wants to run a seal reconnaissance

636
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:05.390
mission to the mouth of the fallen tree.

637
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.460
Quan Viet River.
Is that right?
Quan tree.
Quan Tree River specifically,

638
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.290
he and his superiors want to know about the defenses and enemy disposition

639
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:20.291
around Quan tree naval base and he wants a Vietnamese LDN n officer to head up

640
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:23.030
the reconnaissance team.

641
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.500
I want you to run the operation to ensure the mission gets done properly.

642
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.610
But this needs to be seen as a Vietnamese operation.
So that was the task.
Do it.

643
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.040
Doing a reconnaissance.
Correct.
Pretty normal operation.
I'm,
it's pretty standard.

644
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:40.340
It sounds like you guys were running those type of operations fairly regularly.

645
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.240
Basically.
The NVA had already moved across the quad via at river.

646
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.470
<v 2>So that was a new,</v>

647
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:50.471
we knew that and we knew and they were trying to take over Quan tree again and

648
00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:53.420
uh,
and they attacked on waste city.

649
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:57.230
That was in April and this was an October when this thing was going down.

650
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:01.940
So we knew it was hot and heavy up there.
But,
uh,
uh,
Tommy said yes.
You know,

651
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:03.650
you never said no to uncle Dave

652
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.100
<v 0>and,
and so you guys decided or,
or,
or Tom,
you know,
lets you know,
hey,</v>

653
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:13.300
let's do a small,
a small group.
You're going to take five guys,
correct.

654
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.100
To Americans and three Vietnamese seals,
right?

655
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.290
Obviously the two are you and Tom Norris and then the three,

656
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.940
the three guys that you're going to take with you,

657
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:24.950
the three Vietnamese that you're going to take with you,

658
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.110
a w two of them were your hand selected guys.
Right.

659
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.190
And then there is another officer,

660
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.340
<v 3>the other guy was an officer,
right,
right.
Correct.
And he was lieutenant,</v>

661
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:38.280
I've heard you tell the story in here.
Uh,

662
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.930
he's called Lieutenant Twan.
Yeah,
we,
you always call him ty.
Well,
yeah,

663
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:45.120
but we put a different name in their book calls.

664
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.980
He kind of made the operation go south.
Got It.
Got It.

665
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.940
Uh,
so here's the basic concept of operations.

666
00:44:55.941 --> 00:44:58.830
Low.
Really,
the funny part of it,
Tommy said,

667
00:44:58.831 --> 00:45:03.540
I'll do the mission if you let me choose who I wanted to take back then we had a

668
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.800
rotation basically where everybody,

669
00:45:05.801 --> 00:45:09.720
you get a chance to go on the field and with always went in the field with the

670
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:13.260
new guys and stuff.
And,
and uh,
he said,

671
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:17.670
I'd like to make a choice.
And Uncle Dave said,
well bitch,
I know who it is.

672
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:21.060
And he said,
Oh,
we've never operated together.
And he said,

673
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:24.180
I bet just Mike Thornton.
And you said,
uh,
yes sir.

674
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:26.370
That's who I want to take with me on an operation.

675
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:31.200
And actually woody was supposed to be going in on that operation.
And uh,

676
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.440
but we took,
what do you own?
The,
uh,
you know,
search and extraction,
uh,

677
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.230
a means of transportation.
And that's,
that's,
that's bill Woodruff.
Woodruff,

678
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:44.780
who you talking about.
Yeah.
And we'll,
we'll get into what his role was.
Um,

679
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.260
here's the,
here's the overview of the mission.
And this is,

680
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:53.040
this is Tom Norris talking to is not a particularly difficult mission and it was

681
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.490
certainly something we'd done before.
So we knew the drill in general.

682
00:45:56.491 --> 00:46:00.590
It was about a 50 mile transit from Toohey non up there.

683
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:05.040
Could we vet river in our boats with a max speed of about eight knots?

684
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.980
That was a little more than six hours.

685
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:09.420
So you're talking about a six hour transit.

686
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.420
The plan was to get well out to sea so no one on the beach could know which

687
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:16.050
direction we were heading north or south.
Once we turned in this case north,

688
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.740
we'd make our way up the coast,
then turn West back into shore.

689
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.640
Then we hope to be on station off the southern bank of the coup Yvette River as

690
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.590
soon as possible after dark.

691
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.160
We then leave the junks and paddle in close to shore and rubber boats and then

692
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:39.360
swim the last swim ashore from the rubber boats.
We'd insert,

693
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:41.580
do our job and get out before first light.

694
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.000
We didn't have to be back at two he non before first light,

695
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:48.180
but we sure as heck want to be back across the beach and away from the coast.

696
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:49.240
Before sunup.

697
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.080
I was told I'd have offshore navy support in the way of two destroyers.

698
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.210
So if we're running a little late in getting out of there,

699
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.370
I'd have some friendly on call,
fire support.

700
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.860
So that's a real standard mission that,
you know,
when I first got the team one,

701
00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:08.010
we did that,
not,
not the exact same thing and not real,

702
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.710
but we trained it all the time.
You're going to get on,
you know,

703
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.740
mark fives and you're going to have your Zodiacs on there.

704
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:15.810
Then you're going to get a little closer to the beach in which you get close to

705
00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:17.590
the beats,
you drop off the Zodiacs,
then you get,

706
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.720
get a little bit close to the beach,

707
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:20.960
and then the last thing you do is get out the boats to women.

708
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.200
You go to your operation.
So kind of standard stuff and you know,

709
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:29.890
he says it's not something you hadn't done before.
Correct.
Um,

710
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.950
<v 0>here's what you were talking about with when you're talking about the LDN ends,</v>

711
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.420
going back to the book,

712
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:41.980
the Ldn ens came in all varieties of experience and capability and courage on

713
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:44.140
this operation.
We had three very good ones.

714
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:49.350
Lieutenant Quan was a first rate LDN and officer and Dang and Quan this other

715
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:52.290
quantities and enlisted to Ella Ldn,

716
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.830
no relation where two guys I'd worked with on my first tour and was with them

717
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:00.580
again in two e Non Dang and Quan,
we're good to go.

718
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.040
But the problem was quality officer
Quan was hurt.

719
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.660
And that's the reason.
Yeah.
The problem was that Lieutenant,

720
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.170
Lieutenant Quan,
he liked to get after a little bit,
sometimes oil,

721
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:15.100
those Tulloch all of us.

722
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.120
<v 2>So yeah,
maybe had too much to drink the night before.</v>

723
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.550
<v 0>And so what do you get now?
Some kind of accident or what happened?</v>

724
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:27.560
<v 2>It was Rodney in a whaler ran into the pier.</v>

725
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:32.440
He hit his head and they busted both his eyes and he could,

726
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.340
he see he's,
they're both completely shut.
So,
uh,

727
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.860
this is how we got the other do officer,
which I have never worked with.
But uh,

728
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:45.020
but I had worked many tours.
I mean,
not many tours,
but many operations would.

729
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.530
The other two guys and I'd worked with Quan and he was really good,

730
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.150
but of course he was unable to make the obs so they,
uh,

731
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.060
we brought in another younger officer,
which I'd never operated with.

732
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.040
<v 0>And this other,
just so everyone knows we're going through this.</v>

733
00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:02.460
The other officer that you now brought on that you hadn't worked with before,

734
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.930
his name was lieutenant won.
Is that,
am I saying that right?
No,

735
00:49:06.931 --> 00:49:08.340
but I'm not going to give you the real name.

736
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.220
Got The Vietnamese speaker and here tighten me up.
Uh,

737
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.530
so you had the,

738
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.860
the navy was out to see the two things that navy was supposed to help you with

739
00:49:19.861 --> 00:49:24.390
was helping you guys do navigation because in this time,
no gps,

740
00:49:24.391 --> 00:49:29.391
it's so easy now I'm embarrassed by how you see this and obviously fire support

741
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.300
if you need it.

742
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.880
<v 2>Yep.
Basically what they're supposed to do,
his Vectra of saying,</v>

743
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:39.820
and that's where each ship takes her radar plonge and they shoot it in and they

744
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:44.180
see where we are in the junks,
uh,
which are,
uh,

745
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:48.580
39 foot concrete chunks is what the,
uh,
and uh,

746
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.910
then they would see where we were then they'd shoot us an asthma and then we

747
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:54.930
would take our compas and we'd go in there.
Uh,

748
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:59.500
one of the ships shooting is there were trying to overtake Quan tree again and

749
00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:03.850
he left and went down south to help give gunfire support,

750
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.770
uh,
to,
uh,

751
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:10.660
to help the Vietnamese army and Marine Corps to hold off the Nva.

752
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.210
And,
uh,
when that,
the one guy shot the asthma and he was about three degrees off,

753
00:50:16.211 --> 00:50:21.010
but when you're 15 miles off the beach,
three degrees is a lot.
Yeah.

754
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.040
And,
uh,
everybody said,
uh,

755
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.700
the CEO said that's the river rock.
It actually,
it the Ben Hai River,

756
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:30.500
which was actually in north Vietnam.

757
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.730
So when we went and inserted we're way north of the coffee yet.

758
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.530
<v 0>Now you had talked about,
uh,
Bill Woodriff,
woody,</v>

759
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.890
you're referring to them as at an important point here.

760
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.300
And this is something we always try to hold true to.
Uh,

761
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.600
you won't always put like a seal with your assets if you can manage it.

762
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.250
So you got to seal out there on the boats that are going to be recovering you

763
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.970
because it's a guy that,
you know,
it's a guy that you trust and you know,

764
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.920
he's not gonna leave you hanging in the room who saying and this,
right?
And,
uh,

765
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.420
you know,
that's a good lesson learned for anybody doing operations right now.

766
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:06.650
I don't care what unit you're with,

767
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:08.660
if you're in the marine corps and you're using the army acid,

768
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.790
try and put a liaison officer with the army.

769
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:12.500
If you're in the army and you're using a marine corps acid,

770
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:13.790
try and put a liaison officer.

771
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.000
Same thing with special operations because those are the guys that speak your

772
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:17.481
language.

773
00:51:17.481 --> 00:51:20.300
They're going to be able to predict what you're going to do if things are going

774
00:51:20.301 --> 00:51:25.190
sideways.
It's just a,
it's just a smart move to do.
Um,
and then,

775
00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:28.650
you know,
you talked about how these things started going wrong and you're,

776
00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:33.290
you're off the coast and instead of being,
uh,
where you thought you were,

777
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:37.070
you're at the Ben Hai River,
which is basically right

778
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:41.970
<v 2>south of the bend high.
So we,
and Tommy and I had discussed it and,
uh,</v>

779
00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:46.440
he said,
well,
go ahead and go in.
We'll do what we call a horseshoe ought,

780
00:51:46.441 --> 00:51:51.360
will go in so many clicks and go north and then go back to the Spec to the ocean

781
00:51:51.361 --> 00:51:55.620
and,
and try to,
if we can pick up,
uh,
you know,

782
00:51:56.190 --> 00:52:00.600
if we could do it,
we were doing a body snatch to,
of course by a body stance.

783
00:52:00.601 --> 00:52:02.790
You get your best intelligence that way.
So,

784
00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.360
<v 0>and we used to do direct action missions to go capture bad guys,</v>

785
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.140
but we didn't call them body snatches.
And I'm kind of wishing we did.

786
00:52:13.141 --> 00:52:15.480
It sounds a lot better than to body snatch.

787
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:20.910
Maybe I should have named those bodies snatching operations.

788
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:24.210
I would have found it felt a lot better about it.
Uh,
so,
and,

789
00:52:24.211 --> 00:52:28.770
and tactically you're going in,
it's pretty normal.

790
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.180
Um,
you swimming,
it's pretty normal.
You get on the beach.

791
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.550
And here we go.
Back to the book.
This is you talking.

792
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.070
I was carrying the starlight scope,

793
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.810
a bulky first generation night vision device that allowed you to see relatively

794
00:52:42.811 --> 00:52:46.350
well at night.
It was a size of a loaf of bread and weighed eight pounds.

795
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.220
Tommy told me to scout the beach area to see if I could find any of the features

796
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:53.160
we were looking for or expecting to find like the mouth of the river.

797
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.580
I went north about 200 yards from our position and the same distance to the

798
00:52:56.581 --> 00:52:57.210
south.

799
00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:00.570
And with the starlight scope I could see a good ways up and down the beach,

800
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.380
no river mouth and nothing looked familiar.
Tommy moved inland,

801
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.410
just a short distance to look the area over with his binoculars.

802
00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:11.820
Neither of us saw anything that indicated we were supposed to be.

803
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:15.390
So,
and then like you said,
you,
you know,
you're in the wrong space,

804
00:53:15.391 --> 00:53:18.390
but you might as well do an reconnaissance while you're there.

805
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.950
And that's kind of the,
the decision that's made.
Um,

806
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.320
and I was thinking about this too,
so I was,
you guys only have five guys and the,

807
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.700
the idea behind that must've been,
hey,

808
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:32.040
let's travel light and we can maneuver really quick.

809
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.640
And then I got to this list of what you were carrying.
Here's what Mike was.

810
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.290
Karen Mike Talking.
I was the mule on a recon patrol.
I carried a car,

811
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:45.000
15 car being and just over 800 rounds of five,
five,

812
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:49.470
six ammunition along with an assortment of a dozen fragmentation,

813
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.420
cs and smoke grenades.

814
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.690
I also had three La rockets and a starlight scope.

815
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.810
All of us carried a medical kit and inflatable Udt over the head life vest.

816
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.280
I also had our silence to weapon,

817
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.880
a 22 caliber automatic pistol with a suppressor attached to the barrel.

818
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.870
We called it a hush puppy.
So not exactly light for,

819
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.880
for regattas.
It's a movement.

820
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:15.900
I was thinking you guys would try and stay all slick,
but that's,
that's no joke.

821
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:16.734
What you are carrying

822
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.600
now as your patrol and you start seeing fires and eventually you see movement,

823
00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:28.500
you see bunkers and,
and Tom,
he says,
I think it's about time.

824
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:33.180
We get the heck Outta here.
You say Roger,
that sir,
it's about zero 300.

825
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:38.181
You got about three hours of darkness left and you get into a stream and start

826
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:41.310
moving towards the beach.

827
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:46.380
<v 2>Well,
for three different reasons.
One that could show low cell silhouette.
Uh,</v>

828
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:50.140
we knew that we were within a battalion of Nva at that period of time.

829
00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.030
Then we saw tanks and guns and gun in placement.

830
00:54:53.031 --> 00:54:57.700
So we knew that we were way north of where we were supposed to be.

831
00:54:57.701 --> 00:55:00.780
So,
uh,
by getting in the stream,

832
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:05.260
the tide ranges 18 feet over there.
So the current was running out,

833
00:55:05.261 --> 00:55:07.180
so we knew it was going out to the ocean.

834
00:55:07.181 --> 00:55:12.100
So we got in there by keeping our low silhouette and there we can move a lot

835
00:55:12.101 --> 00:55:16.660
faster in the water.
And,
uh,
hopefully,

836
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:20.710
uh,
we would bump into any of the enemy out there,

837
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:24.880
which we're starting to move around at that time in the morning.
So,

838
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:27.443
<v 0>um,</v>

839
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.920
now you start hearing something correct

840
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.490
and you know,

841
00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:39.320
you hope the patrol and you see what you see is,
uh,

842
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.540
NVA soldiers,
a bunch of them.

843
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:47.400
It's like an encampment of NVC,
NVA soldiers.
And they,

844
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.440
and,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

845
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:53.220
but from what their position and where you had moved to in the stream,

846
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.490
now you're looking at them and,
and as you move to the water,

847
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.800
you're going to be exposed.
Is that,
is that the situation?

848
00:55:59.090 --> 00:55:59.211
<v 2>Well,</v>

849
00:55:59.211 --> 00:56:03.200
actually there were in a base camp type deal and it was a quick reaction force.

850
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.200
The main forces behind us,
uh,
of course says,
uh,

851
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:12.920
that exposed us kinda cut off our southern route.

852
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.520
So to the north of us,
which we knew were going farther north,

853
00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:19.700
there was that big lagoon is a,
as the map show.

854
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.700
And so we would have,
uh,
to our,
uh,
eastern flank,

855
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:29.050
we had the ocean to the western flank.
We had the,
uh,
uh,

856
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:33.580
the lagoon and then to the south we had the bad guys that we knew of.

857
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.300
And to the north,
we had some sand dunes and uh,

858
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.280
but we could see after you pass this one big bunker,

859
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.850
you could see nothing but flat beach.
So we figured that'd be our best,
uh,

860
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.050
objective to move up there.
And Tommy got on top of this,

861
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.180
we thought it was a big sand dune,
but actually it was a,
as a,

862
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.750
as a bunker built and actually had tunnels down inside of it.
So,

863
00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.310
<v 3>and that's the one that you did a recon and you found that bunker the bunker and</v>

864
00:57:01.311 --> 00:57:05.210
brought Tommy there.
Tommy went up there with the radio on,
which was Dang.

865
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:06.410
And that gave us,
you know,

866
00:57:06.411 --> 00:57:11.270
of course back then it was the radios for PRC 77.
His line of sight,

867
00:57:11.271 --> 00:57:14.480
which you,
uh,
so yeah.
Yeah.

868
00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:19.570
And he's trying to make coms back to a woody or back to the ship.

869
00:57:20.211 --> 00:57:24.500
Back then she has needed,
the shit was a Newport and using the USS Morgan,

870
00:57:24.501 --> 00:57:28.610
that's what those ships were.
Then we had,
we finally got woody,

871
00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:31.790
but woody was done off the mouth of the quality yet he thought,
you know,

872
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:35.840
after he got their bearings.
So there are a long ways off from where we were.

873
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.670
So at this point,
Quan,
you guys are,

874
00:57:40.671 --> 00:57:44.240
you guys were in that bunker and Quan comes from and back and he says die way

875
00:57:44.241 --> 00:57:47.360
Norris with a starlight scope.

876
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.150
I see two men coming down the beach.
They're quite a way off,

877
00:57:50.151 --> 00:57:54.880
but they're heading our way.
So then you,

878
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:57.470
you seem like you come up with a plan right there of what you're going to do.

879
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.150
Yeah.
Which to me,
I'm like thinking,
well I'll let you brief what your plan was,

880
00:58:02.151 --> 00:58:06.320
but you see two bad guys coming down the beach and your idea is cool.

881
00:58:06.321 --> 00:58:07.910
It's time to do our body snatch.

882
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.150
<v 2>Correct.
And I figured,
uh,
uh,</v>

883
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.460
the officer,
which name is mentioned,
he was,

884
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:21.870
he was a good side.
He's like five,
nine [inaudible] a strong,

885
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.250
I mean that's what it guy,
right?

886
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:28.330
<v 3>So this is the other Vietnamese or the Vietnamese officer?
Officer Guy,
yeah.
Yeah.</v>

887
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.930
<v 2>So I put him down on the beach because the,
uh,</v>

888
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.820
the high water line and these guys were walking up and down the high water line

889
00:58:36.821 --> 00:58:40.750
and the other guy was about a hundred,
150,

890
00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:43.620
a hundred yards ahead of the guy calls.

891
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.320
The other guy was walking up in the sand dunes and I figured we've got to make

892
00:58:47.321 --> 00:58:50.890
sure we not Kim out let the other guys just walking by because he's just

893
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:55.660
tootling down the low,
uh,
the coastline looking around.

894
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.240
And uh,
so I said,

895
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.160
I sent Quan Down with the hush puppy and not Quan,

896
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:07.360
but uh,
the officer and I sent him down and I said,

897
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.810
I'm on just guys go walk by us.
But when the other guy,

898
00:59:10.811 --> 00:59:15.811
I'll take him out and then I had Quan there with me and Quan after I knocked him

899
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:21.680
out cold and when the Quan got him,
he takes him up and,
and a secured him.

900
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.490
<v 3>Since you guys are the two enemy are walking down the beach had a pretty good</v>

901
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:29.240
distance apart or you say,
okay,
I'm going to get me and Quan,

902
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:34.241
we'll go get this guy will capture him and then lieutenant or this Vietnamese

903
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:37.100
lieutenant you go and get this other guy.
Correct.
And you do,

904
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:41.570
you said kill him right now.
I said if you could take him,
take him to,
okay,

905
00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.360
got it.
But he's right on the shoreline.

906
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:48.410
So the waves are breaking those making a lot of turbulence and noise and the,

907
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.720
and the other guys up in the sand dunes,

908
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:53.420
he's at the high water log of walking around looking like that.

909
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:55.910
So I knew he would be the last one there,

910
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:58.880
but we had to make sure we took him out for sure.
Right.

911
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:03.970
And then I told the officer he could go up and take this guy out or eliminate

912
01:00:05.571 --> 01:00:09.110
him or just make sure he didn't go back to the village calls

913
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:14.220
<v 2>villages on down the beach.
And,
uh,
he,</v>

914
01:00:14.221 --> 01:00:18.840
uh,
he stood up,
you know,
lie day,
Mile Lynn and Vietnamese.
I mean,
stop,
come here,

915
01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:23.760
he's got an AK 47,
uh,
the bad guy does,
he's got a,

916
01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:29.220
you know,
a 22 long hush puppy,
which is about from here across this room.

917
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.900
And,
uh,
you know,
he's out there like that.
And then the guy opened,
fired on him.

918
01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:38.040
He's running back towards Tommy and me and I'm running past him because I know

919
01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:42.780
he's on his way to the village.
And as I say in the book,
you know,
they were,

920
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:47.210
they didn't have radios like everybody did.
So what sometimes they would weigh,

921
01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:50.610
they would,
uh,
uh,
sin,
uh,

922
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.480
information and shoot somebody arounds in the sky and somebody to answer back.

923
01:00:54.481 --> 01:00:57.420
But they changed all the time.
But at that period of time,

924
01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.010
he only shot off two rounds.

925
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:03.690
So I hopefully that didn't mean something bad or good.
And,
uh,

926
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.480
we got to the opening of the,
um,
he went across the creek,

927
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.930
the creek bed,
and he was heading straight to the,
uh,

928
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.090
entrance to the village and I dropped down to one knee,
hit two shots,

929
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.720
hit him in the back,
he fell down and next thing,
oh hell,

930
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.360
it was 50 to 75 bad guys are chasing us down.
And um,

931
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.450
and I was heading back to Tommy and uh,
we got back and I went,

932
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.190
I moved out on the point is the book explains Song.

933
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:36.080
<v 3>So,
so when you,
when you grab our,</v>

934
01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:40.950
now you're heading back to Tommy and that's in that big sort of bunker doom
then.

935
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.530
Yeah.
And so now all you are co located in the big dump bunker?
Uh,
no,

936
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.580
actually I'm out on the very point.
Okay.
And Tommy was up on top of the market.

937
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.300
Got It.
Dang.
And they had taken our,

938
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.520
the guy we did capture up there and he was up there.

939
01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:00.790
So I move the officer to rear security and told them if he sees anything,

940
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:05.330
let Tommy go and I put clon over all my eastern

941
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:10.240
<v 2>flight,
which is the side of the ocean.
So I was about 50 feet ahead of him,</v>

942
01:02:10.241 --> 01:02:14.170
50 yards ahead of him so I could cover,
I could see everybody coming in.

943
01:02:14.171 --> 01:02:15.910
So I was kind of like the point,

944
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.030
but I kept Quan over to own the ocean side.
If they tried to flank me,

945
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.980
he would knock them off.

946
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.420
Then I could see them low goon over here cause see the lagoon.

947
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.210
And so I could see everything out in front of me.

948
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.310
<v 0>And now the enemy starts calming for you.</v>

949
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:36.840
Came forward and you start engaging them,
taking them down.

950
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.230
<v 2>Yeah.
An engaged them and what I'd do,
I'd come up over here,</v>

951
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.740
I'd roll over and come up somewhere else.
I'd throw a grenade over here,

952
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:46.830
I'd move back till another grenade.
I'd,

953
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:51.210
I'd move forward where the grenade hit calls I had by that time.

954
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.710
And uh,
I gave him a frost,
preached tenses.
How many people we had.

955
01:02:55.711 --> 01:03:00.110
They didn't know we had 12 or 15 or lonely,

956
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.220
didn't Tommy numerous shooting from up there.

957
01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:04.740
But Tommy was on the radio trying to get communication

958
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.910
<v 0>and what Tommy was trying to get communications from,</v>

959
01:03:06.911 --> 01:03:11.910
and just to kind of lay this out a little bit,
that the ships had been told,
hey,

960
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:13.710
we might need fire support.
Correct.

961
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:17.970
Well when you and whenever you set up fire support for yourself,

962
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:22.800
you always set up what we call pre predesignated firing position.
So hey we,

963
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.040
you know,
you name them,
whatever you're going to name them,
a,
B,
c,
d one,
two,
three,

964
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:28.530
four.
You give them girls names,
whatever car names,

965
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:33.180
but it's real easy to jump on the radio and say,
Hey,
fire it.

966
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:36.600
Position Bravo now and the,
you know,

967
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:39.810
whatever fire support can start hitting that.
That's,
that's great.

968
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:43.260
If you're where you're supposed to be and then that's the issue.
Okay.

969
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:46.440
So Tommy starts doing its best and saying,
hey,

970
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.650
fire rounds at this pre designated spot.
Go ahead.

971
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.030
They fire rounds of that pre designated spot.
Guests could even see it.

972
01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.160
<v 2>So they started moving north of that period of time and there was shooting smoke</v>

973
01:03:57.161 --> 01:04:01.990
in the air then.
And uh,
the firefight went for almost,
uh,
almost three hours,

974
01:04:01.991 --> 01:04:05.640
actually two hours and 55 minutes.
And we had eliminated a ball,

975
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:09.400
a lot of these guys and they started falling back.
And

976
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.570
<v 0>so there's five of you that are making like 30,
40,
50 guys fall back.
Well,</v>

977
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.750
just four of us calls.
Got It.
The other guy never shot a round

978
01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.710
and that's just you're taking good fire discipline.
Correct.
Uh,

979
01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:29.170
<v 2>one or two rounds of time making good hits and making sure what I'd do,</v>

980
01:04:29.171 --> 01:04:32.680
I'd shoot in the sand about an inch and not see their heads come up.

981
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.270
Then I'd shoot uh,
uh,

982
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.720
about an inch below the sand and I get a head shot every time.

983
01:04:37.721 --> 01:04:40.650
So you could tell that and then you'd roll over,
you know,

984
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.770
then what's the grenades you were knowing that we're getting,
as you mentioned,

985
01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:49.580
what are grenade?
Of course we have a four second delay in hours and their,

986
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.280
their grenades.
We had

987
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:57.820
pulled those things before and they'd go want to go anywhere from 14 seconds to

988
01:04:57.821 --> 01:04:58.410
28

989
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:03.220
<v 0>second so they don't have good quality control and their grenade factories like</v>

990
01:05:03.221 --> 01:05:07.010
we do.
Uh,
let's see.
Yeah,
you're,

991
01:05:07.011 --> 01:05:11.430
you're talking about that you're sending guys off now.
You're,

992
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.820
you're continued to shoot,
you're continuing to hold your position.
You're,

993
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.610
you're about halfway your ammo at this point.

994
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:21.700
And then speaking of these grenades,

995
01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:25.390
you're in one of these positions and boom incomes,
one of those grenades to your,

996
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:27.970
to your spot.
What'd you do about that?

997
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.190
<v 2>Well,
I yelled grenade and I grabbed it and threw it back.</v>

998
01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:35.640
I was going to 00020003000 about Tom.

999
01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.470
I hit 8,000 to jam grenade,

1000
01:05:37.471 --> 01:05:41.130
came back over and I'm going twelve thousand thirteen thousand calls of course,

1001
01:05:41.131 --> 01:05:44.940
where you thousands and I gives you a good second.
Not threw it back.

1002
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.850
And,
and the,

1003
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:52.560
the grenade went back and forth five times and I was at 20 1020 2000.

1004
01:05:52.561 --> 01:05:54.240
I said this saying it's got to go off.

1005
01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:58.620
And it went off and I was hit six times and my bag was shrapnel and I just

1006
01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:02.310
yelled out.
I didn't say nothing else.
And when I yelled out,

1007
01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:06.510
I just stayed there and I looked up and there was four guys coming across and I

1008
01:06:06.511 --> 01:06:08.190
eliminated all four of those guys.

1009
01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.750
And that's when we found out they started falling back.
And Tommy said to her,

1010
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.470
falling back and I said this,
he said,
are you okay?
I said,
you know,

1011
01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:21.190
I'm wounded,
but I'm okay.
We still very,
very mobile.
And uh,

1012
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:26.600
of course the adrenaline's pumping.
Like God knows what.
And uh,
and uh,

1013
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:31.710
uh,
and you don't worry about yourself.
You stood just,
you know,

1014
01:06:31.711 --> 01:06:33.530
you need to get out of there.
Assault.
We knew.

1015
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:39.550
<v 0>Now at this point it seems like they're falling back a little bit.</v>

1016
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:44.320
And it looks like from,
from the way it's described,

1017
01:06:44.321 --> 01:06:48.130
there's basically another dune that's a little further back from where you are,

1018
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:51.890
approximately 500 yards.
And that's to the north,
to the north,

1019
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.930
going right by itself.
I mean,
everything else is flat except for that one too.

1020
01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:59.230
And so what you're,
what you guys hatch the plan real quick.
All right,

1021
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:00.250
let's get to that thing.

1022
01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:02.950
It's further away at create some distance and then from there we can eventually

1023
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:05.590
get in a water and get outta here.
And you know,

1024
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.540
I talk about cover and move all the time.

1025
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:11.290
And that's like the fundamental principle of how we fight.

1026
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:16.740
And in a normal situation you would just get little terrain features and you'd

1027
01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:19.030
move back a little piece at a time because,
uh,

1028
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.030
because that's how you support each other.
In this one,

1029
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:25.350
there was no where to hide in between those two.
No.

1030
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:30.500
So you guys made the call of Tommy and who's going to stay up there?

1031
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.400
Who's Tommy and dying to radio moon stay up there.
And Tommy said,

1032
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:35.200
you fall back that time

1033
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:39.820
<v 2>very to Tom.
I was the only one who had any,
it had been wounded.
But what we did,</v>

1034
01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:42.820
I looked across at a pair of binoculars.
I looked across and I said,

1035
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:46.690
I can understand why because I counted almost a hundred guys.
And Tommy said,

1036
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:50.020
there's a lot more than that.
And it was a Nva battalion.

1037
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.950
They were trying to circle us and uh,

1038
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.550
and by the time I got back,
uh,

1039
01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.320
as the book says,
Dang comes back by himself,
cause Tom,

1040
01:08:01.321 --> 01:08:03.490
he had been shot in the head at that period of time.

1041
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.690
<v 0>So,
so you guys,
they put down copper,
they put down cover fire for you,
right?</v>

1042
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.530
And then you fall back,

1043
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.950
you're doing what you're supposed to do and you got the Vietnamese lieutenant

1044
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.060
and you got Quan with you on with it.

1045
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.270
You get back to that position and

1046
01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.020
that means Lieutenant Norris is still up in the big bunker getting ready.

1047
01:08:27.781 --> 01:08:30.750
He's waiting for your fire support.
And while that's happening,

1048
01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.740
I'm going to go to the book,
uh,

1049
01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:39.350
right here I was asking for naval gunfire right onto our position.

1050
01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.370
And he says,

1051
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:44.520
those rounds could have hit Dang and me just as well as the bad guys.

1052
01:08:44.521 --> 01:08:48.240
But I had no choice.
The guy on the radio came back and said,

1053
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:53.010
understand fire for effect.
And I said,
absolutely put it on us.
And he said,

1054
01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:56.130
are you sure?
And I said,
just get it in here.

1055
01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.260
And so they actually,
as they were called in this naval gunfire,

1056
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:07.090
Tommy was like seeing guys common and like through the grace of God,

1057
01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.130
a one big round hit there,

1058
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.580
they hit them and got a lot of bad guys.

1059
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:17.140
And then again going back to the book,

1060
01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:20.890
I went back to getting the law ready to fire.
That's a law rocket.

1061
01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.910
I could hear the ship shooting,
but that's the last thing I remember.

1062
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.620
And then the narrator comes in and says,
at that point in the fight,

1063
01:09:29.621 --> 01:09:33.010
Tom Norris took an AK 47 round to the left side of his forehead.

1064
01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:37.990
The bullet entered his skull at the orbital socket of his left eye toward a

1065
01:09:37.991 --> 01:09:42.991
section of his skull exposing his brain and caught a shallow furl along the

1066
01:09:43.121 --> 01:09:44.080
brain itself.

1067
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.150
Dang saw his officer go down and the extent of his head wound,

1068
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:53.950
he's lieutenant had been shot dead knowing there was nothing he could do.

1069
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.900
He made for the others who had just taken a position on the next dune to the

1070
01:09:58.901 --> 01:10:03.760
north.
As he ran,
he took around through the radio.
He still carried on his back,

1071
01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:08.080
knocking him down the round,
destroyed the radio and saved his life.

1072
01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:11.140
But fragments carried through into his back.
Dang.

1073
01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:13.270
Picked himself up and kept running.

1074
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:18.430
It took him close to 10 minutes to reach Mike.
Where's Tommy?

1075
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.740
Mike Ass.
Dang,
when he reached him,

1076
01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:25.840
whereas die Wei Dai way is dead.
Dang replied.

1077
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.651
And this is it.

1078
01:10:29.651 --> 01:10:34.651
So you know your trusted Vietnamese fellow seal says,

1079
01:10:36.821 --> 01:10:40.330
Hey,
look,
the lieutenant that's Dai way is the tenant.
He's dead

1080
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.220
and this is what you do.
I'm going to the book here.

1081
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:49.720
I told Quan and the others to wait here that I was going back for Tommy.

1082
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:54.640
They tried to stop me saying it was no use.
He was dead.

1083
01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:59.350
I believed them.
I too thought he was dead,

1084
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.280
but I wasn't going to leave them behind.
We never leave anybody behind.

1085
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:06.910
So no way was I going to be the first to do that.

1086
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:12.010
Had I been wounded or dead,
he'd have come back from me.
That's who we are.

1087
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:17.650
Dang said he was dead and I had no reason not to believe him.
It didn't matter.

1088
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:22.260
And what if by chance he was still alive.

1089
01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.940
I could not have live with myself if I have left him behind not knowing or what

1090
01:11:27.941 --> 01:11:30.490
the Nva might do to him if he were still alive.

1091
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.090
That whole area,

1092
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:36.480
south of the bunker was littered with bodies and they would be looking for

1093
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:37.314
revenge.

1094
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:44.040
I had close to a quarter of a mile to cover and the last part of it was uphill,

1095
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:48.890
but I ran all the way.
The initial salvo from the Morton,

1096
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:50.510
that was the ship out at sea,

1097
01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.440
although I didn't know it at the time that it was the Morton shooting had made

1098
01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:58.100
the bad guys think twice about advancing on the Dune with the bunker.

1099
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:02.240
When I got close,
I saw them moving carefully towards the bunker.

1100
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.740
From where I could see they were flanking the bunker and moving in from the east

1101
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.900
or the beach side as well as from the south.

1102
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:12.650
I saw Tommy lying on the west side of the bunker.

1103
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.730
Two guys were climbing over the top as they moved in from the east.

1104
01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.450
They moved cautiously and got within a few feet of him.

1105
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.300
I shot them both and moved to where Tommy was.

1106
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:28.610
He had an unbelievable head wound.
The whole side of his forehead was gone.

1107
01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:31.250
His brain was visible.
You could actually see it.

1108
01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.350
The front lobe of his brain was kind of pushing out through his skull.

1109
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.060
I could see why.
Dang said he was dead.
I sure thought he was.

1110
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.890
I picked him up,
put him over my shoulder and started running.

1111
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.270
I also grabbed his AK 47 as I knew I was getting low on Ammo.

1112
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:55.460
I hadn't taken more than 10 steps from the bunker when there was this explosion

1113
01:12:55.461 --> 01:13:00.461
behind me from naval gunfire round the concussion picked us both up in the air,

1114
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.570
lifting Tommy off my shoulder and tossed us forward 10 or 15 feet.

1115
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:10.790
I literally saw him move my shoulder,
leave my shoulder and fly through the air.

1116
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.970
When I landed,
I sat there for a moment,

1117
01:13:13.971 --> 01:13:17.030
stunned trying to orient myself and catch my breath.

1118
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:22.420
Once I sorted myself out,
I crawled over to where Tommy was lying in the sand.

1119
01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.590
Once I got to Tommy again and started to pick him up,

1120
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:31.580
he spoke to me for the first time.
He said,
Mike Buddy,

1121
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:37.370
and that was when I knew he was alive.
I said,
can you run?
And he says,

1122
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.770
I can run,
but I can't see.
But he really couldn't run.

1123
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:43.630
Then he blanked out again.

1124
01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.310
I put them in a fireman's carry and took off for the Dune to the north where had

1125
01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:51.520
left the others.
I heard him talking now and then,

1126
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.320
and I guess he was fading in and out,

1127
01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:59.670
but I knew he was alive and I put all my energy and focused to covering the

1128
01:13:59.981 --> 01:14:04.180
ground between where we were and the other dude

1129
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.920
<v 3>where like I said,</v>

1130
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:22.090
you need it on that you and I've talked about the camaraderie and the respect we

1131
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:27.050
have for each other and even though Tommy's a much smaller than I am a,

1132
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.930
he would have done the same thing for me.
I know that so,

1133
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.020
so it's like you say,
you,

1134
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.900
you know,
if you die,
which were all under,

1135
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.120
we understand what our job is as being navy seals,

1136
01:14:43.121 --> 01:14:47.620
but I could never live with myself knowing that if he was dead,

1137
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:52.180
I thought he was dead.
But,
uh,
with the grace of God,
he's still with us.

1138
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.340
So as I was running back with him,

1139
01:15:02.341 --> 01:15:05.920
I got shot through my left calf through my,
uh,

1140
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:11.190
uh,
my left calf and I fell to the ground and we got back in there.

1141
01:15:11.191 --> 01:15:15.450
Squad and Dane given us cover far.
Were you,
uh,

1142
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:22.040
like when I've done stuff that was maybe not the safest things in the world,

1143
01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.520
I never was really thinking like,
oh,
this is dangerous.

1144
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:32.370
Were were you thinking,
uh,
oh,
this is really dangerous?
Or will you just,

1145
01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:36.540
oh,
he's over there and I got to go get him because that's what we do,
what we do.

1146
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.440
So that's what it is.
You don't,
you know,
fears are good thing,

1147
01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:44.490
but you got to focus.
I mean,
if,
you know,
I could have sat down her today,

1148
01:15:44.491 --> 01:15:47.880
we were all gonna die.
I'm just gonna lie here and,
and do it.
But I said,

1149
01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:52.500
I'm going to take as many of those slbs down as I can.
And uh,

1150
01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:57.410
you know,
and then the thing is,
is that,
um,
uh,
uh,

1151
01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:02.850
it,
it was like we should go back to what we are and the Camaraderie and going

1152
01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:05.850
through training and why we do things and things like that.

1153
01:16:05.851 --> 01:16:09.620
And I think the broader was my father and there's like go back to,

1154
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.570
I look about it cause my dad never would have left me behind her,

1155
01:16:12.571 --> 01:16:14.070
anybody else behind,
you know,

1156
01:16:14.071 --> 01:16:17.490
and that's what she instilled in us as we go through training.

1157
01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:19.350
And that's what's instilled us,
you know,

1158
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.340
a know a Tom boy hand was saying last night you said,
you know,

1159
01:16:23.341 --> 01:16:27.780
I don't think he in new one.
Fear was,
well I knew what it was,
but I mean,

1160
01:16:27.781 --> 01:16:32.100
being afraid,
you know,
if you worry about being afraid of everything,

1161
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.910
you should never be in the field because you're not focused on what,

1162
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:38.610
what you're trying to do.
So that's the whole thing is,
you know,

1163
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.570
so we're out there to do a job,
so we'll just get the damn job done yet.

1164
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.070
It's interesting to me.
I would,

1165
01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:49.130
I think guys would feel more afraid when we were getting ready to go in the

1166
01:16:50.581 --> 01:16:54.300
field when even me,
you know,
when you have time to think like,

1167
01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:56.700
oh we're going down this street,
which has had,
you know,

1168
01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:01.970
17 ids on it in the last four days and there's guaranteed to be another one on

1169
01:17:02.461 --> 01:17:03.630
there tonight with a question is,

1170
01:17:03.631 --> 01:17:07.110
is it going to hit you or is it going to hit someone else?
And that's,

1171
01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:10.100
I would see the look on guys' faces while

1172
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.000
<v 0>we were getting ready to go out and you could see a little bit of that.</v>

1173
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:17.060
But once you're in the field,
everyone's doing what they do.

1174
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.320
They're just doing their job.

1175
01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:21.210
<v 2>Just like flicking the switch,
you know,
switch you get,</v>

1176
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.720
you'd get your mind and what you're supposed to be doing.

1177
01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:29.730
So for guys doesn't have his mind in the game.
He's going to stay at home.

1178
01:17:29.731 --> 01:17:31.510
He ain't going out in the field with Mike Thornton though.

1179
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.390
<v 0>Prompt you that.
Now this is one of my,</v>

1180
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.570
one of my favorite parts of the book that is,
well,
I'll,

1181
01:17:40.571 --> 01:17:42.890
I'll read it when I got this,
is you talking,

1182
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:45.590
when I got back to the Dune Dang and Quan,

1183
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.840
we're waiting for me providing cover fire.

1184
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.380
Lieutenant Twan was nowhere in sight.

1185
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:56.090
He had already made it for the water to escape.
But God blessed Dang and Quan,

1186
01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.320
they waited for me and we're still in the fight even though Dang was wounded.

1187
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.580
They said,
Mike,
what do we do now?

1188
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.970
And I said,
we swim,

1189
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:15.340
which is the classic seal scenario in that the water is our salvation.

1190
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:23.210
We have that special experience in the water and,

1191
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:27.470
and people aren't comfortable in the water and it's our home.
And that,

1192
01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:30.890
that was just the classic answer.
These guys were stayed.
Where do we do now?

1193
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.670
Remember we were combat swimmer is not going on.
Better runners.

1194
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:38.270
Bug running does help.
So

1195
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:42.830
now,
now talk about when you're getting,

1196
01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:45.920
now you're moving to the water you're carrying and Tommy,
what goes on then?

1197
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:51.250
<v 2>Well,
uh,
uh,
I didn't inflate Tommy's life.</v>

1198
01:18:51.251 --> 01:18:53.530
Check it as some of the stories said.
I,
I,

1199
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.760
I was using Tommy like a surfboard and then every time a wave would break,

1200
01:18:57.761 --> 01:19:00.910
I'd push them under the cold water and bring him up the other side because the

1201
01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:04.470
worst thing you could do is have a wave.
And we had six sets away.

1202
01:19:04.471 --> 01:19:08.800
He's coming in and that's how Quan ended up getting injured.
You guys shot.

1203
01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:13.030
And uh,
so after I got Tommy out,
that's when I put,

1204
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.100
and I could never find Tommy's life check it.

1205
01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.020
And he had it in a pocket down on his calf.
And I said,
why?
He said,
well,

1206
01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:23.560
I wonder if I get a bullet hole in it.
I said,

1207
01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.250
it's good because we can put a piece of tape and then,
you know,
if you have a,

1208
01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:31.510
you know,
sucking chest wound where I can take.
So I took my life,

1209
01:19:31.511 --> 01:19:36.010
check it off me,
put it on his head,
and I took the,
you know,
the old Udt,

1210
01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:36.910
I took the harness,

1211
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:41.560
but I just put a little bit of air and I started a breast stroking out to sea.

1212
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.080
And that's when I saw Quan was in not going anywhere and I could see dangled in

1213
01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:47.914
front of me.

1214
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:53.310
And so I swam over and Grab Quan and I put Quan in front of me had been shot

1215
01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:54.341
too.

1216
01:19:54.341 --> 01:19:59.341
He had been shot in the femur and also his buttocks was completely kinda gone.

1217
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.730
He though he couldn't.
So I uh,

1218
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.520
<v 0>so you're wounded,
you,
you got shrapnel in your back,
you got shot in the leg.</v>

1219
01:20:06.521 --> 01:20:11.521
Like you got Lieutenant Norris who's basically unconscious dying and now you've

1220
01:20:13.191 --> 01:20:16.920
got quant who he can't move himself.
He's a mobile as well.
Correct.

1221
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.140
And Dang is leading point.

1222
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:22.130
As you guys are paddling out and you're carrying both these other guys

1223
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:26.840
<v 2>through the water.
So what I did,
I took Quan and put his arms.</v>

1224
01:20:26.841 --> 01:20:30.170
I'll put my arms or knees quantum's arms and he yelled Tommy like this.

1225
01:20:30.171 --> 01:20:35.171
And I started breast stroking and two we got out past the a ranger there,

1226
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.073
weapons.

1227
01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:40.760
And at that period of time I inflated Cohen's life check with a little bit.

1228
01:20:40.761 --> 01:20:45.350
Then I actually tied his life jacket to my waist and I told Kwan and swim with

1229
01:20:45.351 --> 01:20:46.280
Tommy on my back.

1230
01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:53.170
<v 0>Um,
here's again a typical,</v>

1231
01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.650
I think this exemplifies the seal attitude right here.

1232
01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:02.110
This is you talking every time Tommy woke up,
it was Mike,

1233
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.800
you got everyone.
I could only count four of us.
Where's the other guy?

1234
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:09.580
I'd say I got them,
I got everyone and then he drift off again.

1235
01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:13.150
Then when he woke up.
But again,
it was Mike,
you got everyone.

1236
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:18.010
Do you have all of them?
And I'd say,
damn it Tommy,
I got them all.
Okay,

1237
01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:22.270
they're accounted for.
But I just love the fact that,
you know,

1238
01:21:22.271 --> 01:21:27.271
you got a guy that's clearly close to death and when he does become conscious,

1239
01:21:27.401 --> 01:21:31.590
his number one concern is does he have his guys with

1240
01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:35.740
<v 2>that's true.
And that's the way great leadership is.</v>

1241
01:21:35.741 --> 01:21:39.010
Sometimes people surpass that because,
uh,
you know,

1242
01:21:39.011 --> 01:21:43.000
but it goes back to the thing that you and I were talking about earlier.

1243
01:21:43.001 --> 01:21:45.790
You take care of your people,
your people will take care of you

1244
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:51.800
<v 0>now.
Um,
you get out,
you know,
pass like you said,</v>

1245
01:21:51.801 --> 01:21:55.610
pass the small arms fire and,
and again,

1246
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:59.540
Dang and Quan keep asking Mike,
what do we do?
What do we do?

1247
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:03.830
And each time you said we swim,
we just keep swimming.

1248
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:08.240
We'll swim south all the way to two.
We non if we have to.

1249
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.970
That's correct.
And that's what you did.
You start,

1250
01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:18.971
you kept swimming and kept swimming and kept swimming and you're out there for

1251
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:21.000
three hours swimming.
And,

1252
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:25.230
and just to put that into some perspective for people that have never swam in

1253
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:26.640
the open ocean before,

1254
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:32.570
the longest swim that you do in seal training is 5.5 now nautical miles,

1255
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:38.460
which is 6.2 statute regular land miles.

1256
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.710
And that takes,
depending on the current,

1257
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:42.600
depending on how good your swimmer you are,

1258
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.390
that's the longest swim that they actually make you do.

1259
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:48.270
And that takes like three,
four,
sometimes five hours.

1260
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.630
That's the longest one that they make.
You do.
And by the way,

1261
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:55.650
they give you a little water break inbetween.
So here you are

1262
01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.340
swimming this and you,
you're wounded,
shot in the leg.
Like I said,

1263
01:23:01.341 --> 01:23:06.040
you're dragging these other guys now.
Luckily,
Bill,

1264
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.110
we're drifting.
We talked about this earlier.
You had,

1265
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:12.060
<v 2>you saved her life.
I mean,
Billy wouldn't give up almost.
He would not give up.</v>

1266
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.920
He kept looking for us and the,

1267
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.300
and actually the Morgan thought they'd killed us all they thought and they ever

1268
01:23:18.301 --> 01:23:21.090
knew until several years ago that we were

1269
01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:24.260
<v 0>the whole hive.
No,
that's,
that's actually a great,
and again,</v>

1270
01:23:24.261 --> 01:23:28.040
obviously I can't cover the whole book on the,
on,
on,
on this show,

1271
01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:31.730
but get the book because uh,
uh,

1272
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:35.660
there's Dick Couch did a great job of actually going out and talking to the

1273
01:23:35.661 --> 01:23:37.910
people that were,
that were firing,

1274
01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.460
talking to people on the Morgan and you're right,
they,

1275
01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:42.950
they fired rounds and all of a sudden they didn't hear anything.

1276
01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.040
And the fire danger close rounds meeting like,

1277
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.830
well rounds that we know are going to be very close to our friendly forces.

1278
01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.020
And then they never heard another word.

1279
01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:56.000
So they're fought was horrible.
We must have hit our own guys.

1280
01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.550
And,
uh,
but luckily,

1281
01:23:58.551 --> 01:24:03.551
and any other thing that's interesting about bill woody Woodruff is the other

1282
01:24:03.951 --> 01:24:08.630
lieutenant lieutenant had actually gotten out to them and told them,
hey,

1283
01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:11.180
this is what happened for the lieutenant got killed.

1284
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:15.990
Mike went to go get him and never came back.
That's what he got told.

1285
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:19.990
<v 2>So the word got back to woody and he called the Newport news new went out with</v>

1286
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:24.890
the navy blue that Tommy was dead and I was missing in action and uh,

1287
01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.460
they were still looking for Quan and dying.
So,

1288
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.310
<v 0>uh,
okay.
So here's actually here we hear here in the book,</v>

1289
01:24:36.311 --> 01:24:38.770
and again,
Dick Couch did a great job getting back with all the,

1290
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:42.780
all the guys that had were there,
or at least a lot of them.
And he's,

1291
01:24:42.781 --> 01:24:46.210
he's talking to,
to woody here,
Bill Woodruff.

1292
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.670
He says it was about 1130 and I saw the Newport news began to move off to the

1293
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.504
south.

1294
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:58.060
Then my junk skipper got a call from the other junk that was off to the north

1295
01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.510
and slightly in shore from us.
We are about a half a mile apart.

1296
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.940
So as to better search the area,

1297
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.140
they said they had swimmers in the water and we're going to get them.

1298
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.660
You can't know what that meant.
So there it is,

1299
01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:16.060
uh,
because bill stuck around.

1300
01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:17.253
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1301
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:22.290
I have the greatest admiration and respect for bill.

1302
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:27.150
Uh,
I'm glad to bill found does kilz bills.
We'll do a counter attack.
And then,

1303
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.230
then we had Ryan McCombie done into tune on getting a bunch of guy,

1304
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:35.940
everybody else.
So it was left to come and find us.
So that goes back to the,
uh,

1305
01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:39.980
things about taking care of your teammates,
you know,
and,
and,

1306
01:25:39.981 --> 01:25:43.080
and thank God they did find this because,
uh,

1307
01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:44.910
none of those guys would have made her,

1308
01:25:44.911 --> 01:25:49.510
cause I mean they had over 600 bad guys up there.
So,
you know,
you know,

1309
01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:52.440
sometimes you,
you don't want to leave nobody behind,

1310
01:25:52.441 --> 01:25:54.870
but sometimes you gotta take your losses too.
You know,

1311
01:25:55.750 --> 01:26:00.580
<v 0>it was the,
uh,
two things,
and I,
I've heard this from other seals,</v>

1312
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:02.320
from Vietnam to missions.

1313
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:06.260
There's no question we're launching on is down pilot and seals in trouble.

1314
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:07.380
We're going.
Yup.

1315
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.940
And that's what those guys that were still in [inaudible] were doing.

1316
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:11.900
They were getting ready to go.

1317
01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.640
<v 2>Your welcome.
They were coming after us,
you know,
and uh,
uh,
say it,</v>

1318
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:20.570
but I figured we'd lost everybody you're trying to get in to get us to go like

1319
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:22.800
shit.
It had the gun emplacements they had tank scenario.

1320
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.730
We weren't the a heavy duty guys,

1321
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:30.650
but that goes back to even what we have today with,
you know,

1322
01:26:30.651 --> 01:26:35.360
like Eric Crichton trying to go in and uh,
losing the guys that,

1323
01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:39.830
you know,
we go,
we're going to go in and get our boys back out and uh,

1324
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:43.610
uh,
you know,
and,
and,
and you know,

1325
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:46.370
we passed the baton on back from where I am and these,

1326
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:50.570
these young men who serve us now I have the greatest admiration.

1327
01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:54.590
There are a lot smarter than I am cause they,
uh,
I mean again,
he got,

1328
01:26:54.650 --> 01:26:56.380
these kids are going through trying to nail,

1329
01:26:56.381 --> 01:26:58.850
are all going to college education but they're enlisted guys.

1330
01:26:58.851 --> 01:27:00.080
They just want to be in the teams

1331
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:01.850
<v 0>and the training they do is awesome.</v>

1332
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.810
Way better than I had it when I went through there,

1333
01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:09.500
there and there have very high standards.
Great guys coming through.

1334
01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.120
Um,
so you guys now get back on board,

1335
01:27:14.121 --> 01:27:17.470
but obviously this didn't go over yet because you got severely wounded three,

1336
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.260
especially Tommy Norris and you,

1337
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.310
you actually told them bring the Newport news back cause there's a correct,

1338
01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.350
<v 2>there's a doctor I knew there was a doctor on board because it was a Navy</v>

1339
01:27:25.351 --> 01:27:30.330
cruiser and they had a lieutenant commander on board and I called woody and I

1340
01:27:30.331 --> 01:27:34.860
said,
we have four Wia in one critical and uh,

1341
01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:40.440
and they Newport news dude turn around and we started steaming and our junk

1342
01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.660
woody was on the other junk are junk,
got there first and we passed down.
I was,

1343
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.860
uh,
uh,
boats and chair.

1344
01:27:49.861 --> 01:27:53.730
Then we just pass down on rigor than we've put Tommy inside that you've got him

1345
01:27:53.731 --> 01:27:55.850
up there.
And uh,

1346
01:27:55.890 --> 01:28:00.890
I actually pick Tommy up out of it and carried him down because the thing was

1347
01:28:00.931 --> 01:28:02.230
too wide to get through the hack.

1348
01:28:02.231 --> 01:28:05.760
So I picked Tommy back up and carried him down and laid him on the Gurney.

1349
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.740
And the doctor's office.
And

1350
01:28:09.810 --> 01:28:12.270
then I got called to the bridge to debrief the admiral,

1351
01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:17.160
<v 0>what was going on.
This is a,
again,
a great find by Dick Couch,</v>

1352
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:20.790
another,
another seal that,
that wrote the book and other Vietnam Seal.

1353
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.560
And he found a guy named dot chuck Zehnder.

1354
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:30.660
And Chuck Zehnder was a corpsman on the USS and Newport news.

1355
01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:34.830
And I'm not sure why,
why Dick Couch found him or how that worked,
but did,

1356
01:28:34.831 --> 01:28:39.831
he's the guy that he found and he's talking about when you guys came on board.

1357
01:28:42.391 --> 01:28:46.680
And what was interesting was that,
uh,
a few months before,

1358
01:28:46.681 --> 01:28:48.420
actually a month earlier,

1359
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.480
they'd had a turret explosion on the USS Newport news and it killed Loven killed

1360
01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:02.020
1111 and wounded 62.
And so they,
these,

1361
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.670
the medical staff on that was,
they were kind of primed.

1362
01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:07.890
Luckily they were used to,

1363
01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:11.700
they had just been through basically a horrible mass casualty drill and they

1364
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:15.480
were somewhat ready for it,
which,
you know,
again,
by the grace of God,

1365
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:19.470
they weren't,
they had some recent experience with dealing with wounded and,

1366
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.360
and so that's why they were ready for this.

1367
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.020
And that that's according to a chuck Zehnder,
this,
this Korman.
And here's,

1368
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.790
here's chuck Zehnder talking.
When they came aboard,
they were pretty scruffy lot.

1369
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:34.080
My job in handling casualties was triage.
I saw them first,

1370
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:37.230
evaluated them and sent them on to a senior medical person,

1371
01:29:37.231 --> 01:29:41.010
corpsman or doctor for treatment.
I remember seeing this one American,

1372
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:45.450
I couldn't believe his head wound.
His forehead was simply blown away.

1373
01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.120
I had two thoughts.
One,

1374
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:51.780
it was a good thing he was in salt water or heat of have bled to death.

1375
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:56.640
My second fault was this man will not be alive in the morning.

1376
01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:03.190
He went straight to Dr for Cheerio for Chiro who was waiting for him in surgery.

1377
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:10.800
There was this big guy who was with him and he carried him from the fan tail to

1378
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:15.270
the sick bay.
We had to force him to let go so we could treat him.

1379
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.110
He wanted to go into surgery with him.

1380
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:27.290
So that was,
you know,
it was obviously,
and uh,

1381
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.300
he also said that,

1382
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:32.873
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1383
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.730
<v 0>when,
when they came out and said,
hey,
we need to check you out.</v>

1384
01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:40.810
And you looked and you said no,
the Tommy comes first.
The rest of us can wait.

1385
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.593
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1386
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:48.870
<v 0>This is chuck Zander talking again.
While we were treating the Vietnamese seals,</v>

1387
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:50.370
I kept my eye on the big American.

1388
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.160
I finally got him to sit down so we could look them over.

1389
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.980
I saw blood on his pant leg and I cut into his trouser.

1390
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.990
I saw bullet hole in his leg,

1391
01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:02.010
my eyes got big and I called another corpsman over to look at it.
I said,

1392
01:31:02.011 --> 01:31:05.880
we better treat that.
And the seal said something like,
yeah,
whatever.

1393
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:06.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1394
01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.160
<v 0>He just didn't seem to care.</v>

1395
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.750
But he did care about the others and kept asking you about them.

1396
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:13.980
Especially his lieutenant.

1397
01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.730
We knew he was a lieutenant because the other big American seal said he was,

1398
01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:20.920
he had no rank insignia on him.

1399
01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.600
So again,

1400
01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.190
<v 1>okay.</v>

1401
01:31:28.190 --> 01:31:30.500
<v 0>Your number one priority is your teammates.</v>

1402
01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:35.493
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1403
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.410
<v 0>Another person.
So Te,
so you guys make it back.
Uh,</v>

1404
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:42.150
the ship gets you back to land.

1405
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:47.190
Tommy eventually gets casualty evacuation to the Philippines.

1406
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:51.290
<v 2>Yeah.
I uh,
got on the radio and Ryan [inaudible] and uh,</v>

1407
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:55.160
we met her evac Tommy off,
uh,
uh,

1408
01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:00.640
by helicopter to Denang and Ryan flew down on a helicopter and he was waiting in

1409
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.900
Denang and Ryan stayed with Tommy the no,
send a one 41.

1410
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:09.890
Uh,
cause we knew we were,
we had our appeal,
diabetes Admiral Stockdale Bud day,

1411
01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.780
people like that out.
And uh,
uh,

1412
01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:17.330
so all the top doctors,
you know,
neurosurgeons,

1413
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:20.890
all those guys were over there cause they had already pulled everybody out of

1414
01:32:20.891 --> 01:32:24.940
Vietnam with the exception of just general practitioners.
And uh,

1415
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.270
by the time we got Tommie through the whole operation,

1416
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:30.160
you've got him to the Philippines to Clark's,

1417
01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:34.980
it was almost 19 hours long.
Matter of fact,

1418
01:32:34.981 --> 01:32:37.900
in his operation lesson,
a 19 and a half hours,

1419
01:32:37.901 --> 01:32:41.350
his first operation and they stayed in touch with us.

1420
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:45.520
But I stayed on board of the Newport and news to the following day to take care

1421
01:32:45.521 --> 01:32:50.490
of the Vietnamese spoke English.
But I spoke of a pretty,
I mean I,

1422
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:55.090
uh,
I was fluent in Vietnamese and so I stayed on there until we got them all

1423
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:55.924
patched up.

1424
01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:01.690
<v 0>This is the doctor talking major Walter Grand.</v>

1425
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.230
He's the neurosurgeon that they had to get this guy get,

1426
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:08.410
get Tommy Norris too in the Philippines.
Correct.
And he says when he arrived,

1427
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.880
we took them directly into the,

1428
01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:14.881
or at the time general military battlefield protocol held that the patient

1429
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:20.551
needed to be needed to be or should be conscious going into surgery.

1430
01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.430
And I was surprised that someone with this series of a head wound would be

1431
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:27.760
conscious and conversant.
Fortunately he was,

1432
01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.070
he was still dressed in his operational gear,

1433
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.830
which were blue jeans and a black t shirt of some kind.

1434
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:37.800
As I was conducting my initial examination,
I remember that he was conscious but,

1435
01:33:37.801 --> 01:33:42.370
but just barely,
I could tell he'd been through a lot.

1436
01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.080
Then he seemed to come more alert and ask sir,

1437
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:51.400
can you tell me about my men?
I know we got them all off the beach,

1438
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:54.100
but can you tell me if they're okay?

1439
01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.713
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1440
01:33:57.090 --> 01:34:01.120
<v 0>Julian.
Yeah,
it's um,</v>

1441
01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.720
it's the teams

1442
01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.440
now they get done with the surgery that you're talking about.

1443
01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.240
Incredibly long surgery.

1444
01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:18.080
And here's the doctor talking again on removing the bandage and inspecting the

1445
01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:19.471
wound.

1446
01:34:19.471 --> 01:34:24.471
We talked and I sensed that he didn't know that he no longer had a left eye.

1447
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:30.070
I was reluctant to tell him as he had endured a great deal,

1448
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.480
but he was a pretty tough fellow.

1449
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:34.270
So I told him that we were unable to save his left eye.

1450
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:41.180
He thought about it for a second and then said,

1451
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:43.760
do you think they'll kick me out of the Navy because of that?

1452
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:47.750
I said that I couldn't really answer that,

1453
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:51.740
but I took it as a good sign that he still wanted to be a seal.

1454
01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:58.190
<v 2>Then the funny part,
it wasn't the,
as much as it was</v>

1455
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 3>the loss of the front Lobel part of his brain that was,
uh,</v>

1456
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.090
I actually don't think that's funny.
Sorry.
I don't think it is either.

1457
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:10.250
So when you say that,
what do you,
what do you mean that,
what was the,
uh,
uh,

1458
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:11.930
you're saying,
hey,
they're not going to kick you out of,

1459
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:15.890
even though you've lost part party your brain.
Well,
I think that was a,

1460
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:19.910
one of the,
that we talked about it cause he wanted to stay in,
he was,

1461
01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:24.830
<v 2>uh,
already chose to be a lieutenant commander at that period of time.
And uh,</v>

1462
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.100
of course she owned medical hold that does that.
She goes to stop and uh,

1463
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.380
but Tommy would have been a great,
he would have been a great ad role.

1464
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:37.890
I mean he really would have done us proud as of Ryan McCombie two and,

1465
01:35:37.891 --> 01:35:42.750
and a few other guys who didn't go up through the ranks of a to the top.

1466
01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:45.250
But we've had some great leadership up there.

1467
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.150
And I'm Eric Olsen,
Bill McRaven,
uh,

1468
01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:54.810
Joe McGee,
Joe Kernan,
Maguire,
Burke,
Callan.

1469
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.450
I mean,
the way you look,

1470
01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:58.430
<v 3>I watched the teams grow from this,</v>

1471
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.690
Oh oh four was as high as you could go and still be in the teams.
And now look,

1472
01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:07.540
as I look at their thing and the guys are,
I just amaze me every time I looked

1473
01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.340
<v 2>can read something or something,</v>

1474
01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:13.540
how much I'm so proud of each one of these young men who serve this great nation

1475
01:36:13.541 --> 01:36:14.374
of ours.

1476
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:18.870
<v 3>Yeah.
Uh,
it's amazing.
Again,
that,</v>

1477
01:36:18.871 --> 01:36:21.540
that attitude,
it's just constant.
And you know,

1478
01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:24.510
I had this with my guys that got wounded that none of them wanted to go home.

1479
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.770
They wanted to just stay.

1480
01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:28.650
They didn't care if they just had to sit and stay and watch.

1481
01:36:28.651 --> 01:36:33.480
They wanted to stay with us in Iraq.
Uh,
well,
you know,
I mean,

1482
01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.350
how proud all you guys were when we were there with Admiral Olson and you guys

1483
01:36:37.351 --> 01:36:40.070
were receiving your awards in the Pentagon,
you know,
after Mike

1484
01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:42.620
<v 2>and,
and you know,</v>

1485
01:36:42.621 --> 01:36:47.420
you look at the guys are job and those guys that,
you know,
of course

1486
01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.250
he lost his life in a very basic operation.
And,
uh,

1487
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:58.300
<v 3>but you know,
the,
even though when they,
they had the diversity against him,</v>

1488
01:36:58.301 --> 01:37:01.600
they continued to strive to make their life better.
Well,

1489
01:37:01.601 --> 01:37:03.430
Ryan Job's the classic example.
We don't know.

1490
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.920
He was blind in both eyes and he was telling me he wanted to,

1491
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.770
he was already back in America and he's on the phone telling me,

1492
01:37:08.771 --> 01:37:13.080
can I please come back to Iraq?
I want to be with the platoon.
Yup.
Yeah.

1493
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.040
And uh,

1494
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.020
it goes in and gets his college education and it has a beautiful family and uh,

1495
01:37:18.021 --> 01:37:19.970
he's,
I remember there was a,

1496
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:24.220
I was able to put the purple heart on him down then Tommy and I were there with

1497
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:29.170
the Admiral Olson of course.
Was that it at Bethesda?
Where was that?

1498
01:37:29.171 --> 01:37:32.990
Was that in the hospital?
No,
no,
no.
He was at the Pentagon.
Oh,
camera.
Oh wait.

1499
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:36.700
At the award ceremony that we had for you guys to the big ones.

1500
01:37:36.701 --> 01:37:41.701
And then we went down and he gave other from team three we gave a call and green

1501
01:37:41.771 --> 01:37:44.410
was there more green was,
it was awesome.

1502
01:37:44.411 --> 01:37:48.370
It was the task unit bruiser a award ceremony at the Pentagon.

1503
01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:54.880
We were all pretty surprised to be there doing that.
But yeah,
Ryan job.

1504
01:37:54.881 --> 01:37:56.010
So you guys put the Purple Heart

1505
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.860
<v 0>on him there?
Yeah.
Got It.
So yeah,</v>

1506
01:37:58.861 --> 01:38:02.010
he's had the same attitude that you hear from Tommy Norris.
Yeah.
Hey,

1507
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:03.083
can I stay in?

1508
01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.350
<v 2>Can I be there,
be with the guys?</v>

1509
01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:07.543
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1510
01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.370
how much longer were you in Vietnam after that operation?

1511
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:17.420
<v 2>Dober 31st and I came home,
uh,</v>

1512
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:22.750
on a break in November and then I came home for good January.

1513
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:23.620
So then,

1514
01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:28.160
then everybody left in March of 73.

1515
01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.420
And uh,

1516
01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:35.170
woody and the rest of the guys I stayed there and they came back a little funnel

1517
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.650
butt Brooksy and woody and Chamberlain and Harry Kinda cool.
And,

1518
01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:43.940
and all those guys brought Bill Bradford and stuff.
So,
uh,

1519
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:47.960
and uh,
that was the last sales of course.

1520
01:38:47.961 --> 01:38:51.230
Then we got involved with the delta per tune.
You know,

1521
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.220
what the Cambodia issue and all that kind of stuff and the Philippines and stuff

1522
01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:56.054
like that.

1523
01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.510
<v 0>You,
uh,
you talk about coming home here.
I'm going to the book.</v>

1524
01:39:01.511 --> 01:39:05.020
Coming back to the team.
This time was different from my first Vietnam tour.

1525
01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.810
When you were labeled a one tour wonder,

1526
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:12.550
which is by the way still what you get called in this day and age you come home

1527
01:39:12.551 --> 01:39:16.720
from your first deployment or even from my Thailand tour at seal team one you

1528
01:39:16.721 --> 01:39:20.350
are not a made man until after your second combat rotation.

1529
01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:25.450
It was not so much respect from the team veterans as many of them had been on

1530
01:39:25.451 --> 01:39:29.380
four or five combat rotations.
It had more to do with acceptance.

1531
01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.160
I was now one of them when guys like Gary Gallagher and Walt Gustavo and doc

1532
01:39:36.221 --> 01:39:37.720
sale came up to you and said,

1533
01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:42.130
nice job over there or good work getting your lieutenant back off that beach.

1534
01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.960
It really meant something.

1535
01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:50.810
There was also getting to know my kid who thought I was some stranger,

1536
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.900
which I was and getting reacquainted with my wife.

1537
01:39:55.860 --> 01:40:00.270
I'd been gone more than I was at home since we were married and there was the

1538
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.100
absence of combat.

1539
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:08.210
Both the worrying of having to go in the field and in some ways missing the

1540
01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:14.940
anticipation of getting ready to go on an operation and the rush that comes from

1541
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:15.774
combat.

1542
01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1543
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:20.640
<v 0>I looked at all of this as normal for any seal coming home,</v>

1544
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:26.260
but it was still an adjustment.
So you guys,

1545
01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:29.470
same stuff the guys go through now,
no court.
Correct.

1546
01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.500
Same exact stuff guys go through now.

1547
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:35.520
<v 2>And our spouses don't get enough credit for what they do.
I mean,</v>

1548
01:40:35.521 --> 01:40:38.970
they raise our kids and families,
they take on,
you know,

1549
01:40:38.971 --> 01:40:42.330
stuff that we should be there to try to help them with.
But you know,

1550
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.800
we have amazing spouses,
uh,
you know,
in the teams too.

1551
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:50.990
And we have a lot better.
You know,
the first thing I mentioned,
my wife,
he said,

1552
01:40:50.991 --> 01:40:53.320
where was she?
Did the navy issue or

1553
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.840
<v 3>now we have a whole different outlook.
Thank God.
Uh,
you know,</v>

1554
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.680
there are a part of our lives and they should make it better for all of us.

1555
01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:08.080
The military wa all the military wives.
Oh yeah.
The generic on what they do.

1556
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.910
Yeah.
They're raising the kids,

1557
01:41:09.911 --> 01:41:13.280
but they're also fixing water heaters and you know,

1558
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.940
repair and plumbing and they're just doing everything in the house.

1559
01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:19.270
Like you said,
the stuff that we're supposed to be doing,
if we're home,

1560
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:20.020
we're home.

1561
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:25.020
So they had to put up with all the bs was a man taking a car and they're trying

1562
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:29.200
to,
hell,
I know how to change oil.
They say,

1563
01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.540
don't try to pull that one over my eyes.

1564
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.860
Now going back to the book,

1565
01:41:35.861 --> 01:41:38.980
this is you talking and I was notified in September that I would receive the

1566
01:41:38.981 --> 01:41:39.814
medal of honor.

1567
01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:43.750
A lot goes through your mind when something like that is going to happen to you.

1568
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.020
You try and play it down in your mind like it's no big deal,

1569
01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:52.360
but it really is a big deal.
Everyone in uniform knows it's a big deal.

1570
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:58.500
I felt humbled and undeserving and I swore that I was not going to change me.

1571
01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.533
Well,
you know,

1572
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:12.070
Mike Thorne has always been a renegade and probably always will be a renegade.

1573
01:42:12.071 --> 01:42:16.960
And then I wasn't going to let it change me.
And,
uh,
so,
uh,
you know,

1574
01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:20.140
when I went back to get the metal,
they wouldn't let Tommy out of the hospitals,

1575
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:22.500
so I kidnapped,
kept him.

1576
01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:26.410
So Tommy was still recovering from the head of news is still going,
this is,

1577
01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.760
this is what,
a year later,
a year later.
And Tommy still,
I mean,

1578
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:34.420
he's just going through all these,
all the surgeries and everything else.
I mean,

1579
01:42:34.421 --> 01:42:34.731
Tommy,

1580
01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:37.960
you went through surgeries for six and a half years and are still goes even now.

1581
01:42:37.961 --> 01:42:42.060
So,
uh,
you know,
it's unbelievable.
I mean,
so,

1582
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.390
but they wouldn't let them out of the hospital go to your ceremony.
So I said,

1583
01:42:46.391 --> 01:42:50.950
hey,
this is not,
I said,
I'll bring him back,
you know,
and they said,
no.
I said,

1584
01:42:50.951 --> 01:42:52.900
well,
I'm going to get in trouble when I'd take your mouth.

1585
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:56.810
So I kept him for four days.
But in my hotel nerf,
it was name and uh,

1586
01:42:57.250 --> 01:43:01.300
everybody in the world's looking forward and the surgeon general of the navy,

1587
01:43:01.301 --> 01:43:04.160
which was a three store put me on report and uh,

1588
01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:09.580
I had to go to the admirals master does a,
my first one,
you know,

1589
01:43:09.581 --> 01:43:12.310
uh,
Tony Fratty who is the Charlie platoon chief.
We used to,

1590
01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.980
we used to talk about Mike Thornton and we'd say,
you know,

1591
01:43:14.981 --> 01:43:19.240
just on random days we'd say,
Hey,
you know what Mike Gordon's doing today,

1592
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.270
whatever Mike Fort and wants to do today.

1593
01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.870
So you just smuggled them out of the hospital against orders,
went to,

1594
01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:32.810
went to admirals,
mass.
Uh,

1595
01:43:34.050 --> 01:43:37.330
you talk a little bit about the ceremony here.
Going back to the book,

1596
01:43:37.331 --> 01:43:39.460
we showed up at the White House for the ceremony.

1597
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:43.930
Then we were all taken in the Oval Office and I was presented with the metal.

1598
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:48.520
I'll never forget President Nixon saying,
Mike,
what can I do for you?

1599
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.100
And I said,
well,
Mr President,
you could break

1600
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.950
<v 0>this metal in half and give the other half to this young man,</v>

1601
01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.060
which was Tom Norris.

1602
01:43:56.061 --> 01:44:00.800
You were pointing to standing behind me because he saved my life too.

1603
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:10.960
So again,
even even in the end,
there you are,
uh,

1604
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:17.410
you're looking out for your teammate,
right.
All the way through.

1605
01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:24.750
<v 2>Um,
well,
we still look out for each other even today,
after 46 years.</v>

1606
01:44:24.751 --> 01:44:26.320
So I never,

1607
01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.510
it's a job that you never give up.
Well,

1608
01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:34.190
<v 0>the book,
like I said,</v>

1609
01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:39.530
I mean we've covered a traction of the book and it gives so much more detail.

1610
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:44.570
It goes on to talk about the rest of your navy career.
It goes on to talk about,

1611
01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:48.860
and obviously it talks about Tommy Norris,
his career as the FBI.

1612
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.200
The FBI agent,
by the way,

1613
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:55.490
went into the FBI and wasn't undercover operative.
I mean,

1614
01:44:55.491 --> 01:44:57.830
just unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.

1615
01:44:59.200 --> 01:44:59.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1616
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:04.210
<v 0>You got to get this book so that you can get the full details of what I'm</v>

1617
01:45:04.211 --> 01:45:07.090
talking about.
And you know,

1618
01:45:07.091 --> 01:45:09.860
the last thing I wanted to read from the book is,
um,

1619
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:16.050
the citation from your metal of honor.

1620
01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.513
Please don't.

1621
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:20.593
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1622
01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:25.830
<v 0>they can go online and read it.
But the book's called Byod or file,</v>

1623
01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:26.340
ladies and

1624
01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:30.690
<v 2>gentleman.
And I tell Ya,
uh,
I,
uh,</v>

1625
01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:35.250
I never felt I deserved them.
That'll never feel I would deserve the modal.

1626
01:45:35.251 --> 01:45:39.660
But you know that I wear that with the honor of the men and women who served

1627
01:45:39.661 --> 01:45:44.250
before me,
serve with me and the server after me.
But a lot of people don't know.

1628
01:45:44.251 --> 01:45:46.590
We've lost 2 million,
850,

1629
01:45:46.591 --> 01:45:50.970
3000 people in this great nation does and Georgia freedoms today.

1630
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:55.800
And that's who we can never forget.
And freedom is not free.
And,
uh,

1631
01:45:56.430 --> 01:46:00.510
we must honor each and every one of them and they all deserve the muddle in the

1632
01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:04.710
skew,
in their lives for this great nation.
Of course,
Mikey months,

1633
01:46:04.711 --> 01:46:08.430
or like I said before,
what a great young man.

1634
01:46:08.431 --> 01:46:11.210
I knew Mikey and uh,
uh,

1635
01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:16.050
I feel for all our gold star families and uh,
cause I've never,
knock on wood,

1636
01:46:16.051 --> 01:46:19.770
I've never lost a child,
but I've lost a lot of,
lot of close,

1637
01:46:19.771 --> 01:46:23.040
great friends and uh,
I know what,

1638
01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.630
what part of they're going through.
But you know,

1639
01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.580
until you lose a child of your own that you,

1640
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:32.300
God's blessed you to give.
Uh,

1641
01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:36.120
it's hard to people to understand that freedom is not free.

1642
01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.420
This written in blood as you know jack

1643
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.360
<v 0>well.
Yup.</v>

1644
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:48.760
And you know,

1645
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:55.020
I can't even fathom what it's like to lose a child.
I know.
Uh,
you know,

1646
01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:00.260
it's,
um,
I can't,
I can't even fathom.

1647
01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.300
<v 1>And you know,</v>

1648
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:10.200
<v 0>when I hear people,
uh,
throwing the word here all around,
you know,
I always,</v>

1649
01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:11.930
<v 1>okay.</v>

1650
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:12.860
<v 0>I always say</v>

1651
01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.690
what I hear a lot of veterans say and that is the real heroes didn't come home.

1652
01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:20.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1653
01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.990
<v 2>Well I agree with you,
but loose,</v>

1654
01:47:23.991 --> 01:47:28.490
we did get them all and we still continue to try to get the ones that remains a

1655
01:47:28.491 --> 01:47:29.324
little ones home.

1656
01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:35.400
<v 1>Um,
well,</v>

1657
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.200
you know,
the,
uh,

1658
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:43.890
<v 0>like I said,
if you go and get this book,</v>

1659
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.800
you can,
you can read it.
You can learn a lot about the,
these operations.

1660
01:47:49.801 --> 01:47:51.480
You can learn a lot about people.

1661
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:52.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1662
01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.510
<v 0>And what people are capable of.</v>

1663
01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:57.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:00.760
<v 0>And what real sacrifice looks like.</v>

1665
01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:05.250
And do you know Mike,
Again,

1666
01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:13.630
like everyone's going to want to tell you and it tells you all the time,

1667
01:48:13.631 --> 01:48:17.950
thank you for the service that you made for our country.

1668
01:48:17.951 --> 01:48:21.880
But as a seal,
I want to say thank you for setting the example

1669
01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.640
that we followed and as a person and as a human being.

1670
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:30.230
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1671

1672
01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.230

1673
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:38.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1674
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:42.110
<v 0>And no matter how dire the circumstances,</v>

1675
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:47.510
no matter how many enemy forces are advancing,

1676
01:48:47.511 --> 01:48:49.520
no matter how many rounds they're firing at,

1677
01:48:49.521 --> 01:48:52.070
you know how many grenades they throw at you,

1678
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:57.140
no matter how big the problems that you face in life,

1679
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:05.390

It never quit on each other.

I'm sure you didn't get a whole lot of speaking time there,

01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.990
<v 0>No,

That's what eco does.</v>

1685

<v 2>But um,
thanks for coming on was my honor.</v>

1687
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.770
Thank you for what you're doing and getting the word out to the public,

1688
01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:40.290
uh,
book calls.
It was like I say,
freedom is not free,
ladies and gentlemen,

1689
01:49:40.291 --> 01:49:44.340
freedoms written in blood and please don't take advantage of this,
you know,

1690
01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.650
give back to the ones that were given much.

1691
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:51.570
And I goes back to what you and I were talking about too.
I mean the,

1692
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:56.110
the wives,
the children,
the sacrifices they make for their,

1693
01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:59.920
for their spouses to go overseas and keep this nation free.

1694
01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.900
And what's the organization that you have now is called the Michael [inaudible]

1695
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:08.350
Thornton foundations summit.
Fun.
Uh,
we give out money,

1696
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.800
uh,
and I don't give out,
you know,

1697
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:16.960
50,000 or a hundred thousand.
I give out a 10,000 here,

1698
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:21.460
5,000 there and,
and our are met foundation and basically,

1699
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:24.840
or I'll give out 20,000,
you know,
and uh,

1700
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:29.740
just a couple of examples.
One was a young marine came back,
he was a corporal.

1701
01:50:29.741 --> 01:50:32.920
They retired him.
Uh,
but of course it down,

1702
01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.940
it takes them anywhere from 19 months to two years to get into the Va.

1703
01:50:36.941 --> 01:50:39.980
He had these bad headaches,
but he'd have enough money to pay for.

1704
01:50:39.981 --> 01:50:41.440
Hers is copayment.

1705
01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:45.900
So I write a check to the MRI to the hospital.
I wrote,

1706
01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.830
write the check,
they do an MRI fund,

1707
01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.700
found out he had a brain aneurism and was able to say the young man's life.

1708
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:55.130
The other one,
uh,
we had a guy in special ops.
Uh,

1709
01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.740
he was an air force major until all Sir Jay sock and he was overseas.

1710
01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:03.880
His wife got diagnosed with a stage four cancer.

1711
01:51:03.881 --> 01:51:08.460
We put her into Duke University.
I would try to save her life.
Uh,

1712
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:12.970
a friend of mine,
he goes back to the day when we started seal team six and uh,

1713
01:51:12.971 --> 01:51:16.930
along which started Jay sock in 1980.
He was our chaplain.

1714
01:51:16.931 --> 01:51:19.360
He was a Catholic chaplain and he calls me and said,

1715
01:51:19.361 --> 01:51:22.360
Micah here you had a great foundation.
I have a problem.
While I said,

1716
01:51:22.361 --> 01:51:24.610
what is your problem?
I do due diligence.

1717
01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:27.240
We were able to get their kids into this.

1718
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:30.430
Bakhtin is a Christian school,

1719
01:51:30.431 --> 01:51:35.431
which all the kids there range from the age of seven to a 10 or 11.

1720
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:38.500
I can't remember.
And,
uh,
there's three of them,

1721
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:42.560
but they had spent their whole school time there.
Uh,

1722
01:51:42.610 --> 01:51:44.890
but the father causes a cold payments,

1723
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:48.040
which they had already built up to a like a hundred something thousand blogs

1724
01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:51.790
with the cold payments.
I paid for the kids to wish and wrote a check,

1725
01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:57.040
which was a little bit over $18,000,
you know,
for all and put them back in there.

1726
01:51:57.041 --> 01:52:02.041
But at least they had a stable platform and everybody knew what was going on

1727
01:52:02.051 --> 01:52:06.070
with the mother.
The all the teachers knew the kids and stuff like that.

1728
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:07.870
And then at that period of time,

1729
01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:12.070
I go back and I make some phone calls to some good friends of mine in New York

1730
01:52:12.071 --> 01:52:15.760
City and they took care of the over the a hundred and something thousand dollars

1731
01:52:15.761 --> 01:52:20.290
copayments.
So I put a bandaid on the problem and then I try to go other,

1732
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:25.420
but I mean,
call for fire somewhere.
Yeah.
Farsi.
Yeah.
But I mean,
I were with the,

1733
01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:29.870
uh,
the navy seal foundation,
Navy Seal Family Foundation,
the,
uh,

1734
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:33.970
we work with the,
to keep in our history of the museum.
Uh,

1735
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:38.260
uh,
was John Lee does a great job that we do up at Pebble Beach,

1736
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:42.100
the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation,
which is the number one foundation,

1737
01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.940
um,
uh,

1738
01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:49.020
in the nation to give 99 cents of every dollar raised and I give 97 cents of

1739
01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:54.350
every dollar raised.
Uh,
I do have one administrator I I pay for,

1740
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:59.140
so my wife and I can travel around and take care of that.
But uh,

1741
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:02.520
uh,
but there's some great foundations out there.
I just told him,

1742
01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:05.180
make sure you do your due diligence on their foundations.

1743
01:53:05.181 --> 01:53:07.940
You just go online and check them out in there for four star,

1744
01:53:07.941 --> 01:53:10.190
five star and find out.

1745
01:53:10.191 --> 01:53:14.780
But all the foundation is I work with has got to give at least 94 cents of every

1746
01:53:14.781 --> 01:53:19.040
dollar race out to Alpha the calls.
Where can they find your foundation?

1747
01:53:19.041 --> 01:53:22.370
Just bullet the mat fund.
Okay.
Uh,

1748
01:53:22.371 --> 01:53:25.670
online as fond.
Uh,
the,

1749
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:29.480
the Mad Yvonne or the Michael,
he Thornton.
I'll put my name on it.

1750
01:53:29.481 --> 01:53:31.850
The buck stops with me.
If somebody is pointing fingers,

1751
01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:35.420
they only got one finger to point.
I'll take full responsibility.
What I do.

1752
01:53:35.421 --> 01:53:38.800
So he's always have,
you know,
don't do,
uh,

1753
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:43.910
and I have people like Bob Kerrey Congress from medal of honor.

1754
01:53:43.911 --> 01:53:46.040
It's on my board.
I have an admiral on my board.

1755
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.840
I have a two really great businessmen on my board and,
uh,

1756
01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:56.090
I have supports of people all in the United States,
which helped support their,

1757
01:53:56.091 --> 01:53:58.760
cause they said they used to give money to other foundations,

1758
01:53:58.761 --> 01:54:02.210
but I didn't like to with the money was being supported.
So they give me the,

1759
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:07.250
and I,
and uh,
like I say,
we make sure we take care.
I mean,

1760
01:54:07.251 --> 01:54:11.810
if like somebody blows up the engine,
the engine having a bad month,

1761
01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:14.840
they got laid off and we paid for their rent,

1762
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:18.440
but we write the check to the,
we don't give it to the person,

1763
01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:23.000
we give it to the complex or we give it to the hospital or we give it to the

1764
01:54:23.001 --> 01:54:23.834
doctor.

1765
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:27.650
So that way I know the money's going where it's supposed to be going so they can

1766
01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:30.140
get the take care of their problems.

1767
01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:34.950
<v 0>Well,
obviously,
uh,
your service isn't quite over yet.</v>

1768
01:54:34.951 --> 01:54:39.810
You're still serving and still helping veterans and seals across the board.

1769
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:44.640
And once again,
sir,
thank you for coming on.
It's been an honor knowing you,

1770
01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:48.210
it's been an honor talking to you and I look forward to talking to you again.

1771
01:54:48.211 --> 01:54:48.690
Some total.

1772
01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:52.410
We Will Jocko just keep doing what you're doing and our coke keep them out of

1773
01:54:52.411 --> 01:54:56.130
trouble.
Yes sir.
Thank you very much for having me on.
Thank you.

1774
01:54:58.210 --> 01:54:59.040
All right.

1775
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.040
We just took a technical break and Mike Thornton has left the building and went

1776
01:55:05.551 --> 01:55:08.220
to go do what Mike Thornton does,
whatever you want,

1777
01:55:08.221 --> 01:55:11.940
which is pretty much what every once and it was awesome.

1778
01:55:12.090 --> 01:55:16.680
Obviously having them on agree and when Mike Thornton tells you,

1779
01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:21.010
don't read my citation and you know,
read the citation.
Simple as that.

1780
01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.360
No factor.
Yes,
no factor at all,

1781
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:32.010
but awesome having him on obviously.
And now

1782
01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.200
we want to keep having people like Mike Authority on the podcast.
Yes.

1783
01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:42.210
If somebody wanted to help us have people on this podcast,
sure.

1784
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:44.100
Do you have suggestions on how

1785
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.870
<v 4>they could maybe lend to that effort?
Echo Charles the support?</v>

1786
01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:52.410
Sure.
Oh yeah.
Like,
basically that's what I'm saying.
A way to support you.
Yeah,

1787
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:54.323
of course.

1788
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.940
Here's the way and support yourself kind of thing.

1789
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.870
You know what's good for the goose is good.
You know what I'm saying?

1790
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:09.660
Maybe origin were in league with origin as you put it.

1791
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.900
Yes,
I do.
Put it that way.
Sure.
Yeah.
So origin Maine.

1792
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:17.470
So origin may mean the state.
Just so to be clear,
yes.

1793
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.960
Origin Mei,
any,
oh,

1794
01:56:18.961 --> 01:56:22.600
you mean it will like you might be like maybe the state,

1795
01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:25.680
the main one kind of Kinda,
which makes sense by the way,

1796
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:30.780
cause he couldn't it be the main one.
Totally.
And so,
you know,

1797
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.770
a lot of times like okay,
we'll take the keys.
That's how I first heard of origin.

1798
01:56:34.771 --> 01:56:37.890
By the way,
the geese,
like all these keys are dope checked it,
you know,

1799
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:40.320
and of course,
you know,

1800
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:43.890
but that technically is kind of a matter of opinion as far as like,
okay,

1801
01:56:43.891 --> 01:56:45.660
I'm going to look at this game.
And I'd be like,
okay,
no,

1802
01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:50.480
I'm gonna look forward more than Chevy,
whatever,
whatever,
or the look.

1803
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:55.230
Especially with the geese,
you know,
the,
the subtle differences kind of,
you know,

1804
01:56:55.231 --> 01:56:56.960
it's to each their own kind of thing.
Yeah.

1805
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.120
I guess you're going into like full on fashion realm here.

1806
01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:03.390
I don't go into potentially,
yeah,
I'm looking for functionality.

1807
01:57:03.450 --> 01:57:07.170
You probably could've guessed that.
Yes.
So yeah,
and you look into it.

1808
01:57:07.171 --> 01:57:10.080
So the functionality part,
yes,
all that of course.

1809
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:16.080
But when you see made in America,
this is like the epitome.

1810
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:20.730
This is the deal that basically the defining
situation.

1811
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:25.320
So you know,
you know how they'll be like,
hey,
made in America,
but then you know,

1812
01:57:25.321 --> 01:57:28.530
it's closer or whatever was in this case closed.
But then you say,
oh,
okay,
Dang,

1813
01:57:28.531 --> 01:57:32.250
those are good shirts.
You know,
where do you get your blanks from her,
whatever.

1814
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:36.780
Now all we get them from somewhere other than America kind of thing.
No,

1815
01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:39.780
the cotton get the cotton from America.

1816
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:43.420
That's what origin did that actual cotton.
Well,

1817
01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:46.590
we need you to talk about functionality,
just kind of Fyi.
Uh,

1818
01:57:47.850 --> 01:57:52.080
when you have a guy that's making the geese and therefore it's going to weave

1819
01:57:52.081 --> 01:57:53.520
the material to make the gies with,

1820
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:59.030
he's going to make material that is specifically the best to have four G,

1821
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:01.800
right.
That's a situation where the origin,

1822
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:06.270
that type of commitment.
Yes.

1823
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:11.190
That's why we're a league with origin.
Yeah,
totally makes sense.
We're kind of,

1824
01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:16.200
we have that mindset over on this side.
It makes sense.
Well so yeah,
origin.

1825
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:19.020
That's the one I'm looking forward to my geek

1826
01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:24.990
and I'm down for Geeks by the way.
But um,
yeah,

1827
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:27.450
so I'm looking forward to that one.
Origin,
Maine,
O,
r.

1828
01:58:27.451 --> 01:58:30.090
I.
G.
I.
N.
M.
A.
I.
N.
E.

1829
01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:34.020
Just to be clear just in case it's not just these.
Yeah,

1830
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:36.480
you can get the hash guards dash glad.
Yeah.

1831
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.140
And we're going to be making everything there.
Yeah.

1832
01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.380
We're going to be making everything there.

1833
01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:44.830
I everything that I utilize in my life.
Yeah.
I'm going to make,

1834
01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:47.520
it's like you.

1835
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:50.800
So you're going to kind of come out with almost like a life kit is really what

1836
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:54.190
it is.
It's a code.
Don't use the Reebok terminology bro.

1837
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:59.560
Cause the Reebok calls it like the UFC fight kit.
Ah,
okay.

1838
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.120
But I didn't know that man.

1839
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:05.320
Not Not the word kit is a university of where your kid is a universal word,

1840
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:08.440
which I do concur with.
Right.
But what did you call it,
the kid?

1841
01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.480
That's what I called it,
I guess so.
So you could call it the Brits call it kit.

1842
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:17.320
They call their op gear.
Like their web gear?
Yeah,
they call it kit.

1843
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.450
Which means that we also,

1844
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:22.830
because we have interoperability with the Brits and the Aussies.
Sure.

1845
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:27.940
So we also tend to call our gear kit.
So yes.

1846
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:32.860
In fact you are correct.
If you were to say,
I'm going to make all my kit there,

1847
01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:35.470
the answer is yes.
But

1848
01:59:37.150 --> 01:59:42.150
there's a fine line where people might think of the UFC fight kit,

1849
01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.160
which didn't go over real well when they first came out.
Hey,

1850
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:49.150
and you know we're going to let that be their thing for sure.

1851
01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:54.160
As far as he's going well or not going well,
this one,
what would it be?

1852
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:58.480
Kind of like the dis,
the unofficial discipline equals freedom kit.

1853
01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:02.420
How about we just call it gear?
Yeah.
Or we could just call it gear.

1854
02:00:02.421 --> 02:00:05.680
I guess that's my vote.
I don't rule the world.

1855
02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:08.950
So if you want to call it a kid on your side and I'll call it a gear over here.

1856
02:00:09.370 --> 02:00:11.650
Let's do that.
You know that way you're comfortable.

1857
02:00:11.651 --> 02:00:14.230
I'm a him all about everyone being comfortable with what they're saying.

1858
02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:18.580
Technically it will be a kit with gear in it and okay.
This traditional,

1859
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:22.870
that's a traditional use of the word kit,
right?
Right.
That's what,
okay.
Oh,
okay.

1860
02:00:22.871 --> 02:00:24.110
You got like five kids.

1861
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:27.640
I got a survival kit when I was six years old and it's got a compass and a

1862
02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:31.210
whistle and a pair of matches in it.
What happens if you use both matches?

1863
02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:34.210
You're in trouble.
So that's a survival kit.

1864
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:36.250
Why do you have a a whistle?

1865
02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:39.490
You just said whistle cause you know when you're a little kid you get lost in

1866
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:42.700
the weeds.
Would you supposed to blow on the whistle for awhile until they find,

1867
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:46.690
you know,
sorry,
that doesn't happen in Kona.
Not that I know.

1868
02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.250
What'd you do in collide?
When you got lost,

1869
02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.750
you just keep heading in one direction and you're you to the ocean or up in the

1870
02:00:52.751 --> 02:00:57.190
mountains.
So it's kind of,
they call it Malka Malka is mountain and MCI is ocean.

1871
02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:00.920
So that's kind of the directions.
Otherwise you just keep walking.

1872
02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:06.790
That's a good lesson for life to go into the mountains.
One time.
Long story,

1873
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:11.440
maybe some other time.
Back to origin please.
Another dive.
So boom,

1874
02:01:12.190 --> 02:01:16.360
origin,
Maine,
all made in America.
Rash guards,

1875
02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:21.550
Jeez.
All that stuffs.
This is like,
yeah.
And by the way,

1876
02:01:22.190 --> 02:01:26.260
supplements there too.
Yeah.
Supplements and labs.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1877
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.600
So you can find it all there.
And,

1878
02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:33.430
and we're going to make basically what we're talking about here,

1879
02:01:33.431 --> 02:01:37.180
Jocko supplements,
because again,
know what do I specifically want?

1880
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:42.680
I'm pretty particular.
Let's make that thing.
Yeah.
And then we go forward.

1881
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:45.290
The good part about that is to,
as you're kind of one of these guys,

1882
02:01:45.291 --> 02:01:48.250
you can rest assured you're not going to have like this,

1883
02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:52.520
these weird extra things like on an oaf hair dye or something like that.

1884
02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.840
They will not be selling hair dye.
Yeah,
yeah.
Or something like this.
So yeah,

1885
02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:00.250
that'd be good.
The good stuff for sure.
Or do you mean.com also

1886
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:04.010
support yourself?
So on it.

1887
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:07.640
I'm not going to go into my kettle bells situation again this time.

1888
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.280
Actually yesterday I worked at,
I didn't do kettle bells.
I did.

1889
02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:12.470
I did you that was,

1890
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:17.590
it was like an article that said that those little goblet squats upwards but

1891
02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:21.680
not,
yeah,
that was a funny article for sure.

1892
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.790
Laughed.
You know what the title was called?
Something along the lines of,

1893
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:28.030
I'm trying to make remembering exact,
it's,

1894
02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:33.190
it was called 14 ways to avoid being bigger to remain a puny little weakling.

1895
02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:38.830
Actually puny I think.
No,
do we,
do we be within there?

1896
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:42.470
So apparently given number whatever number that was,

1897
02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:46.100
I'm going to remain a puny little dweeb apparently.
Here's the thing,

1898
02:02:47.090 --> 02:02:49.980
are those really goblet squats though?
Cause Goblet Squat?
No,

1899
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:53.360
I know it should do you do that?
You basically do a front squat double rack,

1900
02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.090
double rack yet cause Goblin is like,
cause this is the form,

1901
02:02:56.091 --> 02:02:59.310
the shape of album that here and that's how you hold it.
Yeah.
It is kind of,

1902
02:02:59.770 --> 02:03:03.480
well what if you use like a huge ass kettle bell?
I'm a metcon.
Yeah,

1903
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:05.990
that could work.
In fact,
I mean respect to the author that,

1904
02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:10.690
I forget who wrote it or whatever,
but it was a real subjective really.
You know,

1905
02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.900
I think it was more of like a shock article.
Kind of just feels the laugh.

1906
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:20.150
But if you take that serious directive out there trying to help people that have

1907
02:03:20.151 --> 02:03:21.200
skinny knees

1908
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:30.590
proud of though,
is he real proud of that?
I looking look at you anyway.

1909
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:36.320
I didn't really like the article on that level,
but for a laugh it was good.

1910
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.040
And and factually,
here's the deal.
We're kettlebells are alleged yet.
Yeah.

1911
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:44.870
And they are cross religion.
But here's the thing,
there was a good point.
Hey,

1912
02:03:45.150 --> 02:03:47.810
yeah.
I'll tell you what.
You know what you're talking about,
what you,

1913
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:51.700
what you used to,
you're good at what you're used to.
Yeah.

1914
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:54.340
For some reason I hurt my wrist or something.
Yeah.

1915
02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.210
Or I heard something and I couldn't do back squats or front squats.

1916
02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:02.960
I was,
yeah it was,
maybe there's more,
maybe it was my shoulder.
Anyways,

1917
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:07.550
I was doing goblet squats with the,
uh,
with my big kettle bell,

1918
02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:10.670
which is 40 kilograms and I,

1919
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:15.850
I had put on the schedule of what I was going to do like 25 it was a bunch of,

1920
02:04:16.511 --> 02:04:20.810
it was a metcon scenarios,
but the first number was 25.
There was 25,

1921
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:25.290
2015.
Oh the reps.
Yeah.
Those are the rest 25 hurt.
Yeah.

1922
02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:30.170
Yeah I was Dang cause it's only,
it's only 88 pounds.
Right.
That should be in,

1923
02:04:30.171 --> 02:04:31.520
that should be pretty insignificant.

1924
02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:34.780
But you really do when you do those goblet squats.
Yeah.

1925
02:04:35.090 --> 02:04:39.690
You're using your whole body to keep that thing alive.
Yeah.
It's good.

1926
02:04:39.691 --> 02:04:44.520
Olympic my,
yeah,
I think I'm used to it now.

1927
02:04:44.521 --> 02:04:45.810
I think that,
yeah.

1928
02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:48.390
And I got used to it and it's pretty short period of time that that's what was

1929
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:49.290
cool.
Yeah.

1930
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:54.420
So on at.com you can get that kind of stuff there if you want the cool ones.

1931
02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.390
I think I and I don't know,
cause then you know I didn't,

1932
02:04:57.391 --> 02:05:01.080
haven't ventured out and I don't think I ever will venture out to go see where I

1933
02:05:01.081 --> 02:05:04.320
can get other kettle bells from.
No need really.

1934
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:09.180
Cause you can buy the regular ones or the adult ones and let's face it man,

1935
02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:12.060
you take enough pictures of the dolt ones for your Instagram,

1936
02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:17.290
wherever you take pictures for and you kind of can't go back.
You can't.
Mm.

1937
02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:21.690
So keep that in mind yourself into a kettle bell.
Exactly.
Right.

1938
02:05:22.090 --> 02:05:26.950
Anyway,
you and your social media,
yeah.
Have painted yourself into this yes.

1939
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:31.680
Corner,
which is not a bad thing necessarily on a.com/jocko.

1940
02:05:31.681 --> 02:05:33.000
That's where you get these things.

1941
02:05:33.001 --> 02:05:35.310
Painting myself into a corner with my social media.

1942
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:38.340
I'm going to wake up everyday at four 30.
Yeah,
you've got to post it.
Guess what?

1943
02:05:38.341 --> 02:05:40.290
The other day I got home at three o'clock in the morning or I got,

1944
02:05:40.291 --> 02:05:43.770
I didn't get to sleep until like one 30 and when I woke up in the morning I was

1945
02:05:43.771 --> 02:05:45.810
really tired.
Yeah.
And uh,

1946
02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:47.580
<v 1>okay.</v>

1947
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:50.880
<v 4>I was,
gee,
what am I going to do?
I'm,
I'm painting in the corner.
I had to say,</v>

1948
02:05:50.881 --> 02:05:55.170
hey guys,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm going back to sleep.
And I actually went back to sleep.

1949
02:05:55.470 --> 02:06:00.460
I told everyone,
Dan.
See that's good though.
You took accountability though.
Light.

1950
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:05.490
That's just lying.
Which I don't support.
Oh,
if you didn't do that,
if I said,
Oh,

1951
02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:08.130
if I woke up,
took a picture of my watch,
which I've had people say like,
Oh,

1952
02:06:08.131 --> 02:06:11.000
I bet you just wake up.
Or did you ever sometimes just wake up in the morning,

1953
02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:13.740
take a picture,
you're watching to go back to sleep?
No,
actually I don't do that.

1954
02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:17.100
Yeah.
It doesn't seem like you could ever bring yourself to do that.

1955
02:06:17.101 --> 02:06:19.860
We'll look why would even want it,
you know?
We didn't want to do that.

1956
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:22.550
It's a horrible scenario.
It kind of defeats the purpose,
right?
Yeah.

1957
02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:25.950
The whole purpose.
So the other day woke up,

1958
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:31.290
took a picture of my watch,
and I was like,
I got to go back to bed.

1959
02:06:31.291 --> 02:06:35.710
I'm too freaking tired.
So in fact her bed,
but you didn't post it note?
No,

1960
02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:41.450
I'm going back to bed.
I'm sorry.
Hold the line for me.
Yeah,

1961
02:06:41.490 --> 02:06:43.620
I think you're on the cover for me actually,

1962
02:06:43.621 --> 02:06:45.630
that one time we got home cover and snooze.

1963
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:50.280
You guys covering it after that would be over here.
Snoozing.
Well,
hey,

1964
02:06:50.281 --> 02:06:53.150
that's the freedom part though.
Well,
we always say discipline.

1965
02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:57.930
You have the freedom to,
hey man,
you got us sometimes,
but you can't like,
um,
well,

1966
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:59.940
especially if you're working out and you don't,

1967
02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:03.930
you straight up don't get enough sleep.
I'm not saying you don't.
You don't,
right.

1968
02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:09.030
That's not what I'm saying right now.
But if you,
the proverbial you,
us,

1969
02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:12.400
when we don't get enough recovery.
Uh Huh.

1970
02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:13.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1971
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.220
<v 4>Which sleep is recovery,
but that's not a good thing,
man.</v>

1972
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:21.270
So every once in a while you got to exercise that restraint

1973
02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:27.790
in the form of the freedom to sleep in.
Yeah.
Well I did.
Amen.

1974
02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:29.080
That's part of life.
Anyway,

1975
02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:31.730
on it also the whole painting yourself in the corner of gate.

1976
02:07:31.731 --> 02:07:33.940
So I got this jump rope and it's like,

1977
02:07:33.941 --> 02:07:38.080
you know that I know how up to date you are on the new general technology

1978
02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:41.500
getting better.
They're,
yeah,
they're dope.
And here's the thing.

1979
02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:46.240
If you just buy a regular jump rope,
like you'll see the difference.

1980
02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:49.450
And I mentioned that because I got an a on it jump rope.

1981
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.280
I told you about the time my neighbor taught me how to do the crossover,

1982
02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:55.840
and that's what it really hit me like.
This is the dope jump rope.

1983
02:07:56.890 --> 02:08:00.850
So if you want to upgrade your jump rope,
boom on it,
that's the one in fact,

1984
02:08:00.851 --> 02:08:04.150
just go on there.
See what,
what up.
See what they have.
A lot of good stuff,

1985
02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:06.610
a lot of good stuff.

2000
02:08:59.830 --> 02:09:02.650
That's a good way to support.
Also,
Jack was a store.

2001
02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:05.920
It's called Jocko store chocolate store.com.
There are hats.

2002
02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:10.980
They're good hats.
Trucker hats,
flex fit three colors.
Wait,

2003
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:12.940
flex fit their flex him.
Wait,

2004
02:09:12.941 --> 02:09:17.580
they don't have the little thing in the back were snapped back,
snapped back.

2005
02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:22.050
No,
I think their flex fit and they don't make trucker hats that are flex it.

2006
02:09:22.051 --> 02:09:26.670
I don't think they do now.
Oh,
okay.
Pretty sure I'm fairly positive there.

2007
02:09:26.850 --> 02:09:29.900
Their hats and their,
their dope.
Yeah.

2008
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:33.790
I thought you were gonna bring me nine of them.
Yeah,
I didn't do that.
That was,

2009
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:37.010
that's a bummer.
Jocko has a store,
but TACO has no hats.

2010
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:41.560
There is,
Oh,
you know what?
There's this other kind of hat.

2011
02:09:41.561 --> 02:09:46.510
I think it's called like,
like an operator hat.
It's like real simple.
Anyway,

2012
02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:49.900
I'm thinking about doing that one too.
Interesting.

2013
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:53.920
In the event of you not being as into the trucker hat is maybe something else

2014
02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:59.140
will see flex it as well.
That's my thing is flex fit.
Cool.

2015
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:01.630
Is that good?
Yeah.
Flux.
It has purpose.

2016
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:04.350
I just have never seen a trucker's hat flex fit.
Yeah.

2017
02:10:04.410 --> 02:10:08.050
And I doubt I'm going to see one now.
No Man,
it's the new stuff apparently.

2018
02:10:08.110 --> 02:10:10.780
But yeah,
some of the stuff on there.
There's some shorts on there.
Cool stuff.

2019
02:10:10.810 --> 02:10:14.770
Jock Leven has a shirt that he designed,
which is cool layers if you will.

2020
02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:18.640
Um,
just,
I like the way you promote the shirt that has your picture on it.

2021
02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:20.291
You proud of that aren't,

2022
02:10:20.291 --> 02:10:23.290
you know I'm not actually because I didn't want that one.
No,
I didn't want,

2023
02:10:23.291 --> 02:10:25.480
I didn't want my picture on there actually.
That's true.

2024
02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:26.620
I gotta give you that Echo.

2025
02:10:26.621 --> 02:10:29.820
Did Not want to have an echo shirt cause it does to me.

2026
02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:32.260
Demanded it vetoed it.

2027
02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.580
[inaudible] called Jocko store.
I got some pull.
Yeah.

2028
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.240
Italians dark.
And I'm not saying to buy this shirt.
I'm not saying nobody a hat.

2029
02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:44.630
I'm thinking,
go on the store,
drugstore.com again,

2030
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:51.200
if he liked something,
get something good support.
Also

2031
02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.820
psychological warfare,
if he didn't know what that is.
It's an album with tracks,

2032
02:10:56.850 --> 02:10:57.750
Jocko tracks.

2033
02:10:57.810 --> 02:11:02.580
And these tracks help you get through moments of weakness in your campaign

2034
02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:04.530
against weakness.

2035
02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:09.330
Every once in a while when you wage these hard campaigns against weakness,

2036
02:11:09.331 --> 02:11:14.130
against your,
you know,
waking up early,
sticking to the Diet,

2037
02:11:14.131 --> 02:11:19.110
workout,
all this stuff.
Sometimes you get moments of fatigue,

2038
02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:22.530
sometimes even the strongest have their moments of fatigue.

2039
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:27.090
That's affirmative.
So this psychological warfare,
these tracks,

2040
02:11:27.091 --> 02:11:30.270
they're like little spots for those moments of fatigue.
Get you through it,

2041
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:35.310
no problem.
Psychologically,
then you act boom.
So yeah,
that's a good one.

2042
02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.620
So if you're,
you know,
waking up early,
like I said,
you're waking up early,

2043
02:11:37.621 --> 02:11:40.650
you feel like even the snooze,
listen to psychological warfare,

2044
02:11:40.651 --> 02:11:44.250
one of those tracks on there,
I think it's called get up and get after it.

2045
02:11:44.610 --> 02:11:47.580
You will not hit the snooze.
Good one.
Yup.
That's it.

2046
02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:52.260
It's like electrical repaired.
Jocko Willink anywhere,
iTunes,
uh,
where else?

2047
02:11:52.261 --> 02:11:55.440
Amazon music,
all these places where he,
where they sell mp3s.

2048
02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:59.750
You can get him there.
Yup.
Uh,
yeah.
This book that,

2049
02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:04.770
that we covered today by Mike Bordin,
by Tommy Norris and by Dick Couch,

2050
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:08.430
you can get,
you got to get this book.
It's a great book.

2051
02:12:08.431 --> 02:12:12.180
It's a great read and that's a good place to start.

2052
02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.290
So much more detailed than I went over today where we just as I was walking out,

2053
02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:19.020
Mike and his wife and I was telling her that,

2054
02:12:19.021 --> 02:12:23.760
I was explaining to him that it's like the debrief I wanted since I was an e

2055
02:12:23.761 --> 02:12:28.230
four in the navy to wanting to know what happened and wanted the details.

2056
02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:31.260
Well now we got them and there was some crazy details.
By the way.

2057
02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:36.930
He's crazy.
He's,
he's,
he's talking about how,

2058
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:41.640
yeah.
You know,
my friend gets his forehead blown off or whatever.

2059
02:12:41.641 --> 02:12:46.260
You can see his brain,
all this stuff,
even in a movie that,

2060
02:12:46.261 --> 02:12:50.210
that'd be pretty graphic scene.
Even a movie that'd be unbelievable.
Lucky back,

2061
02:12:50.230 --> 02:12:53.700
all of that movie wasn't really realistic because the guy had his head blown off

2062
02:12:53.701 --> 02:12:56.700
and then he lived.
But that was a crazy part though,
right on that movie.
Yeah.

2063
02:12:56.750 --> 02:13:00.270
You know,
but yeah.
Well it really happened.
Oh.
So He's,
you know,
he has him,

2064
02:13:00.330 --> 02:13:03.880
his other guy,
he shot by the way,
and he's like,
and he's going,
you know,

2065
02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:04.411
through the ocean,

2066
02:13:04.411 --> 02:13:07.950
all this stuff and shrapnel in his back from the made that he threw back five

2067
02:13:07.951 --> 02:13:12.030
times.
Yeah.
It's so crazy.
Yeah.

2068
02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:14.850
And then we're sitting here and he safe.
He's sitting right there.

2069
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:18.300
That's the guy who really did that.
You know,
he's not,
I mean,
respect.

2070
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:22.260
Of course acting is cool and dope furrow,
but that's not an actor.

2071
02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:26.610
That's the guy who really did it heavy.
But that's heavy.
Yeah.

2072
02:13:26.670 --> 02:13:30.240
It's crazy.
Um,
so get the book,
read about it,

2073
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.070
read the rest of details that

2074
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:35.430
<v 0>we barely even scratched the surface on.
Uh,</v>

2075
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:39.000
also some other books you can get,
you can get a book called extreme ownership.

2076
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:40.600
It's about leadership.
Yeah.

2077
02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:42.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2078
02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.960
<v 0>It teaches you how to lead.
Sure.</v>

2079
02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.760
It's a book that I wish I had when I was a young leader,
but I didn't have it.

2080
02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.500
I wasn't old enough to have written it and giving it back to myself yet.
Yeah.

2081
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:57.740
It doesn't work like that.
Also,
we're speaking of being young.

2082
02:13:57.770 --> 02:13:59.570
You need another book called the way of the warrior kid,

2083
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:03.110
which is awesome because kids all over the place,

2084
02:14:03.111 --> 02:14:07.220
like parents now when I'm speaking somewhere,
they bring their kids.
Yeah.

2085
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:10.880
So I get to meet these kids,
kids that are getting graft riff,

2086
02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:14.570
which is pretty awesome.
So where the warrior kid

2087
02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.520
as so many kids are like doing pull ups now.
Yeah.

2088
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:20.530
So I'll just going to get some real thing.

2089
02:14:20.531 --> 02:14:24.370
My daughter will be like bothering me debt that I want to do.
Pull ups.

2090
02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:28.860
[inaudible] she didn't want to go.
You don't get that from reading Cinderella.

2091
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:33.990
Cinderella did not make her want to want to do that.
Right,
right.

2092
02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:36.990
I did tell her the story of Cinderella last night.
Coincidentally.

2093
02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:39.620
She really wouldn't want to do any pull ups about it though.
No,

2094
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:43.710
I didn't compel her to go do any compel her to eat better.
No.

2095
02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:47.850
Did it compel her to study hard?
No,
she just said it was beautiful.
Okay.

2096
02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:52.560
So compelled some thoughts of beauty but it didn't compel any change of

2097
02:14:52.561 --> 02:14:54.840
direction and that I know no action taken.

2098
02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:58.030
I'm going with the way of the warrior King Bay.
Me Too.
Uh,

2099
02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:00.400
also discipline equals freedom.

2100
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:05.510
Freedom field manual is coming out that could compel you to get after it.

2101
02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:11.220
Yeah,
it could.
I check it out.
There's no books like it

2102
02:15:12.930 --> 02:15:14.710
and it's like it's a manual.

2103
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:19.640
You know how like when you listen you're like,
okay,
I can,
you know,

2104
02:15:19.710 --> 02:15:21.810
you kind of get a feel,
but I know there's nothing,

2105
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:25.240
there's nothing vague about the manual.
It tells you what to do.
Yeah.

2106
02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:29.070
And it also talks about some thoughts that are in my head.

2107
02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:32.430
So it is interesting.
You can get it.

2108
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:38.420
I appreciate it.
Also origin Maine,

2109
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:42.650
you already covered that,
which is good.
That is now us by the way.

2110
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:43.963
We're partnered.

2111

2112
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:54.280

Come and get it.
If you're on the path of getting after it.
Yeah.

2113
02:15:55.460 --> 02:16:00.460
Do it with us at origin and also if you want to partner with us from a

2114
02:16:01.491 --> 02:16:04.760
leadership perspective in your business.

Me,

2116
02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:11.660
Leif,
Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,

2117
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:16.990
info@echelonfront.com don't Google and look for Jocko speaking cause that's

2118
02:16:20.871 --> 02:16:24.410
going to give you a speaker's agent that's going to charge you more money.

2119
02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:28.160
Is there something going to be like a bureau or speakers bureau,

2120
02:16:28.170 --> 02:16:30.140
a speaker's agent,
what they do and,

2121
02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:32.860
and they're trying to provide a service they're trying to get,

2122
02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:36.940
they're trying to connect speakers with people that need speakers,

2123
02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:41.740
but we don't need anyone to connect us with people that need speakers.

2124
02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:46.600
You can go straight to echelon front.com right.
So that's that.
Also

2125
02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:52.540
the monster,
September 14th and 15th in San Diego.
Just to clarify,

2126
02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:57.670
the first three monsters were based on the same material because we did it on

2127
02:16:57.671 --> 02:17:01.030
the west,
on the east,
and then in the center of the country.

2128
02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:06.220
Just to clarify,
now that now this muster muster for is a new material,

2129
02:17:07.390 --> 02:17:10.480
so it's different.
New approaches.

2130
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:15.430
New Stories is not sold out yet,
but it will be.

2131
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:18.520
So if you want to come register now,

Are you on there?
I am on there and I posted Ah,
snap so far.

2140
02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:57.710
One snap and it disappears after 24 hours.
Yeah.
So you can't go,
I'm good.

2141
02:17:57.711 --> 02:18:01.430
I'm still working to figure out like how I'm supposed to utilize this thing.

2142
02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:04.850
Yeah.
So we'll continue working on that one.

And uh,

2145
02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:21.100
tell anybody else sits out there who thinks maybe you're being overwhelmed or

2146
02:18:23.050 --> 02:18:28.050
you think the deck is stacked against you or you think you can't go on anymore.

<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2148
02:18:30.470 --> 02:18:31.640
<v 0>Think about Mike Thornton</v>

2149
02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:39.120
and remember that you are capable of so much more

2150
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:48.400
as long as you never give up and keep getting after it.

2151
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:50.313
<v 1>Hm.</v>

2152
02:18:52.730 --> 02:18:54.290
