This is Jocko podcast number 37 with Echo Charles and me,

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.370
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.340
good evening and with us tonight.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.430
I am honored to have retired Chief Warrant Officer Roger Hayden here with us

7
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.090
tonight as a guest.
Now,

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:35.091
unless you are in the seal teams or you were in the seal teams,

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.310
then you likely don't know who Roger Hayden is.
In fact,

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.670
I'm going to go ahead and guarantee you don't know who Roger Hayden is.

11
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:47.850
There's no book,
there's no movie,

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.810
there's no social media,
there's no one to Google.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.750
And I've talked before about how there's three types of guys in the seal teams,

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.710
the guys that built the reputation that the seal teams has,

15
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.600
the guys that maintain the reputation of the seal teams,

16
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.940
and then there's the guys that live off the reputation of the seal teams and

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
usually those guys didn't contribute much to it in the first place.

18
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.610
But let there be no doubt Roger Hayden is without question,

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.720
without question.
One of the people,

20
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.470
one of the men responsible for building the reputation of the seal teams.

21
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.440
He did the massive heavy lifting in,

22
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:42.441
laid down the foundation of everything that the seal teams are in the jungles of

23
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
Vietnam and he passed on lessons of combat written in blood that we carry to

24
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:57.300
this day.
One of the guys here,
Roger Hayden,

25
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:02.301
that truly forge the attitude that makes the seal teams what the seal teams are

26
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.270
and I'm going to tell you quickly how I first heard of Roger.

27
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.950
So I was back.
I was a new guy at seal team one,

28
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520
so it's 1991 and back then no one reads,

29
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:22.140
the seals weren't that popular yet and the old seal Udt seal reunions,

30
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.570
we're not that big of a deal there.

31
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:28.571
They were just kind of a small little gig down at down at like the lion's club

32
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:33.180
or something and national city.
Real low key.
But the only guys who,
none of the,

33
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.450
none of the younger seals went to moves all Vietnam seals.

34
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:41.160
Maybe a couple of World War II guys.
And I was down there.
I was with my,

35
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.950
my running mate at the time,

36
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.180
my good friend who's at seal team one who had gone through Buzzworth guy by the

37
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.860
name of Chris and we were just sitting around talking to some old Vietnam guys

38
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.910
and we were getting pretty fired up.
You know,
it's kind of,
there's,

39
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.300
you don't want,
you pay the $10 fee,
get into this Gig,
there's free beer.

40
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.680
So we were a few beers deep you might say.
And we listen to stories and again,

41
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.890
we're new guys.
This is 1991 we didn't never been in combat.

42
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.040
So we were there to try and learn about the history and learn about the guys.

43
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.381
And finally me being young and dumb and pretty well buzzed,

44
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.730
I asked these two Vietnam guys that we were sitting there talking to,

45
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.860
<v 1>I said,
hey,</v>

46
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.440
<v 0>who was the most bad ass burger and mother fucker and seal in Vietnam?</v>

47
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090
And both these guys looked at me and said,
Roger Hayden,

48
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.990
and I remembered that name.

49
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.390
And when I actually met you for the first time you were,

50
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.320
I'd met you a couple times.

51
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:51.090
But then when I actually worked with you for the first time,

52
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:54.840
you were laying greater on a,
on a platoon full mission profile.

53
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.290
And that's actually the first time I learned,

54
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.130
truly understood the concept of cover and move,

55
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.910
which is a basic tactic,
which guys didn't know.
No one had taught it to me.

56
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.280
This was my second platoon.
I'd already been through a workup.

57
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.930
I had the idea in my head,
but here,
and you say it the way you described it,

58
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.750
I said it clicked in my head and I never forgot it.

59
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:18.840
And I actually wrote about it in the book extreme ownership.

60
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.240
And it's what I talked to all the seals that when I was putting in through

61
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:25.320
training,
that's what I told him.
One of those fundamental tactics.

62
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.490
And so

63
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.003
<v 1>that's</v>

64
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.690
<v 0>kind of my,</v>

65
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.970
my introduction to Roger Hayden.
So Roger,

66
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.420
I know you've actually literally never done an interview before and I want to

67
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:45.690
thank you for coming on.
It's,
it's a true honor to have you on the podcast.

68
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.643
So welcome.

69
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.650
<v 2>Yeah,
Roger Hayden here.
Thanks Jocko.
Really appreciate it.</v>

70
00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:56.370
And you're one of my heroes who different environment,
different times.

71
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.350
Did you kicked ass and took names to the um,
I wasn't,

72
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:04.470
I was uh,
just one of the boys in the,
uh,

73
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.760
in seal team one when I got there and deployed a couple of times with them.

74
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.871
And uh,

75
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:13.920
our environment was the jungle and we got pretty good at it and went out and

76
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:18.750
hunted the bad guys.
Nobody else in Vietnam,
as far as I know,

77
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.380
army marines or any of them were to go out at night.

78
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:25.620
They would usually hold up in a base camp or something like that while we

79
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:29.100
figured nighttimes when they move around that then we're going to move around

80
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:32.010
and see if we can find these guys and take 'em out.
And that's all we did.

81
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.840
It isn't,
um,
one guy.
It's a team effort.

82
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.520
Everybody works hard.
I had some great,
great buddies of mine that were,
uh,

83
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.620
I mean my gut and partner was a stoner guy and I was a 60 guy between the two of

84
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:51.570
us.
He shot a thousand rounds a minute,
nine to five,
five oh seven,
six to my 60.

85
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:55.080
At a worked out well,
last platoon I was in,

86
00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.110
we carried for sixties and five he didn't carry a stoner or a 60 he carried a 16

87
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.140
with a two oh 300 or x nine one 48 for back in the day.
Guys

88
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.390
<v 0>say those numbers again of how many guys were carrying sixties and stoners.</v>

89
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.490
<v 2>Four of us were carrying sixties and fire guys carried stoners out of a 14</v>

90
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.540
member too.
That's what we operated.

91
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.030
<v 0>So for those of you civilians out there that are listening,</v>

92
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.870
that's a lot of firepower.
Yeah,
that's,
that's a way you bring the thunder.

93
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.660
And so we're,
where'd you grow up though,
before you got in the team's,

94
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.730
where'd you grow up?
Basically

95
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.870
<v 2>my rook and what I look at,
my dad was a carpenter,</v>

96
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.410
so we moved quite a bit around,

97
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:38.411
but it was a place called rule Nan Montana by the flathead lake in Montana.

98
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.820
Rudy have the mission range in a real,
real brief area.

99
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.460
I grew up green,
breaking horses and stuff like that and uh,

100
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.960
building tree houses and just,
uh,

101
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.280
working on my grandpa's farm and my uncle's ranch and stuff like that.

102
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.490
So that's kind of where I grew up at.
I lived a wild Phoenix,

103
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.610
Arizona on stuff like that.
And,
um,

104
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.930
it says here in the next thing sports.
Well,
I played football outside linebacker.

105
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:09.620
I boxed her two years in high school and I swam.

106
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.700
My Dad built,
worked on the tram and palm springs.

107
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.340
And when he was there I went to palm springs high school.

108
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:18.260
So I got on the water polo team there.

109
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.760
<v 0>So let's say you got a little comfortable in the water.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

110
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.100
So at what point,

111
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.040
what year was it when you actually decided you're going to join the navy?

112
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.920
That was 1965.

113
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.340
And did you know already know about the seal teams will know?
Nope.

114
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.470
Nobody knew about him.
My Dad,

115
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.220
<v 2>uh,
like you said,
he was a carpenter,
but he was in,
um,</v>

116
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.640
Udt three and it was at swam on the Incheon Harbor in Vietnam.

117
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.130
But I did,
and I'm not Vietnam,
Korea,

118
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:53.710
but I didn't know anything about it because he never talked about it.

119
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.530
So your dad was a frog?
Yeah,
but I mean that's,

120
00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.550
I knew guys that knew him over older guys.
I mean,
when I was young guy,

121
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:04.570
like you said you were when your document,
you know,
so anyway,

122
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.750
but he never said much about it.
But,
uh,
when I was a kid,
you know,

123
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:12.430
I watched the bridge of the river Kwai and uh,
their guns and never own.

124
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.170
And I also seen the marines hidden beaches and rangers getting wiped out and

125
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:19.090
they went,
okay,
if you're going to fight,

126
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:21.730
you want to get in something that you think you're going to come back with.

127
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:25.780
So that's why I became a frog man.
And,
uh,
we didn't go through buds.

128
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:29.800
It was UDT already under water demolition training.
So,

129
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.870
<v 0>so you joined the navy.
Did,
did,
uh,</v>

130
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.750
did you go straight to straight to underwater demolition?
Oh,

131
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.370
<v 2>no.
Back in the day they wanted you to have an ace school.</v>

132
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.090
So I got a bootcamp and 65 went to north island in core nautile for about seven

133
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:52.021
months waiting for my radiomen school and was lucky enough to go to 22 weeks of

134
00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:55.000
radio one school and then went from there,

135
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.880
us as Paul revere for about four months and then went to a training and I

136
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.870
started turning January 6th,
1967

137
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.100
<v 0>how big was your class when you showed up to that?</v>

138
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.530
<v 2>There was about,
I don't know,
200 of us,
maybe,</v>

139
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.180
maybe 150 how many guys made it?
There were about 30 of us that made it,

140
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.520
which was pretty good and it was colder than shit.

141
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.010
I don't know how you guys did when you went to turning Jocko,

142
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.220
but we made a pact that we weren't going to let anybody quit and we did

143
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:28.380
everything we could to make that happen.
So,

144
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.290
and some guys did make it through there.
We shouldn't have.

145
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.990
<v 0>Yeah,
that's one of the,
that's one of the things I've talked about with laces.</v>

146
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.640
You see that and I was never instructor buds,
but eventually you say,
no,

147
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.840
you don't want to help people through.

148
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.000
They're not going to make it through on their own.
You don't want him,

149
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.390
you know that you got to get,
guys are going to get through it on their own.

150
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.703
You know what I mean?

151
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.090
I figured I had a guy was a,

152
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.810
there was a previous fleet guy and he had been to bud's before and I became

153
00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:59.050
friends.
He's a second class mature guy.
And I thought,
yeah,
this guy,

154
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.020
I'm going to kind of kind of follow his lead a little bit,
you know,

155
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.800
second night of hell week he quit.
I was just,
I was laughing.
I'm like,
go like,

156
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.980
here's a mature guy.
27 years old,
you know,
I was a kid and he's quitting.

157
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.680
Ridiculous.
So then you,

158
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.390
but when you got done with the initial Udr a,

159
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.590
you went to,
uh,
you checked into Udt,
right?

160
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.320
<v 2>Yeah.
[inaudible] 12 was really funny because I'm,</v>

161
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.920
me and our good friend of mine up in Flagstaff where he joined in,

162
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.460
we decided we're going to be marine.
You know,
his dad,
you Guadalcanal,

163
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.540
you name us,
uncles.
Did you use a marine?

164
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.420
But he talked me into it too.
So we went up to join the marines.

165
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:47.421
Well that office was closed and right across the hallway was the navy recruiter

166
00:10:47.891 --> 00:10:50.610
and there was a both made of the line,
you know,

167
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.020
lean against the door and he goes,
what are you boys doing?
Oh,

168
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.160
we're going to join the marines,
you know,
which,
you know,
it's all good.
Yeah.

169
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.870
And he goes on and asked the other guy or what?
Your parents' background,

170
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:02.400
everything.
Marines,
marines,
marines.

171
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:06.190
So he knew what he was going to need to have a cue.
Well,
my dad was,
uh,
uh,

172
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.210
in the navy achieving Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
He says,
come here son.

173
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.290
So my buddy went off to be a marine.
I went in the navy

174
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.990
<v 0>that close.
I think we all have a story like I know,
really close.</v>

175
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:23.880
So yeah,
I had a buddy,
Bruce,
we were,
we were,
we saw like some,

176
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.390
some ship pulled in and we saw a guy's marine uniforms and we were like,

177
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:31.830
let's go join.
Let's just go,
Julie.
That's how effective that recruiting tool is.

178
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.460
Oh yeah.
So luckily I luckily live a longer open,

179
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.300
<v 2>but the marines or the navy officers open,
so recruiting office</v>

180
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.170
<v 0>and so he showed up at Udt in what was the schedule there?</v>

181
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.980
I mean the Vietnam war was already on.
So now it's like is it 1966 now?

182
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.620
<v 2>No,
I didn't.</v>

183
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.621
God got one into Udt 67 I graduated from training a single mile 1967 and that's

184
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:00.280
when I went over to hub Udt 12.
Yeah,
the word been on.

185
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.730
And then we had heard a little bit about seal team but it's still dead.

186
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.640
Nobody knew much about it cause we're everybody.

187
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:11.350
I graduated with East Coast and west coast.
You went to a Udt team first,

188
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.280
then you did a trip with Udt,
then you came back and got an sale team.

189
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.580
And how was that?
How was that first trip with Udt?
Oh it's great.

190
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.640
I would did a nine month trip and we had different debts that you went to and

191
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.530
uh,
in Vietnam,
like,
Oh,

192
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.150
first thing we did is go to Denang place called camp 10.
Sean.

193
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:32.380
We worked up at food way,

194
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:36.700
way quaint Tree Dung Hall all over the northern part of,
um,

195
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.650
of south Vietnam doing demo work,
different things,
you know what I mean?

196
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.780
And then we left that debt and one on the USS Diatchenko and we did about 110

197
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:50.710
miles of beach recons.
And then from there we went,

198
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.960
some of us went down to a debt and the,
uh,

199
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.530
<v 0>Willow's hydrographic or,
or where they're just perpendicular,</v>

200
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.340
perpendicular,
parallel,
not perpendicular,
but most of them are parallel.

201
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.950
We didn't do any perpendicular,
is that your combat?
You know what I mean?
But so,

202
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.350
so for those of you that don't know the original job of one of the original
jobs,

203
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:15.410
the Udt was to find out how deep the water is off of a beach.
So,

204
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.590
and obstacles and if there's any obstacles there that could trip up a boat

205
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:25.830
that's coming in.
And so you said you did 110 miles of the three months,

206
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.120
and so you basically you have to swim with a lead line.
So you have a,

207
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.140
a cord with a,

208
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.350
with a piece of lead on the bottom of it and you've got different markings on it

209
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:39.590
to tell you how deep,
how long it is.
And you sit there and you swim along.
Yeah.

210
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.370
<v 2>Gray every 25 meters.</v>

211
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.350
You have a beach party on the beach and it has a swimmer line going out.

212
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.250
And we added hooked to an IBS in case we got interest from that.

213
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:54.150
Ibs could turn and get us out of there.
We all grab onto the course.

214
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:58.310
It was only nine and a half horsepower ranges.
So you didn't go out very fast.

215
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:01.640
And we are able to swim fast every 25 meters.
You'd take sounding,

216
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:05.670
sounding soundings when you got back to the Diatchenko,
then he could tog refer,

217
00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:07.410
which I was lucky enough to be one.

218
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.090
You'd go up a hydrographic charts right when I got the Udt 12.

219
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.940
Um,
you know,
you're pretty regimented and I'll call it budget as you,

220
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:18.740
Tory Burch,
you're pretty regimen bud.

221
00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:22.710
When we got there are per tunes aren't even formed up and you were kind of lost

222
00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:26.490
at sea.
You know what I mean?
Nobody's really telling you what you have to do.

223
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.660
You're not in a petunia at.
And it was kind of kind of floating,

224
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.500
you know what I mean?
You went up and did a um,

225
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.580
lifeguard stuff for the marines when they did land dunes up by Pendleton and

226
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:41.760
stuff like that.
It wasn't really a lot to do.
You know,
we're going to Jesus,

227
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:43.950
you know,
played volleyball lots and stuff,
you know,

228
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.380
ran around your UDTs and oral boots,
you know.
So,

229
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:51.340
uh,
then we started forming up,
uh,

230
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.570
how Udt worked is that you'd,

231
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.660
they'd be home for nine months and then the whole team would deploy in,

232
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:01.220
relieve the team that was out there.

233
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.700
Like we relieve Udt 11 and 11 would come back.

234
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.000
Nine months later they would come out and relieve us.

235
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.210
So it was a nine month deployments and almost port and starboard,

236
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.210
you didn't have like a year.
And a half,
two years of workup.

237
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:15.320
It was about nine months,

238
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.510
<v 0>months with a workup.
And there was the workup.</v>

239
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.220
W w what did you do during the workup?
Oh,
we did everything

240
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.410
<v 2>saying we did recons we did demolition raids.</v>

241
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:28.200
We did a river recons who we,
uh,

242
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.370
just how many guys were in a Udt platoon.

243
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.010
<v 0>18 or 20.
I made,
it might've been 20.</v>

244
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.080
It was quite a bit because you've got the swimwear line,

245
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.120
Beach Party and all that other stuff.
You know what I mean?

246
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.820
We did the old guard platoons.

247
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.890
We always try to get a couple extra guys cause we needed him to cover more
beach.

248
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.730
Same deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,

249
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.730
everything you did and we'd do a just,
it was just a lot,

250
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.090
<v 2>you know what I mean?
And it was a lot of physical work to,
you know what I mean?</v>

251
00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:58.700
Everything.
You need key.
Actually when we went through training,

252
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.090
I think we did about 50 times more swimming than the guys doing buds now.

253
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.680
Cause that's what we're,
we're,
we're frogmen so

254
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.680
<v 0>more women than we did a bug.
That's a lot of this weapon.</v>

255
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.310
I'm glad I went through buds instead of that while don't surf out there and in

256
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.340
January it's pretty cold.
There's no doubt.
And when you were there,

257
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.730
you were telling me before about some of the kind of hooking on to some of the

258
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:29.000
conventional units or some of their operations that they did with the,

259
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:31.270
I think it was the ninth infantry.
So we were down

260
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.910
<v 2>in the delta or no,</v>

261
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:39.450
we were doing river recons and I think we're the only ones that ever did with

262
00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:43.850
this.
They called him the darts and it would look like a jet ski,

263
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.200
but you laid on it and you guide it with your feet and it had a 355 degree

264
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:54.730
camera up on top and the fat domino in the bottom of it and it had a piece of

265
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:55.600
aluminum.
I like this.

266
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:59.570
Of course we wouldn't get hit with the props and stuff and the handles were are

267
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.540
on the right and left,
you know what I'm saying?

268
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.290
And they went up to about 30 knots.
What they would do is take two of us,

269
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:09.910
either by chop or something,
drop us in a canal and we'd come down that canal.

270
00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:13.000
Then we got back,
we do a,
uh,
a charter of that,

271
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:18.150
of that canal and a that would let the 19 inventory in their riverine boats?

272
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.240
No.
If they could go up there and do a land unit,
not,
not.

273
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.770
That's one of the things we did.

274
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:27.910
Of course you only went down on the river maybe once or twice and you didn't,

275
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.650
<v 0>I don't want anymore.
Would you care for,</v>

276
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.730
would you carry like a sidearm when you're on that?

277
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.720
We had a 45 in the front of the cover there and that's what we had.

278
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:39.820
We had a black jacket on,
a helmet,

279
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:45.150
UDTs and Gajda whether she would you do it at night or in the daytime?

280
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.550
Daytime.
Oh,
daily.
And then you know,
with would that 350

281
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.380
<v 2>degree camera across a canals coming into pagodas.</v>

282
00:17:55.381 --> 00:18:00.060
Anything that was a known thing you could find on a map would take a picture of

283
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:00.811
as we went down,

284
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:05.490
you'd tried to stay at the same speed all the way down because otherwise your,

285
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:06.960
your chart wouldn't be good,
you know,

286
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.740
but we could really did that and we couldn't do it too much.
So,
uh,

287
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.120
I mean just a different rivers and different canals and stuff.
So we got bored.

288
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:16.540
So we started going out with the ninth,

289
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:20.580
10th and tree on those river boats to be their demolition guys,

290
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.390
blow up bunkers and sometimes they'd put log dams across the river.

291
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:28.650
We blow those up and stuff.
And I mean,
we took some heavies on that,
doing that.

292
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.650
So it looks,
so what kind of situations did you get in when you were,

293
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.160
when you're riding up with a ninth infantry?
Well,

294
00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:39.020
we got caught in an ambush one time.
They usually had about seven,
about five,
six,

295
00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:43.010
seven boats.
They had a bolt in the front called an Alpha Bolt.

296
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.750
It looked like your old monitoring,
the civil war.

297
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.060
And then they had um,
um,

298
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.650
like the landing craft they had those were bar arm or on the side.

299
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.710
Then they had a fifties up on top and back there that build up and they had bar

300
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:03.210
armor so that if a B 40 rocket punch you in,
they had rural,

301
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.690
thick styrofoam so that it would just be channeled into one area.

302
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:10.890
If they hit him from the sites,
then they had thirties to thirties on each side,

303
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:14.700
each one of the landing craft type of boats that they put the troops in.

304
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.260
And right in the middle of that was what they call a monitor new scene that that

305
00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:22.190
was,
that's over and CISM field.
That's a great big boat.

306
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.520
And then to back they had another Alpha bolt and then all the ones in between.

307
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.950
So who was the,
was it one of those navy boats where they army boat,

308
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.540
the navy as a navy guys doing that?
I wouldn't have that job for anything.
Yeah.

309
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.960
So anyway,
we just going up and a group had won it before,

310
00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:41.500
has dropped their people off and they came right by us.
As soon as we got by him,

311
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.190
uh,
they opened up on us and it was a bad day.

312
00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:48.460
We had a 30 [inaudible] 70 wounded Americans.
Yeah.

313
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.120
And like the Alpha bolt head of us,
everybody.

314
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:55.750
But one guy was killed on it and that boat was floating by and he stared at the

315
00:19:55.751 --> 00:20:00.190
American flag flying.
And there's one guy on the back on the 30 still shooting.

316
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.010
I mean,
you know,
there's no one wants to cracks me up when I not cracks me up.

317
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.590
It tears me up when I think about that.
But it was just,

318
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:10.540
that's the American finding guy,
you know,

319
00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:15.490
that's the way we are not give those riverboat guys all the credit in the world

320
00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:19.000
on those tango boats because they're just sitting targets,
you know?

321
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.420
And then after we got hit,
of course,
uh,
we all got,

322
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.310
we were in the fourth bolt back and we heard number one bolts hit.

323
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.780
That was the Alpha boat number two boats hit number three boats head.

324
00:20:31.781 --> 00:20:34.530
We're number four,
but there were three of us.
Udt guys not voting.

325
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.040
I remember looking over a guy named you going,
we're fucked.
Excuse me,

326
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:40.270
I shouldn't have said it.
Anyway.

327
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.670
Then we got head blew us all down and stuff and I've of we buddies,

328
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:47.260
I had about 53 pieces wrapping him.

329
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:50.890
So I called over to him and hit him with morphine,
got up in the navy.

330
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:52.480
God got blown off as 30,
you know,

331
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.460
so I shooting that until I ran a rounds and shit.
Well the other guy,
um,

332
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.653
no,
that was,

333
00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.883
<v 0>I got here,</v>

334
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.310
<v 2>the other guy y'all messed up so he goes over and didn't see my pins,</v>

335
00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:06.060
who was call her.
So he had seen with another,

336
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.820
<v 0>they're showing the morphine he lived though.
And then</v>

337
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.340
<v 2>who got a,</v>

338
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.380
we just started shooting or the sides and stuff in the army guys who wouldn't

339
00:21:15.381 --> 00:21:19.210
get up and shoot it.
They're handing us up weapons issue.
Well,

340
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.250
an old numbers and giving them to us and we were up there hammering

341
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.190
<v 0>and you know,
sometimes you get a frogman.
Yeah.</v>

342
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.520
Then the cobras came in in a army cobras and hose everything down real good.

343
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.100
So would they,
were they doing like an actual landing?
That's not,
the purpose was,

344
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.580
and they were going to get a beach foothold.
Work in area for awhile

345
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.090
<v 2>can make a sweep through there.</v>

346
00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:42.100
And don't ask me why the marines weren't doing it.
And when they had the nine,
10,

347
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.860
I tell you why the marines weren't doing it.

348
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.900
Was there a holding the DMZ up in north?
They shouldn't marines,

349
00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:52.290
that's their job.
But the ninth infantry did a good job.
They are good troops.

350
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.140
You know what I mean?

351
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.250
<v 0>Well,
you,
I know you haven't listened to this,
this podcast much,</v>

352
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:00.350
but I know you have,
you have read the book that Leif and I wrote and you,

353
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:03.970
you know,
that I have nothing but uh,
nothing but the most order,

354
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.560
highest respect for the marines and the army units that we work with were just

355
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:09.251
phenomenal.

356
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:12.970
And the sacrifices that they made and the bravery they showed on the battlefield

357
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:15.520
was unbelievable on a daily basis.

358
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.330
So I know it's definitely something you'd think about this.
Now,

359
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.050
<v 2>the training that we went through just for Udt to start with,</v>

360
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.440
and then I came back from the dean,
went through seal team,
so you get all the,

361
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.500
what you guys call SQT.
We'd call it a category back in the day,

362
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.590
and then you go over again.
You've already had your feet and a gun.

363
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:40.150
Now you figure he's armor guys go through basic training and a lot of them had

364
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:41.860
viral to Vietnam.
You know what I mean?

365
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.890
And they could be in a Shau valley anywhere and and where where the crapper you

366
00:22:47.791 --> 00:22:51.880
get the hit the brick and you imagine that we had the training,

367
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:55.150
we were volunteers,
we've volunteered for war,
we're going to do,

368
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.830
we weren't just saying,
here you go.

369
00:22:56.831 --> 00:23:00.130
We knew exactly where we were going to go and we wanted to go.

370
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.050
You know what I mean?

371
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.170
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Big differences.
No.
Another weird thing about Vietnam,</v>

372
00:23:04.171 --> 00:23:07.220
and I've talked a lot about Vietnam books from Vietnam.

373
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:12.570
There were Vietnam here and you know,
the fact that these guys would rotate out,

374
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.850
you'd be in the middle of a deployment.
You just,
you know,
guys,

375
00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:16.350
we're just rotating out all the time.
You know,

376
00:23:16.351 --> 00:23:18.270
it wasn't like what you just described,

377
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.750
what you did in the seal teams and in Udt and what we still do in the seal teams

378
00:23:21.751 --> 00:23:23.700
now is you get with your guys,

379
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.540
you go through a workup with those guys together as a team.

380
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:30.810
Then you go on deployment together as a team and you come home together as a

381
00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:34.110
team.
And the army guys,
they would just,
yeah,

382
00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:36.540
they're just filling in the holes and the guy would go home and another guy

383
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.340
would take his place.
So he never worked with this.
You know,

384
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.650
you could have a guy on a patrol with you,

385
00:23:40.651 --> 00:23:42.810
two or three guys you've never worked with before and you're going out on patrol

386
00:23:42.811 --> 00:23:45.740
with them.
So it's a,
I don't that system.

387
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.890
I like the way we do it reminds me of Forrest Gump,
you know,
that was,

388
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.300
what were you good little fee?
What happened?
No.

389
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.350
The new guys that came into the platoon.
Oh yes.
Checking in.

390
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.280
Everybody had already been there already and they're just coming in.

391
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.140
They hadn't worked up with these guys,
nothing.
They were just showing up,

392
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.030
you know,
in Boston.
Then we actually did take a couple of guys in.

393
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.100
When I was in Ramadi,

394
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:10.830
we took a couple of guys that just showed up new guys and we just had to slowly,

395
00:24:10.831 --> 00:24:15.320
you know,
we put them in the Washer.
Do you have people that were taken out?

396
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:18.140
That's why they came in and they were just guys that were filming and we did.

397
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.750
We lost guys,
but they were just guys that they,

398
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.550
they got sent to seal team three from SQT and when they got there there was no

399
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:27.350
one there.
So they brought him over on deployment.

400
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.280
A couple guys was like two or three guys and we just,
you know,
okay,

401
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:34.700
here's w we made him work in the compound for awhile and then maybe bring them

402
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:37.880
out.
They'd be a turret gunner on nop and maybe eventually get loved,

403
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.970
do a little bit more,
but yeah,
that's perfect.
Yes,
we should do it.

404
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.500
And so any other,
any other Reese?

405
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.450
<v 2>Yeah.
So another time we were [inaudible],
we used to be on the front bolt,</v>

406
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:55.451
the alphabet because there were the first ones that saw the log damns or it had

407
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:58.250
a blow up bunkers and shit.
And we had about

408
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.100
a big stack of c four in the back,
you know,
the average actually shit,
you know,

409
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.070
and all of a sudden the whole boat shook like this.

410
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:11.660
We've got to be 40 rocket right.
And one of the exhaust tubes.

411
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.070
And we started sinking.

412
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.500
So we give the Cox and ran it to shore and everything and we're shooting back

413
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:22.580
and everything but the fucking boat thinking and that it had been about another

414
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.790
Adh is hired.
It hit all that c four but we landed and uh,

415
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.910
[inaudible] we swam off and got out in the river and this other,

416
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.350
they called it a Zippo bone.
It was like to troop carrier bolt.

417
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.830
It was all napalm or not napalm,
whatever.
They go out in flames,
the worst,

418
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:44.570
you know,
flame thrower bolt.
And this ain't just weren't on the beach,
you know.

419
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:48.770
And we went and climbed up on that.
We got out of their day us than the crewman.

420
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.320
That was,
uh,
that was another moment of excitement.

421
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.380
<v 0>You know,
it's,
just to go off of what you just said too,</v>

422
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:59.390
and with the training that you get in special operations,
seal teams,

423
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.570
whatever,
Rangers SF is,
you know,

424
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:07.460
a lot of times we in special operations get a lot of praise for doing what we

425
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:09.080
do.
And that's great and everything.

426
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:11.800
But like what you're talking about being in a conventional unit,

427
00:26:11.801 --> 00:26:14.900
it's the same thing over in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Being a conventional guy,

428
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.700
it's no joke.
I mean it's,
in many cases they're doing a much more dangerous job.

429
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:22.330
I mean even,
you know,
a logistics job,

430
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.160
something like that where they're exposing themselves on a regular basis.

431
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:29.510
So anybody out there that's a civilian at that thinks that the conventional guys

432
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.070
aren't doing,
you know,
aren't taken as many risks as a special operations guys.

433
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:37.760
I'm telling you right now.
They absolutely are.
They absolutely are.

434
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.310
And of course there's things that the,

435
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.220
that all special ops guys do that a step it up as well.
But everybody,

436
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.250
everybody pays a price and everybody takes a lot of risk when they go over
there.

437
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.430
And it sounds like it was the same thing when you had the ninth infantry role in

438
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:51.264
up the river.

439
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.840
<v 2>You're good day.
I did get new jobs.</v>

440
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.450
If I seem to say anything derogatory,
I apologize.

441
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.880
<v 0>Oh No,
you didn't.
The boys were getting it all.
You didn't know.</v>

442
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.140
I'm just pointing out a lot of times,
again,
people,
I'm sitting here thinking,

443
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.800
I'm thinking exactly what you just said.
Here you are,
you EDT,

444
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:10.540
you've been through all this training and you,
you know,

445
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.790
when that boat started sinking,
you're like,
Hey,
I'm going to jump on the swim.

446
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.770
There's regular army guys there.
They're,

447
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.590
they're thinking they haven't had the training that you've had and yet they're

448
00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:20.120
still in the same,
almost the same exact situation.

449
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.000
<v 2>Exactly.
So one other thing,</v>

450
00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:26.290
and Udt we're doing a beach recon and I was a cartographer,

451
00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:28.910
so I'm up in front with another guy and um,

452
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.650
I have this big huge piece of plexiglass I'm doing all the backdoor information

453
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:37.650
on,
but I'm ahead of him.
We're putting in the stakes.
So the guys behind him,

454
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.340
he had every 25 meters and do their sound needs and stuff.
Well,

455
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.130
we didn't.
Usually we had Arvin,

456
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.160
which are your a South Vietnamese army or we had marines that would do screening

457
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:51.670
for us.
You know,

458
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.220
when we were doing the beach recons we couldn't get either one of them.

459
00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:59.050
So he had to have her own guys doing it.
So they were walking,
going behind.

460
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:03.710
It was all,
um,
a lot of sand dunes and stuff like that on the beach,
you know,

461
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.601
trees,

462
00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:09.601
little forest in itself while we almost walked right into an l shaped ambush

463
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.570
that they had set up for us,
except the two guys back here,

464
00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:18.150
that aspire hole back here.
So that when we fell back from the ambush,

465
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.920
if any of us were still living in,
these guys would get us right.
Yeah.

466
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.760
They hit these guys.
So made them open up,

467
00:28:24.761 --> 00:28:28.870
which made him open up earlier than we leap frog down and got out of there.

468
00:28:28.871 --> 00:28:31.300
But that was a,
that was a few moments of excitement too.

469
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.230
And that's when I got back to the U S die.
She ain't gon,
I went,
you know,

470
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.770
screw this a naked warrior shit.

471
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.150
Jimmy has sexy and carry me up and let me go out and hunt these guys at night.

472
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.870
I don't like running down the beach and UDTs and you know,

473
00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:50.650
my choral boots shoot an m 79 been heads down and shit.
You know what I mean?

474
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.870
It was a,
but I was just Udt then so I didn't talk too much about it.
You know,

475
00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:00.510
it wasn't a seal.
So you get back from that deployment?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

476
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.450
Every month when I was on the deployment mean a guy named,

477
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.740
we'd put in a chip to go to seal team when they had just your asses out.

478
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.100
He ain't going anywhere until we get back,
you know.
All right.

479
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.440
So we'd wait a month and put another chit in.
Well,

480
00:29:15.441 --> 00:29:18.830
when we got back poon we weren't right to,
uh,
um,
um,

481
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.060
cadre go and checked into seal team one and then one and two a cadre

482
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:28.310
<v 0>and the cadre training was,
was what we call now the estimates,
the Slt,</v>

483
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.030
your ids,
that stuff

484
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.350
<v 2>in the,
actually on the Alamo River.
And a few other places.</v>

485
00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:39.970
They had it set up to be exactly like it would be in Vietnam with watch your

486
00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:43.960
little watchtowers and they had a whole um,
uh,

487
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:48.550
village that was in amongst all the shit that's on the side of the Alamo River

488
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:52.060
and stuff.
It was really good training.
Yeah.
And then we'd do that.

489
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:55.810
Ambush ass had Amboy,
Sam,
they'd come down in,
um,
you know,

490
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:59.890
sand pans we had there and stuff like that.
And just like on a,
you know,

491
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:01.570
and you do an ambush on a river,

492
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600
you always want to try and do it at a curve and hit him.

493
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:08.020
So that way the sand pans after he hit him and stuff,
have flown to the bank,

494
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.230
not keep on going down the river and you can't get nothing out of him.

495
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:16.330
Just all kinds of little tricks.
And what they did,
our cadre at ran a,

496
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:17.400
through the,
uh,

497
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.050
our cadre of instructors were guys that had just gotten back and they pulled

498
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:27.120
them out of platoon to do that for about six months before they went back into

499
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.850
another Bluetooth.

500
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.230
So we were getting continuous guys right out of the field and Vietnam,

501
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:36.580
which is all good in different areas to the triple canopy shit,

502
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:40.120
you're mangrove stuff and you know the rice patties and all that stuff.

503
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:43.840
Like you do a bulk of the training.
Oh,
out at an island.

504
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.280
And then we'd go up to Queer Maca for map and compass and stuff.

505
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.210
And then a bunch of us went through a,
what they called CEO advanced training,

506
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.310
which is for your approved program,

507
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:59.320
which was a five months long in that though is all tradecraft medical and stuff

508
00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:02.140
like that.
And really,
really good,
uh,

509
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:07.160
gut really honed in more even on the ids and stuff like that.
And we,

510
00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.120
we took trials until trills all kinds of stuff.

511
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.320
<v 0>Yeah.
It's interesting as you talk about that,
how much of that stuff you know,</v>

512
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:18.660
carried on to you?
When I showed up at seal team one,
you know,
we did that all,

513
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.960
we did booby trap trails,
you know,
there was no one,

514
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.080
it hadn't been a war going on for 20 years when I got there,

515
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.330
the old and the Gulf War.
But we still did booby trap tales.

516
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:28.860
We did point man courses,
we did the medical stuff,
we did river ambushes.

517
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:33.070
I mean it,
it's,
it's,
it's awesome that that in,
there was no,

518
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.540
it wasn't really written down anywhere.

519
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.680
<v 2>Two weeks of advanced demo on kitchen table demos because we set all that up and</v>

520
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.460
she'll keep one.
I know what you had.
She had a show been going.

521
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.360
<v 0>That's awesome that it lasted that long,
you know,
with,
no,</v>

522
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.540
cause the weird thing about seal team is we didn't used to have anything written

523
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:54.990
down.
I mean it was barely anything written down.
And so all that,

524
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.370
all that knowledge was passed word of mouth from guy to guy to guy.
And that's,

525
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.210
I think we've corrected that now where we capture more of the stuff.

526
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.793
But you know,

527
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.600
<v 2>you ever one flight rangers get the range your handbook.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

528
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.930
That's the only thing I had against that a little bit.

529
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.870
It still should stay in house.
It should be rolled down.

530
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:18.800
But you know what I'm saying?
I don't,
you know,

531
00:32:18.801 --> 00:32:22.180
and give you a ranger handbook can you can find out exactly how those guys are

532
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:25.240
going to fight,
what their methods are.
Everything.

533
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.880
<v 0>Another thing I've talked about on here is when you have doctrine and you get</v>

534
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:32.290
tasked with something that's not the doctrine and you get confused,

535
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.540
you don't know what to do.
That's one of the,

536
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.780
that's one of the reasons I think seal teams have been very successful in the

537
00:32:36.781 --> 00:32:38.450
recent past.
A even in the,

538
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.930
even in the longer past is because we didn't have a book to look at.

539
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.390
We had to figure out how to do it and so no matter what the mission is,

540
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:46.890
we always had a fresh look at it in a damn.

541
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.900
<v 2>We're an Orthodox way,
right?
I mean,
you know our guide you,</v>

542
00:32:51.901 --> 00:32:56.560
if you had pulled a platoon right out of Vietnam and put him in Ramadi or

543
00:32:56.561 --> 00:33:00.850
somewhere would have been lost at sea because we didn't have the training for

544
00:33:00.851 --> 00:33:03.650
the urban type of warfare.
Yeah,

545
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.310
I know you wouldn't have been lost at sea.

546
00:33:06.311 --> 00:33:08.800
I know you would say principals are the same.

547
00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:12.070
The same principles that you guys taught me was the same thing we did over
there.

548
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.680
Have figured it out over move.
Take the high ground.
Yeah,

549
00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:15.760
we would've figured it out,

550
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:18.940
but you know we didn't have Overwatch is and stuff like that.

551
00:33:18.941 --> 00:33:22.930
When it's pitch dark at night and you're working your way through real quiet,

552
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.310
not making a lot of noise.
Yeah.
Everything you do is we're,
you know,
being,

553
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:31.900
being silent or just like you guys never had to do things like,

554
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.860
you know,
in a real town line,
the point scout did well,

555
00:33:35.861 --> 00:33:39.740
he had to step over and grabbed the guy behind him,
bring in his hand down,

556
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.850
showing where that wire was and he had step over the wire.

557
00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:47.680
He had put his leg over and grabbed the guy behind him and that's how we got

558
00:33:47.681 --> 00:33:51.010
across until we get everybody across and got a head count,
they would move on.

559
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.100
That's just who we trap stuff.
You know what I mean?
We that,

560
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.040
that's just a new did it and you couldn't see it was pitch black.

561
00:33:57.041 --> 00:33:59.470
That's where he grabbed the guy's hand,
children where it was.

562
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.770
And if it's a Taiwan,
you don't cut it.

563
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:07.490
If it's all losing stuff that how old the wool,
the point held the point man.

564
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.090
See that now you had what they called,
we used,
um,

565
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:15.580
you take a twig ruling on a real,
no,

566
00:34:15.581 --> 00:34:16.414
no string on it,

567
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.440
but just like a fishing pole and used to run that up and down like that.

568
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.760
We moved and you'd feel it.

569
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:25.630
You can feel it just like you would if you've got a trout or a bite and then you

570
00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:29.320
work your hand down,
you Rico there and feel and see what that is.
Yeah.

571
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.040
<v 0>Ninja.
Yeah.
You went the other,</v>

572
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.690
the other interesting thing that when you started talking about seal team and

573
00:34:37.691 --> 00:34:42.691
going out at nighttime and how that was all unorthodox and people weren't doing

574
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.190
it,
is the opposite of what when we were in Ramadi,

575
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.080
we started going out in the daytime.

576
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:48.970
And the reason we started going out in the day,

577
00:34:48.971 --> 00:34:50.860
there was a bunch of reasons why we started going out in the daytime.

578
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:55.600
But one of the main reasons was the enemy knew that we own the night.

579
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.090
We had night vision,
we had there,
you know,
we,
we own the night.

580
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.660
And so they didn't want to go out at night until they went out daytime.
That's,

581
00:35:01.661 --> 00:35:04.230
and they tell planted their id just so they kill people.
That's what,

582
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.550
and so we went out the daytime because that's where the bad guys were out.

583
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.590
<v 2>Datetime in Vietnam too.
You'd see guys sleeping in hammocks to share.</v>

584
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.110
We'd wrap them up because I knew there they had been out at night doing shit.

585
00:35:17.111 --> 00:35:19.790
So who we wanted to talk to him,
you know,

586
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.130
just like a rules of engagement and shit.
When we got,
uh,
my last platoon,

587
00:35:24.131 --> 00:35:28.960
we stopped in Saigon and went to Mac for v and our Lt,

588
00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:33.700
God has orders,
you know,
and his orders were pacify the vin long province.

589
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.010
Wow.
That was his orders.
Pacify the long province,

590
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.370
Roger that we went off and did it.
Yeah,

591
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.510
no rules of engagement,
nothing.
Just pacify it.
And it was like,
okay,

592
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.070
we didn't work for the army,
navy,
marines or anybody who we were our own entity.

593
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.360
So if you'd been the LTE over there,
Jocko,
you'd had,
you'd had the con,

594
00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.510
<v 0>matter of fact.
Yeah,</v>

595
00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.950
<v 2>they uh,
were at Dong Tam,</v>

596
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:04.040
they had a naval base here and then the big army base here,
Dong Tam,

597
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:08.990
they had a stay on the Vietnamese navy base in between them because the navy

598
00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:12.320
didn't really want us on their base plus or bolts are right down there in the

599
00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:15.920
war.
So it worked out perfect.
You know what I mean?
Then we'd go to the army to,

600
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.960
you know,
to test her west side.
Yeah.
And they were doing that all the time.

601
00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:24.230
So it wasn't like,
you know what I mean?
It wasn't anything unusual,

602
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.093
you know what I mean?

603
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.240
<v 0>So,
so going back now,</v>

604
00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:32.420
you get back from your first appointment with Udt,
you go to the seal team,

605
00:36:32.421 --> 00:36:35.410
you show up,
you're going through the training.
What was the,
what was the,
kind of,

606
00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:36.670
talk to me a little bit about this before,

607
00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:38.620
but how were you getting treated because you got,

608
00:36:38.621 --> 00:36:41.890
you got wounded on your first deployment as a ut guy,
right?
Yeah.
So here you are,

609
00:36:41.891 --> 00:36:44.920
you're a combat veteran,
you've been in the shit,
you've been wounded.

610
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.930
We called it a Viet Cong achievement medal.
So,

611
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.170
so you shell up at seal team one,
you're kind of like,
Hey,
I'm a,

612
00:36:53.171 --> 00:36:56.440
I'm an experienced veteran,
I've been through shit and didn't mean shit.

613
00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.490
And they just,
the guys there,
how'd they treat you?
Well,

614
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.050
<v 2>all right.
Just the same.
I mean,
I'd had a trip with EDT,</v>

615
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:10.070
but just about everybody that when your team came out of Udt 11 or 12 into seal

616
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.450
team,
you know what I mean?

617
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:15.900
Back in the day before they started bringing them right into seal team,

618
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:19.770
the new guys,
you know,
so it wasn't any different.
There were guys there.

619
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:24.060
You just had to learn.
I mean,
I didn't,
you know,
when I was in Udt,
I'll tell you,

620
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:28.020
I wish I really wanted to go.
Like when we were Dong Tam,

621
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:33.290
that was during the 67 68 10 and we got a call that the east coast platoon,

622
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:38.100
the metal,
which wasn't too far away from Dong Tam was being overran.

623
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:41.640
Luckily they were up in a tall building,
so they,
they held out real good.

624
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.290
They were the tallest building and they had a 57 recoilless and you can hear the

625
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:49.710
VC coming up,
the stairways to throw grenades down and shit like that.

626
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.270
And they needed some help.

627
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:56.271
And there were about 17 of us down on that dark patrol on the USS Benoa right by

628
00:37:56.311 --> 00:38:00.750
Dong Tam.
And we begged her,
Lieutenant Goddamn,
let us go in there.

629
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.800
We'd been fucking killed.
Our heart was there,
but we didn't have the eye,

630
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.140
a IED training,
immediate reaction,
you know what I mean?
None of that shit.
I mean,

631
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:13.830
we had been,
it would have been stupid.
So old.

632
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:16.590
He's our lieutenants had known we hated him,
you know.

633
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.100
Then I got back and went to a cadre or SQT and did all that stuff and then

634
00:38:24.061 --> 00:38:26.850
deploy.
The next time I saw John Odie shy,
hugged him.
I said,

635
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:28.200
you are one smart son of a

636
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.660
<v 0>vegetarian or heart was there,
you know what to be,
but Udt you'd just</v>

637
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:37.510
<v 2>trained to operate on land.
He didn't have the uh,</v>

638
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.740
that prerequisite skills that you learned in SQT and stuff.
You know what I mean?

639
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.760
And you get,

640
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.080
he get more of that even in buds now than we ever got because we were trying to

641
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:51.740
be a frog man.
That was it.
I mean,
our last op,
we did it.
Thank you.

642
00:38:51.741 --> 00:38:55.660
Many island and it was,
we swim scouted in by bird shit rock.

643
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.860
And I can tell you this shit I'm talking about,
they gave us 40 pounds of demo,

644
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:04.120
have her sac.
We went 26 miles down to the other end of the island,

645
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:09.690
blew up at target and come 26 miles back and attack the camp guys.

646
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.280
As we were patrolling that ambitious and they'd pick out guys had been killed.

647
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:16.930
Pretty soon we were all fold down and they'd go,

648
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:19.060
God damn it would tell you who he shot.

649
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.420
Then they get to go back to the camp and defend it when we came back and

650
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.810
attacked it.
But it was still just a demo rate.
Do you know what I mean?

651
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:27.140
It wasn't anything,
uh,

652
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.930
patrolling real good patrolling tactics and all that stuff that you learn.

653
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:32.880
You know what I mean?
Uh,

654
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.230
I mean like I went out with the Australian SAS in Nui did and did a,

655
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.730
um,
a week,
uh,
out in the field.
Oh,
as a week or was it,

656
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.750
yeah.
Uh,
my second platoon,
two of us,

657
00:39:48.751 --> 00:39:51.390
we had the Aussies come down and work with us and they loved it.

658
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.360
Then we went up to Nui Dat.
That's a 60 guy.

659
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:58.810
We went up and went out with them.
We did a 10 day patrol with them,

660
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.280
resupply and all that stuff.
They never talked.
Said one word.

661
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.430
That whole patrol was all hand and arm signals.
That's awesome.
And they would,

662
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.330
they would get an ill,
you pee at night,
everybody with their feet out.

663
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.700
You need your lane on your pack,
have your weapon,
right?
Actually,
yeah.

664
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.180
Pull what they called the silk.
Yep.
And you'd go to sleep.
Well,

665
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.720
didn't sleep for about two nights because that's when we usually went out and

666
00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:21.830
work.
Then we started to,

667
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.990
cause the way they figured it was in a real noisy area and somebody in that

668
00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:31.820
circle would be awake and if we got sprung or something then you have 360 degree

669
00:40:31.821 --> 00:40:35.360
fire power and we get out of there.
But they were the best I've ever seen.

670
00:40:35.361 --> 00:40:35.901
I've been to,

671
00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:40.901
I went to army ranger school rate of herb school and everything and that one 10

672
00:40:41.751 --> 00:40:43.310
day patrol.
The Austrians,

673
00:40:43.311 --> 00:40:48.200
I learned more about reconnaissance and I did anywhere,
anywhere.

674
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.190
No,
we know we used to have guys from the sis come to come to team.
I know.

675
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:56.170
Yeah they did.
We had that program for a long time but they were,

676
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.920
the last guy we had there was an officer and he wasn't worth a shit.

677
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:01.480
But some of the sergeants we had,

678
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.780
the guys that were there when I showed up were we're really squared away.

679
00:41:04.781 --> 00:41:09.040
Guys that definitely had their field craft down.
Oh they're so good and fit.

680
00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:10.060
That's what I was trying to say.

681
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:15.230
The field craft we did in Udt didn't have the field craft to be out in the

682
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.940
jungle looking for people and shit.
You know?

683
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:23.070
That's why in Udt 13 some of the guys got killed and stuff down trails and shit

684
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:24.510
like that.
They didn't,
you know what I mean?

685
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.440
Got to kind of have their shit together a little bit.
Yeah,
so,

686
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.440
so you go to the cadre training,

687
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.070
you check into your platoon and

688
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.900
<v 0>it's time to go on deployment.
You are you flying?</v>

689
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:37.640
Where are you flying out of flying out of North Island?

690
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.770
<v 2>Yeah.
We fly out on North Island and my first book tune,</v>

691
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:46.130
we flew into camera on bay and then took choppers down to a place called new NAM

692
00:41:48.601 --> 00:41:52.500
can,
which is the very southern part of South Vietnam,

693
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.990
right by a place that called the human forest.

694
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.880
<v 0>Do some turnover ops with the guy with the other platoons that were there.</v>

695
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.730
No turnover.

696
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.810
<v 2>We didn't,
we didn't at that time,
matter of fact,</v>

697
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:05.810
most of our ops were dark board off's.
You ever heard of those?
No.

698
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.970
That's where you put a map behind you and you choose one of the guys and it was

699
00:42:09.971 --> 00:42:13.160
a tune.
You throw a dark behind you wherever the dart hits is,

700
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:16.400
where you're going to go into.
Because we didn't have intel,
we didn't have shit.

701
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:21.290
We were pretty isolated where we are in a Vietnamese base camp and and BF,
Egypt,

702
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:23.390
you know what I mean?
So that's how we went out.

703
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.000
<v 0>Is it,
what did you do in like a do an helicopter insert or a river answer?
Yes.</v>

704
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:33.840
<v 2>All River.
Actually out of a new Nam Cam where we were,</v>

705
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:38.100
we'd take sand pans out because we didn't even have any MST support or anything.

706
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.870
That guys down at sea flow dead,

707
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:45.030
which is a ways away from us to our other squad was there and finally they

708
00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:47.520
pulled us out of new Nan can because we weren't,

709
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:52.210
we were doing stuff but it wasn't,
it wasn't effective.
It wasn't real bad yet.

710
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.310
So they brought us down to see flow.

711
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:56.430
Then we started getting some good ops down there and you know,

712
00:42:56.431 --> 00:42:59.910
what were those ops lights?
We still did riverine ops,

713
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:03.150
like we went down to a place called square bay and uh,

714
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.540
cause we heard there was a prisoner of war camp and stayed down there for about

715
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:08.580
three days watching this trails,

716
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.840
seeing if we could see him moving and stuff like that.
We'd do ambushes,

717
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:16.410
we'd get Intel from our navy Nilah which still wasn't that good.

718
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.910
Oh one of the things in 69 that was the first platoons and 69 was uh,

719
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.240
we landed at New Nam can got her stuff off the old 46 that Landon is there and

720
00:43:26.581 --> 00:43:31.530
put it in the bunker.
And then this little loge came in and landed.

721
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.970
Do you know?
No,
I don't know his name,
but yeah,
he was,

722
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.520
he was approved guy in that province that we are in down there.

723
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.570
So he came in and told us,
yeah,
if you guys need anything,
just let us know.

724
00:43:43.571 --> 00:43:45.760
And as soon as that load load load,
she left.

725
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.950
We got mortared for about an hour and a half.

726
00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:51.450
So we told him never to come there again cause they knew what that loach was.

727
00:43:51.451 --> 00:43:52.630
Yeah,
he was approved.

728
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.180
It was approved guys now great Ui.

729
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.930
But uh,
yeah.
And he was approved down long hair,
you know,
bearded,
you know,

730
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:08.060
<v 0>the platoon setup was you had an OIC and AOI see a platoon chief and an LPL kind</v>

731
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:11.300
of like what you'd run well,
what we'd ran into two squads,

732
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:17.060
<v 2>the uh,
you know,
appeal and just like what you did.
Just the same one.
Exactly.</v>

733
00:44:17.061 --> 00:44:21.470
Yeah.
And then we broke it down.
You know what I mean?
You had your like,
uh,

734
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.130
I was with the AA OIC and the last book too,
and I was in,
was with,
uh,

735
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:31.740
with,
with uh,
it was my AIC.
Really?
Yeah,

736
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.940
that was a,
when was that 89 Pale.
Yeah.
No,

737
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:42.480
that's awesome.
But he was a Muslim it fun.
Yeah.
He used a great guy.
Awesome.

738
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:46.350
But I'm just saying he was hugely AOAC cause you always see,

739
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.530
we had the Lpo old work with him.
Then I would,
you know,
have a,

740
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.530
you know,
the kind of guy.
He was a senior chief then.
Yeah.

741
00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.180
That's awesome man.

742
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.260
I don't know if he knew any of them.
They're all in my platoon,

743
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.760
my radio one horse radio when I ever had in my life.
You know,

744
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.790
I can imagine I went to radio school,
like I told you,

745
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.830
I guess he never carried a radio on the team.
Really?
You never carried a radio?

746
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:24.210
No.
As a 60 gunner until I made LPO.
Then I went to the m 14.

747
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.810
I like to seven,
six,
two round.
Yeah.
That's the uh,

748
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.740
that's kind of the stand when I went,
I went through SQT that they told us,

749
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.560
if you're not caring to item 14,
you're,
you're wrong.
Yeah.

750
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.090
That's a great weapon.
It's accurate.
It's perfect.

751
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:42.990
I love doing a bunch of guys.
Ramadi carried the m 14 as well.
Yeah.

752
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.940
Cause they're shooting,
you're shooting at vehicles,

753
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:47.880
you shooting do buildings shooting and he put the h,
the uh,

754
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:53.070
our AP rounds in there and you can dig through some stuff.

755
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:58.020
Yeah,
we did six months deployment and I did three deployments.
I did,
um,

756
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.640
1969.

757
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:04.641
I was in a Kalo platoon and then came back from that.

758
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:08.670
Then they actually got out for a year and a half because I was married and my

759
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:10.380
wife talking to get now.

760
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.440
So I did and worked for the phone company as a cable splicer painted everybody

761
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:18.350
and everything.
We lived in corn auto,

762
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.500
so I'd go down the trade winds and all my buddies would tell me what grade trips

763
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:26.580
or having stuff and I just went.
Now what year was that?
That was um,

764
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.610
[inaudible] 70 71 that was the only got back in 69.

765
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.720
So when you got back in 69 you got out for a year and a half?
Well about a year,

766
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:40.860
maybe not quite a year and a half,
but I went back in and gotten another platoon,

767
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.850
lack of lane and went to Vietnam again,
70 71 and I had

768
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.120
guys like that and that probably,
that was a great book.
Dune.
And what was that?

769
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:54.620
What was that now were you,
you were an Lpo.
That platoon,
no suicide.

770
00:46:55.490 --> 00:47:00.300
Get in Africa,
but yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
And what was that?

771
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:03.780
Was there any difference between that first seal deployment to Vietnam?

772
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.550
I'm real happy with the first deployment because we just didn't do a lot.
I mean,

773
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:13.350
it was okay,
we did some stuff,
but it wasn't my idea of what it should be,

774
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.530
you know,
as a seal.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah.

775
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.810
And then it was better when it got down to see float and it's still,

776
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.380
you know what I mean?
But that second platoon,
the one that kept me in the navy,

777
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.710
you know,
they were just,
uh,
you know,
we're a band of brothers.
You know what?

778
00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:29.860
And we were so close.
It was unbelievable.
I mean,
I love those guys.

779
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.190
<v 0>The,
the difference in what you did,</v>

780
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:35.120
was it the missions that you got tasked with it?

781
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.330
The way that the platoon commander kind of set things up so that he had a better

782
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:43.610
vision of what,
what to do and what to get after?
Absolutely.
I was

783
00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.990
<v 2>then my second platoon,
that guy was just unbelievable.
I mean,</v>

784
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:51.440
he was just a really,
really good,
our first platoon it was,

785
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.240
and he was kind of nuts who we didn't like him.

786
00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.780
Like one time we're all cleaning or weapons on the sea float and everything.

787
00:47:59.781 --> 00:48:02.480
And what we used to come back when off is grab a line,

788
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:06.500
then you jump in the water and let it wash all the mud off.
Yeah,

789
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.510
well he grabbed the line,

790
00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:13.130
jumped in and we had music real loud and cleaner weapons and shit.

791
00:48:13.131 --> 00:48:17.750
Well the line wasn't tied off right?
So he just started going down the river,

792
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:21.780
but they saw him in the watch tower and said,
man overboard and went and got it.

793
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.413
<v 0>You know,
something that,</v>

794
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.090
something that we talk about on here and I sub I've experienced is his album

795
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.960
blue on blue situations take place.

796
00:48:30.961 --> 00:48:35.130
And it's really hard for people to understand how it happens.

797
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.220
But I know that you had,
you had one of those happen.

798
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.650
You want to kind of give a quick debrief on that.

799
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.830
<v 2>We're about ready to go home.
We had a new platoon come in.</v>

800
00:48:43.831 --> 00:48:47.550
They wanted to do a breakin up,
not mentioning any names of the officers,

801
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:50.310
but they wanted to do a hammer and Amro up,

802
00:48:50.311 --> 00:48:54.870
which you just don't do with a brand new platoon.
And we'd been there.

803
00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.380
We had our stuff together pretty well in that area.

804
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:03.300
But what it was was we were supposed to push these bad guys to the VC into these

805
00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:06.980
guys that were in a tree line and they inserted,

806
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.920
it's at the wrong place to start with.
So when we started working our way in,

807
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.820
we kind of came up to this tree lane where it ended a rice patty.

808
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.210
And then there was another tree line.
I couldn't give you the,

809
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.450
it was a halfway decent ways away,
you know what I'm saying?

810
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.420
But we had three kit Carson scouts or this kit.

811
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:29.420
Carson scouts were north Vietnamese that had,

812
00:49:29.491 --> 00:49:30.324
um,

813
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:35.570
gave a turnover over to the south enemies and they put them in camps and they

814
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:39.480
called them a chew toy camps basically.

815
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:44.690
And what we would do is we'd go to these camps and we would get these guys that

816
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.960
knew our area that we're working in and through an interpreter and stuff,

817
00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:52.770
we'd brief and everything and they'd come and work with us and they'd work with

818
00:49:52.771 --> 00:49:54.300
us,
run a couple of obstacle.

819
00:49:54.301 --> 00:49:56.810
They became kind of trusted agents and they were pretty good.

820
00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.440
Most of them were nor a on not north Vietnamese,
the VC that were good fighters,

821
00:50:01.441 --> 00:50:05.190
you know.
And then we,
they lived with us the whole nine yards.
We paid them,

822
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.740
we had money from a now for B,

823
00:50:07.741 --> 00:50:11.130
they gave us a lot of money to pay these guys and stuff.

824
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.100
So they weren't doing it just for free,
you know,

825
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.070
cause they needed money for their families.
And I don't know,

826
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.600
the atrocities that happened to their families is one of the reasons a w two

827
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:25.830
void and came to our,
uh,
to the South Vietnamese.
I,
anyway,

828
00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:28.970
we had three of those guys out in front of us.
Black Pajamas,

829
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:32.300
AK 47 looks just like VC,
you know,

830
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.340
so the brand new platoon saw three guys coming out of the tree line that were

831
00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:40.730
VC.
So they opened up on him,
killed two of them are wounded.

832
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:45.731
The other one we swung off to the left and laid down and they were shooting sex.

833
00:50:46.921 --> 00:50:48.110
She's and stoners status.

834
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:51.740
But Shit was just falling on their heads because they were shooting high like

835
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:53.540
new guys generally do before you,

836
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.660
and that was a pretty new brand new guys and apple tune,
you know,

837
00:50:56.661 --> 00:51:00.260
they weren't experienced and shit.
Normally you'd walk him in whatever,
you know.

838
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.380
So we're yelling the radio,
cease fire,
cease fire.

839
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:05.880
And we had our officer that was with us,

840
00:51:05.881 --> 00:51:08.870
got up on his knees and shoot back at him,
a gunshot to the heart.

841
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.220
Then we finally got him to stop and then we got him out of there.

842
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.340
He was dead though.
He shall right to the heart,
you know,

843
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.540
that was a blue on blue thing.
It was pretty bad.

844
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.270
<v 0>And that was right before you went home.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

845
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:23.490
The confusion that happens

846
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.910
<v 2>breaking up and you know,
and like I say,
the new,</v>

847
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.090
the new platoon had about two guys,

848
00:51:29.091 --> 00:51:32.870
I think they're Lpl,
can't remember his name.

849
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.870
And then it was with me on that beach where we got shot off.

850
00:51:36.871 --> 00:51:41.500
He was also in my training class.
He was the,
uh,
either the OIC or Aoac on that,

851
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.740
but most of the rest of them were all brand new guys.
You know what I mean?

852
00:51:44.741 --> 00:51:47.840
Good training and everything.
But you know,
this is their first off,

853
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:49.750
God damn were in a firefight.
You know what I mean?

854
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:50.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

855
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.350
Anytime you get the opportunity to slowly work into the combat situations,

856
00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.780
you know,
do a smaller patrol,
do an easier patrol that's going normally.

857
00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:03.080
Did he not care

858
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.200
<v 2>variety.
You're uh,
officers that you got,
you know,
take him out in the daytime.</v>

859
00:52:07.201 --> 00:52:08.910
That was a daytime up by the way.

860
00:52:08.911 --> 00:52:13.320
But usually it's just to kind of get them oriented to the environment,

861
00:52:13.321 --> 00:52:16.440
what they're going to be on an,
and then we all had these,
uh,

862
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.500
I don't know if we had one in 69,
70,
71,

863
00:52:19.501 --> 00:52:22.860
we had these barn dance files and every opera we went on,

864
00:52:22.861 --> 00:52:24.900
we'd put a synopsis in this Barn Dance.

865
00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:27.030
So if you were going to go in that same area,

866
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.630
he could pull off that barn dance file and read it and see what the guys had

867
00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:35.010
seen their enemy,
what the terrain was like a on and on.
You know what I mean?

868
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.230
It was a,
it was pretty good,
real good.

869
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:41.850
And almost every platoon had those from previous platoons all the way up to you.

870
00:52:41.851 --> 00:52:45.930
So you can kind of get an idea of what you're going into if you didn't have

871
00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:47.160
intel on that area.

872
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.200
<v 0>What are some of the leadership,</v>

873
00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:52.350
you talked about your second platoon being super tight,
super close.

874
00:52:52.351 --> 00:52:55.830
What were some of the leadership characteristics that you saw from the platoon

875
00:52:55.831 --> 00:53:00.660
chief and the and the platoon commander that that as you look back you recognize

876
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:04.340
that those were really good traits that really brought everyone together.
Well

877
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.261
<v 2>was our chief,</v>

878
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:11.261
he meets senior chief and he'd been over about three times and it was just very

879
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:16.370
easy going but very sharp and the understood things really well.

880
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.980
Our LPL was Gary Smith,

881
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:24.020
she had Smith and he had been a pro advisor in that province or the advice.

882
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:29.730
So as far as getting in town all over the sides,
it was perfect.
And then,
um,

883
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:36.430
now I won't say much about him.
Pindar lt,
he was outstanding.

884
00:53:36.431 --> 00:53:37.120
He,
uh,

885
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.120
went on almost every op fact one time he'd burned his hand with a smoke grenade.

886
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.910
[inaudible] we're still going to go out and he was going to go out with us.

887
00:53:45.911 --> 00:53:47.920
He just had his hand wrapped up and shit.

888
00:53:47.921 --> 00:53:52.750
So he has over key officers club on the navy side,
Eden and the officers are sin.

889
00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:56.710
What your,
your hands all Ben.
He definitely shit.
You're still going out?
He says,

890
00:53:56.711 --> 00:53:59.050
yeah,
if they get by my guys,
I'm dead anyway.

891
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.700
But he was really good.
He had to say he had his stuff together.

892
00:54:03.701 --> 00:54:06.400
He was a just savvy,
just a head,

893
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:10.810
his head on his shoulders figured out things,
quick thinker,
you know what I mean?

894
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.360
And it was just a neat,
he was just good

895
00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.230
<v 0>it,
how about,
I mean,
you know,
we always,</v>

896
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:19.110
obviously here now veterans get treated great now.

897
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.930
I mean from the Afghan war and the Iraq war,

898
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.910
we get treated really great buy for the most part by American and by the public.

899
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.650
We get treated really well compared to what you guys had to deal with Vietnam.

900
00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.460
Well how much of that did you see when you'd come home?
Was it,
I mean,

901
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.070
Coronado is a pretty pro navy town.

902
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:41.820
I mean in San Diego it's a pretty pro navy town.
Was it the same way back then?

903
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:44.550
Was it relatively pro navy or did you see some of the,

904
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.860
some of the hippies and whatnot coming on and yeah,

905
00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.980
<v 2>some demonstrations sometimes.
You know what I mean?</v>

906
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.220
Like a downtown San Diego could not much.

907
00:54:54.221 --> 00:54:59.221
And we basically just hung out here in San Diego or to other bars that we knew

908
00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.160
we'd fly out on North Island.
Fly in the North Island.

909
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.870
Wasn't like we were flying in the San Francisco or something.

910
00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:08.440
So we didn't get hit with that real,
real heavily,
you know what I mean?

911
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.520
And if we did have issues at a bar somewhere,

912
00:55:12.521 --> 00:55:15.130
we usually scare escorted away pretty quick,
you know,

913
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.750
so it wasn't really a problem.
We didn't really,
our guys here,

914
00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.080
these ghost guys that don't know,

915
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.200
but our guys here where we didn't really have a have a thing,

916
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.350
I'll tell you an auto and a 69,

917
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:34.410
we were going up this one canal and we used a pbrs couldn't get up at,

918
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:41.020
so we had to take a Boston whaler up it with a twin six.

919
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.640
She's in the front and one guy would sit and steer the steering,
you know,

920
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.730
would take a squat up.
There may be five guys,
you know,

921
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.070
and whatever squad didn't have the opt night,

922
00:55:51.071 --> 00:55:55.750
they got to be the driver and a gunner,
which I got to be the driver once.

923
00:55:55.751 --> 00:55:59.020
And I wasn't happy.
I covered myself with flak jackets.
I mean,

924
00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:00.940
who's anybody going to shoot that?
Oh yeah.

925
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.180
So we were going up real slow up this thing and all kinds of a filament lines

926
00:56:07.121 --> 00:56:10.540
and stuff like that that we're cutting ourselves through.
Cause it was low tide.

927
00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:14.890
Luckily it wasn't high tide,
you know what I mean?
So we got up there and,
and uh,

928
00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.570
put the guys in and we came back out in the PBR,
said,
uh,

929
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:23.560
what the boats into a bank,
right.
So we're sitting there on the Pvr and uh,

930
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:28.510
my buddy that was the gunner,
another seal and all sudden across this river,

931
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.420
we were just pop up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.
I was the sand pan,

932
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:36.720
so we're going to go after some bitch,
but one guy drive on one guy in the 60.

933
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:40.150
[inaudible] we needed a guy with,
uh,
that could see too,
you know what I mean?

934
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.840
Because you,
you know,
so we asked one of the Pvr guys,
you know,

935
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.520
who wants to go with us?
And this whole time we'd been with them.
God Damn,

936
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:48.880
we'd love to go out with you guys.

937
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.290
The only guy on that boat that volunteered was the guy that was married to him.

938
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:58.270
The rest of them wouldn't do it.
So,
uh,
we jumped in San Pan,

939
00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.430
one after the other one,
hose them down,

940
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:04.820
they hit the bank and then there was blood trails going into the,
uh,

941
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:05.710
killed one of them.

942
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.610
He was laying in the boat and the other guy had gotten out and ran and he could

943
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:12.510
see blood spots,
you know,
following in.
Well,
we didn't go after him.

944
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.950
We're not that stupid,
you know,
nighttime,
you know,

945
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:18.810
he'd probably die in y'all take these fucker guys out with me.
Sorry.

946
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.280
We brought the sand pan back and God damn,

947
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:26.200
we had old big thing of Intel and weapons and all kinds of shit and the other

948
00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:28.390
guys.
Then we went up and got the other guys bought them out.

949
00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:30.250
They didn't do a thing.
You know,
it's pretty neat.

950
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.820
<v 0>That's sketchy.
Yeah.
I can't,
I can't imagine the uh,
the,</v>

951
00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.860
that you guys would just go buy these filament wires and step over these trip

952
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:44.390
wires and just continue on your mission.
That's sketchy.

953
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.483
<v 2>You have to</v>

954
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:52.300
switch what we did anyway,
so I wasn't on Esop,
but it was,

955
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.240
and a couple of other guys from the other squad went down to score bay.
And um,

956
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.780
we'd gotten this Intel that the sand pin,
pretty good size one.
Um,

957
00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:07.940
almost like a junk would go up the river at nighttime up the main river where

958
00:58:08.011 --> 00:58:09.870
she flow was up by that way,
you know.

959
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:14.400
So George and those guys are down there they are again,
we're in a Boston whaler.

960
00:58:14.401 --> 00:58:18.930
They had a couple,
um,
um,
a law of rockets with him and stuff like that,
you know,

961
00:58:18.931 --> 00:58:21.650
so they figured,
well shit,
we haven't raised,

962
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:24.170
been a dry hole here where thank God damn

963
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:27.960
that junk when it comes by,
you know,

964
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.820
so they go out after the junk and they could hear it and then see the silhouette

965
00:58:32.821 --> 00:58:36.980
of an,
you know,
so he got real close to it,
fires uh,

966
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:42.000
far as uh,
uh,
La rocket and hit hit the stern,

967
00:58:42.001 --> 00:58:43.650
not the exact rutter and everything.

968
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.230
Then popped a flare so they could shoot and everything.

969
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.880
Well after they popped there for about 15 other flares popped and it wasn't

970
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:56.190
there,
us.
So behind him was all this little flotilla sand pans and shit.

971
00:58:56.191 --> 00:59:00.210
And so they took off and were shooting back where they're stoner and 60 and

972
00:59:00.211 --> 00:59:00.901
stuff like that.

973
00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:04.230
Finally they called and then a couple pbrs came down and saved them.

974
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:06.330
That was a pretty good offer.

975
00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.960
<v 0>Uh,
that's,
that's just so,
uh,
that's one of the major differences,
you know,</v>

976
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:14.330
of us have a night vision.
Now,

977
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.840
the only way that you guys had to utilize illumination and we did,

978
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:21.950
we did utilize the lumination from time to time.
We actually,
uh,
on big,

979
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.741
big operation,

980
00:59:22.741 --> 00:59:26.120
sometimes we'd have the army firing or the army artillery would be firing

981
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:29.340
illumination in certain situations.
But generally we weren't doing that.

982
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:33.080
<v 2>Yeah.
And ambushes,
we always fired a flare up.
You don't get good vision.</v>

983
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.690
He had where we had and then we got out of there,
you know what I mean?

984
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.820
It put a claymore is out and claymores behind us,
you know what I mean?

985
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:42.860
And everything sat with him for dudes to come down the river and then we'd get

986
00:59:42.861 --> 00:59:43.694
him,
you know,

987
00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.690
<v 0>and then so you get,
you get back from,</v>

988
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:52.510
from your second tour in Vietnam.
And is that the war ended right?
I mean,

989
00:59:52.511 --> 00:59:54.540
this is pretty much,
in fact a

990
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.610
<v 2>tuna now was that Ben luck,
which was 40 miles away from us.</v>

991
00:59:57.611 --> 01:00:00.610
They were only over there for three months and they came back to,

992
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.840
so we were the last full diploid diploid diploid Bluetooth in Vietnam.

993
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.760
And there was November platoon

994
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.610
was their chief,
uh,
lucky said

995
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.840
<v 0>bunch of great guys and up a tune.
And</v>

996
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.490
I mean at that time there was a couple hundred guys at seal team one,

997
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.810
I think there was about

998
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.610
<v 2>maybe it had boosted it up real high.</v>

999
01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:30.090
So there might've been 250,
300.

1000
01:00:30.091 --> 01:00:34.920
I think there was only about 150.
When I got an,
I don't know,
off the big pushers.

1001
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:39.240
Started yet to build more guys up.
There wasn't a lot you knew everybody.

1002
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.730
I mean it was a pretty tight tight group.

1003
01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.010
<v 0>And one of them,
one guy,
uh,
that we both know,
he,</v>

1004
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.580
he told me when he checked into seal team one back then he was like taking a

1005
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:51.460
shower after PT and like every guy was shot up.

1006
01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:55.120
But you could just see every guy was,
you know,
you could see scars and their arm,

1007
01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:57.520
leg.
Swooned did,
did you,

1008
01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:01.000
did you want a lot of guys staying in at that time?

1009
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.340
A lot of guys doing a couple of tunes get after the,

1010
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.960
<v 2>no,
most of the guys stayed.
And that's what we did.
That's where we logged.</v>

1011
01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:09.630
And then after the war,
yeah,
we had a pretty good,
uh,

1012
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:14.490
accidents and people getting out and when they get out because there wasn't the

1013
01:01:14.491 --> 01:01:17.550
dude,
you know,
that's,
that's what they were doing.
That was there,
you know,

1014
01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.490
there's nothing else.
I mean,
what are you going to do?
You know?
And uh,
I in,

1015
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:24.460
cause I just liked the guys I like,
oh,
we did,
you know,
and uh,

1016
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.610
like when I was over buds,
I come back in the 70,

1017
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:33.770
71 and then went over to budget as an instructor and I got bored doing that.

1018
01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:37.260
So there's this guy called [inaudible].

1019
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:37.761
<v 0>I'll tell you,</v>

1020
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:42.761
I would not want to be an a student when you are bored as a Bud's instructor.

1021
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:46.220
I was a nice guy.
But anyway,
so,
um,

1022
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.910
it would buddy doll was in UDTs,
well

1023
01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.480
<v 2>Betty Guy from Colorado and use a rodeo rider,
right.</v>

1024
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.020
So he talks to me and they're going out this place called Burton's,

1025
01:01:56.021 --> 01:01:59.220
which is out by,
um,
wasn't lakeside.

1026
01:01:59.221 --> 01:02:03.730
Ia was a lemon valley or Lemon Grove Levin goal.
Yeah.

1027
01:02:03.731 --> 01:02:06.520
And there was a place called burdens out there and it was just all bowls,

1028
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:09.670
but they were dinks,
they weren't real.
Your Rodeo Bulls,
you know.

1029
01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:13.510
So I went out there and hell I liked,
I never got bucked off there.

1030
01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:16.780
So I went rodeo and went a IRA.

1031
01:02:16.781 --> 01:02:21.781
Then Prca key in actually thought about getting out of the navy to ride Rodeo

1032
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.070
because I loved it.
But then I got bored because Rodeos,

1033
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:31.380
bowls or rural balls,
they were the last of the
event,
right.

1034
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.310
So I started riding bareback again,
saddle bronc too.
But the,
um,

1035
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.430
I got stepped on.

1036
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:42.210
Why you get 22 stitches in my left side of my face,

1037
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.890
14 in the back of my head and had both my shoulders dislocated.

1038
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.670
What else?
Got Gordon.

1039
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.210
And then it got stepped on and had five busted ribs and punctured lung.

1040
01:02:52.211 --> 01:02:53.980
So I figured,
okay,
that's enough.

1041
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.310
I quit doing that and just ate the teams.

1042
01:02:57.311 --> 01:03:00.290
You know the teams are safer than Rodeo.

1043
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.760
Well that was over over a year and a half,
almost two years.
So it wasn't bad.

1044
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:05.850
<v 0>Yeah.
And what about,</v>

1045
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:10.851
what about guys and mean how are guys doing as far as handling what they'd seen

1046
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.070
and coming back and all of a sudden they're in mainstream?

1047
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.630
<v 2>Dude,
we didn't have that problem.
I mean,
I'm telling you,</v>

1048
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.910
the guys that we're crazy,
we're crazy.
Before they went over,

1049
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:26.630
they worry that they weren't,
uh,
I mean,
I know all my buddies.
In fact,

1050
01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:30.830
a Thursday,
this Thursday night,
we'll have that a UDT Vietnam Udt.

1051
01:03:30.831 --> 01:03:34.260
She'll get together on Thursday night.
I talked to those guys.
You don't,

1052
01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:37.670
you don't see,
but buddy going,
you know,
I've got to go to the hospital.

1053
01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:40.370
I'm mentally ill and not that I know of.
I'll tell you,
there may,

1054
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:41.570
maybe it did happen,

1055
01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:46.571
but the only guy I know that really got affected was he was with that one

1056
01:03:47.181 --> 01:03:49.200
platoon.
I can't think.
And they've,
uh,
uh,

1057
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.240
and they were taking a part of mortar in the mortar blew up and he had just left

1058
01:03:55.521 --> 01:03:59.450
to have a cigarette and all of his buddies got killed by the mortgage and stuff,

1059
01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:02.640
including a guy named [inaudible] who was just a superb guy.

1060
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.790
And he wasn't quite the same after that.
And I can understand that.
I mean not,

1061
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:08.550
you know what I mean?

1062
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:13.290
But just being the firefights and shit like that and stuff that happened.
Nobody,

1063
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:15.480
uh,
you know,
we just,
it was the way it was.

1064
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.850
<v 0>And even when you,
even when you got out for the first,
so,
so then you did,</v>

1065
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.800
you did 30 years in the navy and uh,
you know,

1066
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.300
it was another funny thing when you,
when I talked about earlier,
when you,

1067
01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.300
when you graded,
are you lane graded me for the first time?

1068
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:33.600
I don't know how old you are.
It was 1993,
maybe.
[inaudible] 90.

1069
01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:38.350
I was in,
uh,
uh,
Alpha tune at team one with a,

1070
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:46.140
yeah.
Yeah.
But you were,
I don't know how old you were in that time period,

1071
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:51.060
but you know,
for,
from my perspective,
you would like 170 years old,

1072
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:54.880
right?
Yeah.
And I'm thinking to myself,
Hey,
this guy's deal,
this,

1073
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:58.980
this Roger Aid and you are putting on your wetsuit.
Okay.
Put It on the wetsuit.

1074
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.270
I guess you're going to get in the water,
gets in the water,
swim in,

1075
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:05.760
do the recon recon in any swim back,
ran back out.
You know,

1076
01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:07.220
that's,
that was do

1077
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.910
<v 2>you have to do,
if you're going to do all reads,
you've got to do them right.</v>

1078
01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:13.540
You know,
go point a to point B,
otherwise you don't see everything.
You know?

1079
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.730
And that's what I liked.
I was a warrant then,

1080
01:05:15.731 --> 01:05:19.960
but that's what I liked my last three or four years,
three years I think in the,

1081
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:23.850
uh,
in the teams as I did.
Oree so you still got to have your feet on the ground,

1082
01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:27.130
on the boys,
you know,
he couldn't be in a platoon would suck,

1083
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.150
but that's the way it was.

1084
01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:31.640
<v 0>No,
there's nothing,
there's nothing better than a,</v>

1085
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.430
there's nothing better than the,
uh,
than the platoon life.
Now I know that,

1086
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.320
I know that you're short on time and I,
and I,
I rushed this and uh,

1087
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.780
I'm glad we were able to get a little bit done and I think maybe after,

1088
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:50.890
after this one and we get to listen to it and I'll probably end up with a bunch

1089
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:51.724
of more questions.

1090
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.830
I know people that are listening to this budget team guys listen to this there.

1091
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.610
They actually,
a bunch of team guys sent me a bunch of questions.

1092
01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:58.720
I didn't get to any of them.

1093
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.990
<v 2>Yeah,
we were.
Yeah,
I know.
It says,
I'm sorry.
No,</v>

1094
01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:05.140
it's all good things that pop up in your head when you're talking about him.

1095
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:07.450
You know what I mean?
There's a lot of,
I mean I was at ut,

1096
01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:09.600
I was a frogman first and they'll see,
oh,
you know,

1097
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.570
that was probably one of the best appointments ever had and that was great.

1098
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:18.160
And Philippines is great and we're so glad to leave the Philippines and go back

1099
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:20.950
to a debt just to get an hour for a while when we could have died,
you know.

1100
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.250
<v 0>So uh,</v>

1101
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:29.530
I will definitely get you back on here and like I said,
next time I'll,
I'll,

1102
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.070
I'll get some questions from the team guys that they asked me to ask you and go

1103
01:06:34.071 --> 01:06:39.050
through some of those.
But thanks for coming on.
I know,
like I said,

1104
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:39.943
I know you've never,

1105
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.660
never been out in the public eye before and that's just the epitome of a quiet

1106
01:06:44.661 --> 01:06:49.250
professional that,
that we were all raised on and I appreciate it.

1107
01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.860
Like I said,
you're a hero of mine.

1108
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:55.700
You're a hero of the seal teams and you're really a hero to everybody in this,

1109
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:56.570
in this country.

1110
01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.910
And if anybody out there wants to continue this conversation,

1111
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.760
you can,
you can get echo.

1112
01:07:04.761 --> 01:07:09.170
Charles and I on the social media echo is at Echo Charles.

1113
01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:10.550
I am at Jocko Willink.

1114
01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:15.350
We're on all the different social media,
Twitter,

1115
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:17.660
Instagram and the Facebook.

1116
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:22.970
If you want to support the podcast Echo Charles,
how can they do it?

1117
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:24.913
If you

1118
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.720
<v 3>want some supplements,
the kind network obviously,
um,</v>

1119
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.710
on it has the best ones.

1120
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:35.600
So you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko you get 10% off.

1121
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.480
That's one way.
Also,
before you do your Amazon shopping,
of course,

1122
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:45.230
go to one of the websites,
right Jocko store or jackpot gas.com.

1123
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:49.070
Click through the Amazon link there before you do your shopping.

1124
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:54.620
Or to make that part easier,
we have this,
the trooper tool.

1125
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:57.380
It's just this little extension thing you can put on your browser.

1126
01:07:57.381 --> 01:08:01.670
You get that on any other websites as well.
You just click on,
it's called the

1127
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:08.000
Jocko store trooper tool.
Chrome extension.
Just click on that,

1128
01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.010
confirm it's on there.
It'll automatically do it for you.

1129
01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:12.650
So don't be so you don't have to remember.
It's good.
Um,

1130
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.830

1131
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.410

Um,
but yeah,</v>

1132
01:08:19.411 --> 01:08:23.200
I get some of those.
That's how you can see pork.
Awesome.

1133
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.473
And,
uh,

1134
01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:31.690
you can get the book that Leif Babin and I wrote that actually Roger did the

1135
01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:36.691
security clearance on you didn't I just reviewed it for a four year thing.

1136
01:08:37.691 --> 01:08:41.840
You know what I mean?
Nobody thing.
But uh,
one thing I will say,
you know,

1137
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:45.340
and I don't think I'm a hero,
I just went over there and did my job,

1138
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:48.930
had a lot of fun.
This was a great guys.
Yeah,
that's about it.

1139
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.080
Well that's one of the things that makes you a hero and thanks.

1140
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.970
Thanks for coming on the show.
And,

1141
01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.050
and also if you don't know where we're having a little,

1142
01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.020
a little conference out here in San Diego,
California,

1143
01:09:02.021 --> 01:09:05.620
October 20th and 21st is not going to be for everybody,

1144
01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.020
but if you want to get in the game,

1145
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.560
if you want to do something that's going to be intense to focus.

1146
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:15.340
When we talk about leadership,
when they talk about getting better at what we do,

1147
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:21.270
come on out the monster October 20th and 21st.
Roger,

1148
01:09:21.271 --> 01:09:22.710
thanks again for coming on the show.

1149
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:27.830
Thanks for everything you did serving this country in Vietnam and spending the

1150
01:09:27.991 --> 01:09:32.991
rest of your life supporting the seal teams dedicated to our country.

1151
01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.370
And like I said,
Roger is kind of an unknown veteran.

1152
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:44.270
And I would like to take a moment to thank all the Vietnam veterans that fought

1153
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.810
with courage and with honor in a hard war,

1154
01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.030
in an unpopular war,

1155
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.760
and not only fought for freedom against the evils of communism,

1156
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:05.990
but also establish and passed on lessons learned for the current generation of

1157
01:10:06.721 --> 01:10:07.554
war fighters.

1158
01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:13.970
We owe all of you a great debt of gratitude for what you did for us and for the

1159
01:10:16.531 --> 01:10:20.520
United States of America
and everyone else out there.

1160
01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.250
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for spreading the word.

1161
01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.820
And as you go through life,

1162
01:10:26.821 --> 01:10:31.821
remember the sacrifice of these veterans that fought and sacrificed for us.

1163
01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:34.980
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1164
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.480
<v 0>So that we can live</v>

1165
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:38.330
<v 4>okay</v>

1166
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:42.230
<v 0>with the sacred freedom to go out into the world.</v>

1167
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.920
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1168
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.390
<v 0>And get after it.
So until next time,</v>

1169
01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.460
