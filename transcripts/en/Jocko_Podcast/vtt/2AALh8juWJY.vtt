00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.430
And this idea of discipline,
obviously up.
I talk about discipline a lot.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.470
And one of the things you were talking about earlier with regards to veterans

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.050
and people that have listened to your lectures.

4
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:15.580
And it's the same thing with me.
People that listen to this podcast or,

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.570
or read the books and,

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.000
and one of the things that I've noticed and I've talked about and I've gotten a

7
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.860
lot of positive feedback on is,
you know,

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.200
when you're in the military you have this discipline and beyond that,

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.690
beyond the discipline that's imposed on you,

10
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.080
you also have a lot that you have to just hold the line yourself.
I mean,

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.150
when you're in the military,

12
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.960
sure you go through boot camp where there's a drill instructor that Jellyvision

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.790
and all that.
But once you're in the military,
you're doing what you have to do.

14
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:45.670
It's self discipline that you learn that and you become self disciplined.

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.790
And what happens is guys get out and that's,

16
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.980
that's gone.
And that hurts them.

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.110
And the other thing that hurts them is they don't know what their mission is

18
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:00.400
anymore.
And,

19
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.570
and my big thing with people that have been telling vets now is find what your

20
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.140
next mission is.
Go find whatever your next mission.
And I don't care what it is,

21
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:09.430
but it has to be something.

22
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.200
And I was listening to you talk on something the other day and,
and you were,

23
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.520
you were talking about how

24
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.680
not doing anything when people are not going anywhere,
when they're,

25
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.920
when they're failing,
when they're,
when they don't have the drive,

26
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.450
it's because they're not accepting responsibility for anything.
And,

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.120
and so my way of saying that is like you need a new mission,

28
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:36.040
you need to be responsible for something and you need to go and move towards

29
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:39.370
some new mission and,
and do you encounter people that,

30
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.210
or you see people that's very problematic in the civilian side as well,

31
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:44.970
where people,
they just don't know what they're doing.

32
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.600
I don't take any responsibility for anything.

33
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.540
<v 1>Nihilism.
Is that because first of all,</v>

34
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:55.070
you learned that truth is relevant relative and that there's no real moral order

35
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.810
and you know,
that alleviates,

36
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.500
you have responsibility and that's why that's such an attractive message to

37
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:05.330
people.
But the problem is,
is that it kills you.
It kills your soul,
so to speak,

38
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.680
because,
well,
when we can talk about this technically,
so you know,

39
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:10.670
there are systems,

40
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.270
neurological systems that underlie your experience of negative emotion.

41
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.660
And there are neurological systems that underlie your experience of positive

42
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.450
emotion.
And there are separate systems.
They obviously interact,

43
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:25.340
but they're separate systems.
So,
but the positive emotion system,

44
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.390
while there's two of them,

45
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.020
but one of them sort of kicks in when you get something that you want.

46
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.330
So you know you're hungry and you eat,
and that feels good.

47
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.230
And so that's kind of the simple one.
Um,

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.170
but there's a more sophisticated one that I think is even more.
