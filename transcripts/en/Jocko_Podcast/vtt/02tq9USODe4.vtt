00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.673
Welcome.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.100
This is Jocko podcast number two with Echo Charles and me,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.660
Jocko Willink.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.000
<v 0>good evening.
I go,
good evening.</v>

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
So people ask me regularly what books I like.
In fact,

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.100
Tim Ferris asked me,
which he asks all of his guests,
um,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.430
what books I have given to people,
what books I regularly give to people,

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.370
how do I,
what,
what books do I gift?

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.870
Which I actually am not a real big gift giver for some reason.

11
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.480
I don't know why,
but uh,

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
I don't really expect gifts from people and people of the world.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.850
It should not expect gifts from me.
Either lessons,
not gifts.
Yes,

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.830
less so.
But there is one book that I,

15
00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.830
<v 1>yeah,</v>

16
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.830
<v 0>have given to a few people in my life and it is a book that was and still is</v>

17
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.630
very influential on me and especially on my perspective of leadership and really

18
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:17.020
especially in combat leadership.

19
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.850
And that book is called about face.

20
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.200
Now here it is right here about face.
If you can't,
if you're listening to audio,

21
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.420
it's an 800 over 800 page book.

22
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
It's written by a guy named Colonel David Hackworth.

23
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 0>Hackworth was a kind of a soldier's soldier and born in 1930 he joined the</v>

25
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:43.260
merchant marines towards the end of World War Two at the age of 14 had to lie to

26
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.410
get into the merchant.
Marines got done with that Gig.

27
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
He joined the army just after World War Two.
What do you mean?
Sorry?

28
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:54.150
What do you mean?
He had to lie to get into them?
So he was too young.

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.160
He was 14 years old.

30
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.710
He lied about his age to get in at 14 to the merchant marines.

31
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:01.320
When he went a few years later to join the army,

32
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.590
he was still too young and had to lie again to get into the army.

33
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.140
Once he was in the army,

34
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.260
he went over to Europe and he served directly underneath the war hardened

35
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.330
veterans of World War Two and those are the guys that brought him up in the
ranks

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.090
and taught him

37
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.740
<v 1>okay.</v>

38
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.940
<v 0>About hard training and really that's what they taught him in.
And again,</v>

39
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.750
that's one of those things that I look back on my military career and the

40
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
Vietnam veterans that were still in the seal teams when I just got in the seal

41
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.440
teams in 1990 1991,
there were still some,

42
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.850
some veterans around from Vietnam.
And those guys,
when those guys spoke,

43
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.760
you listened because they had some word to put out.

44
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:51.060
And I absolutely listened to in a lot of those lessons that those guys taught
me,

45
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:55.090
those with Vietnam veterans taught me.
I carried onto them.
I mean,
I,

46
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.350
I held onto him and took notes and pass them on.

47
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:01.420
And a lot of those concepts are the basis of,

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.970
of what we wrote about in extreme ownership.

49
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.810
So he did that.
He ended up getting,

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.190
uh,
Fighting Korea.
So Korea was kind of his,
uh,

51
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.000
where he first saw combat.
He ended up getting a battlefield commission.

52
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.830
And if you don't know what that means,
that means you're,

53
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.410
you're one of the foot soldiers and all of a sudden they go,
look,

54
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.150
you're a good leader.
We're going to put you in charge.

55
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:26.500
And that's exactly what happened to him.

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.670
He was wounded four times before the age of 21.

57
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.980
So the guy was a warrior.
I am going to read his,
uh,

58
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.360
read the book dedication here from the beginning of about face.

59
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
It says dedication to Steve Present [inaudible] who is one of the World War II

60
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.810
combat hardened veterans that taught him how to soldier.

61
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.890
So it says to see present [inaudible] who showed us how to soldier,

62
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.960
to Henry Deboer,

63
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.670
who showed us how to die to Glover Johns,

64
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.200
who showed us how to lead and to all the doughboys,

65
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.900
the ground pounders,
the grunts,

66
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
the American infantry men,
past,
present,

67
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.300
and especially future to them.

68
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.400
This book is dedicated.

69
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.100
So we wrote this book obviously to pass on the lessons that he learned.

70
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.790
And I got to make a note here and read a little section cause he talks about

71
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.910
Henry Deboer who showed us how to die.

72
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.840
So this took place in the Korean War and I'll go right into it.

73
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.750
They're in a big firefight.
And here's Hackworth.

74
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.700
I saw a soldier prone on the ice.
He'd been there a long time.

75
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.360
I thought he was dead.
But then I saw movement and I rushed out to get him.

76
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.490
My God,
I thought it's to Buer
private.

77
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:01.000
Henry [inaudible] had been with George companies since early in the war.

78
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.090
He was one of the few survivors from the original third platoon,

79
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.510
basically because in those first hard months of combat,

80
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.600
he had not seen even one good firefight.

81
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.480
He had an uncanny sixth sense.

82
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.560
He could always tell when the platoon was in for a major bloodletting and

83
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.770
invariably he'd find an excuse to be somewhere else.

84
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.370
So here's a guy that Hackworth is saying this guy was avoiding combat,

85
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.380
finding excuses.
Normally that excuse was going on sick call,

86
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.650
which by regulation he was allowed to do and you couldn't stop him even though

87
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.370
you knew the only thing that was wrong with him was a chronic case of cowardice.

88
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.380
So absolutely it's being called a coward.

89
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.120
Deboer himself even admitted he was a coward and we hated him for it.

90
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.410
He was an outcast from the platoon.
We even had a little song about him,

91
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.490
which we'd sing in unison out of the dark jury.

92
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:58.940
Korean countryside comes the call of the debris or bored,
sick call,

93
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.110
sick call,
sick call.
He pulled this,

94
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.680
he pulled his stunt only yesterday as we were saddling up for this very

95
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.740
operation,
he'd sensed the bloodletting.
All right,

96
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.030
but he hadn't figured that the foggy overcast covering the battlefield would not

97
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.100
lift and the attack would be postponed.

98
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.360
He'd returned from the dock last night with a clean bill of health.

99
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.100
Most surprised to see us.

100
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.330
The rest of the platoon took great pleasure in the fact that his malingering

101
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:32.810
little ass would be in the thick of things in the morning.
So he,

102
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.060
there was a big operation planned and he was supposed to go on it.
He snuck out,

103
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.500
went to sick call,
said he's sick.
The them,

104
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.740
the operation got postponed because of weather.

105
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.130
He shows back up and here he is in the scrap praying that he missed.

106
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.510
I didn't miss it.
Now back to the book.

107
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.250
Now Deborah was ashen faced,
hit in the chest or gut,
I don't know.

108
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:59.960
There was a lot of blood and well into shock.
I knew he wasn't going to make it.

109
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.360
Come onto Buer.
You're going to be fine.
You'll be all right.
I said,

110
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.660
giving him the old pep talk as I grabbed his jacket color and started sliding

111
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.780
across the ice,
but to Booher said,
no,
sarge,

112
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.220
just leave me.
You're going to get hit.
Just leave me sarge.

113
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.610
Then suddenly he groaned.
Sarge,

114
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.360
I shit my pants and that was it.
He was gone.

115
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.320
I left him and ran back to Buer in death became one of the greatest heroes of

116
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:35.840
our outfit.
It was true.

117
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.950
He'd never been anything in his army life,
but a coward.

118
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.620
But he died,
right?
He died like a man.
He didn't say,

119
00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:51.210
take care of me.
He said,
leave me.
Take care of yourself.

120
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.790
And when I told the other guys the story,

121
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.270
old deboer became a legend in the platoon.

122
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.410
So that's the kind of thing that Hackworth saw as a young leader.

123
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.930
From there.
You know,
he,
when the Korean War ended,
he was again highly decorated.

124
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.130
Korean War ended,

125
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.210
did time in a bunch of different units in between the Korean War and the Vietnam

126
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:21.020
War.
When the Vietnam War kicked off,
he went right into the thick of it again,

127
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.770
ended up as a battalion commander in Vietnam.
And here's his,

128
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.180
here's his list of awards to Distinguished Service Crosses,

129
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.020
10 silver stars,
four legions of Merit,

130
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.420
distinguished flying cross eight bronze stars,
eight Purple Hearts.

131
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.480
So you have a guy here that is a

132
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.470
obviously a highly dedicated soldier,

133
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.250
a guy that would do anything for the army and for America.

134
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.500
But,
and this is a big,
but

135
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.610
this guy was a rebel.

136
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.180
He was a true rebel and he went out and went against his officers.

137
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.710
He went against what the way the army was running the war in Vietnam.

138
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:25.010
And eventually he went out in public on national television and spoke out

139
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.420
against the Vietnam War and said that we should not fight there anymore.

140
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.130
So he went on this TV program is called issues and answers.

141
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:38.250
It was a big show in the,
uh,
in the 70s.

142
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.880
And he did this interview.
And again,

143
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:46.740
you've got to remember this guy has an active duty,
an active duty,

144
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.010
highly decorated senior officer in the army.
I mean,

145
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:54.750
this guy is all by all accounts should be the most dedicated

146
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.760
and here he is and this is what he says.
You know,

147
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:01.350
this is one of the quotes from this interview.

148
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.380
I think that the top managers of the army,

149
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.850
and there's a big difference between a leader,
a combat leader and a manager.

150
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The top managers were so involved in systems analysis in the normal bureaucracy

151
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:15.240
of it all.

152
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.020
They were that they were fighting from day to day just to move paper that

153
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:22.650
crossed their desk and they couldn't see the forest for the trees.

154
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.340
In February when we went into Laos,

155
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.290
we went into Laos conventionally,

156
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.580
the idea was to block the enemy's supply routes.
So we dropped in there,

157
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.990
we paid a horrible,
the Vietnamese paid a horrible price.

158
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.230
Tremendous mistakes were made.
Again,
conventional thinking.
He,

159
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.740
he's gonna he hounds on this a lot.
This idea of conventional thinking.
And again,

160
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.170
you got a guy that's institutionalize me.

161
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.380
The guy's been in military service and he was 14 years old.

162
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.680
You'd think that they would have him mentally sedated to a point where he would

163
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:01.320
just think what they tell him to thin,
but he does not.

164
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.230
That's the dichotomy of this guy.
Again,
conventional thinking,

165
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:11.550
conventional thinking put us in that operation rather than have a light mobile

166
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:12.750
guerrilla force,

167
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.260
but a guerrilla force that belonged to the government of Vietnam or an American

168
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:21.180
army operating in their light gorilla.

169
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.250
So he was saying the Vietnamese should be doing this.

170
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.820
The the South Vietnamese army should be doing this or if we're going to do it,

171
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:29.010
we need to operate like gorillas.

172
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.310
It takes a thief to catch a thief.
What we need is a thief.

173
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.460
We don't need a conventionally trained FBI agent dashing through the woods with

174
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:45.390
a large force behind him.
We need small people,
well trained,
highly motivated.

175
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.840
And this is what we have not had because what we have now,

176
00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:53.190
and this is where you say to yourself,

177
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200
wow that because what we have now among the army is a bunch of shallow

178
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.400
dilettantes who run from pillar to post trying to punch their card,

179
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.180
serving minimum time at company level.
Because the exposure,

180
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.370
you are very close to the heat of the furnace there meaning you can get in

181
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:17.230
trouble easily.
So he is on national television,
a colonel in the army,

182
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.220
one of the most highly decorated individuals at the time and he calls,

183
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.850
he says the army is filled with a bunch of shallow dilettantes who run from

184
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:29.020
pillar to pillar to post trying to punch their card and purposely avoiding

185
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.000
combat is what that second piece mates.

186
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.000
You don't see this kind of behavior from army officers very often.

187
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.760
I will tell you that.
Um,

188
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.340
and here's Kinda how he closed it out.
She says,
uh,
hit the interviewer.

189
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.220
They are sorry.
He says,
the interviewer says,
colonel,
do you think,

190
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:54.150
do you feel it's possible you have become too emotionally involved in Vietnam?

191
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.930
And he says,
I have become emotionally involved in Vietnam.

192
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.580
One couldn't have spent a number of years I spent in Vietnam without becoming

193
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:06.660
emotionally involved.

194
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.610
One couldn't see the number of young studs die or be terribly wounded without

195
00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:13.170
becoming emotionally involved.

196
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.270
I just have seen the American nation spent so much of it's wonderful,

197
00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:19.890
great young men in this country.

198
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.730
I've seen our national wealth being drained away.

199
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.320
I see the nation being split apart and almost being split asunder because of

200
00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:33.030
this war.
And I am wondering to what end it is all going to lead to.

201
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.543
<v 1>So</v>

202
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.980
<v 0>that is a devastating statement.</v>

203
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.150
And when it came out,
they immediately,

204
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.980
he put in his resignation papers immediately and the army started to investigate

205
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:53.940
them immediately.
And they tried to,

206
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.740
they tried to get him in trouble for every little minor infraction that had

207
00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:00.810
happened underneath his command at any time,
in any situation.

208
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.430
They really tried to come after him and he ended up retiring.

209
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.330
And
you know,

210
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.420
I think one of the things that he expressed there is a dichotomy that any buddy

211
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.580
in a combat leadership position will feel.
And that is,

212
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:28.440
and I don't,
I in fact,
this might be the largest dichotomy of all.

213
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.730
And that's a big statement.

214
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.170
And that is as a combat leader,

215
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.340
you are

216
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.260
told and beyond being told you aren't ingrained and beyond being ingrained,

217
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.390
you are inherently inherently caring of your guys.

218
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.260
There is no one more important than your guys.

219
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.910
And the dichotomy is as much as you care about these guys and you love these

220
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:11.840
guys and you do anything for them.
But that being said,

221
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.120
it is your job to send these guys on operations that can kill them.

222
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.560
And
so that is

223
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.580
a huge dichotomy.
And I think that's one of the things that Hackworth,

224
00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:35.010
when he saw it on a grand scale,

225
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.040
because he could deal with it in his own groups,

226
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.690
but when he saw it on a grand scale,
you know,
we young men being

227
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.250
<v 1>sent to their death,
it's,</v>

228
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.330
<v 0>it,
it's,
I think what,
what turned him.</v>

229
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.730
<v 1>Um,
so</v>

230
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.020
<v 0>he ended up after this,
you know,</v>

231
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:03.560
he kind of continued down that path and he moved out of America.

232
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:06.710
He moved to Australia and he

233
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.843
<v 1>ended up</v>

234
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.680
<v 0>kind of playing a big role in the anti nuclear weapons movement.</v>

235
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.230
And I mean that's kind of where he went.

236
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.440
So I,
you know,

237
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.320
hack was a complex person,
Hackworth,
that's kind of his nickname.

238
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.260
Everyone calls him hack hack was a complex person.

239
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.890
And I don't agree with everything that he says.

240
00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:38.490
I don't agree with everything that he does and everything that he did.

241
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.600
I don't worship a guy.
Uh,
and you know,

242
00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.990
What's interesting about me questioning what his decisions and questioning his

243
00:16:45.991 --> 00:16:48.870
leadership.
It's like,
that's something I learned from him.
Like,
don't even,

244
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.080
don't listen to anybody 100%.
Don't put,
you know,

245
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:54.870
you should always be questioning what people are saying and,

246
00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:59.130
and making sure and confirming it through other sources and other experiences

247
00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:00.450
that it's the right thing to do.

248
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.990
And that's something that I always try to do with everything is,

249
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.190
is used that attitude.
And

250
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.340
so I,
I,
I don't,
I don't recall,

251
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.320
and I was actually trying to come in here tonight.

252
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:19.640
I was trying to figure out when I got this book,
and I actually have no idea.

253
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:20.500
I don't remember it.

254
00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:25.430
It like appeared in my life at some point and I don't know how,
I don't want,

255
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:29.540
never made the recommendation to me.
I just somehow ended up with it and,

256
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.710
but I got it.
I got it before.

257
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.850
One thing I do know is I got it before September 11th,
2001 when that happened,

258
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:40.310
I had already read it.
I'd had it in my brain.

259
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.810
But when I was in Ramadi in 2006 this,

260
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.210
I read this book every night that I was not out in the field.

261
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.100
I read this book every night and you know,
I just open it up.

262
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.550
You could open up anywhere in that,
in this book and you could find something,

263
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.030
some,
some piece of information,

264
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:08.260
some similar situation,

265
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:12.560
some lesson learned that you could take from it and it could guide you and,

266
00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:15.270
and you're one of the like,
like for instance,

267
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.960
and it all applied to what I was doing.
The situation I always in.
So,

268
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.640
for instance,

269
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.210
we were in Iraq and we were supposed to be working with Iraqi soldiers who are

270
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.620
unmotivated,
poorly equipped,
poorly trained on educated,

271
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.920
bad morale and that's and corrupt.

272
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:39.600
So there the money's all disappearing.
It's,
it's a horrible situation.

273
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.520
And what was Hackworth doing in Vietnam where they were working with the South

274
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.520
Vietnamese army who was corrupt and unmotivated and poorly trained and all those

275
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.500
same things that they were dealing with,
the same things we were dealing with.

276
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.860
And that's one example of many.
Uh,

277
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.260
I took a little break
about three months into deployment.

278
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.940
I took a little break in and I'm not 100% sure why,
but I found another book,

279
00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:10.941
somebody had left a book in our building and the book was speaking of Dichotomy.

280
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.830
The book was the electric koolaid acid test by Tom Wolfe.

281
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.980
And I think at this point,
I,
you know,
three months into deployment,

282
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.960
I think I needed some kind of mental escape,
you know,

283
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:28.110
at least,
you know,
I was close.
I was like dealing with combat all day.

284
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.660
And then I'd go in my room and Redo about combat at night.

285
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:31.890
And I kind of was like,
okay,

286
00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:36.891
you need to think about something else for 20 minutes or 10 minutes and just get

287
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:40.950
out of get get it out of your head.
And I randomly found this book,
so I said,
oh,

288
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.880
and I had read the right stuff by Tom Wolf,
which was a fantastic book.

289
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.030
And so I said all this,
I'm sure this will be interesting as well.

290
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.070
So as I read this book,
the electric Koolaid acid test,

291
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:58.071
which is about hippies and drugs and the 60s and that's what it's about,

292
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:00.930
Haight Ashbury,
the whole nine yards.

293
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.730
And there's a quote in the middle of that I actually pulled out because I will

294
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:10.731
never forget this quote and how this quote was so starkly contrasting with about

295
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:12.110
face and,

296
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.510
and I'm going to read this quote and these and I kind of forget the whole setup

297
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.393
to it,

298
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.080
but they're at some kind of a concert and there's all this screaming and

299
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:24.840
craziness going on at some rock and roll concert.

300
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.110
And you know,
he says,

301
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.610
I couldn't hear what they were screaming either,
but you don't have to.

302
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.380
They're screaming,
me,
me,
me,
me,

303
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.370
I'm me.
That's the cry of the ego.

304
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.530
And that's the cry of this rally,
this concert,
Mi,
Mi,
Mi,

305
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.210
Mi.
And that's why wars get fought.

306
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.140
Ego because enough people want to scream,

307
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.420
pay attention to me.

308
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.150
And it was one of those things that I read night and it was so stark.

309
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.170
We different from the situation that I was in where I was with these guys in my

310
00:21:07.171 --> 00:21:09.030
own task into the seals and my task unit,

311
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.220
the Marines that were there on the ground with us,

312
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.740
the army soldiers that were down on the ground hold us.

313
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.940
And these guys were all so selfless.

314
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.350
The last thing they cared in the world about was me,
me,
me,
me.

315
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.900
And I got done with that book and I went right back to about face because I,

316
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.700
I related to it,
I understood and I said to myself,
this is true,
this is selfless.

317
00:21:32.701 --> 00:21:35.410
This is where I'm at right now.
Yeah.

318
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.900
So I went back into about face and I continued and eventually this book is the

319
00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:48.000
one book that I've given to a few of the guys that worked closely for me,

320
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.460
uh,
including included Leif,
Leif Babin who,
you know,

321
00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:57.840
one of my brothers who wrote extreme ownership with me and he's one of the guys

322
00:21:57.841 --> 00:21:58.531
that,
you know,
he's got,

323
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:02.460
he's got his copy and it's all dog eared and marked up because it's a great
book.

324
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.593
Yeah.

325
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.030
So obviously when we like on Twitter and Facebook and we asked for people to

326
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.150
give us questions,
a lot of the questions are,

327
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.730
a bunch of questions are about
leadership.

328
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.620
And so I kind of,
as I thought about diving in a little bit,

329
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.530
<v 1>two,
two,</v>

330
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:34.060
<v 0>this book and,
and,
and talk about it a little bit.
And of course you could spend,</v>

331
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.440
you know,
we could do 50 episodes,
10 hours each on this book.

332
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.120
There's so it's so dense and filled with information.

333
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:44.260
Not to mention it's 800 pages long.
There's,
um,

334
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.970
but I wanted to,

335
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.970
I wanted to go a little bit deep on this one situation where David Hackworth,

336
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.200
Colonel Hackworth had now gone into Vietnam and there was a,

337
00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:00.310
a battalion of soldiers and they were kind of a disaster.

338
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.800
They were kind of the standard of like what,
what had happened with some of the,

339
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.740
the poor leadership in Vietnam.

340
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.180
And he took over and again,
just to kind of,

341
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.780
to kind of lay out what Hackworth was like,

342
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:18.760
here's a quote that kind of starts off the chapter.

343
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:23.910
Hackworth was essentially a legend just before he arrived.

344
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.140
I recall going to the g one and asking who the new battalion commander was going

345
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:33.310
to be.
The deputy g g one said,
can't tell you,

346
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.990
you know how personnel people are,
they like to hit pocket everything,

347
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.470
but he's Mr Infantry.
I thought,
who the hell is mentioned?

348
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.020
Mr Infantry.
Of course I'd read about David h Akward.

349
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:52.940
So his kind of nickname was Mr infantry.
That was his reputation.

350
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.890
What does hip pocket mean?
Meaning,
if the people that are in charge of,
uh,

351
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.000
personnel and moving people around inside the military,
they know,

352
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:04.460
they know little bits of information and instead of giving it to you,

353
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.560
they keep it,
they keep it close to keep it in their hip pocket.

354
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.640
That's all it means.
And then,
uh,

355
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.590
to,
to kind of explain though that,
you know,
there's some people that go,
yeah,

356
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:18.170
this guy's a,
this guy's a great leader.
He's coming in,

357
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.680
but to kind of show you what the attitude of the troops is,

358
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.260
you got to remember this is Vietnam.
We got draftees,
we got hippies,

359
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:32.020
we got all kinds of anti American.
I mean,
it's crazy times.
Uh,
doc Holly,

360
00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:35.840
there's another quote for who's it from a medic.
Charles Winsor,

361
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.000
doc Holly and I were sitting in the aid station drinking beer and saying,
God,

362
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.110
this is going to be hell.

363
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.850
We've got some GI Joe Life route here is going to just ruin us.

364
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.670
That was probably the lowest point of morale.
And the battalion,

365
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.550
not only had we been taking a lot of casualties,

366
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.840
but now it looked as if someone was going to come in and kick ass and make a

367
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.850
manmade career soldiers out of us.

368
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.860
And it goes on to go through more quotes where they actually talk about a price

369
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:06.260
on his head.
The,
the soldiers talked about,
hey,
we,

370
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:07.970
we need to kill this guy before he gets us killed,

371
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.360
which is just kind of crazy.

372
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.760
Yeah,
yeah,
that's right.
You know,
you hear about that,

373
00:25:18.761 --> 00:25:22.900
you hear about that Vietnam,
this idea of,
it's called fragging.

374
00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:25.740
There's a name for it.
They were going to frag our officer meetings.

375
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.010
We're going to kill our own officer.

376
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.870
And it's something that definitely happened and,
and it's,
uh,

377
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.700
<v 1>okay.</v>

378
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:32.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

379
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.770
This is a perfect case of where people talked about it possibly happening.

380
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:44.220
So
to get into this chapter a little bit,

381
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.443
<v 1>hmm,</v>

382
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.080
<v 0>here's Hackworth,
talking about when he took over,</v>

383
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.170
there was no sense in showing this sorry outfit.
I was in a state of shock.

384
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.390
It wasn't just the command post group that it wasn't just that the command post

385
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:07.391
group slept on cots inside tents that they had folding chairs and state side

386
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.860
footlockers portable radios and plastic coolers filled with beer and coke at

387
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:14.810
their fire base out in the field.

388
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.980
More than that it was that they had portable toilets to,

389
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.710
so here he is,

390
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:26.240
these guys are supposed to be out in the field and they have all this luxury and

391
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:31.241
that's something that we saw in Iraq where there was certain bases where they

392
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:37.751
had a Starbucks and subway sandwiches and Mcdonald's literally had those things

393
00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.950
and you the further you go out into the fray you get guys,

394
00:26:42.951 --> 00:26:45.420
I've in revisiting some of my first deployment to Iraq,
we'd go out to some,

395
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:50.421
there'd be guys you know completely in the bush living like gs,

396
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:53.820
barely scraping by on one MRE a day.

397
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.810
So
now he's talking about the command post and he says that the command post

398
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.200
apparently were blissfully unaware that just nearby their troops were crapping

399
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.340
on the ground and not even covering it up.

400
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:12.720
So you have complete just disaster situation going on here.

401
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.150
And then the,

402
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.260
the general that's in charge of all these battalions as he's about to put

403
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:20.360
Hackworth in charge.

404
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:25.370
Guy Named General Ewell says it's a pussy battalion and I want tigers,

405
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.110
not pussies,

406
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.560
but he'd gotten it wrong with the fourth battalion,
39 and 39th infantry.

407
00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:35.430
That's where he's taken over.

408
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.720
It was not a question of feline degree as far as I could see.

409
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.390
This unit was not even a military organization,
so that's,

410
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.450
that's what this guy walked into,
Como Hackworth.
It was total.

411
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:53.490
He goes on to say it was total disintegration throughout the Firebase Ma amid

412
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:58.710
the shit and toilet paper and the machine gun ammo laying in the mud where

413
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:02.130
troops were wore love beads and peace symbols and look more like something out

414
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:04.650
of Haight Ashbury than soldiers in the U s army.

415
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.450
All we're low on spirit and a few were high openly on marijuana.

416
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.430
There was minimum security,
few men carried are cared for their weapons.

417
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.300
Most had let them go read with rust as they strolled around without them,

418
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.810
grenades weren't taped and when a unit moved out,

419
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.780
most of the gunners wore their ammo.
Pancho villa style,

420
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.910
the ideal way to guarantee a weapon jam sometime down the track when dirty

421
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:34.911
dented cartridges were inserted into their sixties so what we have here is a

422
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:38.160
total lack of discipline.

423
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.750
And another thing that this reminded me of was I was always trying to,

424
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.920
when I was in the seal teams also trying to pull as much information about war

425
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.790
as I could.

426
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.790
And one of the recent wars in recent times was when the Russians went into

427
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:58.050
Chechnya the first time and they,

428
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:03.260
they had a really hard time and I read the after actions reports from the

429
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:08.160
Russian officers that had taken troops there and one of the ones that I

430
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:10.440
remembered,
I've looked forward to try and find it again.

431
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.900
I don't know if it's clean,
I don't know.
I don't know where it went but I,

432
00:29:13.901 --> 00:29:15.060
I haven't been able to find it.

433
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.720
But the guy basically says it all started when the guys stopped shaving and when

434
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:23.980
they stopped shaving then they,

435
00:29:23.981 --> 00:29:25.830
then the next thing you knew they weren't cleaning their guns.

436
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.290
Then the next thing you knew they weren't

437
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.810
staying aware while they were on watch.
And then the next thing you know,

438
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:38.700
they were getting overrun and killed.
So those little things,

439
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.360
those little things that you do right all the time are important.

440
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.240
And that's the same thing with you.
And with me and with our lives,

441
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.810
it's those little things,
those little disciplines,

442
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:54.410
those little daily disciplines.

443
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.750
We'll cycle like you waking up at four 30 in the morning,
like me,
wait,

444
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.700
like as a ritual,
you know,
that's one of them at,
you know,

445
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.930
I try and do something physically active every day.
That's another thing.

446
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.000
When you lose that discipline,
what goes next?

447
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.750
The next thing on the lidding really.
And then the end of the next thing,

448
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:12.500
you know,
you're sleeping in until nine,

449
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.190
you're not getting your work done and things are going horribly backwards.

450
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.660
But it's those little disciplines.
Yeah.
And,

451
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.150
and whenever I feel myself start to slip,
I always think of this.

452
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.110
I always think of the fact that there's these little disciplines that means so

453
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.970
much and they build on each other.

454
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.460
It's interesting is that I didn't,
I didn't really look at it that way ever.

455
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.470
And that makes complete sense where,
yeah,

456
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.850
you let the little things slide and slowly by slowly those things that you let

457
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:41.410
slide start getting bigger and bigger.

458
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.560
I always thought of it where I remember hearing somebody say,

459
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.840
if you can't make your bed right,
right.
Then how do you expect to run a company?

460
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.660
I think it was how do you expect to be the boss of a company?

461
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.570
And I remember thinking,
well,

462
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.410
unless your company is a bed making company that has nothing to do with it.

463
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.780
And this is also a little bit counter to something I've heard recently.

464
00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:08.350
And when they talk about have you heard of this decision fatigue?

465
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:10.130
Have you heard that?
Not Static.

466
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:15.040
So it's basically this theory where every decision you make take some sort of

467
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:18.040
toll on you mentally.
Yes.
And so you should,

468
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.760
you should not fatigue your,
your decisions.

469
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:25.390
You should only should save your decisions for important things.
So for instance,

470
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:30.430
is that Kinda like if you're with a group of people and once one guy says,

471
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.390
hey,
where do you guys want to eat?
And everyone says,
oh,
I don't care.

472
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:36.780
Where do you want to?
It's different.
It's the same thing.

473
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.320
Maybe in a way lower level,
but,

474
00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:41.440
but the level of this is when I heard about this decision fatigue,

475
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.000
the level that I heard this on was a

476
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.473
<v 1>like</v>

477
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.260
<v 0>you every day you don't,</v>

478
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.090
you shouldn't think about what you're going to wear that day.

479
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.120
You should have your clothes ready because if you wake up,
you have to think,
oh,

480
00:31:53.121 --> 00:31:54.900
do I wear the blue shirt or the white shirt and,

481
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:57.210
and it becomes decision and then you decide,

482
00:31:57.211 --> 00:31:58.970
or what am I going to have for breakfast?
I have this,
we have that.

483
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.350
And each one of these decisions chip away now.
Now that's fine.

484
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:04.190
I don't really,

485
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.550
I don't know if I believe that 100% but one thing I do think is the opposite is

486
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:11.560
I think that the smaller disciplines

487
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.950
instill and create stronger disciplines.
So the waking up early,

488
00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:20.160
the making of the bed,
the the checking off your list,

489
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:23.910
that all those little things that you do,
I think increased discipline.

490
00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:28.050
I know what you went.
When I fall off the discipline wagon for whatever reason,

491
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.370
it's like a,
it's like a train wreck,
you know,
I'm like,
oh my God,

492
00:32:32.371 --> 00:32:35.550
what just happened?
I'm all of a sudden my room is a mess in my,

493
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.030
it just goes down hill in three days and two days and I go,
oh my,

494
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.490
get back in the game.

495
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.510
So and then as soon as I get back in the game and I implement those smaller

496
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:45.620
disciplines,
boom,

497
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:48.770
we're back in the game and the and the bigger disciplines fall into place.

498
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:56.130
<v 1>So
continue now</v>

499
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.400
<v 0>there was a general</v>

500
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.233
<v 1>that had</v>

501
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.790
<v 0>swung through Vietnam,
General James Wool.
No.</v>

502
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:08.963
<v 1>And</v>

503
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.530
<v 0>he observed,
and this is going to the book General James We'll know,</v>

504
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.430
observed and wrote to the chief to chief of staff Westmoreland.

505
00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:20.700
We all knew that is less than a month before.
So before this,

506
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.070
he had showed up before Hackworth had showed up.

507
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.190
This Guy General James wore wool.

508
00:33:26.191 --> 00:33:31.191
No had observed and wrote to chief of staff Westmoreland less than a month

509
00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:34.890
before,
during his whirlwind,
nine day trip to the war zone.

510
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.541
We'll know.

511
00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:41.541
Told the chief that the most you that the almost universal opinion among those

512
00:33:42.841 --> 00:33:46.740
he'd spoken with was that the young officers and enlisted men being sent to

513
00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:49.860
Vietnam were indeed properly trained,

514
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.330
prepared for combat both by training and mental conditioning.

515
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.800
So this guy wrote this flowery report after he goes,

516
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.550
goes to Vietnam for nine days and you can imagine somebody like Hackworth that

517
00:34:02.551 --> 00:34:06.150
spent five years in Vietnam,
somebody shows up,
spends nine days there.

518
00:34:06.151 --> 00:34:10.410
He's looking at this guy like he's knee idiot.
Yeah.
And this is a,
a classic

519
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.343
<v 1>mmm.</v>

520
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.480
<v 0>Statement about leadership.
He said,</v>

521
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.090
this is Hackworth going directly to the book again,

522
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:23.420
what a mistake it was to listen to the generals of corporate HQ who were briefed

523
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.200
only in zero defect terms and so far from the cutting edge expected nothing

524
00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:35.730
less.
It was among the biggest mistakes of the war.

525
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.770
The politicians only listened to these generals and these generals to

526
00:34:40.771 --> 00:34:45.340
themselves.
That's,
that's crazy.

527
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.870
And this is again,

528
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.980
when I was talking about questioning earlier and I like I questioned Hackworth

529
00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:52.720
and I question everybody and everything.

530
00:34:52.721 --> 00:34:55.600
I'm constantly asking those questions because you don't know.

531
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.150
You don't know if you're just listening to the generals that are only listening

532
00:34:58.151 --> 00:35:00.700
to themselves.
Back to the book.

533
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.400
Few people ask the frontline soldiers,

534
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.340
the only ones who really knew.

535
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.463
<v 1>So</v>

536
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.890
<v 0>you got to talk to your frontline troops.
Yeah.</v>

537
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.610
That's just a mandatory piece of leadership.

538
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.173
<v 1>Uh,</v>

539
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.360
<v 0>I liked it.
I had a great word on this.
It's called incestual knowledge,
right?</v>

540
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.150
When the,

541
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:27.800
when this little group just talks among themselves and they believe everything

542
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.410
that they hear and they,
and they agree with everything they hear.

543
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:31.221
And you know where we see this,

544
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:35.690
we see this and we saw it with mixed martial arts because you saw guys that got

545
00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:40.691
so into their own little thing with no outside influence that when they all

546
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.950
believed their own crap.
Yeah.
And digits.
It can be to fully,

547
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:51.690
it can be that way and you've got to have an open mind with everything,

548
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:52.950
you know.
Um,

549
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.560
and definitely Jujitsu is one of the things you got to have an open mind with

550
00:35:57.561 --> 00:36:01.830
him,
see what other people are doing and how are they doing it.
And that's,

551
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.850
that's the miracle these days is you can be seeing getting all this influence

552
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:06.684
from the Internet.

553
00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.780
It was all these different people out there and showing how they're doing it.

554
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:13.360
And it's,
it's a whole new world.
But you got to have an open mind.
If you haven't,

555
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.460
no,
don't have an open mind.

556
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:19.461
And all you do is incestuously converse with other people that believe the same

557
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:23.780
thing as you.
You're wrong.
Um,

558
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.800
and this is crazy.
This is,
this is again,

559
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:33.420
this is what we'll know,
says what is left.

560
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:34.980
And he's talking about the,
this Vietnam,

561
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.400
what is left appears to be a mopping up operation.

562
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.580
I do not believe that in the current situation,

563
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:45.570
the enemy has the capability to more than harass us.

564
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.410
I did not find a division commander who disagreed with this conclusion with

565
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:51.900
respect to his own tactical area of operations.

566
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.850
This is 1968 and this general is coming back saying,
hey,

567
00:36:56.851 --> 00:37:01.290
the enemy can't do anything but harass us.
Eh,
and that's this.

568
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:06.150
This guy was the ranking guy going back and reporting to Westmoreland and in

569
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:07.020
charge of the whole army.

570
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:12.090
Crazy crazy that this could be taking place.

571
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.650
As we go a little bit deeper into this.

572
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.740
They had a board that explained it was like a scoreboard for how many VC,

573
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.320
Vietcong,

574
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.590
how many of them had been killed or wounded and how many Americans have been

575
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:33.530
killed or wood.
And when he took over,
when,

576
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.830
when Hackworth took over,
the enemy had zero Kia.

577
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.540
So there've been zero enemy killed,
zero enemy wounded and zero enemy captured.

578
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.513
Meanwhile,

579
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.720
the Americans had had 24 killed and 485 wounded.

580
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.950
So did you hear what I just said?
I did.

581
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.630
So the enemy had zero killed,
zero wounded,

582
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.620
zero captured,

583
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.720
and yet we had lost 24 Americans killed and 485 wounded.

584
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.100
This goes back to what I was talking about where I would see these similarities

585
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:13.101
in Iraq to Vietnam because these wounded came from rockets,

586
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:18.810
mortars,
booby traps,
friendly fire
rockets,

587
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.370
mortars,
booby traps in front of fires.

588
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.400
I think 70% of the casualties in Iraq were from Ids,

589
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.330
which an IED is an improvised explosive device.
That's a booby trap.
You know,

590
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.240
the other big percentage was from getting mortared.
You know,

591
00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:36.160
where you're sitting inside your Firebase and all of a sudden bombs start

592
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:40.300
raining down from the sky.
And it's weird to like,

593
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:41.770
this is something that we talk about often.

594
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:44.020
It's something that that Hackworth talked about as well,

595
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:48.400
is if you've ever heard someone say in Vietnam,

596
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.640
we won every major battle,
but we just lost the word.

597
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:54.610
Have you ever heard that he was a,
it's a,

598
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.860
it's a statement that peep some people make.

599
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.030
And as I started to analyze that,

600
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.000
because when I was younger,
I was like,
yeah,
that's right,

601
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:05.260
because we're the best military in the world.

602
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:09.130
We would never lose to these guys were awesome and we are awesome and we are the

603
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:10.030
best military in the world.

604
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:15.090
But if I have a platoon of 40 guys in the army and we lose a guy to a booby trap

605
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.480
and we lose a guy to a mortar,
and we,
and we never confront the enemy,

606
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:30.940
who's going to win the war?
It's not us.
Right?
So that was a very,
uh,

607
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.430
very disturbing.
And we did see some of this,

608
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.860
we did see some of this in Iraq where things would get sugarcoated.
Mm.

609
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.780
And that's one thing.
I'd go back to the book and I'd say,

610
00:39:45.781 --> 00:39:47.520
why are they sugarcoating this?
What's going on?

611
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.440
Somebody needs to speak the truth.
You know,

612
00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:52.830
we need to tell them what's really going on here.
Hey,
I raised my hand and say,

613
00:39:52.831 --> 00:39:56.640
no boss.
It's not like that.
We need this.
We need,
we're,

614
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.590
this is where we're going to lose.
This is what's going wrong.

615
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.710
And Luckily we had some very strong,
you know,

616
00:40:01.711 --> 00:40:05.970
melt military leaders that did that.
You know,
uh,
Petraeus for sure,

617
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:11.070
who kind of implemented the surge.
We had a McMaster who I talk about a lot,

618
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.900
HR McMaster up in,
uh,
up in northern Iraq.

619
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.810
And you know,
the guy that I worked directly for,
Colonel Sean McFarlin,

620
00:40:19.811 --> 00:40:23.430
who is now a general,
uh,
those guys were guys that spoke the truth.

621
00:40:23.431 --> 00:40:26.580
And I would hear,
I heard Mcfarland do that.
I would hear that guy say,
no,

622
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.700
actually we can't do that.
No,
that's actually the wrong idea.
No,

623
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:32.100
we actually need to engage with these tribal leaders even though they were

624
00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:34.380
criminals six months ago.
No,
this is what we need to do.

625
00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:38.580
So I got to see some of that leadership step up,
which was,

626
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.180
which was awesome.
Uh,

627
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.133
<v 1>okay.</v>

628
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.840
<v 0>He goes on to talk about how</v>

629
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.230
I got to read this.
So he goes to this,
what's called a change of command,

630
00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:58.170
which is when,
you know I'm in charge,
but I'm going to give you the battalion.

631
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.940
So the following day I took over the battalion from Lieutenant Colonel Franklin,

632
00:41:02.941 --> 00:41:04.950
a heart,
you know,
parade field,

633
00:41:04.951 --> 00:41:07.440
change of command in the middle of the Mekong Delta.

634
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.410
What kind of war have I gotten myself into?
I wondered,

635
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.540
a perfectly starched general,

636
00:41:12.541 --> 00:41:16.920
you was there having flown in for the occasion in his polished choppers.

637
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.700
There were,
there were other brass too,
and photographers the American flag,

638
00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:22.110
but the Italian colors,

639
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.380
which were ceremoniously passed onto me and all of this before the scroungy is

640
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.200
most spiritless assembly of soldiers I'd ever seen.

641
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.580
Incredibly.

642
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.530
None of the are colonels seem to notice the slack condition of my new charges or

643
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:37.550
their positions.

644
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.620
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Cart would still receive a legion of Merit for his job

645
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:46.880
well done with the battalion.

646
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.360
So picture that in your mind you're taking over this battalion.

647
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:52.970
These guys are just complete disaster.

648
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:58.270
The general show up in their polished helicopters wearing starched uniforms and

649
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:01.910
they don't even,
they just ignore,
it's like they're like got blinders on.

650
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.970
They're just ignoring the fact that these guys are just a total disaster.

651
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:13.150
Crazy thoughts,
crazy thoughts.
So,
um,

652
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.360
then we get into the point,

653
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:19.820
<v 1>okay,</v>

654
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.440
<v 0>where in this is where,
when we,</v>

655
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.740
when we get these questions on Twitter about leadership,

656
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:30.430
and this is sort of what drew me back to thinking about talking about this book

657
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.790
was because as we get these questions,
you end up with a,

658
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.640
with a just really great examples and,

659
00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.330
and a lot of questions that we get our,
um,
you know,

660
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:47.120
what do you do with people that are unmotivated?
What do you do when you know,

661
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:47.331
and,

662
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:50.120
and everyone has that question of what do you do when people aren't motivated?

663
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.270
And I,
I'll tell you,

664
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.640
can you imagine if there's anyone less motivated then a,
you know,

665
00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:03.200
a construct,
a draftee from Vietnam,
from the Vietnam War.
It's,
it's,

666
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.360
it's kind of crazy.

667
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.330
Sorry,
go ahead.
Yeah,
no problem.
Uh,

668
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.510
one of the things that hacks is his little,

669
00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:22.960
could I have guessed that whipping it into shape,

670
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:27.250
meaning the battalion would require every little bit bit of knowledge I'd gained

671
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.320
in,
in the interim.
So his whole career,

672
00:43:29.321 --> 00:43:31.760
he realized this whole careers and you have to take every trick that he'd

673
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.310
learned to get these guys into shape.

674
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.490
Now what's interesting about this is he says,
whipping these guys into shape,

675
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.800
and this is something I've had,

676
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:44.720
I've had executives when I get out,
get on with the CEO and he'll say,

677
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.530
I need you to come in here and a whip my guys into shape.
And it's always,

678
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.440
it's one of those quotes that I,

679
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:53.450
I have to push back on because they think I'm to come in there like a drill

680
00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:55.930
instructor and bark orders and people are going to obey it.

681
00:43:55.931 --> 00:44:00.440
It just doesn't work that way.
Yeah.
And you know you,
you have to do,

682
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.350
you have to do more than that.

683
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:08.620
So when one of the initial things that he did

684
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.540
was institute discipline.

685
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.570
<v 0>And as you know,
discipline is one of my favorite words.</v>

687
00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.050
Going back to the book here,

688
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:28.230
from the outset I realized that to make this unit and effective military force,

689
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:31.270
I'd have to implement about a thousand.

690
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.760
So I'd figured we'd start with five a day.
Little things,

691
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.880
basic things like where your steel pot helmet and clean and carry your rifle at

692
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:44.700
all times and ammunition will not be worn.
Poncho via style.

693
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.020
My first order was that calm darkness.

694
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:52.890
The fire support base perimeter would pull back 300 meters.

695
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:58.020
The troops instantly began to grumble at this but at the next order.

696
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:03.021
But it was the next order that really began the muteness feeling within my hard

697
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:04.704
luck outfit.

698
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.350
Anything you can't carry 24 hours a day is gone on the next shopper.

699
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.100
So here are these guys that were living in tents that had toilets out there,

700
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.010
radios and all this stuff.
And he said,
anything you can't carry with you,

701
00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:21.420
he's going is out of here.
That's hardcore discipline

702
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.753
and

703
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:26.643
<v 1>okay,</v>

704
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.900
<v 0>they piled it all up in the middle of the,
uh,</v>

705
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.220
the middle of the base and had a big helicopter come in and take it out.

706
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.390
Now one thing you said is here is he says,
I wasn't there to have them like me.

707
00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.550
And this is one of those dichotomies where,

708
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:48.030
and I'm sure everybody at one point or another who has worked for someone that

709
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.570
is very abrasive and thinks they can just throw words around and,
and,

710
00:45:57.571 --> 00:46:01.080
and no one likes working for that guy.
It's,
it's awful.
Yeah.

711
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.020
And so there is a fine line between,
listen,

712
00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:07.110
I'm not here to make friends and Oh,

713
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:10.620
I'm just going to be totally abrasive and treat everyone like crap because

714
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:13.020
you're not going to get people to follow you with that attitude.

715
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:18.410
So he obviously was very good at walking that fine line between pushing hard

716
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:22.920
enough where he's like,
Hey,
I'm not here to make friends.
But at the same time,

717
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.730
not pushing them so hard that he's getting shot or there there's a complete

718
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:29.940
mutiny against him.
Yeah.
You'd think that someone who,
who

719
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.230
<v 2>in my experience,
when people say that I'm not here to make friends,
you know,</v>

720
00:46:36.231 --> 00:46:37.520
I'm here to whatever,

721
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:41.920
it's usually kind of like an excuse because they pissed somebody off.
Yeah.

722
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.950
So I think that to really use that in a,
in a,
in a,

723
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.040
in an accurate way or in a,
in a conducive way,

724
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:54.041
I'm not here to make friends is if you can show them results and at the same

725
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:57.080
time not necessarily,
you know,
be the nicest of guys,

726
00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.140
then I think that's when you start to walk that fine line.

727
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.060
<v 0>So,
so it's beautiful that you said that.
So this,</v>

728
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.040
this goes right into the fact that,
uh,
a short time later,

729
00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:10.990
so after they pulled back this perimeter,

730
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.720
so every night instead of staying where they were just all relaxed,

731
00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:16.180
they packed up,
they pulled back,
they dug in.

732
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.900
Our short time later we were hit with a barrage of rocket and recoilless rifle

733
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.500
fire.
But most of it fell on the old positions.

734
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.180
When I got on the horn and called for artillery,
I was surprised.

735
00:47:28.181 --> 00:47:31.540
I was very nervous.
Command is not like hopping back onto a bicycle.

736
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.190
And after two and a half years away from it,

737
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:36.400
I was rusty and actually scared I'd screw up.

738
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.170
But then I heard a guy later do,
I bet be identified as Lieutenant Larry Taller,

739
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:45.910
who worked in the s three section running behind me to his defensive position.

740
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.080
And here's the quote from this guy,
he's a mean son of a bitch,

741
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.340
but he knows what he's doing.

742
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.730
So that's exactly what you just said and that's exactly what effect it had.

743
00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.313
Um,

744
00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.270
now moving through this,

745
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.620
the men,
and now he's talking about this unit,
the four,
three,
nine,

746
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.630
the men of the four,
three,
nine,

747
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:16.260
had no unit identity and no pride in themselves.

748
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.540
So for all those people that are out there that have sent me Twitter question

749
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.780
saying,
hey,
how do I deal with people that are motivated?
How do I,

750
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.960
how do I change?
There's another one.
How does culture change?
Uh,

751
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.170
he's going to go into that as a first step toward rectifying this.

752
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.480
I decided to call my hard luck battalion,

753
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.930
the hardcore and the troops raw condos.

754
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:41.940
So he's renaming them [inaudible],
he's renaming,
renaming the battalion.

755
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.830
And I actually did this very thing when I was a task unit commander when I took

756
00:48:46.831 --> 00:48:50.580
over a task unit.
So task units in a seal team,
they have a,

757
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:55.110
a phonetic letter for their name.
So there's out task unit,
Alpha Task Unit,

758
00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:58.830
Bravo Task Unit Charlie.
And then you've got the platoons underneath them.

759
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.990
So what I did with ours is basically as soon as I took it over,
I said,

760
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:08.700
hey,
we were tasking you to Bravo B.
And I said,
guys,
we're not tasking your Bravo,

761
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.050
we're tasking at bruiser.

762
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:14.910
And that was one of those things where even though at first people were kind of,

763
00:49:14.911 --> 00:49:16.850
you know what,
what's this all about?
But then,

764
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.130
but then after a little while they're like,
oh no,
no,
no,

765
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.190
cause you're an a task unit.
I'm in task unit bruiser right.
And it,

766
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.250
and it really does have a,
a legit effect.

767
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:28.910
<v 2>It's like a little psychological sense of pride.</v>

768
00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:33.911
Like we're this unique kind of almost elite group just in that small little

769
00:49:34.731 --> 00:49:37.940
psychological way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think branding,

770
00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:40.860
a lot of that has a lot to do with branding.
Where where um,

771
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.680
you get like a company for example,
um,

772
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.830
you do just little things different and include everyone,
whether it be the name,

773
00:49:48.831 --> 00:49:51.610
whether it be little.
I mean sometimes they do it with them.

774
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.600
It's like team building exercises for sure.
Which I've seen a lot of ones that,

775
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.820
that,
that,
that don't really,
they're not very effective.

776
00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:01.000
But there's certain things that if,

777
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.550
if those activities can kind of invoke a sense of pride and you guys are doing

778
00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:08.570
it together,
that's when that's when that can work.
And the name thing,

779
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.750
it's crazy how that's such a big thing when you're a little bit then when you

780
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:15.020
have a cool name where like it's almost like a gang mentality.
It is

781
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:19.130
<v 0>literally says here they had no unit identity.
So guess what?</v>

782
00:50:19.131 --> 00:50:23.390
He's going to pick that identity,
calm the hardcore,
calm the condo.

783
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.750
He's going to give them that identity and give them something to latch onto and

784
00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:30.210
he goes further.
So he talks about how in the past,
when he was in a,

785
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.010
with another unit,
he,

786
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:37.010
they had this greeting between officers and enlisted guys and the officer would

787
00:50:37.011 --> 00:50:39.260
say airborne and the enlisted guy would say all the way.

788
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:41.570
So the airborne all the way.

789
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:46.310
And so now these guys are in Vietnam and it's a little bit different.

790
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:49.610
It's a little bit harder.
So now,
and this going back to the book,

791
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.310
when a soldier saluted an officer,

792
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.700
he said hardcore Macondo sir.

793
00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.030
And when the officer responded,

794
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.900
it was with a heartfelt no fucking slack.

795
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.440
And I mean it,
it doesn't get any better than that.

796
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.970
And as a matter of fact,
when this is one of the most fired up things,
uh,
when I,

797
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:15.620
when I retired from the seal teams,

798
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.460
the guys that ran the land warfare training,

799
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:23.840
so like the most miserable hard training out in the Imperial Valley of

800
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:28.130
California where it's 120 degrees and you're humping through the desert and it's

801
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:31.790
just completely hardcore.
And we would,
I mean,

802
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:35.000
the training was miserable and tough and realistic and bad ass.

803
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:39.470
And when I left those guys from the Land Warfare Group,
uh,

804
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:44.450
gave me a shotgun and on the shotgun was engraved,
no fucking slack.

805
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.160
So the,
so you picture these guys walking around,
it's like you just said,

806
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:51.260
you're talking about unit identity and they give him this name,

807
00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.470
but now they're walking on into,
every time they see each other,
they're saying,

808
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:59.270
hardcore Rick Condo,
no fucking slack.
And I don't care.
That's a mantra,

809
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.600
you know?
And that becomes a mantra that becomes what you say.

810
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.490
And that doesn't take much for what you say to start to become what you believe.

811
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:12.560
And so I love that.
I love,
and when we work with companies we,
you know,

812
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:15.170
depending on how long we're working with them for,
we'll sit down and can,

813
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:17.270
we'll have him come up with a mission statement.
Yeah.

814
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.730
And then we'll come up with some kind of a mantra and I'll tell him this story

815
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:22.700
about no fucking slack and you know,
like what is gonna make you?

816
00:52:22.701 --> 00:52:25.850
What is going to make you think that way?
Because that's what I used to say,

817
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:30.740
Atlanta warfare.
You know,
when I was running land warfare training,
you know,

818
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:33.890
hey,
should we give these guys a little extra time?
Should we give him that?

819
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.040
Should we move the target a little bit closer to the insert point?
Are these,

820
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.990
can we make this a little bit easier for him?

821
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.320
And I'd say no fucking slack.

822
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.480
And the reason was I wanted these guys to be ready.

823
00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:50.480
I wanted every one of those seals that was going to Iraq and Afghanistan to be

824
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:51.680
ready for anything.
If you ready.

825
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:54.680
I wanted the training to be harder than real combat.
That was the goal.

826
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.290
And then these,

827
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.900
these little mantras and all these things that kind of gives everyone a sense of

828
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:03.530
pride in going through that hard training.
Oh,
for sure.

829
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:08.531
To ultimately result in being ready for them to take pride and enjoyment in that

830
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:14.090
hard training because of these little tiny things that makes it just that much

831
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:18.170
more effective.
You know,
the whole,
the whole situation.
It's completely true.

832
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:23.600
Um,
there's another piece here.

833
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.980
Simultaneous had going back to the,

834
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.640
simultaneously I started establishing standard operating procedures that would

835
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:31.920
not only keep the troops alive,

836
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.810
but also give them for the first time the feeling they were in charge of the

837
00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:37.770
situation,

838
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.330
not at mercy of the VC or insidious booby traps.

839
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.560
So think about that.
You know,
this,

840
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:51.360
this idea that you're on the defense all the time and you're constantly like

841
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:55.230
waiting to get blown up or waiting to get mortared,
awaiting to get a take,

842
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.690
a sniper round.
That's a horrible,
horrible feeling.

843
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.110
Being on the receiving end of that stuff is horrible because you don't have

844
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:05.670
control over it.
So then they started slowly putting things together too

845
00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:11.090
to go on the offensive sop.

846
00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.080
Standard operating procedures included such things as every officer having to

847
00:54:15.081 --> 00:54:17.420
read Mao's little red book.

848
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.610
So this was kind of the communist way and he wanted all the officers to know and

849
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:27.611
understand that because how can you beat an enemy if you don't know what they're

850
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:28.554
thinking.

851
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:33.620
That was another just classic move and you got to think like the enemy.

852
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.640
I've got a couple more things to pull out here.

853
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:47.310
People talking about.
Um,
you know,
Karen for your guys.

854
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:51.000
And here's another good,
you know I,
this is going back to the book.

855
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:55.260
I wasn't going to lose any legs for a couple VC.

856
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.340
I was into fighting hard but not at the expense of bleeding troops.

857
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.340
The fact that I had that,
I walked with the platoons,

858
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.110
put me in the good graces and a lot of men,

859
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:08.130
but my stock eat rose even faster when they got word.

860
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.370
When word got around that I wasn't a butcher.
So,

861
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:15.580
even though he was hardcore and he was saying no fucking slack,
what do you,

862
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:19.020
what he talks about earlier in that paragraph is if he found one of the young

863
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:20.910
officers was doing something that was careless,

864
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:24.390
that could put guys at risk of running into booby traps or add that would,

865
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:26.910
that didn't have a good return,
he'd fire that guy.

866
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.830
He would literally just fire the guy and the,
and so the guys realized,
okay,

867
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.970
this guy is hardcore,
but guess what?
He cares about us and that,
that,

868
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.250
that is huge.
And,
and another piece,

869
00:55:41.251 --> 00:55:45.060
and this is kinda going back to what we just said,
all the four,
three,

870
00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:49.530
nine really needed head need had really needed,
was a good kick in the ass,

871
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.790
which included creating or bringing in leaders who cared for their men and

872
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:58.230
giving the men some sense of real purpose.

873
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:02.760
Wow.
Wow.
You know,

874
00:56:02.761 --> 00:56:06.600
and what we call that in real life,
and I talk about it in the book,
it's the why.

875
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.980
Why are we here?
And you'd be surprised.

876
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.110
It happens with companies,
it happens with families,
it happens in the military.

877
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:17.340
It happens with teams.

878
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.580
They don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.

879
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:22.650
They're just doing it as a task,
as a robot.

880
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.880
And you can't treat people like robot.

881
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.270
People have to have some kind of longterm goal.

882
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:31.060
They have to have an understanding of why they're doing what they're doing.

883
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:36.100
So that's,
that's like 99% of my answers when somebody says,
Hey,

884
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:39.070
I've got this problem with these people don't want to follow this rule.

885
00:56:39.071 --> 00:56:42.220
They don't want to do this safety,
uh,

886
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.670
task or safety procedure,
the,
you know,

887
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:48.070
I can't get my guys to do the safety procedure.
And I'm like,
well,

888
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.860
do they understand why they're doing it?
Well,
what do you mean?

889
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.470
Do they understand why they are doing it?

890
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:57.520
They understand why they are supposed to clip in at the top of a tower that

891
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:59.050
they're climbing.
Do they understand why?

892
00:56:59.051 --> 00:57:01.390
Do they understand the implications if they fall?

893
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:03.910
They understand the implications,
not just to them but to their family.

894
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.670
Are they thinking about the implications to their job or they think about the

895
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:09.580
implications to the company.
And then on other people's jobs,

896
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.910
you put all those why,
here's why your clip it into that tower.

897
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.840
Because if you fall,
you can't pay your mortgage,
your kids,
he'll can't eat.

898
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:20.320
Then on top of that,
we have to shut down the tower for week.

899
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:23.590
We're going to lose money,
we're going to lose jobs.
And when you think about why,

900
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:25.450
then all of a sudden the guy goes,
okay,
I guess I'll clip it.

901
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.850
It's one of those things.

902
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:32.851
So that idea of understanding why is just extremely important and uh,

903
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.270
to close out this,
this section on

904
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.900
about face,
which again,
depending on,
I don't know,
this may be,

905
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:51.760
maybe this was just a,
um,
an exercise in my own,

906
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.750
in my own,
uh,
what is it,
what is that word?
Selfishness.

907
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.980
To be able to talk about this with people and have the mayor and,

908
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.980
and for me to go from this book again,
again,
I'm learning every time I read it,

909
00:58:02.981 --> 00:58:06.370
but to kind of wrap it up.
So he goes on and they go on,

910
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:07.990
this is a long chapter,

911
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:12.991
and they'd go on to talk about all these different things that they did and they

912
00:58:13.271 --> 00:58:16.480
did turn the fight and they did start to kill the enemy and they did start to

913
00:58:16.481 --> 00:58:19.690
spare their own guys and they started fighting the guerrillas like they were

914
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:22.630
gorilla.
So he really implemented all those things that they had talked about.

915
00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.210
So now he's getting ready to leave and he says,
uh,

916
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:33.370
the hardcore battalion proved to me everything I'd ruminated on throughout the

917
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:37.870
two years that went before all those ideas and theories on how to fight the g

918
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:41.560
and the G is gorillas.
If there was satisfaction in that,

919
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.120
there was much less in the fact that my success didn't make a dent in the way

920
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:47.530
the war was prosecuted.

921
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.960
So even though he did a great job and it really changed their battlefield for

922
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:56.350
him,
other people didn't say,
oh,
I see what they're doing.

923
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.050
I'm going to do that too.
Ironically,

924
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.140
what did was the debacle of Hamburger here?

925
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.660
Hill where screaming Eagle,

926
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.190
General Melvin's ace ordered 11 assaults up,

927
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:12.340
an extremely well fortified,
totally use,

928
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:15.790
totally useless piece of real estate as if he thought

929
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.890
as if he thought he was in Korea or storming crowd at Normandy,

930
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.450
almost 400 American men dead or wounded later.
The one,

931
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:28.670
oh one unit was king of the mountain,

932
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:32.210
but within a week be objective was abandoned.

933
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:33.740
So I don't know if you've ever heard of this,

934
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:37.340
but a hamburger hill is a huge deal.
Wast full 100 guys wounded or dead,

935
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.820
held it for a week and then left the ensuing horrified uproar among American

936
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:44.840
people and in Washington Bade.
Sure.

937
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:48.410
Hamburger hill was the last huge and costly battle fought by an American troops

938
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:49.244
in Vietnam.

939
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:54.440
So I guess if no one learned how to fight the war for me and the men of the

940
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:59.240
hardcore,
at least from generalizations,
they finally learned how not to.

941
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.970
But we were already four years into the war and there were almost four more to

942
01:00:04.971 --> 01:00:05.804
go.

943
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

944
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.610
<v 0>Tough.
So that's about face for you.</v>

945
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.190
That is a,
uh,
that is a heavy book,
figuratively and literally.

946
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:25.530
And you know,
again,
depending on,
uh,
what people thought of that,

947
01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:29.400
maybe we'll come back to it and talk about it again in the future.

948
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

949
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:36.130
<v 0>That book and those experiences are kind of where this comes from,</v>

950
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.860
this mindset and the attitude that I have.

951
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.510
How much of it do you think?
I don't,

952
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:48.170
I couldn't sit here and put a percentage on it.
Um,
from a leadership,

953
01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:52.850
from a combat leadership perspective,
it is a,
it is a pretty significant amount.

954
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.350
You know,
it's probably in the,
in the 20 or 30% of

955
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.350
confirming things that I believed,
learning new things,

956
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.850
seeing things and reading about them and then watching them happen and,

957
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.720
and understanding them so that it definitely is a,

958
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.380
is a significant portion of some kind.
Yeah.

959
01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:23.260
Meanwhile,
meanwhile,
on the Internet,
on the interwebs,

960
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.290
we got a bunch of great questions,
bunch.
I mean,

961
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:31.000
we've got hundreds of hundreds of great questions and obviously we can't answer

962
01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:35.740
them all.
So some of them we kind of compiled together.

963
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.050
Some of them we pulled out and you know,
what I did not do is I did not,

964
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:42.500
<v 1>yeah.</v>

965
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.490
<v 0>Put the names of the people that submitted them.
So next time I will do that.</v>

966
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.570
I think we got one person that that recommended that.

967
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.980
So I apologize for everyone out there on Twitter and Facebook that submitted

968
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:58.880
questions and we used them next time I'll,

969
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.940
I'll try and get your name in there so you'll know that I am talking to you,

970
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:10.700
but uh,
but we've got some great feedback and comments and all that.

971
01:02:10.701 --> 01:02:14.990
So let's,
uh,
let's dive into some of these.
Okay.
So mental toughness,

972
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:15.771
we're going back to this.

973
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:19.590
I think this is important mental toughness because I think this is one of those

974
01:02:19.591 --> 01:02:20.070
things that's

975
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.580
<v 2>a constant endeavor for,</v>

976
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.490
I would argue for everybody.
I would agree in one way or another and that,

977
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:33.870
and this question is really appropriate.
Mental toughness is not just one thing.

978
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.870
Some people are tough in the gym or in fights,

979
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:40.170
but weak when their wife leaves him,
for example.
Do you agree with that?

980
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.270
<v 0>And,
and this guy,
and again,
I wish I had whoever you are,</v>

981
01:02:43.271 --> 01:02:47.200
I apologize because he actually makes a statement.
This is a statement.

982
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:49.540
Mental toughness is not one thing.

983
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.220
And then he quantifies that statement by saying some people are tough in the gym

984
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:58.630
or in fights,
but weak when their lives,
when their wives leaves them.

985
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.400
He says,
do you agree?
Well,

986
01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:04.450
I agree 100% and this opens up

987
01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:11.310
a whole spectrum of reality and that is that these,

988
01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:15.730
that that,

989
01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:20.730
what is it that crushes a person because it's different for everybody.

990
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.480
Everybody has this thing,

991
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:29.260
this weakness that maybe it never gets uncovered.
Maybe it does.

992
01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.140
And the fact that he's talking about,
you know,

993
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:36.970
fighters and saying that people are tough in the gym.

994
01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:41.890
They're tough and fights,
but they have some weakness that can crush them.

995
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.550
I think we've seen that plenty.
I mean,
just famous people,

996
01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.560
famous fighters that this has happened to Jon Bones Jones.

997
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.170
I mean obviously the guy's an animal and fights.

998
01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:55.540
He's an animal training in the gym,

999
01:03:55.990 --> 01:04:00.990
but he has some mental weaknesses that he needs to overcome in that hopefully

1000
01:04:02.111 --> 01:04:06.420
you will be able to sue.
He can reach his full potential.
And I,

1001
01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.730
I hope he does,
but you know,

1002
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.820
he's lucky he's got a good support base around him and he's got money to,

1003
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:21.030
to try and solve these problems because there's a lot of people that end up with

1004
01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:25.600
those weaknesses or have those weaknesses and ends up crushing them.

1005
01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.250
And that's scary.
And I'll tell you what the scariest thing is,

1006
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.920
and I think this is a great lesson and it's something that I learned over and

1007
01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:39.940
over again and I don't know when it exactly solidified in my brain,

1008
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:44.230
but it's so disturbing and bizarre.

1009
01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:48.610
When you see somebody that you care about

1010
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:55.650
and you watch them go down this spiral and it's so obvious what they have to do

1011
01:04:59.051 --> 01:05:02.470
to stop it,
to stop the downward spiral.
It's like,
Oh,
uh,

1012
01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:07.620
get rid of that girl or get you stop using that drug or stop drinking or do

1013
01:05:08.051 --> 01:05:11.230
whatever the case may be,
whatever that thing that's got them.

1014
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.520
And you're clearly telling them to stop it and they don't.

1015
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.340
<v 2>Yeah,
because I mean,
and I think I,</v>

1016
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.590
I think I know what your point is going to be here,

1017
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.590
but can you say it's clearly obvious?

1018
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:25.990
It's clearly obvious,

1019
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:30.640
kind of a way to put it in as it's clearly obvious on paper where you could

1020
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:34.000
point it out and that person,
the person you care about,
he shoe or whatever,

1021
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.730
they would probably agree with you and you say,
Oh,

1022
01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:39.400
is this holding you back you think?
Or is this jamming you up?

1023
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:44.740
And they'd probably say,
yeah,
but to be like,
oh,
just simply let it go.

1024
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:48.830
Let's say it was a girl would say,
I dunno.
Good girlfriend like that.

1025
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.770
Um,
and you're like,
yeah,

1026
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:55.600
the girls jamming me up snow or whatever.
Um,

1027
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.990
and you know,
it's as simple as that.
Get rid of the girl.

1028
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.480
But I think in everybody's different,

1029
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:06.790
there's a certain need that someone has an inherent need that that girl is

1030
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:11.320
fulfilling and that need is big no matter how deep down it is.

1031
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.840
It's a big need obviously,
that they're letting that need get fulfilled in,
in,

1032
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.610
at the expense of their goals,
their training or whatever.

1033
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:24.190
So it's not that easy.
It's obvious.
Sure.
But it's just not that easy to be like,

1034
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:26.440
oh,
let's just get rid of the girl.
I didn't say it was easy,

1035
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.360
but I know you've seen this.

1036
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:32.140
I think we've all seen this where you're looking at a situation with someone

1037
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:34.960
that you truly care about and you want to help them.

1038
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:40.240
And you could write down in two sentences what they have to do to completely

1039
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:43.300
resurrect and change their life.
And it's just,

1040
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.440
it is as easy as getting rid of a girl or a guy that's took on a life that's a

1041
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:49.331
disaster.

1042
01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:54.331
Or it's as easy as stopping either use of drugs and alcohol or it is easy as

1043
01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.420
cutting sugar out of your diet because you're sick from it or just easy as

1044
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:06.100
working out in a certain methodology to get you through this situation.
So it's,

1045
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.750
it's,
it's horrible and it's one of those things that's,
for me,

1046
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:14.500
it's taught me to,
again,
I talk about detachment law,

1047
01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.680
detach from myself to make sure I'm not that guy that doesn't have so many issue

1048
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:24.760
that's holding me back and I could be doing better if I would get,

1049
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:28.240
if I would take that input from other people or even better off if I could

1050
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:31.690
detach and see that input myself and self correct.

1051
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.790
And you when you can see it in someone else,
that's really what you,

1052
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.910
what the dynamics of that relationship is.
Meaning let's say,
you know,

1053
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.350
your friend has something,
a girl for example,
holding them back.

1054
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.480
It's easy for you to say,
oh,
just do this.

1055
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:49.180
Here's the two sentences is like going to do,
get rid of the girl,
be happy.

1056
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:53.410
That's it.
It's easy because you are detached.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1057
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.130
So the hard part is for him to actually detach,
but if he can detach,
look in,

1058
01:07:57.131 --> 01:08:01.270
he'd be essentially in the same position as you and probably be able to at least

1059
01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:04.210
be on his way to do it.
Exactly.
It's weird though.

1060
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.450
And that's why I say people are crazy.

1061
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:12.640
Like we do crazy things.
We make big mistakes,
we get emotional,

1062
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:17.270
we do things that are crazy,
human beings do it.
And that's very,

1063
01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:20.120
very difficult to deal with.
And,
and it's really,
uh,

1064
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.650
it can be very sad to see,
you know,
I've seen people with great,

1065
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.800
unbelievable potential that have for all practical purposes,

1066
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:33.860
cast it away for some ridiculous reason that again,

1067
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.490
if they would have followed two bullet points on a piece of paper that said,

1068
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:40.790
get rid of this girl and stop using this drug,

1069
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:44.570
their life would be different and you just,
you can't help them.
Yeah.

1070
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.850
And obviously,
you know,
getting rid of a girl,

1071
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.360
that's clearly just an example.
It's not,

1072
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.430
we're not saying girls or any sort of a problem.

1073
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.840
We've seen the same thing with girls and guys and girls that had date.

1074
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.600
This guy that's a disaster that drags them down,
whatever.

1075
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.700
And it could be the one,
we should just say relationships and it would be unfair,

1076
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.880
toxic relationships,
toxic relationship.
Um,
I an,

1077
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.990
I mean you use the word ridiculous,
which,
uh,
you know,
cool.

1078
01:09:11.991 --> 01:09:15.320
But I don't think it is really ridiculous because if you kind of,

1079
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.930
if you break it down,
I think,
like I said,

1080
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.780
they have a certain need that isn't obvious to everyone,
you know,

1081
01:09:23.781 --> 01:09:26.330
and everyone else I even to them,
it might not be obvious,

1082
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:31.331
but they have a need in there that this toxic relationship is fulfilling.

1083
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:35.030
It's jamming up a bunch of other things in their life or their goals,

1084
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.470
but it is fulfilling this little thing that they need.
We'll,
okay,

1085
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.330
you can say that.
That's,
that's fine.

1086
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.150
I'm not gonna argue with you.
That's the,
that's the root of the problem though,

1087
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:52.480
if that need is,
if basically the,
the,
the,

1088
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:57.380
some of that need or the,
the,
the size of that,
the size,

1089
01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.410
the bigger than the need of them achieving those goals,

1090
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.130
which may seem weird because it's like all that teeny tiny need to be loved or

1091
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:08.990
accepted is bigger than being a champion of the world or be,
it seems weird,

1092
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:11.780
but from an individual standpoint on the,

1093
01:10:11.781 --> 01:10:16.781
in how they feel on the inside that need in a lot of times is bigger.

1094
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.360
And that's what's crazy,
which is why I said people are crazy because he gets,

1095
01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:26.500
so you make that determination and you can't help them.
That's the piece.

1096
01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:30.530
You cannot help them and you can try,
you can paint it out for him.

1097
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:34.640
You can tell them a thousand times,
a thousand different ways.
Yeah.
I think,

1098
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.880
yeah,
I think there are ways to help.
Obviously.

1099
01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:40.820
I think it's like through like a therapy type of situation.

1100
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:43.130
Not necessarily like a professional therapy maybe,

1101
01:10:43.131 --> 01:10:47.780
but not necessarily or something really impactful.
Yeah,
I was here.
You know,

1102
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.900
you always hear it's gotta be the rock bottom.

1103
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.950
The person's got to hit rock bottom somehow.
And then they realize,
okay,

1104
01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.960
I've destroyed my life.
Now I'll start moving again.

1105
01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.170
And you just wish you could help them before they hit rock bottom.

1106
01:11:00.171 --> 01:11:03.320
I was talking about this today with,
uh,
with Greg hitting rock bottom.

1107
01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:07.240
And the reason that it's typically,

1108
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:09.140
and I'll just use the word easier,

1109
01:11:09.141 --> 01:11:13.070
it's easier to move forward when you hit rock bottom is because you're not,

1110
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:17.520
you can't go any further deeper.
But what that,
I mean,
that sounds obvious,

1111
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:21.510
but what that means is you're here right at the bottom.

1112
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:25.530
If below here is unacceptable,

1113
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:29.310
it's death or it's,
you know,
I don't know,
jail,
I dunno,
whatever,

1114
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:34.050
whatever your rock bottom is.
So you can never justify,
oh,

1115
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:36.630
I've been doing it this way and I'm still here.

1116
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.810
You can never make that justification at rock bottom because I've been doing it

1117
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:42.240
this way and I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
You're rock bottom.

1118
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:44.220
But let's say you're not at rock bottom,

1119
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:47.820
but you're pretty junk yard and you're not doing good,
but you're making it,

1120
01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:52.620
you're handling it.
Sure,
your job sucks.
But I'm still here.

1121
01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.640
You know,
I still got my car to justify.
Yes.
Okay,

1122
01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:59.970
I need to make an improvement.
I'm going to start,
I'm going to start on Monday.

1123
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:02.800
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna make an improvement.
So they started Monday.
Okay,

1124
01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:05.250
if it goes good,
Tuesday goes good,
Wednesday,

1125
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:08.730
some temptation comes and whatever the drugs or drinking,
whatever,

1126
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:15.210
when they're kind of exhausted from putting in that effort to change and it's

1127
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:17.250
like,
okay,
I'll just have one beer.
Okay,
I'll just,
okay,

1128
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:21.450
I'll just start drinking again because really,
I'm cool with it.
You know,
I,

1129
01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:23.400
I made it,
it's not that bad.

1130
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.900
They've accepted their station in life and somebody accepts their station in

1131
01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:32.040
life,
then I guess they're not going to be motivated to do anything.
Right.
So,

1132
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:36.300
and that accepting their station is essentially their justification for

1133
01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:39.630
relapsing.
But when you're at rock bottom,
you can't do that.
So,
I mean,

1134
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:42.050
obviously people's rock bottom,
they're different,
like I said,
but,
um,

1135
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.980
that's the reason that it's,
that it's easier.
I know it sounds crazy,

1136
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:50.730
but it's easier to move forward when you're at rock bottom.
It's tough stuff.
So,

1137
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:54.790
um,
yeah,
mental toughness yet,
like how you said it is,
um,

1138
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.670
it's different for everyone and you can be met.

1139
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.440
It's not an across the board thing.

1140
01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:03.441
You're just mentally tough to tie this back into mental toughness is again,

1141
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:07.470
going back to detachment.
You know,
I'm,
I'm glad we're,

1142
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.050
most of the people listening to this aren't dealing with a situation where

1143
01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:14.820
they've got some grievous scenario going on and their life is on a downward

1144
01:13:14.821 --> 01:13:15.420
spiral.

1145
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.250
Hopefully we're downward spiral is that you slept in until five 30.

1146
01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:23.220
You know,
that's,
that's the type of thing where you want to catch yourself.

1147
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.380
And like we talked about earlier,

1148
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.290
you want to get those little disciplines in place and,

1149
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.380
and build upon those and become better.
Yeah.
Stay out of them.

1150
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.140
Nevermind the rock bottom.
Let's get to the top of this bad boy.

1151
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:37.110
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
And it,
and with that,

1152
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.280
I think this might be kind of obvious,

1153
01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:43.260
but it's important to recognize what elements or what aspects of your life that

1154
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:48.080
you are not quite as tough mentally at,
you know,
like if,

1155
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:52.150
you know,
if you have a weakness for beard alcohol,

1156
01:13:52.151 --> 01:13:53.130
then recognize that.

1157
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.150
Or I have a weakness for giving up when I start to get tired and training or

1158
01:13:57.151 --> 01:14:00.560
something like that.
Um,
you know,
recognize that.
Yeah.
And uh,

1159
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.760
here's a quick story for you.
It's important story,
Echo tribes with a story.

1160
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.980
Christmas Eve.
Um,

1161
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.700
I went to the store just a real quick and it was real crowded,
that supermarket,

1162
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:14.530
right?
So I go and I get

1163
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.450
two 12 packs of beer and

1164
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:27.130
some tomatoes and I have a cart,
not where I have a basket and not a cart.

1165
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:30.340
So I'm carrying it.
So all the lines are long.
So I'm,

1166
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:32.980
so I'm standing in one of the lines and um,

1167
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:38.430
and I'm holding the basket with the 12 pack of beer in one hand with the

1168
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:42.340
tomatoes and the other 12 pack of beer and the other hand.
So that's,
you know,

1169
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:45.730
it's not like terribly heavy,
but it can get heavy after a little while.

1170
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:49.570
So the line is real long.
So I'm going to be in that line for a while.

1171
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:54.070
So after a while,
you know,
you shoulda started getting tired and right.

1172
01:14:54.071 --> 01:14:58.750
Then I recognize,
okay,
he,
this can be a small exercise in mental toughness.

1173
01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.220
Just a small one,
not a,
you know,
not a marathon and nothing like that.

1174
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:05.740
But you know what I'm going to do,
I'm just going to hold these until,

1175
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.860
until I put them on the thing.

1176
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.580
I'm not going to put them down because right now I kind of want to put them
down.

1177
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:16.030
So what I did is I made it consciously made it an exercise.

1178
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:20.800
So I held them and every little thing that would happen,
this guy is not taking,

1179
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.740
um,
or this guy's not being as quick as he should be.
Boom.

1180
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:27.540
That that's another element added to the mental toughness exercise.
No,

1181
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:32.080
what he's going to write a check.
Yeah.
So I did it.

1182
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:35.290
I totally did it.
It took maybe,
I would say 10 minutes,

1183
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:39.850
a good 10 minutes of just holding it,
you know?
Um,
so I put my,

1184
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.550
my,
uh,
my stuff on the,
on the little carousel or whatever to get it checked out.

1185
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:50.080
And I remember thinking,
okay,
that's one little exercise in mental toughness,

1186
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:52.210
a little workout myth,
mental toughness done.

1187
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.190
Now I realize as a demonstration of mental toughness,

1188
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:58.900
that's quite lame,

1189
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:06.240
but as far as recognizing a potential situation where you could be mentally

1190
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:08.950
weak,
using it as an exercise to be,

1191
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:13.540
to help with mental toughness as a concept,
that's an important element.

1192
01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:13.841
And you know,

1193
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:18.400
what I liked the best about that whole story was the fact that you had to

1194
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:21.280
mentally detach yourself and recognized,

1195
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.850
because that's the true exercise in my mind,

1196
01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:29.110
is having the ability to be outside yourself and look at yourself and say,

1197
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:33.970
you're being weak right now.
Or here's an opportunity that's real triumph.
Yeah.

1198
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.700
On a small scale.
Yeah.
When ab or it,

1199
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:39.170
we're going to meet with you.

1200
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:44.530
But if you can just start thinking to yourself that way,

1201
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:49.710
that small little exercise can turn into a little bit bigger exercise and,

1202
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:54.160
and next thing you know,
you're in a detrimental situation.
Recognizing,
hey,

1203
01:16:54.161 --> 01:16:58.210
if I can practice some toughness right now where you know,
a month ago,

1204
01:16:58.211 --> 01:17:00.160
two months ago,
I would have straight up gave up,

1205
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.340
but let me use this as he had another exercise and it's a big detrimental

1206
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:07.480
situation.
Look,
look,
he mentally tough.
I like it.

1207
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.770
At least on your way.
Yeah,
approved to share.

1208
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.230
<v 0>Barely approved,
approved.
None.
The less.</v>

1209
01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:24.880
Next question.
Okay.
Okay.

1210
01:17:24.881 --> 01:17:26.980
Next question is my son who's seven,

1211
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.190
seven years old and I want to get into Jujitsu.

1212
01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:34.300
What lessons has it taught you in life?

1213
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.850
<v 1>Well,</v>

1214
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:39.090
<v 0>you know,</v>

1215
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:41.850
I talk about your due to all the time because I do think it's a great metaphor

1216
01:17:41.851 --> 01:17:42.684
for life.

1217
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:46.200
Some of the things that it teaches you without a doubt is it teaches you

1218
01:17:46.201 --> 01:17:50.010
humility because it's not going to teach you humility.

1219
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:52.590
Bice telling you,
hey,
be humble,
be humble.

1220
01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:57.591
It's going to teach you humility because you are going to get submitted and be

1221
01:17:58.171 --> 01:18:02.610
forced to surrender to people that are smaller than you,

1222
01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:05.130
that are weaker than you,
that aren't as good athletes as you.

1223
01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.960
And that's going to happen on almost a daily basis when you first start out.

1224
01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:15.120
So there's no doubt about that.
It's going to teach you about respect.

1225
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:20.010
And I had a,
I had a buddy in the marine corps,
uh,
great dude,

1226
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:24.320
big H.
I know you're out there somewhere.
And he was,

1227
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:27.570
he was a bad ass.
I mean,
he looked like a superhero,

1228
01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.030
super strong just,
and he,
and he grew up in,
so I think he grew up in Texas.

1229
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:36.630
He was some kind of a gang member in Texas,
had a rough childhood and he was,

1230
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.440
he was a bad ass.
Scary dude.
Super Nice.
But,
but,

1231
01:18:40.441 --> 01:18:42.000
but definitely could bring it.

1232
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.550
And when he started training after like a month,
you know,

1233
01:18:47.551 --> 01:18:50.980
I said,
so,
you know,
what do you,
what do you think of Jujitsu?
And he said,
uh,

1234
01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:51.983
you know,

1235
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:57.090
I used to think I was bad ass and now I don't want to mess with anybody because

1236
01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.990
I don't know if they've been training for three months and if they have been,

1237
01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.910
I'm in trouble.
So you definitely will learn respect from Jujitsu

1238
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.120
discipline.
You know,

1239
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.320
we were just kinda talking earlier and I was talking about training today and

1240
01:19:13.321 --> 01:19:15.960
how I just did not feel like training today.
I was all beat up,

1241
01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:20.310
I was tired of soar and there's only one thing that got me on the mat.

1242
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.890
And that's just having the discipline to get on there and know that I needed to

1243
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:25.830
train.
So there's nobody,
I don't care who you are.

1244
01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:29.100
That feels like training every single day,
seven days a week.

1245
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:32.160
But if you want to get better and you want to reach the goal,

1246
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:36.490
then you have to do it.
And so it teaches you about discipline.
And,

1247
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.200
and I would say from a mental perspective,

1248
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:46.160
one of the coolest things that Jujitsu teaches you is it teaches you that

1249
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:52.430
maneuver and that tactics and that brains that those things Trump strength and

1250
01:19:57.481 --> 01:19:59.820
Trump meeting force on force.

1251
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.620
And I talk about this all the time in psychological situations and it's too bad.

1252
01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:07.710
I wish everybody in the world train Jujitsu because you have all metaphors that

1253
01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:08.544
you could tell them.

1254
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.420
So it's great when I have a client that actually trains Jujitsu because then I

1255
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:17.421
can or understands MMA or watches martial arts or watches UFC because then you

1256
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:20.430
can use these examples.
But you know,

1257
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:25.431
the classic case in the mental confrontation is people have a tendency to want

1258
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:31.590
to go,
you know,
fist on fist.
And if you say one thing,

1259
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.500
if you say method a,
I say method B,

1260
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.430
and we'll just going to bang those two methods together and see who you know.

1261
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:42.660
A lot of times it's see who has more rank and you know what?
You know what Echo,

1262
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:45.840
I'm in charge.
So we're going with method.
Well now you're going to do what I say,

1263
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.870
but you're not going to do it willingly.
You're going to sabotage it.

1264
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:53.160
Whatever the case may be.
That's not true.
Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is,

1265
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:58.380
is using maneuver and setting people up and,

1266
01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:02.400
and being more crafty.
That's what you did to his and that's how you win.

1267
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:06.450
And that's how you win,
not just on the mat,
not just but in life as well.

1268
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.460
And it does the same thing on the battlefield.
You know,
we,
oh,

1269
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.470
we have a little saying in combat.
He who flanks first wins,

1270
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.190
meaning the person that gets around to the side and attacks from an unexpected

1271
01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:21.450
direction is going to win.
And it's the same thing in it mentally in Jujitsu.

1272
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:24.630
And it's the same thing in,
in,
you know,

1273
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:26.920
mental confrontations with people.
It's,

1274
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:31.970
it's who is going to maneuver and it's always this indirect approach.

1275
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.530
That's the key phrase that I use when I'm dealing with someone that's not a

1276
01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:38.640
Jujitsu person.

1277
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:42.450
And I'm talking about how do they deal with their boss that does does this or

1278
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:46.350
their subordinate that has a big head or whatever.
I tell them,
listen,

1279
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:51.890
you need to use an indirect approach because the direct approach is not going to

1280
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:54.750
get through to this person.
I was,
I have a,

1281
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:57.240
was doing some executive coaching the other day and had this guy,

1282
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.670
he explained the personality of this guy that worked for him and the guy that

1283
01:22:02.671 --> 01:22:04.950
had worked for him had been moved underneath him in a,

1284
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:07.410
in a reorganization and it was one of those guys,

1285
01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:09.780
he's a senior guy who he should have been appear,

1286
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.060
but now all of a sudden he's reporting to him and he's been in the business for

1287
01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:16.350
32 years and he knows stuff better than I do.
And then the guy says to me,

1288
01:22:16.351 --> 01:22:21.351
so I've brought the guy in and I've told them I'm going to coach him and this is

1289
01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:23.580
what I'm going to help him with.
And I said,
okay,

1290
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.650
you are no way is this guy going to accept that,

1291
01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.980
that you're going to coach him and it's,
he's not in his personality.

1292
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:36.840
You can't go.
Whereas this guy that I was talking to call him Mike,
I said,
Mike,

1293
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.260
you want to be coached.
You want to be helped you have an open mind.

1294
01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:42.810
If I came to you and said,
hey,
I want a coach,
you'd be like,
that's great.

1295
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.630
This guy is the complete opposite.
If I go to him and say,
Hey,

1296
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:48.900
I'm going to coach you,
he's going to say,
I don't need coaching,

1297
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:51.420
and even if I outrank him and I say,
no,
I'm going to coach you.

1298
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:54.330
He's going to do it reluctantly and he's going to sabotage it and he's never

1299
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:57.060
going to put any effort into it and he's going to actually do the opposite to

1300
01:22:57.061 --> 01:23:01.260
prove you wrong,
right?
That's the direct approach.

1301
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:05.500
Jujitsu is the indirect approach.
So what you do with this guy,

1302
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:07.120
when you're going to coach him,
as you say,
listen,

1303
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:10.840
you know what I need is you're so much more experienced in this.

1304
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:13.300
I need some help running the organization.

1305
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:18.550
Can you come and help me get things in order and give me a hand straightening

1306
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:23.551
things out and also can you fill me in on what we can improve inside of our

1307
01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:28.060
department?
And when that,
when you do that,

1308
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:30.550
now all of a sudden he's just started to telling me what all the problems are

1309
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:35.551
and now I can discretely and indirectly coach him on how we're going to fix

1310
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:36.550
those problems.

1311
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.380
That's Jujitsu and that's one of the lessons you learned from it.

1312
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.660
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
And,</v>

1313
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:48.720
and not to mention that the thought of more obvious things where you know,

1314
01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:52.870
it's a great workout.
You get um,
you know,
kind of this,

1315
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:58.270
you know,
men actually just be all people.

1316
01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:02.290
They have us sort of aggression kind of built into them and it's a spectrum.

1317
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.800
Some people more than others,
you can engage,

1318
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.520
I understand what you're trying to tell me.

1319
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:16.290
You can engage in Jujitsu and be a pretty accurate simulation of whether it be a

1320
01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:22.441
fight or any kind of aggressive combat situation and it's still be safe and

1321
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:26.360
doable where you can do it again and again.
You can go,
you know,

1322
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:30.310
the next day it's,
it's,
if you go spar right boxing,

1323
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:33.220
you can't really do it every day and you can't go all out.

1324
01:24:33.221 --> 01:24:36.940
If you go all out and do it everyday,
you can get messed up in Jujitsu,

1325
01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:40.780
you can do that.
And so you get that satisfaction when you,
when you leave.

1326
01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:45.781
And it's kind of strange because when you get the satisfaction from that,

1327
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:48.010
you kind of want to do it some more,
you know?

1328
01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:51.200
So most people when you talk to these people who have been doing it for over a

1329
01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.150
year,
I talked to anyone you know,
that has been doing it more than one year.

1330
01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.600
I would say my argument would be 85% or more will tell you that at some point

1331
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:02.050
they were addicted to it.

1332
01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:05.080
That they'd go to sleep at night and they'd be thinking about a move or

1333
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:05.914
something like that.

1334
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.350
<v 0>And to go along with the things that you,
just,</v>

1335
01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.900
the obvious things because you're right,
there's some obvious things.
The,

1336
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.690
the workout,
it's a great workout.
You grit more in tune with your own body.

1337
01:25:16.691 --> 01:25:20.110
You learn how to handle yourself in a real fight.
And,
and it does give you,

1338
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:24.160
absolutely gives you confidence and confidence that you can handle a situation

1339
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:26.050
confidence that,
uh,

1340
01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:28.600
that's coupled with the respect that you look at everyone and say,
hey,

1341
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:32.800
you know what,
this guy might be able to,
uh,
this guy might know more than I do.

1342
01:25:32.801 --> 01:25:36.490
So I'm gonna respect him.
But at the same time,
you know that,
hey,

1343
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:39.310
I'm going to be able to at least know what I'm doing very confidently.

1344
01:25:39.311 --> 01:25:43.880
So it helps out across the board.
And it's definitely a,
a great sports.

1345
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.010
<v 2>So with the new year approaching,</v>

1346
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:54.000
what have you changed your mind about is as far as two 50

1347
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:55.910
<v 0>in 2015?
Yeah.
Well,</v>

1348
01:25:55.911 --> 01:26:00.390
the biggest thing that's been a radical change,
cause I'm,

1349
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:05.030
I always talk about how I have big open mind and all that,

1350
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.590
but the fact of the matter is I,

1351
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.820
I'm very set in my ways and I kind of follow patterns and I,

1352
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:14.750
I believe things and,
and my beliefs are open for,

1353
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:20.090
for changing,
but a lot of times they just don't get changed.
Uh,
okay.

1354
01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:24.320
So one thing that's been radically different about me in 2015 and it's been kind

1355
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:27.710
of a bizarre ride,
is the fact that I am now

1356
01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:33.300
out there in the world and you know,
people,

1357
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.740
obviously when I made the decision with leaf that we were going to write this

1358
01:26:37.741 --> 01:26:41.610
book,
we knew that we were going to be out there and,

1359
01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:45.510
and people are going to know us now.
The book has been more successful than,

1360
01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:46.471
you know,

1361
01:26:46.471 --> 01:26:49.800
it's kind of been the Max level of success that I thought I could achieve.

1362
01:26:49.801 --> 01:26:49.981
You know,

1363
01:26:49.981 --> 01:26:53.600
I thought there was a spectrum and we definitely achieved a great success and

1364
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:55.440
we're,
we're super,
super happy about that,

1365
01:26:55.441 --> 01:26:59.580
but that means we're even more out there then we thought we're going to be.

1366
01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:00.990
Then on top of that,

1367
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:06.020
there's been this whole Internet phenomenon of they don't go on the Tim Ferriss

1368
01:27:08.551 --> 01:27:13.551
show with Tim and going on the Joe Rogan show with Joe and then doing this

1369
01:27:13.981 --> 01:27:17.790
podcast and being on Twitter and all these things,
being on Facebook.
I mean,

1370
01:27:17.791 --> 01:27:19.980
I didn't literally did not have a Facebook account,

1371
01:27:19.981 --> 01:27:23.310
literally did not have a Twitter account.
Never been on before.

1372
01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.190
And then now I have,
you know,

1373
01:27:26.191 --> 01:27:30.690
I'm on it and in it and communicating with people and I think that's,

1374
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.500
you know,
people would tell me like,
hey,
social media is cool.

1375
01:27:34.501 --> 01:27:38.100
You can link up with other people.
And I was definitely,

1376
01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.980
I didn't want to link up with other people.

1377
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.810
I didn't want to have my friends and I didn't really want to meet other people.

1378
01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:50.880
But now that I'm there,
it's awesome.
Honestly,

1379
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:55.950
it's awesome to have people all over the world.
I have people all over the world,

1380
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.791
especially cause you know,

1381
01:27:56.791 --> 01:28:00.390
I do the thing in the morning with my watch and at four,
four 30 in the morning,

1382
01:28:00.391 --> 01:28:04.680
I take a picture of my watch and I posted on Twitter and I get those because

1383
01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.940
other people do it.
And,

1384
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:10.260
and now my Twitter is filled with people from every time zone throughout the day

1385
01:28:10.261 --> 01:28:12.870
that wake up at four 30 in the morning and they still get their workout on.

1386
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.670
And that's,
that's cool man.

1387
01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.840
That's very cool to see that there's other people in the world that have the

1388
01:28:18.841 --> 01:28:21.810
same kind of mentality that want to be better,

1389
01:28:21.811 --> 01:28:24.960
that want to improve that wanna do their best.

1390
01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:29.760
And I think that's a,
I think that's been pretty cool to see.

1391
01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:33.950
And it's also been,
it's,
it's been,

1392
01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.150
honestly,
it almost makes me feel

1393
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:45.420
like I'm in a leadership position in a way again because I've got like people

1394
01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:50.620
that are saying,
hey,
thanks for putting this out there and thanks.

1395
01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:52.270
And it makes you feel just like,

1396
01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:56.950
just like being in a leader at combat leadership position where you feel humbled

1397
01:28:56.951 --> 01:29:00.970
by these guys that are doing so well or I feel the same way with these people.

1398
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.130
Humbled by the fact

1399
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.860
<v 2>that these people are out there and they're communicating with me and talking to</v>

1400
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:09.540
me and saying I inspire them and I always write back,
man,

1401
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:13.620
you inspire me.
You know,
that inspires me that you're out,
you know,

1402
01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:15.640
kicking ass and,
and there's these,
Yo,

1403
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.480
I was talking about like the single moms are the single dads that are out there.

1404
01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:21.290
They're getting up earlier than me and they're going to work,
you know,

1405
01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:24.060
and that's job number one and they're getting home late.
So that's,

1406
01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:28.110
that's inspiring to me.
And,
um,
I think it's been a pretty cool ride so far.

1407
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:32.400
Any other weird thing is I have no idea where the ride is going.
I do.

1408
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:37.200
I do not know.
And I'm all about plans and I'm a little bit of a control freak.

1409
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:39.720
But just to be out there and on this roller coaster,

1410
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:42.980
did you have no idea where it's going.
So that's,
that's pretty entertaining to,

1411
01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.260
to,
to connect with,
um,

1412
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:49.590
with people who have the same interest in you and not all interests,
obviously,

1413
01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:52.920
but just some of the same interests as you.

1414
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:57.300
It is kind of refreshing because if you go just through your day to day life,

1415
01:29:57.301 --> 01:29:59.370
right?
And someone is extreme as you are,

1416
01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.640
it's going to be hard to find someone to relate to in specific ways or even in a

1417
01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:08.400
general way.
It's gonna be harder for someone like you,
right?

1418
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:13.820
So when you get these little tidbits of people doing the same thing is you?

1419
01:30:13.861 --> 01:30:14.581
And it's like,
Dang,

1420
01:30:14.581 --> 01:30:18.840
I'm relating to these people just in that small little way every day or however

1421
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:19.980
often you check your Twitter,
you know,

1422
01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:24.630
and it's kind of refreshing and it reminds you that there are people like that

1423
01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:29.190
out there who want to wake up early in and be disciplined and work hard and then

1424
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:31.080
face the day and get stuff done or whatever.

1425
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.830
And you might not see that in your day to day life outside of the Internet,

1426
01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:37.080
like in your,
in your real life.
You might not see that.

1427
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:39.030
So you might have this feeling of,
man,

1428
01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:41.730
am I the only one who's trying to get this stuff done?
You know,

1429
01:30:41.731 --> 01:30:45.450
almost like that kind of thought.
Right.
And I'm definitely not.
Yeah,
and it's,

1430
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:49.470
and you're right,
it is,
it is reassuring.
Yeah.

1431
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.800
And it's cool to communicate with these people.
They're fired up.

1432
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:55.560
I've got a bunch of firemen and police officers that are on there that are fired

1433
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:59.790
up every day.
Bunch of,
obviously a bunch of former military people.
But then,

1434
01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:02.850
you know,
cause I have kind of a weird background.
I get these crazy old,

1435
01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.820
the hardcore punk rock kids and you know,

1436
01:31:05.821 --> 01:31:09.750
they're communicating with me and it's just,
it's very interesting,

1437
01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:12.420
very interesting.
And it's been an interesting ride.
I'm like,
um,

1438
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:15.000
I'm curious to see where it all ends up.
Yeah,
yeah.

1439
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:17.430
I do think that the more experience you have with people,

1440
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.770
the more good stuff you can learn that,

1441
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:25.050
that people have in them regardless of stuff.
You might not agree with them,

1442
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.580
but if you can find,
have more experiences with more people in whatever way,

1443
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.970
you'll be more informed.
And this,
and this,
this really,

1444
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:38.470
the fear or the rejection I had of social media was based on what I talked about

1445
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:46.590
earlier with that Tom Wolfe book,
the electric Koolaid,
acid test,

1446
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.380
mi,
Mi,
Mi,
Mi.

1447
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:53.220
And I always felt that social media was me,
me,

1448
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.830
here's a picture of me.
Here's me doing this,

1449
01:31:55.831 --> 01:32:00.130
here's my food and this is my car and this is me,
me.
And he just

1450
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.540
<v 0>felt so disturbing.
And,
but now I,</v>

1451
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:08.620
like you're saying,
I realize that this,

1452
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:13.030
this social media,
at least the way that I'm involved in it right now,

1453
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.300
it's not about me.
It's about we,

1454
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:21.660
and there's a group of people that have the similar mindset and some of them are

1455
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:23.560
more into it.
Some of them aren't,

1456
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:28.060
but they're there and they communicate with me and it's not me,

1457
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:31.660
it's we.
And I think that's,
that's,
that's pretty cool.
Yeah,
for sure.
Well,

1458
01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:35.470
it is everything.
It's a spectrum.
But I think,

1459
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.730
I think we all feel that even if we're people who are really into the Internet,

1460
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:42.940
really into Facebook,
really into Twitter and Instagram,

1461
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:47.650
if people overdo it,
me,
me,

1462
01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:50.170
here's a Selfie of me in front of the mirror.

1463
01:32:50.171 --> 01:32:53.380
If you see 10 pictures of,

1464
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.380
of them taking a picture of themselves in front of the mirror,
that's a me,
me,

1465
01:32:56.390 --> 01:33:00.070
me situation for sure.
They're just on that side of the spectrum.
That's all.

1466
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:00.700
There's,

1467
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:05.700
there's all kinds of different people and I think the majority people are in

1468
01:33:06.191 --> 01:33:09.040
that we,
we category.
Yeah,
sure.
It's something about me.

1469
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:12.770
But there there is no we without me.
Do you know?
No,
it's cool.
Uh,

1470
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:18.310
I don't like people that send me stuff on Twitter that I get pictures every day

1471
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:22.180
of peoples of watches.
I get pictures of their jump rope or their kettle bell.

1472
01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.670
Like no one said,
I don't know what any of these people look like,

1473
01:33:24.671 --> 01:33:28.900
which I guess is kind of bizarre and,
but that's,
you're right.

1474
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:32.830
They're not about me.
Me,
me either about we,
and it's like having a little,

1475
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.830
a little group,
a little gang to get after it.

1476
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.670
I sent you a picture of me and it wasn't for 30,
like more like noon.

1477
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:44.030
It's four 30 in the afternoon actually was like 2:00 PM.
Um,

1478
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:49.930
so your sleep,
next question,
your sleep routine,

1479
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.340
you get less than eight hours sleep from what I know.
Okay.
So your sleep routine,

1480
01:33:54.341 --> 01:33:59.341
how many hours of sleep do you get and what are the techniques you used to get

1481
01:34:00.251 --> 01:34:03.910
to sleep if you're not tired,
you know,
do you take naps,
do that,
does that work?

1482
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.270
Uh,
okay.
So I generally sleep.

1483
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.780
I try and sleep at least five,

1484
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:13.270
five and a half or six hours a night.

1485
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.260
It generally ends up being somewhere between five and five and a half.

1486
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:22.350
Generally I feel not good if I sleep for,

1487
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:29.110
you know,
seven hours.
I don't feel good.
I feel groggy.

1488
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:32.980
Uh,
I don't know why that is.
I,
that's the way it is though.

1489
01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:38.580
I feel good and I sometimes I feel better when I slept 4.5 hours,

1490
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.290
otherwise known as four and a half hours.

1491
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:49.670
So,
so there's no doubt that I don't need a ton of sleep.
Um,

1492
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:54.530
that being said,
sometimes I do feel tired and sometimes,
you know,

1493
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.720
come the afternoon,

1494
01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.200
especially if I have to do something boring or tedious and that's when I'll feel

1495
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:06.260
really legitimately tired.
If I'm up and moving,
I don't need to sleep.

1496
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.880
I actually don't need to sleep.

1497
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:10.760
Like I can go long periods of times without sleeping.

1498
01:35:10.761 --> 01:35:13.990
If there's something actively engaging my mind,
it,

1499
01:35:14.370 --> 01:35:16.430
especially something that's going to be partially physical,
you know,

1500
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:20.180
cause you sitting down,
reading a book when you're tired is,
is tough.
So,

1501
01:35:21.170 --> 01:35:23.380
uh,
I do and,

1502
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.470
and power naps are great and this is something that I learned the part of it in

1503
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:32.330
high school and part of it in basic seal training,
when I was in high school,

1504
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.100
my anatomy and physiology teacher,
I used to go in,

1505
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:40.790
walk by his room at lunchtime and he'd be in there with his feet up on the desk

1506
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.420
in like as chair all low and he'd just be in there sitting,
you know,

1507
01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:47.960
doing a little bit of work and one day I said,
hey,
you know,

1508
01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:51.530
you look kind of relaxed in there.
And he said,
hey,
this is a technique.

1509
01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:54.980
And I said,
what do you mean?
He said,
put your,
when you,
when you rest,

1510
01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.040
elevate your feet above your heart because your veins are stressed out,

1511
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:02.060
you know,
the one way valves and yours veins,

1512
01:36:02.061 --> 01:36:04.310
you've got blood pooled up in areas and your feed,

1513
01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:07.790
you want to get that stuff out of there.
So elevate your feet above your heart.

1514
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:11.210
And I was like,
oh,
that makes sense.
Then in seal training,

1515
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:16.750
you'd come back from let's say breakfast in the morning or lunch and you get

1516
01:36:17.301 --> 01:36:20.360
back to the barracks and you have to grab gear to get ready for whatever the

1517
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:23.120
next evolution was going to be.
Well,
they'd give you time to grab the gear,

1518
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:26.600
but they'd also give you time to,
you know,
use the bathroom or whatever.

1519
01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:29.270
And it would literally be,
they'd say,
all right,

1520
01:36:29.271 --> 01:36:31.970
we gotta be back out here in eight minutes.
Well,

1521
01:36:31.971 --> 01:36:33.260
it take you one minute to get your gear on.

1522
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:36.140
So if I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom,
I would go in my room.

1523
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.750
I would lay down on the floor,
I'd put my feet up on the bed,

1524
01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:43.751
and I would set my alarm clock for six minutes and I would get a power nap.

1525
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.700
And you'd fall asleep almost immediately because you're so tired.

1526
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.610
So He'd just fall asleep.
Six minutes later,
boom.

1527
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:54.050
You wake up and you feel refreshed and you feel recharged.

1528
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:56.510
If you sleep for longer than that,

1529
01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.570
sometimes you start to feel groggy again.

1530
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.450
So you gotta be careful that you don't sleep for too long.
But yeah,

1531
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:06.410
try the elevated feet above the heart.

1532
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:11.830
Eight minute power nap when you're feeling tired and it'll make you feel better.

1533
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:14.570
You got to set your alarm clock so you don't,

1534
01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:19.000
so that eight minutes doesn't turn into two and,

1535
01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.160
and that's it.
You know,
I look,
I know and probably,
uh,

1536
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:28.190
I know I should probably sleep more and I would like to do that.
I'll try.

1537
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:33.020
I try and do that sometimes.
Um,
but also my mind,

1538
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:38.240
it's,
it's not like a big choice that I'm making,
you know,

1539
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:42.200
when,
when I'm thinking about something,
it cannot be stopped.

1540
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:47.780
It cannot be stopped.
When I'm thinking about something,
it just goes and I,

1541
01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:51.560
in my mind,
it feels like I'm going down,
um,

1542
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:56.130
various tunnels of thought.
That's literally what it feels like.

1543
01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.740
I'm going down these various tunnels of thought and one leads to another.

1544
01:37:58.741 --> 01:38:01.770
I'm taking a left turn,
right turn.
I'm getting all these ideas and I can't sleep.

1545
01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:03.060
Yeah.
So,

1546
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:06.563
<v 2>you know,</v>

1547
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:11.080
and I would imagine that a lot of people are like that where if they have a lot

1548
01:38:11.081 --> 01:38:12.390
going on in their life,
you know,

1549
01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.160
where they can't get these certain thoughts out of the head,
good or bad,

1550
01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:15.461
you know,

1551
01:38:15.461 --> 01:38:18.670
sometimes you just excited about something and you can't stop thinking about it

1552
01:38:18.671 --> 01:38:23.320
and you know,
whatever.
Um,
but if that's a problem,

1553
01:38:23.321 --> 01:38:25.660
if he gets in the way your sleep and it's jamming you up the next day,

1554
01:38:25.661 --> 01:38:27.370
then I'm sure you can,
you know,

1555
01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:30.780
I'm sure meditation can kind of help is from what I hear about men.

1556
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.640
<v 0>Yeah,
maybe,
I don't know.
He didn't know anything about that.
But I will say this,</v>

1557
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:39.500
if you,
if you want to go to bed earlier,
you have to get up earlier.

1558
01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.940
Like it doesn't work in reverse.

1559
01:38:40.941 --> 01:38:42.710
You can't just force yourself to go to sleep at night.

1560
01:38:42.711 --> 01:38:45.320
You have to just wake up earlier and be more tired at the end of the day.

1561
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.340
And I love the feeling of when I'm so tired that my,

1562
01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.050
my head hits the pillow and I fall asleep immediately.

1563
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:55.540
I love that feeling of just exhaustion.
That's what I'm going for every day.

1564
01:38:55.541 --> 01:38:56.780
See if I can just burn it,

1565
01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.320
burn it out and just be so tired at the end of the day.

1566
01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.240
So that's my sleep routine probably made all kinds of doctors and stuff angry at

1567
01:39:07.251 --> 01:39:09.440
me.
Sorry.
Sorry Doc Parsley.
I know,

1568
01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:12.190
<v 2>I think they say that the,
the,</v>

1569
01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:17.080
the ideal amount of sleep is seven and a half hours or something like that.

1570
01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.150
But I would imagine it'd be different from person.

1571
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:22.900
Like if you're used to getting six hours sleep,
it doesn't your body conform,

1572
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.070
like get your sleep cycles.

1573
01:39:24.071 --> 01:39:28.210
I think they come form to that six hours said they have Dr and Dr Recko has

1574
01:39:28.211 --> 01:39:32.620
spoken.
Yup.
Your sleep schedule conform.
I learned that on the Internet.

1575
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.520
Um,
so in regards to,
you know,
achieving goals and just your pursuits in life,

1576
01:39:39.521 --> 01:39:44.521
how do you deal with loved ones who seem to determine or who seemed determined

1577
01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:49.060
to hold you back from your goals?
Um,
and that's,

1578
01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.360
I guess that's kind of assuming that you have loved ones that are determined to

1579
01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:56.140
hold you back from you.
All right,
well that

1580
01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:57.800
<v 0>in issue,</v>

1581
01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.640
this is one of those questions that came in and I think you voted positive on

1582
01:40:01.641 --> 01:40:04.640
this question was let's answer this question and why did you,

1583
01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:06.560
why were you so why did you want to answer this question?

1584
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:10.940
And not that I've had this experience where that answered this question or that

1585
01:40:10.941 --> 01:40:15.170
asks this question.
I put a line through it,
echo brought it back from the dead.

1586
01:40:15.171 --> 01:40:19.430
So all cause I think people deal with this.
I,
I don't,
I haven't

1587
01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:23.900
<v 2>experienced this personally,
but I've seen it happen.</v>

1588
01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.400
I've seen it in other people were.
And I think

1589
01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.150
part of this is just my philosophy,
but I think a big part of this,

1590
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:38.151
I believe a big part of this is you can apply it to every situation where it's a

1591
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:44.100
supposedly loved one,
whether it be your family,
spouse,
whatever,

1592
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:49.080
um,
where they will hold you back sometimes.
And

1593
01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:55.090
sometimes it can be because they're like jealous of you or something.
So,

1594
01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:59.290
and not necessarily jealous.
So they're going to say,
um,
you know,

1595
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:01.870
they're going to lie to you and say,
hey,
that's a bad idea.

1596
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.730
When it's really a good one or nothing like that,

1597
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:08.500
just they'll just be focusing on the bad part of it.
So let's say,

1598
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.130
let's say you were unemployed for a little bit,

1599
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.480
you've been working hard to get this job and you finally get a job and then

1600
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:20.660
you're,
I dunno,
a parent or whatever says,
well it's about time,
you know,

1601
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:25.180
so instead of Dang,
you know,
you're,
you know,
you got this job,
congratulations.

1602
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:27.040
They focus on the negative and that can,

1603
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.930
that can be discouraging on a personal level.
Like,
like there was no,

1604
01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:35.740
there was no happiness,
there was no encouragement.
There was no,

1605
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:41.220
no one's saying that no one making me feel like they were on my team,

1606
01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:43.690
make me feel like I'm alone in doing this.
People do do that.

1607
01:41:43.691 --> 01:41:45.420
And then they do a bunch of other stuff as well,

1608
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.050
telling you the other part that I said,

1609
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.470
they will tell you it's a bad idea to start this new company.
You know,

1610
01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:53.950
cause they're,
they may be afraid subconsciously or whatever that,
you know,

1611
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:57.070
he might outshine them where you might do something good when they haven't done

1612
01:41:57.071 --> 01:41:59.960
anything good.
So,
yes.
So how do you deal with that?
Um,

1613
01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:04.150
and of course a bunch of other ways that they can kind of get in the way.
Um,

1614
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.970
this probably isn't going to be anything new,

1615
01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:11.971
but you know how you surround yourself with likeminded people or you surround

1616
01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:14.260
yourself by certain types of people in,

1617
01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.670
you're going to start to become like that.

1618
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:20.650
So I'm not saying disown any family members or loved ones,

1619
01:42:20.651 --> 01:42:25.090
I'm not saying that,
but you have to create boundaries,

1620
01:42:25.091 --> 01:42:28.660
specific boundaries to these people.

1621
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:32.830
And I know a lot of people say,
well,
that's my family and I can't change that,

1622
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:35.120
or that's my family.
So,
you know,
um,

1623
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:40.140
and they feel like they're under this obligation to essentially give away part

1624
01:42:40.361 --> 01:42:43.240
of their life.
But I think it should be the opposite.

1625
01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:45.130
I think that that's your family.

1626
01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:48.670
So they should understand that you're on a path to success or you want to be on

1627
01:42:48.671 --> 01:42:53.200
a path to success.
And if they're in the way,
then they're in the way in.

1628
01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:56.380
Those boundaries have to be created.
If they can't handle that,
then there,

1629
01:42:56.410 --> 01:43:00.310
there is someone who,
who is against you in your path.

1630
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:06.220
And
if you're on a successful path and someone is against you,

1631
01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:10.330
just that the eventuality is that they're going to be cut out of your life.

1632
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:11.570
And if,

1633
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:14.380
if they can respect the boundaries and boom you can and you can keep living your

1634
01:43:14.381 --> 01:43:17.170
life and they can be them and you can,
I love them for them,

1635
01:43:17.171 --> 01:43:20.620
no matter how negative there.
And you can have all that,
but if you don't,

1636
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:23.440
they're either going to bring you down or you got to come and cut them out of

1637
01:43:23.441 --> 01:43:24.850
your life,
family or not.

1638
01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.880
I think family should be held in a higher standard then your friend or your

1639
01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.980
whatever because they're,
they're your family.
They're,

1640
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:34.750
they're the one who should be treating you good.

1641
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.260
So you're saying your loved ones are treating you bad.

1642
01:43:38.261 --> 01:43:39.130
They're are the ones that shit,

1643
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.650
they're the last people that should be treating you bad.
They're your loved ones.

1644
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:45.700
So if they're not treating you good,
then like I said,

1645
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:50.710
they're the one in violation that you for pursuing your path.

1646
01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:51.544
And you know,

1647
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.540
<v 0>and not giving them the attention.</v>

1648
01:43:53.541 --> 01:43:56.420
We're not going to their house every other Saturday or whatever like you're

1649
01:43:56.421 --> 01:43:58.940
supposed to do whatever.
It's their fault or not their fault,

1650
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:03.941
but it's their responsibility to support you and if they're not then like anyone

1651
01:44:04.221 --> 01:44:05.240
else who's not supporting you,

1652
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:08.930
they should either have a boundary between you and them or be cut out of your

1653
01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:09.764
life.

1654
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.110
I think that's fairly sound advice.

1655
01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.970
I'll tell you that a couple of things from my perspective,

1656
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:21.561
first of all,

1657
01:44:21.561 --> 01:44:26.561
I think that many people are negative in the world and to coin a term that is

1658
01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:33.110
used very often these days,

1659
01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:37.010
a lot of people are haters and they don't want you to succeed in.

1660
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.310
And we would see that we didn't see that in the seal teams because seal teams is

1661
01:44:40.311 --> 01:44:45.290
a bunch of really super competitive guys and everybody is competitive with each

1662
01:44:45.291 --> 01:44:45.860
other.

1663
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:49.640
And when someone starts doing something well other people get can get jealous of

1664
01:44:49.641 --> 01:44:52.820
them pretty quickly.
And so that,
like I had one,

1665
01:44:52.821 --> 01:44:57.710
a friend of mine who he decided that hey,

1666
01:44:57.711 --> 01:45:02.711
he was going to try and take like a year off or get get orders to go to an ivy

1667
01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:05.210
league school while he was in the seal teams.

1668
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:10.700
And he had applied and actually got into it.
But you know,

1669
01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:15.410
uh,
one of the best colleges in the world to go there for a year and get a degree

1670
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:18.650
and you know,
that's awesome.

1671
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:21.740
And he came to me and he said,
hey,
you know,

1672
01:45:21.741 --> 01:45:23.450
I've got some guys that are telling me I shouldn't do this.

1673
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:27.200
It's going to be bad for my career and this,
that the other thing.
And I said,
Bro,

1674
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:34.310
I hate to tell you this.
These guys are just,
they're haters.
They're just jealous.

1675
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.620
The fact that you thought of this,
the fact that you went on a limb,

1676
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:38.780
the fact that you made this happen,
the fact that you put an application,

1677
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:42.340
the fact that you took the the test to get into the school and now you're going

1678
01:45:42.341 --> 01:45:46.640
to go there,
you're going to have that on your resume,
which is awesome.

1679
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:52.280
You know what?
Don't worry about anybody else.
They're,
they're just,
you know,

1680
01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:54.500
I hate to use the word jealous,
but they're jealous.

1681
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:57.170
The fact that you're going to go out and make this happen,
which I thought was a,

1682
01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.670
I thought that was awesome.

1683
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:03.730
The other kind of contrary advice to what you just said is when people aren't

1684
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:10.790
approving what you're doing and they're saying negative things to you and

1685
01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:13.850
they're not giving you the praise that you want for your,
what you're doing,

1686
01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:19.700
that's your fault.
You're the one that's wanting praise.

1687
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.170
You're the one that's looking for approval.

1688
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:23.150
You're the one that wants all the support,
like,
no,

1689
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:27.020
I don't expect anything from anybody because people are crazy as I briefed

1690
01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:29.420
earlier,
and they're not going to give you support.

1691
01:46:29.421 --> 01:46:31.760
If they're one of these people that are,
that are negative,

1692
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:34.340
they're going to be negative no matter what you do.

1693
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:38.300
So you can't be be hung up on getting their approval and getting their support.

1694
01:46:38.301 --> 01:46:42.230
You go forth and conquer regardless of what people are trying to do to told you

1695
01:46:42.231 --> 01:46:45.200
back,
and one's going to hold you back.
Who's gonna hold you back?

1696
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.650
How's that going to happen?
It don't let them hold you back.
Yeah,
in a,

1697
01:46:48.651 --> 01:46:49.980
and I agree with that last

1698
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.310
<v 2>part.
You don't let them hold you but hold you back.
But here,
here's an example.</v>

1699
01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:57.940
Let's say,
let's say you're pursuing this,
I dunno,

1700
01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.250
business degree or something,
or you're,
you're,

1701
01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.370
you want to start a tee shirt company and it's going to,
it takes all this time.

1702
01:47:04.371 --> 01:47:07.580
You've got to really get your knowledge down and you really do all your research

1703
01:47:07.581 --> 01:47:10.790
and stuff and it takes a lot of time.
Let's say it takes 15 hours a day,

1704
01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.590
every single day while you're getting this thing up and running.
But you visit

1705
01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:20.930
your mom on the weekends typically,
and you go down there,

1706
01:47:20.931 --> 01:47:25.250
you help her with her yard work.
Just cause she wants company,
you know,

1707
01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.160
you do all this stuff.
If you don't,
she makes you feel guilty.

1708
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:31.220
If you can't make it or I don't know you're sick or something,

1709
01:47:31.221 --> 01:47:35.840
she makes you feel guilty.
So you're under this obligation.
When you grow up,

1710
01:47:35.841 --> 01:47:38.690
it kind of gets ingrained in into you.
You know,

1711
01:47:38.691 --> 01:47:43.691
like these relationships with your loved ones and not to mention they're your

1712
01:47:44.091 --> 01:47:46.160
loved ones.
They're supposed to love you,
you know,

1713
01:47:46.161 --> 01:47:50.480
and you're supposed to love them.
Um,
so I think you do care about the support.

1714
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:53.210
I think that's a natural part of it.
If that's your loved ones,

1715
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:57.560
I'm not saying like your friend or your neighbor is not recognizing my,

1716
01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.710
my success or whatever.
That's your loved ones.
Typically,
that's,

1717
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:04.490
if anyone's gonna praise you,
you're going to hope that they're the first ones.

1718
01:48:04.491 --> 01:48:08.840
Yeah.
But you can't be hung up on it.
Especially if they're crazy.

1719
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:13.400
Right.
And that's,
that's my point.
That was your point.
Yeah.
So accepted.

1720
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:17.450
So you sit and you,
that's how they can hold you back.

1721
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:20.630
If it's ingrained in you that you have to be there for your mom.

1722
01:48:20.631 --> 01:48:25.610
If she's trained you from a little kid to be to say,
you owe me,
I gave you life,

1723
01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.140
then yeah.
Then again,
that's your fault.

1724
01:48:27.141 --> 01:48:29.080
If you're letting them hold you back from,
that's your fault.
Right.

1725
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:32.090
You need to take ownership of it and move on.
So yeah,
exactly right.

1726
01:48:32.091 --> 01:48:35.750
And that's what I mean by you create those barriers yet you have to suck it up

1727
01:48:35.751 --> 01:48:40.540
or,
or kind of model in your life and how you would say about,
um,

1728
01:48:40.730 --> 01:48:44.250
about other people or other situations when you're in a job or,

1729
01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:46.910
or leadership situation where you can make them understand,

1730
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:50.330
if you could make them understand what you're doing.
Yeah.
That's ideal.

1731
01:48:50.331 --> 01:48:53.210
Where you can maintain the integrity of the relationship.
You are correct.

1732
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.600
Now you just hit a home run because you're going back to the basic principles.

1733
01:48:56.601 --> 01:48:59.300
You have to let people understand why and you have to make them understand why

1734
01:48:59.301 --> 01:49:02.210
it's going to be beneficial for them.
You know,
the long run.
You know,

1735
01:49:02.211 --> 01:49:05.880
I used to dealing with guys when we were working hard,
uh,

1736
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:11.720
you know,
training guys for combat or we were training for combat and you think,

1737
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:14.510
oh well,
you know,
you've got to let these guys get home to their families.

1738
01:49:14.530 --> 01:49:17.240
You know,
they got to go home tonight,
let's let them out early.
And I'd say,
look,

1739
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:20.480
the best thing we can do for these guys to help them and their families is to

1740
01:49:20.481 --> 01:49:21.560
train them as hard as possible.

1741
01:49:21.561 --> 01:49:23.510
So in the long run where they come home from combat,

1742
01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:27.530
that's what we're here to do.
And everybody understands that message.

1743
01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.160
So it's the same thing.
You're right when you explain to your family members,

1744
01:49:31.161 --> 01:49:34.280
this is why I'm doing what I'm doing,
this is how it's going to benefit me,

1745
01:49:34.281 --> 01:49:38.300
which will thereby benefit you,
which pulled thereby benefit or whole family.
Yes,

1746
01:49:38.301 --> 01:49:40.690
that is correct.
Explain the why

1747
01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:46.640
next question.

1748
01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.350
<v 0>Um,
what is the,</v>

1749
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:55.380
what are the bullet points in keys to success for motivating and engaging your

1750
01:49:56.621 --> 01:49:58.750
team of leaders?

1751
01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:02.620
Well first of all we just kind of covered that when we talked to with uh,

1752
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.540
about about face for a solid hour,
which is,
which is one of the questions here.

1753
01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.820
I actually answered this question last time.

1754
01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:12.220
So this is a question that you hear all the time is you know,

1755
01:50:12.221 --> 01:50:15.160
what can I do to motivate these guys?
How can we get them engaged?

1756
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:20.350
And first of all,
I want to say that leadership,

1757
01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:25.540
although there are basic principles,
fundamental principles that can be used,

1758
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:29.530
it is not something that can be bulletized.
It is,

1759
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:34.150
it is like trying to bulletize how you play guitar or trying to bulletize how

1760
01:50:34.151 --> 01:50:38.110
you play the violin.
It is a,
it is an art,

1761
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.050
it is a practice and there are many,
many different ways to,

1762
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:43.720
to manipulate that instrument to make it,

1763
01:50:43.721 --> 01:50:46.690
make the noise that you want it to make.
And that's what leadership is.

1764
01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.400
Leadership is not follow these four steps and you will become a good leader.

1765
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:54.700
It doesn't work that way.
It is an art.
Now again,

1766
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:56.890
just like there's principles behind music,

1767
01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.820
there's principles behind leadership and that fundamental principles stay the

1768
01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:01.330
same.

1769
01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:06.330
But how you engage with those and the nuances involved in executing those those

1770
01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:11.800
principles is what makes leadership so challenging,

1771
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:16.000
which again is why we have a book,
which is why we have a business,

1772
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.420
which is why there's leadership schools around the world because it is a very

1773
01:51:19.421 --> 01:51:20.590
challenging thing to do.

1774
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:25.900
So you know the bullets are I almost after saying that,
you know,

1775
01:51:25.901 --> 01:51:28.000
what are the bullets?
Well,
you got to build relationships.

1776
01:51:28.001 --> 01:51:29.620
You've got to listen to people,
you've got to give respect.

1777
01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:32.350
You got to the main thing we talked about tonight with about face,

1778
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:33.280
you got to answer that.

1779
01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:37.570
Why people got to understand why you're doing what you're doing and understand

1780
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:40.840
what their perspective is.
So you got to communicate with them.

1781
01:51:40.841 --> 01:51:42.100
It's all those things.

1782
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:47.370
But I think it's important to realize that leadership is a learning constant

1783
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:51.610
learning process.
It's nuanced tool.

1784
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:55.930
There aren't any bulletized lists that are going to make you into a great leader

1785
01:51:55.931 --> 01:51:56.621
tomorrow.
What?

1786
01:51:56.621 --> 01:52:00.910
There are principles that you can learn and understand and interpret and apply

1787
01:52:00.911 --> 01:52:04.990
in different ways with different amplitudes at different times with different

1788
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:08.890
personalities.
Its mayhem.
It's may him.

1789
01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.550
That's what makes it so challenging and so fun.
And I,
I,

1790
01:52:12.551 --> 01:52:15.430
that's what makes me love to talk about leadership because there's,

1791
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:19.470
it's an infinitely complex thing on,

1792
01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:23.380
in so many different ways.
But all that being said,

1793
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:26.500
it is something that does follow core principles.

1794
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:29.350
And so learn those core principles,

1795
01:52:29.351 --> 01:52:32.740
know those core principles and that's what will make you good leader.

1796
01:52:32.741 --> 01:52:35.260
But don't look for a quick solution.

1797
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.440
Look for a comprehensive,

1798
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.700
a comprehensive,
uh,

1799
01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:47.100
mass of knowledge and technique and understanding that will make you

1800
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:51.110
<v 2>a better leader.
Check.</v>

1801
01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:55.441
In your opinion,

1802
01:52:55.441 --> 01:52:59.700
what are the best tactics in order to remain focus?

1803
01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:00.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1804
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:05.660
<v 0>Okay.
This is individual for me because I know different people have different</v>

1805
01:53:05.661 --> 01:53:06.920
techniques.
If you're,

1806
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:11.000
if you're using whatever take Nick's you have and they're not working well then

1807
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:12.830
they're not working.
So try mine.

1808
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:19.220
So mine are when I have to do something focused.
No music,

1809
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:23.840
no video,
no TV playing in the background,
none of that.
No phone,

1810
01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:28.130
turn that off and and get focused on the task at hand.

1811
01:53:28.131 --> 01:53:30.320
So what are you going to do to focus on the task at hand?

1812
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:34.150
You have to predetermine
there's a,

1813
01:53:34.151 --> 01:53:36.670
there's a thing we used to use in the seal team,
seal teams.

1814
01:53:36.671 --> 01:53:41.530
It's called task condition standard.
Here's the task,
here's the conditions,

1815
01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:45.520
better involved in the task and here's the standards that you have to complete

1816
01:53:45.521 --> 01:53:50.350
the task too.
So I like to think of when I have to focus on something,

1817
01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.660
I set up my own task conditions and standards for it.

1818
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:58.660
And a good example for me was writing our book when we were writing extreme

1819
01:53:58.661 --> 01:54:01.390
ownership.
Lafe wrote about half of it.
I wrote about half of it.

1820
01:54:01.570 --> 01:54:03.760
We actually wrote a little bit more of half each because we,

1821
01:54:03.850 --> 01:54:06.150
we both wrote chapters that aren't in there and,

1822
01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:10.900
but it was a lot of writing to do.
And how do you do that?
How did I do it?

1823
01:54:10.901 --> 01:54:11.734
I'll tell you,

1824
01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:16.450
I set the task conditions and standards for what I needed to do.

1825
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.600
For me it was what did I have to do?

1826
01:54:19.601 --> 01:54:22.720
The task was to write the condition was I,

1827
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.470
I was trying to write the draft so I knew it didn't have to be perfect and I got

1828
01:54:26.471 --> 01:54:28.750
perfect out of my head cause perfect can be bad.

1829
01:54:29.650 --> 01:54:31.510
And the standard was,

1830
01:54:31.511 --> 01:54:34.390
I said I'm every day I'm going to write a thousand words regardless.

1831
01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:37.930
I want to write a thousand words and I tried to do it in an hour or less.

1832
01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:42.880
So that's what I did.
I made no music,
no phone,

1833
01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.510
no videos,
playing in the background.
I have an hour,
I'm gonna sit down,

1834
01:54:46.511 --> 01:54:50.530
I'm gonna get this done.
So to me that's a form of motivation.
When you say,
okay,

1835
01:54:50.531 --> 01:54:52.450
this is what I'm going to do,
this is how I'm going to do it,

1836
01:54:52.451 --> 01:54:54.210
this is how long it's going to take me.
I'm going to get it done.

1837
01:54:54.230 --> 01:54:56.050
I'm probably going to try and get it done faster than an hour.

1838
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:59.740
And I used to time myself and be like,
Hey,
that only took me,
you know,
49 minutes.

1839
01:54:59.741 --> 01:55:02.200
That's pretty good.
Kind of like a crossfit exercise.
Yeah.

1840
01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.960
Like you're going into it with a,
with a challenge.

1841
01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:10.040
And then you go about it in a,
in a disciplined way.
Right.

1842
01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.200
And that's going to be the core of a lot of answers I give.

1843
01:55:14.670 --> 01:55:15.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:20.480
I think I'm going to disagree on a personal level from a personal standpoint.

1845
01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:24.480
I mean,
uh,
with the no music thing,

1846
01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:29.010
I think the music in my case helps.
I think for a lot of people,
music helps.

1847
01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:33.930
It might,
when I talk specifically about writing than music does not help me.

1848
01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:38.850
Especially music with like words,
like if there's lyrics,
you know?
Um,

1849
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:43.830
but if it's like,
um,
like somebody I know or like that.

1850
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.723
Okay.

1851
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.530
<v 0>Echo,
you are clear to listen to piano as you create</v>

1852
01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:54.450
some violence.
Marcus driving that had worked to force the cello.

1853
01:55:59.270 --> 01:56:02.910
<v 2>Um,
any it was there more to that one.
No scoring.
I'm good.</v>

1854
01:56:03.650 --> 01:56:08.600
Any advice on balancing the thousands of things you have to do every day?
Yeah.

1855
01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:13.390
<v 0>Again,
chapter in the book it's called prioritize and execute,</v>

1856
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:17.440
prioritize and execute.
That is the name of the chapter that is a,

1857
01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:19.420
one of the basic principles.

1858
01:56:19.421 --> 01:56:22.500
One of the laws of combat that we used in that is that you're going to have all

1859
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:24.460
these problems happening on the battlefield.

1860
01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:29.380
They're all going to happen at the same time because Murphy's law and when they

1861
01:56:29.381 --> 01:56:33.400
do,
if you try and handle them all at once and you try and do them all at once,

1862
01:56:33.401 --> 01:56:37.930
you will fail.
So what you have to do is you have to prioritize them and execute.

1863
01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:42.400
So in business that looks the same way,
you know,
you've got all these problems,

1864
01:56:42.401 --> 01:56:44.710
all these initiatives that you're trying to start,

1865
01:56:44.711 --> 01:56:49.420
these things you got to handle and that's,
that's good.

1866
01:56:49.421 --> 01:56:52.270
And that looks very similar on the battlefield.
On a personal level,

1867
01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.130
it's the same principle.
But I'll tell you what I considered to be,

1868
01:56:59.590 --> 01:57:04.180
for lack of a better word.
Um,
I will,
I will use this word.

1869
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:05.810
I will tell you the hack,

1870
01:57:07.810 --> 01:57:12.190
the hack for this e and this is no genius thing here.

1871
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:15.550
If you really want to get things done,

1872
01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:21.460
make a list of what you need to do the next day,
make it an a priority.
Uh,

1873
01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:27.300
what you actually need to do is schedule the time that you're going to execute

1874
01:57:27.731 --> 01:57:30.430
those tasks.
This is a piece that a lot of people miss.

1875
01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:32.800
So I guess it is a little bit bigger of a hack then.

1876
01:57:34.090 --> 01:57:38.110
Then I gave it credit for you have to say,
okay,

1877
01:57:38.111 --> 01:57:40.660
I've got to do these six things tomorrow.

1878
01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.460
You've got to put on your schedule when you are going to do those things.

1879
01:57:45.610 --> 01:57:50.610
And that really drives execution because it puts a time limit on it and it makes

1880
01:57:51.041 --> 01:57:54.310
you get on there and get it started and get it done so you can move onto the

1881
01:57:54.311 --> 01:57:55.144
next task.

1882
01:57:55.270 --> 01:58:00.270
So task lists and calendars should actually be connected,

1883
01:58:01.690 --> 01:58:03.100
you know,
intimately.

1884
01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.170
And then once you have that in place,
you get up and you go and you get it done.

1885
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:13.420
Wake up early and make it happen.
Prioritize and execute.
That's what we do.

1886
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.340
<v 2>New Year's resolutions,</v>

1887
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.380
2016 is coming up in a few days.

1888
01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:31.100
So what's your one thing for 2016 that you need to do such that by doing it,

1889
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.200
everything else will be easier and or unnecessary.

1890
01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:41.710
<v 0>And that's,
that's one of the new year's resolution questions we pulled out,</v>

1891
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:45.370
cause I've got a bunch of them because everyone's thinking,
you know,
what,

1892
01:58:45.371 --> 01:58:48.700
what is,
what are we all going to do for the big New Year's resolution?

1893
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And I mean,
you seem pretty fired up by the new year's resolution,
so,

1894
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:56.260
so what are your thoughts here?

1895
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.590
<v 2>What like my personal new year's resolution and or faults there in</v>

1896
01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.860
a,
I've,
you know,
I'm be honest,

1897
01:59:06.861 --> 01:59:10.670
I haven't come up with any specific ones right now.

1898
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:14.330
Maybe I will.
Maybe I won't.
But I think,
yeah,

1899
01:59:14.331 --> 01:59:18.530
I think all evaluate where I want to be,

1900
01:59:18.590 --> 01:59:23.450
where I am and the see if I can connect those dots,

1901
01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:28.010
whatever that looks like.
Okay.
You know,
I don't know yet,
but we'll see.

1902
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:31.620
<v 0>Well that sounds reward.</v>

1903
01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:37.040
Anyone who just heard that in the world,
um,

1904
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.910
please ignore or delete from your mind.
Uh,

1905
01:59:42.690 --> 01:59:43.110
okay.

1906
01:59:43.110 --> 01:59:48.110
Well actually here's the funny thing is I think that resolutions are for the

1907
01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:53.481
most part little feel good statements that people use to justify

1908
01:59:56.250 --> 02:00:00.540
a delay and execution.
That's what I think.
So I say,

1909
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:04.050
don't make a new year's resolution for tomorrow.

1910
02:00:04.530 --> 02:00:08.460
Don't execute then execute now,
execute now.

1911
02:00:08.461 --> 02:00:09.630
And when I say Xq now,

1912
02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:14.660
I mean now and now and now and now,

1913
02:00:15.931 --> 02:00:19.230
and continually execute what it is you're trying to do.

1914
02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:22.650
And the other thing about new year's resolution is it's a year.

1915
02:00:23.070 --> 02:00:25.320
That's a big long chunk of time.

1916
02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:30.780
And that type of goal to anybody,
I don't care who you are,

1917
02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:33.030
a year is too long,
it's too big of a chunk.

1918
02:00:33.031 --> 02:00:38.031
So saying that you're going to make that type of a long term strategic goal.

1919
02:00:38.670 --> 02:00:42.670
It's like shooting when you shoot,
if you've ever shot weapons before,
um,

1920
02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:47.750
if you look at the target belonged target,
that's the 400 meters away.
If you,

1921
02:00:47.970 --> 02:00:51.600
if you look at a target as you look at it,
your vision can't hold that folks in,

1922
02:00:51.601 --> 02:00:52.730
it becomes blurry,
right?

1923
02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:55.200
So you have to shift back to the front side of your weapon,

1924
02:00:55.201 --> 02:00:57.090
which is only two and a half feet away.

1925
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:59.950
And then that becomes very clear in the end.

1926
02:00:59.951 --> 02:01:02.550
The long distance target in the background fades a little bit,

1927
02:01:02.551 --> 02:01:05.700
but that's okay cause you can see that thing right in front of you and that's

1928
02:01:05.701 --> 02:01:06.690
what you want to make happen.

1929
02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:10.500
So what you want to do is you want to set those short term

1930
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:16.500
goals that are closer than a year away that's going to be blurry and it's going

1931
02:01:16.501 --> 02:01:19.080
to lose its impact and you're going to not see it anymore.

1932
02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:23.400
So makeup that long term strategic goal,
that's fine.

1933
02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:28.401
But make sure you make some short term tactical goals that are closer now.

1934
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:29.760
Now that being said,

1935
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:32.060
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1936
02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:35.830
<v 0>to close this out since the last question that I would say</v>

1937
02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:40.430
don't make a new year's resolution.

1938
02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:41.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1939
02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:46.840
<v 0>To be a better person in 2016 I would say make a resolution to be a better</v>

1940
02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:48.530
person.
Now

1941
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:55.340
make it a resolution of discipline to get better,
smarter,
faster,

1942
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:58.580
stronger,
healthier,
more productive,

1943
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:02.930
less agitated to eat cleaner,

1944
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.720
live more to go and do,

1945
02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.620
do all those things.
But don't do them on New Year's Eve.

1946
02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.230
Don't do them on New Year's Day.
Do them now
that

1947
02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:24.060
that resolution of discipline to work and follow through and maintain your will,

1948
02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:33.990
that'll result in the freedom that you're looking for.

1949
02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:39.190
And yes,
you heard it.
Once again,
discipline equals freedom.

1950
02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:43.090
Discipline equals freedom.
And with that,

1951
02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:48.670
that's all I got.
Thank you Mister Reco.

1952
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:52.960
Thank you everyone that's out there listening.
We appreciate it.

1953
02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:58.740
We will see you next time.
Keep getting better.
