00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
This is Jocko podcast number 68 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.
Echo did evening.

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.520
So we've been doing some Facebook lives lately.

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.110
Facebook live and they've been pretty cool interacting,

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.340
getting a lot of questions.
But here's the deal on the Facebook live,

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.740
I think the first one I did,

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.980
I got 3000 comments or questions in one hour and it's something like 40 or 50

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.620
questions a minute,
which is one a second,

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.620
which means you can't answer all of them.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.940
And I started looking at some of the questions I,

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.870
there were some really good questions on there and there's also a lot of common

12
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:50.871
questions that pop up that maybe I don't address or haven't addressed.

13
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
And I said,
you know what,
if a lot of people are asking the same question,

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.100
there must be a need to know or people are interested in what the answer is.

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.790
So I kind of threw together some of those questions from Facebook live

16
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.351
primarily.

17
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.280
There's a couple other ones that I got from Twitter and or Facebook message.

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.880
Is that what it's called?
Facebook message messenger?
Yeah.

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.870
Like when somebody direct messages
and you know,
with that,

20
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.710
if there's people that are sending me messages and s and stuff through social

21
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.500
media and,
and even through email,

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.190
I can't answer all of them right now.

23
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.550
I just can't and I apologize and I appreciate what you're sending me,

24
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.160
but I can't always get to them all.
There's a lot of them coming in.
It's,

25
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.360
it's not a disease.
I don't have enough time to answer them all.

26
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.480
I look at them and you know,

27
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.490
I'll try and throw back and answer real quick sometimes.
But um,

28
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.980
a lot of times I just don't have time to answer them off sometimes.
Yeah,

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.550
I read them all.
I do read them all.
But you know,

30
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:04.551
when I'm looking at a limited amount of time and I have a ton of Facebook

31
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.620
questions coming in,
um,
it can be hard.
A,

32
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:13.250
if you do want an answer,
let me give you a thumbs.

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.570
It's something that is helpful.
If you want an answer,

34
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.010
ask like a really simple question.
Yes or no,

35
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.130
or should I do this or that?
You know,

36
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:28.131
should I go to college or join the military based on the situation I'm in right

37
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.740
now that I don't have any money and I'd have to borrow money to go to college?

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.880
What do you think I should do?

39
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.210
So there's a couple options there for me to answer.
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.490
It's going to be pretty straight forward on that one.

41
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.910
I'm going to say join the military.
You want to join the military anyways,

42
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.010
go get after it,
boom,
done.
So,

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.070
but if you give these long questions that then you're looking for an open ended

44
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.930
kind of answer.
It's hard for me to get around to them.
Now.

45
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.100
Those are also questions that I normally might pull into the podcast because

46
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:00.730
they do require more of a response.
So if that's what you're looking for,
yes,

47
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.910
that's a good way to send it on Facebook or on Twitter.
Hey,
if you need to,

48
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.880
if it's an open ended answer that I'm going to have to think about are on and a

49
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.490
half to discuss with you,
that's cool.

50
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.230
But if you just need an answer about something,
just answer,
answer,

51
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.010
ask a direct question,
I'll get around to it.
But during the Facebook live,

52
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.570
there was a ton of questions and it was really cool.

53
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.790
I'd never done Facebook live before and got a lot of good questions.

54
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.710
So with that,
let's go to this,
uh,

55
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.380
some Q and a from the Facebook

56
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.550
and Twitter.
I'm a man and Twitter.

57
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.530
These primarily came from Facebook live.
Oh Dang.
Look,
I,

58
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.850
I went through every comment,
Dan.
Yeah.

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.960
So it took some time.
Yeah.
But especially to see my computer started lagging,

60
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.881
which,

61
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.660
and I know I talk about being mad at computers or printers and copy machines,

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.350
but when my computer is lagging,
that also can get me angry.
Yeah.

63
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.490
The computer's pushing it,
pushing.
It's luck.

64
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.920
I just want the thing to work quickly.
Yeah.
That's the whole thing though.

65
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.130
That's the whole thing with computers.
It's like,

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.390
of course you wanted to work more quickly that like if you get a cheap computer

67
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.680
tents,
I don't have a cheap main thing.
Oh yeah.
So you have,
you have expectations.

68
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.000
Yeah.
It makes sense.
I want the thing to work quickly.
Yeah.

69
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.560
I almost got a t one line and you know that is Internet wise.

70
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.150
I thought that that was like old school.
No,
it's the t one line is,

71
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.133
is when you're,

72
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.140
you're getting it in and they guarantee 99.9% you know,

73
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.590
up and going and never break.
Never have any issues.
I almost got a t one line,

74
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.640
one line I think I didn't do it.
Wow.
Hey,

75
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:53.110
that's up to you obviously.
And with that I think,
uh,

76
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.010
let's go to the question,
the first couple of questions.
Okay.

77
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.790
[inaudible] first question,
do you work out every day?
Okay.
Yeah,

78
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.450
this is a question that a bunch of people were asking me and I thought it was

79
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:06.910
pretty evident that I do work out every day,
which I do.

80
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.170
And then I also thought that there was a little misleading

81
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.140
statement in the success magazine article.
And again,

82
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.030
I don't know what I said on some of these questions are how I answered it at the

83
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.760
time or what I explained or how well I explained it.

84
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.170
But there was a misleading statement that that on this particular day I had

85
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:33.940
already lifted in the morning at zero four 30 and now I was lifting again at

86
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:38.040
nine or whatever time it was and then I was going to lift to get,

87
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.470
it was like made it seem like I was lifting just over and over again throughout

88
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.350
the day,
which generally I don't do.

89
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.620
Generally when I wake up in the morning I lift and by Lyft I mean workout by

90
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.760
workout.
That might mean lift.
It might mean do calisthenics.

91
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:58.730
It might mean sometimes it just means stretching.
Right.

92
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.040
But rarely do I stretch.

93
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.030
But like yesterday I was feeling a little under the weather for two days,

94
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.110
wasn't full on sick.
My,
some of my family members got sick,

95
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.120
they were really sick and when it hit me,
it didn't hit me as hard because I,

96
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.200
you know,
fought against that against the illness.

97
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.540
So I was a little bit sick.
But one day I was the one,
I was like,
okay,

98
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.990
I'm just going to go in and stretch the next day.
I was like,
leg day,

99
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.900
you know I was going to go do squats and I did squats,

100
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.740
but if anybody was to come and witness that workout,

101
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.620
I would have to be ashamed of myself because all I did was basically go in there

102
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:38.270
and go through the motion,
put a little weight on the bar move.
But yes I do.

103
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.480
I work out everyday,
so even when I'm sick,
I'm going to work out right.

104
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.010
I'm going to work out and when to do something because I think it's healthy to

105
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.730
do something.
Now,
another question that people say,
he's like,

106
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:54.110
do you lift and do Jujitsu in the same day?
Yes,

107
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.500
absolutely.
All the time.
Almost daily.

108
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
I'll another branch question to that one is do you lift before Jujitsu or after

109
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.160
Jujitsu?
I like to lift before Jujitsu.

110
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.010
I want to go into Jujitsu a little bit tired.
As a matter of fact,

111
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:14.510
some of the young guns at the gym,
they'll,

112
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.960
they'll say,
oh,
you know,
I'll go into role with them at night,

113
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.870
and the young guns will say,
Oh,
I already worked out.

114
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.880
We were still hard to work out today.
I'm not all fresh,
you know,
I say,

115
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.290
well you think I'm fresh when you think I've been doing all day.
So,

116
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.240
so,
so yeah,

117
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.330
I like to work out before I do Jujitsu and I like to surf.

118
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.740
If there's good waves or even marginal waves,
get a little surf session done.

119
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.120
And if I can get,
I don't like to use the word cardial,

120
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.380
but I'll use it.
It's nice to go for a little run,
a little jog.

121
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:56.180
So that's sort of like my grand slam of day.
Oh the three,
no,
four four,
yeah.

122
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.560
If I work out,
you know,
Lyft car,
uh,

123
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.390
calisthenics or whatever,
then do some kind of a gain.

124
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:10.100
I'll use the word cardio,
go for a run,
go for a jog,
go for a swim surf.

125
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.000
That's awesome.
And then you throw the Jujitsu on top of it.

126
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:16.640
That's a grand slam for me.
I love those days.

127
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.030
And those are the days you go to sleep at night,
you know,
those are the days you,

128
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:23.660
you,
you,
you go to bed and you feel tired.
You know,

129
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.250
that's one of the things in,

130
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.640
in the book that's coming out the field manual discipline equals freedom field

131
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:34.370
manual.
I talk about sleep and one of the things I talk about is,

132
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.030
you know what people are saying,
how,
how do you fall asleep at night?

133
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.100
Cause a lot of people,
you know,
we all,

134
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:42.710
everyone has trouble getting up in the morning.
But then when you start saying,

135
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:45.710
okay well I'm going to go to bed earlier,
people have trouble falling asleep too.

136
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:47.960
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of people and even me.

137
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.710
So what do you do to fall asleep earlier I got a couple of steps in the IT field

138
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.040
manual.
One of the steps in the field manual is be more tired.

139
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.290
How do you be more tired?
You work out harder during the day.

140
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.150
You Drain yourself physically and mentally during the day.

141
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:03.480
That way when you go go to bed at night,
you will fall asleep.
Yeah.

142
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.020
And I got the whole thing laid out in there,
but that's one of them.

143
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.820
One other note.
So that's it.
You know,
do I work out every day?
Yes.

144
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.930
Do something every day.
Do something,
do something.
Even if you,

145
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.740
even if all you have this 10 minutes,
do a hundred burpees,
you know,

146
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:23.160
just do a hundred burpees just at a minimum.
Make that happen.

147
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.440
But also sick.
If you're sick,
do what you can.

148
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:31.920
Get a little sweat going if you're injured,
do what you can.
If you're sick.

149
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.233
Caveat,

150
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.540
that doesn't mean go train Jujitsu cause if you're sick you make everybody else

151
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:41.460
sick at Jujitsu and I didn't,
that's not cool.
So if you're that kind of sick,

152
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.740
don't do it.
But other than that,
yes,
I work out every day.

153
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.320
I try and train every day.
I would stay active.
Yeah.

154
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.110
Bottom line,

155
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.940
it's going to be hard though to try to mask your routine onto someone else.

156
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.570
You know,
like you,
you can't just go into,
let's say I'm a guy,

157
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:04.250
I work out one at once a day and it's like just,

158
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.020
let's say it's a strenuous workout,
not super strenuous,
not like hard.

159
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.640
I can't just be like,
Hey Jocko works out four times a day on his good dance.

160
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.940
The limit.
He start doing that.

161
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.350
Like you can not only get hurt but it won't work via,

162
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.470
and that's another misconception is that every single day that I go that I work

163
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:30.790
out,
I'm going level 29 does self-destruction.

164
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.880
Yeah,
you can't do that.
You can't do that.
It doesn't,
you can't do it.

165
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.170
You just can't do it.
I mean,

166
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.300
it's not like you can't do it because it'll hurt you.
You just can't do it.
Right.

167
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.840
You know,

168
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.810
you do squats heavy one day or you go through three or four days of going really

169
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.470
hard.
The fifth,
sixth day,
one of those days you're going to be like,
okay,

170
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.790
I need to back off today.
Whatever did it date is so I'll,

171
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:57.420
I'll do some kind of workout.
I'll still go,
I'll still get it on,

172
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.220
but I'm not going to go level 29 you know,
self destruction.

173
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.340
And when I was going to bootcamp,
there was a,

174
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.810
they would say there was a room attached to the main hall,

175
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.050
the main barracks where everyone was this open bay barracks.

176
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.120
And if you've got in trouble for something,

177
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.250
they'd send you to the side room and they'd say go in there and self destruct,

178
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.630
which meant you did what you did and they had a list of exercises and it was,

179
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.120
you know,
jumping jacks,
pushups,
you know,
sit up.

180
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.150
Just a bunch of random calisthenics.

181
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:35.151
What when they'd send you in the [inaudible] I think it was posted and then you

182
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:39.720
went in there and you did one of every exercise then to have every exercises,

183
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.940
then three and then four,
then five and then six.

184
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.300
And one of my buddies who ended up being a CEO who's a great dude who I went to

185
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:48.690
bootcamp with,
he's like,
he's he,

186
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.470
he is the only guy I went to Navy boot camp with and we both ended up in the

187
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:57.040
seal teams but the,
the chief that was running it was like,

188
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.890
you know,
whatever is seamen apprentice,

189
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.110
this kid in there and self destruct.
And this guy was a,
was a wrestler,

190
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.170
a college wrestler,
legit college wrestler.
Great Dude.

191
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.850
And he went in there and you know,

192
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.880
normally people are done by whatever that you know,

193
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.030
five or six repetitions or maybe eight repetitions.

194
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.460
He was in there for like an hour.

195
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.800
He came out just dripping with sweat.
It was,
I knew,
I knew he was in there.
Uh,

196
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.860
getting out for sure.
Yeah.
The wrestler version,

197
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.130
the rest of the different,
it's different than some,
you know,
guy from wherever.

198
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.460
That's you know,
a non wrestling,
a non wrestler.
Yes.

199
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.740
I still have to put quite simply,
yes.
Thanks.

200
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:41.470
See they'd just kind of leave it to you.

201
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.610
You've got self discharged all and that's right.
He was the,
that's what it was.

202
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:48.020
He was the master at arms in my bootcamp,

203
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.250
which I don't even remember who the wrestler Guy,
the rest of the ride he was,

204
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.040
he was the master at arms [inaudible].
We when we were both from New England to,

205
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.950
and so we had had driven the flown down there to Florida,

206
00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:03.400
all on the same plane.
And of course we were both kind of,
you know,

207
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:05.650
what are you going to the navy for?
Oh,
I want to be a seal.

208
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.180
What are you going for?
I want to be a seal too.

209
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:09.100
So we kind of had a little bit of,

210
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.300
okay well at least this guy's kind of getting after it in some way.

211
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.160
And honestly he was a college wrestler.

212
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.410
I was probably like a little punk to him because he's thinking what does this,

213
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:21.430
I was just a high school kid,
go non Razon rest of there going uh,

214
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.410
I want to be a navy seal and yeah.
So anyways,

215
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:29.410
he was a master at arms,
that's what we was like mastered arms,
kidded that room.

216
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:33.310
It's self destruct.
So that was a good time.
So no,

217
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.650
I do not self destruct on a daily basis,

218
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040
but I do get it on every day and definitely pushed myself on a regular basis.

219
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.163
Yeah.

220
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.610
And that's obviously going to depend on what you like,

221
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.670
what is the results because you're not at a point where you're like,
hey,

222
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.160
I need to really get in shape.

223
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.600
I need to lose 25 pounds or something.
I'm not saying that,
you know,

224
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:02.410
it is interesting though is the days where I'm getting the,

225
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.850
the Grand Slam going,
when I get to Jujitsu,
I feel good.

226
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.580
The I train way better when I'm in the zone,
when I've been working out,

227
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:15.130
when I've had a good workout,
I've surfed,
I show up.
Did you just do I feel great.

228
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.610
I don't feel I'll feel tired but I feel better.
Right?
Yeah.

229
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.310
It's kind of like your second round of rolling.

230
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.930
If for whatever reason I don't get a workout in the morning or I only get a

231
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:28.240
really short workout in the morning and then I go train Jujitsu,

232
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.260
I f I never feel optimal.
And as a matter of fact,

233
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:37.261
I have a personal superstitions slash curse in my own head that if I don't work

234
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:42.010
out in the morning,
I am going to get injured.
So,

235
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.120
so that forces me to work out even when I don't want to.
Cause I said,

236
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:46.090
well I'm going to train tonight.

237
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:47.890
I don't want to get injured because there's been,

238
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.980
I think two injuries that I've gotten from Jujitsu.
Both of

239
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.450
<v 1>them happened when I didn't work out in the morning.
One of them,</v>

240
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.111
yeah,

241
00:14:57.111 --> 00:15:00.950
I didn't work out in the morning and I showed up and went to train and one of

242
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.660
them hurt my ankle really bad,
like a high ankle sprain and that was bad.

243
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.080
But I didn't work out in the morning.
It must a minute.
And I think the,
yeah,

244
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.930
well apparently think the other one was,

245
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.280
I think the other one was a knee injury.
No,
it wasn't unusual for her.

246
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.390
I think it was a shoulder injury.
Anyways,
whatever it was.

247
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.690
It's also that day didn't work out in the morning for some pathetic reason,

248
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.760
you know,
it didn't work out.
So for me work out,

249
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.540
it's mental prep,
it's physical prep gets you ready for the evening,

250
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.220
the zoo's yets.
I think that's,
I think that's called the availability bias.

251
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.290
When you kind of,
you draw that conclusion,
you know,
in your specific case,
oh,

252
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.400
it stands out in your mind on this emotional level.
So it's like,
you know,

253
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.620
you really happened though.
So nevermind cognitive.

254
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.610
I'm not telling you what I understand what happened,

255
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:56.810
but you have to consider all the times in your whole digits a career that you

256
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.950
didn't work.
That's what I'm saying.
Then I was the only tool.
It's it's,

257
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.590
it's a such a small number.
It's such a small number.

258
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.270
I bet you it is.

259
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.080
I bet you there's 10 times in the past 10 years that I didn't work out in the

260
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.010
morning and I teach and I trained Jujitsu that night.
Yeah,
210 that's bad on,

261
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.740
yeah,
you can't,
you can't consider it.

262
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.800
You can include that and that's probably pretty generous.

263
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:26.330
It might be like five because sometimes I'm on the road and then I didn't work

264
00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:27.560
out,
but I didn't train Jujitsu,

265
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.620
but for me to be here in my hometown with access to my garage gym and the

266
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.120
Jujitsu,
for me to just say,
Oh,
I'm just not going to work out today.

267
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.770
I don't say that.
Right.
It's not very common.
No.
Yeah.

268
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.220
I would say if it was a muscle strain or tear or something like this,

269
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.330
I would say that would maybe make it a little different because you're stiffer,

270
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.930
you know?
Yeah.
But then again,
ankle too.
If you're super like warm,

271
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.230
you can stretch your ankles and shoulders a lot.
So I don't know,

272
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.990
maybe you might be right.
I could have it completely.

273
00:17:02.991 --> 00:17:07.550
Certainly sounds like I'm right,
but statistically I think I,

274
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:12.320
when statistically,
statistically,
let's say it's inconclusive.

275
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.930
Okay,
so 20% is not conclusive to,
okay.
No,
it's not.

276
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.440
You know what I'll do,
I'll keep working out.
Given the quantity,

277
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.920
like you'd have to do it over time and then if there's like a discernible 20%

278
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:27.020
then you could start to conclude,
okay,

279
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:31.880
I'm 20% more likely.
Okay,
well that's fair.
That's,

280
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.650
we can make that a statement right now.
Oh yeah.

281
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.120
I'm more statistically is 20% more likely get hurt if you don't,

282
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.810
which is pretty big out.
Yes.
Yeah.
Those aren't good odds at all.

283
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.110
I know I'm working out every day now.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

284
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.580
I used to do that like,
but I would go hard workout then go Jujitsu.

285
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.390
But same thing though,
I think it's mental.

286
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.960
Unless you're doing it like seven days a week for you know,
a few weeks,

287
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:58.770
then you can start to feel like,
hey,
or your nutrition is bad or I don't know,

288
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:03.600
something it to go,
you feel better,
you feel better sometimes.

289
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:04.700
Sometimes.
Not all the time though.

290
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.380
I know sometimes I'll feel better if I don't work out,
but,

291
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.490
so I wouldn't say that necessarily in my case.
But I think it is more mental,

292
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.540
you know,
in Jujitsu,

293
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:17.540
like I think it's natural to put pressure on yourself to perform in Jujitsu

294
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.880
training.
You know?
Cause I think it's part of it.
Like when I go in,

295
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:23.490
I'm going to rule against you.
I'm going to try to do good against you.

296
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.570
I'm not going to every single time I'm not going to go in and be like,

297
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.790
let's just see what I learned today.

298
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.230
Let me work on my weaknesses and try to learn and you're going to turn to when

299
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.980
I'm trying to win.
And there's that element.

300
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:37.050
I think most of the time for most people,

301
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.420
so mentally will play these games or we'll kind of psych yourself out like shit,

302
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.980
not at my best because I'm kind of tired from working out so I won't be able to

303
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:48.750
perform.
Now the pressure's on.

304
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.820
Maybe I'm going to roll with the guy who was my level,

305
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.040
me and my instructor is going to see me roll with him.

306
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:54.570
I'm not going to do as good as they normally do.

307
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.390
He will think I'm not as good as I really am.
You know?

308
00:18:57.391 --> 00:18:59.670
It's like you're saying there's mental pressure when you're at the edge.

309
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.840
That's why I think that's why people will say,
oh I worked out today.

310
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.440
Oh I don't want you to judge my performance necessarily.

311
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.650
A Primo excuse in a way.
Yes.
That excuse.
Yeah,

312
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.540
no you can't because it would be a lie too.
Yeah.

313
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.180
Cause I would actually go and say,
Hey,
I didn't work out today,

314
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:18.180
therefore my game is going to be weak.
That's what I would have to say.

315
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.310
But that's not the case for you of the time.
Yeah,

316
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.820
and it's pretty rare I think.
I mean,

317
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:28.821
in my experience it's pretty rare that I'll work out even a hard workout in the

318
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.280
morning and then go roll at night and then it affects me like,
yeah,
I feel too,

319
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.770
it's pretty rare.
No,
now I will get so sore sometimes,

320
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.090
you know,
if you do squats or you a hardcore,

321
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.160
like a hardcore kettlebell workout,

322
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.690
I'll be sore and it takes a few minutes to get that soreness out of the body.

323
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:52.350
Once you're on the mats and sometimes somebody will be doing some movement

324
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.470
that's grinding on the quads and it hurts you and makes you Zeki a little bit.

325
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.490
Sure.
So I was jumping,
I was parachuting,

326
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.560
I had like hardly,
this is like when I was,
when I was in the seal teams.
Okay.

327
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.600
That like this morning was parachuting and I didn't have that many jumps.
Right.

328
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:16.920
I wasn't an experienced freefall.
Parachuters parachutist at this time.

329
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.490
And the guy we were going jumping with was an extremely experienced,

330
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.460
highly experienced,
thousands and thousands of parachute jumps.

331
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.180
And he took a crew of us and we were all pretty much new jumpers.

332
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:33.000
We didn't know what the hell we were doing.
And so,

333
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.960
so we go up and there's a ceiling,

334
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.230
meaning that the clouds are low and so we can't get to full out,

335
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.610
tattooed and so he goes,
hey guys,
we can't get up to altitude.

336
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:46.570
We're in the aircraft.
This is almost,
you know,

337
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.220
this is one those cheesy like a movie

338
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.700
<v 0>type scene where we're in the aircraft and he's Kinda yelling like what's going</v>

339
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:55.450
on to us new guys and this guy was a master chief [inaudible].
He's like,

340
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:58.600
hey guys,
we can't get up to altitude.

341
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.810
We're going to just do a hop and pop at three grand or something like that.

342
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.360
Meaning we're just going to go at a very low altitude,

343
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:08.980
just going to jump out and pop our parachutes.
And I'm sitting there.

344
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:10.810
I've never even done a hop and pop before.

345
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.010
I barely knew how to get stable coming out of an aircraft the way you go
through.

346
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.160
We used to go through free fall school.
It was like a rapid,

347
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.810
rapid evolution where if you did correct on one jump,

348
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:25.900
they moved to the next one and I did my jumps correctly so I didn't have a lot

349
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.700
of jumps.
So then we get this guy saying,

350
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.500
and I only jumped at 13,000 feet before this.
So you have all kinds of time.

351
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:34.090
If you,
if you mess up on your exit,

352
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.250
which if you don't know when you jump out of an aircraft,

353
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:39.100
when you're inexperienced,
you can get spun around.
As a matter of fact,

354
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.700
Andy Stumpf talked about how he started spinning out of control and it happens.

355
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.500
Well,
when you're at 13,000 feet,
you start spinning.
It's okay.
You've,

356
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.650
you find your body position,
you get stable.
We called it flat,
dumb and happy,

357
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:53.770
meaning you're falling flat and everything is stable and good and then you can

358
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.660
pull your parachute and it's fine.
Well,

359
00:21:55.661 --> 00:22:00.250
at 3000 feet you don't have time to do any of that.
So when you come out,

360
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:03.610
you basically have to come out and immediately adapt to the airstream of the

361
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.010
aircraft and you have to get yourself stable and then you need to pull it really

362
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:10.120
quickly.
And so I'm kind of thinking to myself,
I'm trying to think of myself,

363
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.010
I have no idea how to do this.
And I've,

364
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.700
I know him that I've messed up a bunch of exits and I knew that I'd gotten

365
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.070
unstable a bunch of times jumping out and you know,

366
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:22.890
it just find my time and get stable and to be cool.
So anyways,
this mastery,

367
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:25.180
it's like,
hey guys,
we can't get to altitude.

368
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:29.650
We're just going to do a hop and pop it at 3000 feet.
And I,

369
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.940
I'm thinking to myself,
okay,

370
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.270
there's a limited chance that I'm going to make this exit properly.

371
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.770
And I think I said something along the lines of like,
Hey,
master chief,

372
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.140
I've never done a hop and pop before.
You know,

373
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.390
because we're yelling at an aircraft,
you can't hear anything.
I'm like,
Hey,

374
00:22:43.391 --> 00:22:48.280
I've never done a hop and pop before.
What's anything,
any pointers?
And it was me.

375
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:52.090
And all my buddies,
none of us had done it before.
And he goes,
yeah,

376
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.320
he's no big deal.
You just go out,
just count to three and pull.

377
00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.210
And I go,
Roger that.
And then he goes,
just don't Ziggy the exit.

378
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.080
That's what he says.
Just the exit meeting.
Don't,
don't have a bad exit.

379
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.820
Which like at this point,
like I said,

380
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:10.630
I was probably batting 50% bad exits cause I just didn't know what I was doing.

381
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.360
So of course,
what did I do?
Okay,
fine.
I'll just jump.
If I does,

382
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:18.670
they get the accident and die.
Cool.
Sophie.

383
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.740
But at least I tried to hit it.

384
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.570
So don't say get the exit to the what?
What else?
Oh,
so I went out.

385
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.630
I didn't Ziggy the exit actually,
you know,
that's when the,

386
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.890
when the pressure's on,
you rise,
you know,
you rise,

387
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.010
you hope to rise.
I always feel better.
You know,

388
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:40.090
it's like surfing without a leash.
You know what Alicia's right.
Do you know?

389
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:42.370
I mean,
you're from Hawaii,
you know,
it's just,
I know that at least thank you.

390
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.010
Some people were,
at least some people don't.
When you wear it.
When I wear

391
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.570
<v 1>a leash,
which I don't like to you fuel,
you can make mistakes and there's no,</v>

392
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.020
there's no,

393
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.990
there's no price to be paid because all you do is you fall on your boards right

394
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.100
there with you.
When you don't have a rope on or Alicia on,
when you fall,

395
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.420
you're board has gone.
You have to swim for it.
It's a pain.

396
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.070
It can hit people is hazardous.
It's dangerous.
All of these things.

397
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.580
When I surf with Alicia and I surf like crap,
when I surf with no rope,

398
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.880
which I prefer,
I serve better because if you don't make,

399
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:17.390
if you Ziki that didn't use digging,
that drop,
your board's gone.

400
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:21.770
You're going to hurt somebody.
It's a nightmare.
So yeah,
thanks again.

401
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.690
And I'll tell you my son the other day there was big waves and I mean not big

402
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:29.720
waves from a Hawaiian standpoint,
but San Diego,

403
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:34.250
big waves and he's just on a long board.

404
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.320
No rope,
just dropping in on [inaudible].

405
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.520
I was pretty impressed.
They actually,

406
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.910
especially because I have a little bit of a tweak shoulder right now,

407
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:48.911
so I was wearing a leash because I can't quite grip my board as much as I need

408
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:51.590
to.
And so I was,

409
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.890
I'm sitting out there wearing a leash and he's out there and no rope getting

410
00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.350
after it.
I was like,
okay,
that's cool.
Impressive.
Impressive.

411
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.000
You're not,
it was,

412
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.230
oh that they rise to the pressure or even in your case it seems like you prefer

413
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:09.200
the pressure.
I prefer the pressure I put from the person feels better.

414
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.640
Like when you drop in on a wave and there's no it,
there's no penalty for,

415
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.830
for making a mistake.

416
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.870
There's just less reward.
Right.
You want more reward.
Yeah.

417
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:23.180
I think it's like rolling with people that you're better than,
you know,

418
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:25.280
you don't want to roll with people that you're just way better than,

419
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:29.000
there's no reward to it.
You want to,
you want to feel the challenge.
Right.

420
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:32.180
You know?
Yeah.
Just I do.
Yeah.
And that makes sense.

421
00:25:32.181 --> 00:25:35.370
But I guess it's like the standard is different with youth.

422
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.810
Cause like I was a sponger back in the day.

423
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.090
For those of you that don't know back in the day,
echo is riding a boogie board.

424
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.620
We call it bodyboarding.
Anyway,
same thing,
thing,
leash,
no leash.

425
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.820
But if you're shredding big waves,
right,

426
00:25:53.821 --> 00:25:56.090
you want that leash because it's some people,

427
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.300
I was one of those people where if you don't have a leash it's like,
okay,

428
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:02.240
I'm cutting now.
I'm thinking about that a little bit.
No,
it's on my mind.

429
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.210
Rather than,
you don't have to think about that.
I can just think about,
you know,

430
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:07.790
this wave shredding.
I can just think about shredding.
Yeah.

431
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.830
So you have that situation.

432
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.780
But yours perfect analogy with the g with Jujitsu guys,

433
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.730
like let's say you know you're a black belt and you know whatever,

434
00:26:16.731 --> 00:26:19.130
you get matched up with a white belt,
boom timer goes off.

435
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:22.230
And then let's say it's a white belt that you've rolled with before.
So you,

436
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.180
not only do you expect to be better than than him,

437
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.590
you're actually actually,
you know it.
Yeah.
And there's no payoff.
So yeah,

438
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:34.940
your body is straight up,
has no essentially no motivation.

439
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:38.940
And no incentive to unquote perform same thing.
Yeah.

440
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.450
But I think with these types of things,
like sir,

441
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.010
is it just a different standard though?
Some people in

442
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.060
<v 0>your case,
apparently you feel that in surfing with the leash,</v>

443
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.480
but I think some people at the same time,
it's like wearing a mouthpiece to,

444
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.950
you know,
there'll be like,
oh yeah,
you know,
but that's not smart.

445
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.180
What not wearing without a mouthpiece.
But no,
I mean not,
not Jujitsu,

446
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.890
but when you start stand up.
Yeah.

447
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:05.850
It's like boxing or kickboxing without a mouthpiece in.
That's not smart,

448
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.500
which I've done a tone of stupidly.
Yeah.
But think of that,

449
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.660
that mindset there where it's like,
yeah,

450
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:15.930
I won't wear mouthpiece that way when someone hits me,
it's,
it,
it,

451
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.640
the cost is greater,
you know?

452
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.760
So to add some pressure to talking about think dental damage damage.

453
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.120
Yeah.

454
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.920
As opposed to a face losing your boogie board and to the shore where you got to

455
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:33.240
swim a little bit more.
Yeah.
Man.
Same Deal Jack.
All right,

456
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.830
next question.

457
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.130
Boxing or Jujitsu for a seven year old boy

458
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.150
Jujitsu all day.
Uh,
on that one,
it's a couple reasons.

459
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.013
It's fun,

460
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.260
it's active so you can actually fight the other person and it's real fighting

461
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.240
and it's what they're used to.
And so many,
often when,

462
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:59.730
when parents come in and they bring their kid in for the first time,

463
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:03.780
or now it's week two,
and the parents say,
oh,
they just love it so much.

464
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:06.180
And I said,
yeah,
they're doing what they want to do.
What they're,

465
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.950
what they instinctually want to go look at dogs,
go look at cats,

466
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:15.420
go look at any animal out there in the animal kingdom.
You know what they do?

467
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.500
They grapple with each other and they,
and they actually do submissions,
right?

468
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.500
They,
they,
if you watch like a wolf pack,

469
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.420
when that dominating wolf gets the throat of the weaker wolf,

470
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.260
the submissive wolf,
he doesn't rip his throat out.
The guy taps out game over.

471
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.780
He'd now he knows that he's the alpha now,
but it's the same thing.
So,

472
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.770
you know,
you watch little lions or tigers,

473
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.250
they wrestle with each other.
They don't kill each other.
They top out,

474
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.500
they'd get submissive and they say,
Oh yeah,
you want,

475
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.730
so it's very natural and very instinctive to do so.
Yeah,

476
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.200
I do Jujitsu all day long.

477
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.670
Now it's important to develop your striking and you can do that,

478
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.320
you know,
training boxing on two times a week,
you know,
just get in there,

479
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.500
learn how to throw it.
I mean it's really,
it's really pretty sad when you,

480
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.790
when you meet a grown man that does know how to throw a punch,
right?

481
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.050
That's just not good.
They,

482
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:12.330
you should know how to throw a punch because if you get in a fight,

483
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.850
the fights are going to start standing.
And if,

484
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.790
if all you know how to do is try and double leg someone you,

485
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.430
you don't always want to do that.
In fact,

486
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.790
you prefer to knock the person out in many cases.

487
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.070
So learn how to throw strikes.

488
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:31.100
But I will say as far as seven year olds getting in there and sparring too

489
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:34.020
young,
too young,

490
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:37.920
all kinds of brain development still going on head trauma is head trauma.

491
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.850
You're not going to get better at it as you get older.
You,

492
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.780
<v 1>you buy,
well,
I shouldn't say that.</v>

493
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:46.270
You're not going to get better at it by taking more punches.

494
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.230
The more you get punched in the head,
the worst you're going to be at it,
period.

495
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.180
And a story,
and I shouldn't say period in story,

496
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.710
when you turn 18 or when you turned 17 and you're going to start sparring,

497
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.430
you're going to get better at it for a little bit because you're going to get

498
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.800
used to it.
You're going to understand how the reaction,

499
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.710
you're going to know how to deal with the little white fast that hits you.

500
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.280
You're going to,

501
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.730
you're going to become comfortable in that uncomfortable scenario.

502
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.940
But that uptick of increased improvement is very short and,

503
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.160
and very quickly you reach the other side of that,

504
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.490
which is every time you get punched in the head,
you're taking your,

505
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.470
your brain resilience backwards.

506
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.360
So do boxing,
learn it,
throw punches,

507
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.660
hit pads,
note,
make sure you know how to throw a punch.

508
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.910
And you take a kid that's 10 years old that knows how to throw a one,
two,

509
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:42.250
three combo and he gets in a street fight.

510
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.890
He knows Jujitsu and boxing and he's not even getting into the,

511
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.200
to the Jujitsu Bart cause he knows a one,
two,

512
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:51.040
three combo and he's knocking out just about every other kid or at least he's

513
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:53.180
putting them down.
Uh,

514
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.620
or at least at least he's shown that that kid is going to go,
wait,

515
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.750
this person knows how to fight and I don't because it is hard to knock people

516
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:03.210
out.
I don't care.
You know,
even a,

517
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.280
even a skilled boxer will have a hard time knocking out a random person in the

518
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.590
street cause it's hard to knock someone out harder.

519
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.290
So yes,

520
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.060
Jujitsu all day long for the seven year old and do a little bit of striking to

521
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:19.930
get them familiar with it.
Yeah,
just,
it was way funner too.
And of course that,

522
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.340
it sounds like a matter of opinion,

523
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:23.290
but just how he said like grappling and stuff,

524
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.030
the natural like even if you get two brothers who don't take to get through it

525
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:30.430
all,
no wrestling,
no nothing,
and you say,
Hey,
go play outside,

526
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.130
they're going to start and no ball,
no nothing.
They're going to mess around.

527
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:34.750
And chances are they're going to start,
you know,

528
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:36.490
one goes is going to be painting the other guy on the ground,

529
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:39.670
putting his hands or whatever.
And that's kind of part of the little Jujitsu.

530
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:43.480
It's like,
it's basically Jujitsu.
It's just that literally just that,

531
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:47.710
except for there's actual skills in there so they can get good at that thing

532
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:48.670
that they were doing.
And in that,

533
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:52.750
and that's one of the reasons that boxing or striking kick,

534
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:54.910
cause I should say boxing,
kickboxing,
Muay Thai,
whatever.

535
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.840
There's a reason why it's a little bit boring if you're not sparring because now

536
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:02.050
you're not swearing,
hitting pads,
you're hitting,
it's just not as fun.

537
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.290
It is cool and it's good.
And I'll tell you what,

538
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.160
I've been to Thailand and it's awesome seeing the young kids that are training

539
00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:12.010
like that all the time.
You drive down the streets in Thailand,

540
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.480
just like in America,

541
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:15.850
you'd see guys shooting hoops or you see kids shooting hoops.

542
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.960
You see kids playing catch with a baseball.
The kids there are doing more time.

543
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.330
That's what they're doing and it's bad ass,
bad ass.

544
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:25.960
But that's the traditional thing.
When that's all around you.
That's what we do.

545
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:27.580
That's what else can just like soccer,

546
00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:29.710
like certain places you're gonna see more people playing soccer,

547
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.590
playing basketball.
Yeah,
of course it's traditional thing.

548
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.660
But I'm saying even at that young age,

549
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.720
they do find it entertaining and they,

550
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.880
and they are also our ways to spar.

551
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.360
If you can do it correctly,
that is like light sparring.

552
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.620
It's almost like you're playing tag,
I call it playing tag.

553
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.440
You can kind of play tag with the person,

554
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:53.090
you are improving your skills but you're not getting head brain trauma and that,

555
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.220
and that's actually a good point because you do,

556
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.040
even if you're not trained in bucks and you'll do that in anyway,
you know,

557
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.150
with your brothers like slapboxing slap box.

558
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:05.100
We used to go before actually took Jujitsu when we just watched UFC where the

559
00:33:05.101 --> 00:33:06.800
hoists Gracie videos,
we'd um,

560
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.230
we'd play slap MMA basically.
So it slap boxing,

561
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.150
you can kick them in the legs or whatever.

562
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.590
And even if you get them on the ground,

563
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:17.090
your ground upon is just slapping them in the face.

564
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:19.700
Like we do that and that's fun.

565
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:22.830
Even if you don't know Jujitsu or boxing or anything.
So that's right.

566
00:33:22.831 --> 00:33:24.140
I think that you're right about that.

567
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:29.170
In that case where you just have to be careful of kids getting hit.

568
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.440
He kids and adults getting hit repeatedly in the head with legit strikes.

569
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:37.790
It's just not good for you,
period.
Yeah.
And that's kind of a slippery slope too,

570
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:41.380
when you're like,
oh,
seven year old boy,
um,

571
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.710
I want to get them into boxing,
you know?
So obviously there's a spectrum there.

572
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:48.410
It's a,
it's an a,
you know,
on one side you're like,
okay,
just get them learn,

573
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.710
learn how to throw one to learn the,
you know,
what else is important to say too,

574
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.820
because I just thought of this as you said.
Did you say there's a spectrum,

575
00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.130
there's a spectrum.
There's a spectrum of natural ability to take punches too,

576
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.790
right?

577
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.380
So some people can get punched their whole lives and they're fine in the head.

578
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.560
And you look at some pro boxers that come out of their box and career after

579
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:12.620
having wars,
and they're,
they're,

580
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.570
they're cognitively fine.

581
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.320
And there's other guys that go through their careers and they're there.

582
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.780
They're in rough shape when they get done,

583
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.910
they have a pugilistic brain syndrome.
I forget the actual name of it,

584
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:29.330
but they have,
you know,
the,
the boxers,
brain damage.

585
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.580
And so you don't know who's going to have that.

586
00:34:31.581 --> 00:34:32.990
You don't know if your kids are going to have that or not.

587
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.580
So if the only way to find out is to test them by giving it to him,

588
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:39.200
that's not a good way to find out.
It's not worth it.

589
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.670
Even if they wanted to be a pro boxer,

590
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.570
it's not a good way to find out because you're going to find out when they're

591
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.070
doing their first amateur bout and they get,
if they get knocked out or you know,

592
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.410
they get bad headaches,
it's a bad situation.

593
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.000
So I think that's one of the reasons why I think Jujitsu and wrestling is going

594
00:34:56.001 --> 00:34:59.180
to get even more popular because as you look at the UFC evolve,

595
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.620
the people are now saying,
you know,

596
00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:06.740
all kinds of UFC fighters are saying,
hey,
I'm not sparring.
You know,

597
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:09.770
I'm barely sparring anymore.
I don't spar before my fried rice bar.

598
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.040
Very limited amount.
And so as people are saying that,
well,

599
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:15.230
what are you going to do if you're not sparring while you're hitting pads?

600
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:17.070
That's cool,
but how are you going to train?
You're going to do Jujitsu,

601
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.380
you can do wrestling,
you're gonna do grappling.

602
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:19.520
That's where you're going to win the fight.

603
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.850
So I think that as the UFC gets more and more popular and as more information

604
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:29.921
comes out about traumatic brain injuries that come from repetitive hits to the

605
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:31.010
head,

606
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.570
I think that the popularity of boxing and striking training is going to go down.

607
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.130
And that will force or

608
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.670
<v 0>cause the popularity of wrestling and Jujitsu to go up.</v>

609
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.680
<v 2>Yeah,
potentially.
Yeah,
true.
But these,
um,</v>

610
00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.070
oh,
what I said about the state,
I mean everything's really a spectrum,

611
00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:53.310
but the approach to it,
right?
So let's talk about boxing.

612
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.100
Seven year old boy boxing is,
there's a spectrum.
On one side of the spectrum is,

613
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:59.550
yeah,
let's have them learn the one to have learned a jab,
hook,
cross all this.

614
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.390
And that's cool.
Hit submit,
do workout,
do some jump rope.

615
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.590
And do this on the other side,
the extreme side,
deuce kid discipline,

616
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.230
seven days a week he's going to be the next,
you know,

617
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:13.190
Roy Jones jr or something like that and we're going to start them right now kind

618
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:16.050
of thing.
So in that case,

619
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:19.770
most of the time I would predict is that on the extreme case,

620
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:21.990
the boy is not going to take to it as naturally,
you know,

621
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:24.570
unless it is part of the tradition or something like that.
But you do too.

622
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:27.630
Like I said,
it's like just,
just so unless you're doing,
you're being that guy,

623
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.770
that parent,
you know the ones who you're going no matter what.

624
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.770
Um,
but I,
I think so.
I think you're,

625
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:37.620
I think naturally they're going to take to something like Jujitsu.

626
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:38.783
It's just way more fun.

627
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.080
And even just the traditional atmosphere of Jujitsu is more fun.
You're just,

628
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.180
especially in the kids,
probably those kids

629
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.170
<v 0>so much fun in there.</v>

630
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.320
They don't barely know that they're doing something instructional in a lot of

631
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:53.220
cases.
They're just,
hey,
you hold this person here with your knees on each side.

632
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:54.920
Well,
that's the mountain.
And the personal,

633
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.300
the kid on the bottom is learning the amount of scape.
They don't even know it,

634
00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.040
but they're learning it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fine.
Yeah.

635
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.700
My daughter doesn't even want to leave the gym now.
That's so lucky.

636
00:37:04.701 --> 00:37:07.830
Can just run around and think about too.
You're in a padded room.

637
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:10.440
Here's a padded room.
Do whatever you want.
Yeah,
go

638
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.640
<v 2>the best.
Next question.
Cool.</v>

639
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.430
How'd you read books to prepare for podcasts?

640
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.050
How do you read a book to extract maximum benefit?

641
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.070
Any advice on keeping yourself focused and being patient while reading books?

642
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.820
So this was a series of rear

643
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.200
<v 0>recurring questions that were about kind of how I read and I grabbed three of</v>

644
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:39.250
them that were in there.
So how do we prepare for the podcast?

645
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.300
It's actually a pretty in depth situation.

646
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.270
So first thing I'd do is read the book.
It hasn't written the book.

647
00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:51.271
I highlight anything that I find to be interesting or informative to me or

648
00:37:51.881 --> 00:37:54.880
reinforced an idea that I know or bring a new idea to bear.

649
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.810
So as I'm going through,

650
00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:58.450
I'm just highlighting everything and when I get done with,

651
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.250
and now just to just to say when we're talking Max benefit when I was in college

652
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:04.084
and I would do that,

653
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.780
I would once I got done with highlighting the areas that I found informative or

654
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:13.060
important than I would make flashcards of the highlighted areas.

655
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.450
So I was like double locking the information because when you,

656
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.440
as soon as I make a flashcard,
I've already got it,
50% of my book,
I read it,

657
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.520
I highlighted it.
It was like 25% make a flashcard.

658
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.690
That's another 45 or 50% and so boom now I got to do is study the Flash Card for

659
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:34.870
that last 25% the lock in the knowledge where when I go in to take the,

660
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.170
I know 100% I know I'm going to know every answer on the,
on the on the question.

661
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:45.070
You recall like a thing you actually recall what the flashcards?
Yes,
exactly.

662
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.160
You wrote the a yes,

663
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.430
so that's what I would do this kind of a side track when I was in college,

664
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:56.490
highlight and then make flashcards of what I highlighted now for the podcast.

665
00:38:56.951 --> 00:39:00.480
What I do is once I,
once I read it and highlight it,

666
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.090
now I go back through and I look at the highlights and now I start being

667
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:09.091
selective of what is going to be in the podcast and I actually circle the actual

668
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:12.100
words.

669
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.700
I'm going to read with a red pen that I'm holding right here and that's what I

670
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:19.490
do.
I circle and then I have little notes that say next,

671
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.450
like when I circle a section and then I'll either have an arrow that goes to

672
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:27.451
another point or I'll have a little note that says go to page 49 and then

673
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.780
there'll be a tab,
one of those little yellow sticky tabs on page 49 boom.

674
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.750
There it is.
I can flip right there real quick so we don't have to edit,

675
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:37.360
we don't have to.
There's a flow where it can keep rolling.

676
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.930
And then on top of those,
when I get to,

677
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.570
when I read something and I want to say something about it,

678
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.920
I have little sticky notes that I put in there,
either sticky notes,

679
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:52.210
I have the sticky tape stuff,
which is pretty legit and I just rolled,

680
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.600
I rolled that out and I stick it on there and I say,
hey mentioned,
you know,

681
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.200
experience I had here or what happened when I was doing this.

682
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:04.120
And so I kind of make those notes in that way I can get it done.

683
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.590
And while I'm doing that is when I have to figure out the chronology that I'm

684
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:13.030
going to read it because I don't always read the notes from the book on the

685
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:17.350
podcast in the same order that they are in the book.

686
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.830
Because sometimes it just doesn't make sense.
Sometimes there's some.

687
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.720
So at the same time I'm doing that,

688
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:26.200
I'm going back and figuring out what direction I'm actually going to read them.

689
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.710
So sometimes my conclusion of the book is different than the author's conclusion

690
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:32.500
of the book.

691
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.130
So I got to go back and say I got to go back pages or forward or whatever.

692
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:37.840
So that's what I'm figuring out there as well.

693
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.240
So that's Kinda what the podcast prep looks like.
Now,

694
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.740
how to stay focused in patient while reading books.
This is really difficult.

695
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.390
I don't have a long attention span when I have a lot of contention span.

696
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.390
It's only because I absolutely force myself to do it.
Hmm.

697
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.680
So what I would prefer to do is to read in small chunks.

698
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.800
I want to do work for like an hour at a time.
Right.
When I'm writing,

699
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.630
I want to work for about an hour.
When I'm reading,

700
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.020
I want to read for about an hour after that I want to get up and break something

701
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.060
or throw something or lift something or run somewhere.
You know what I mean?
It's,

702
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:20.410
I have an hour of patients with me.
Of course.

703
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.780
Unfortunately that is not enough time.
You know,

704
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:25.210
especially when you're doing a podcast a week and you've got to read a whole

705
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:28.330
book.
Well guess what?
You got to,
you got to read for longer.

706
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:31.220
You got to read for two,
three hours at a pop.
Uh,

707
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.180
I'll try and make it that I do on our early in the morning.

708
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.130
Sometimes when I'm behind the curve,

709
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.030
I will read first thing in the morning before I work out because I just want to

710
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.240
get an hour done.
Then I get to go and release,
right.

711
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.160
Then I get done with the workout,
take a shower,

712
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.680
now I'm going to read for another 45 minutes.
Okay,
good.

713
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.250
Now I'll do something else,
little prelaunch reading.
So,

714
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.940
and then before I go to bed,
I'm doing another hour.

715
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.960
So there I just got four or five hours in a day without having to sit down and

716
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:02.870
do something for four or five straight hours,
which bothers the hell out of me.

717
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.110
The other thing you can do,
and I do this,

718
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.430
is I'll read multiple books at the same time,
which is,

719
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.860
which is an interesting task,
I a tactic.

720
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.280
I don't know if everybody should do that or could do that or would want to do

721
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:20.450
that,
but sometimes one book,
it's boring,
but I know I got to read.

722
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.100
So I guess I have two books,

723
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:25.970
three books all sitting there and I'm reading them all at the same time and that

724
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:29.180
makes them a little bit more interesting.

725
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:35.020
And the last thing I would say about trying to be focused on inpatient when

726
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:41.291
you're reading books is to try to really understand what it is that is happening

727
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:49.250
in the book.
Not just from a plot perspective,

728
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.870
but from a human perspective.
What is that person going through?

729
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.100
What is that like for that person?
What are they thinking?

730
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.580
And I get to a point where I'm so engaged,

731
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.100
I feel like I'm becoming the off.

732
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:06.170
I feel like I'm in the book sometimes when I'm reading it.

733
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.850
So that is another good way to keep it engaging.

734
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:13.490
Because if you're seeing it from the outside and you're not really in it,

735
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.910
well then it's not.
It's just not as engaging.
Simply put,

736
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.320
if you get into it and you start thinking about that person,
you go back,

737
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.860
you know,
do a little Wikipedia search on the author and see who they are.

738
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.840
That gives you like a little insight and that helps me.
Now I connect with them.

739
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:34.100
I know that they're from New Jersey.
I know that they went to this college.

740
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:36.830
I know that they played soccer.
So now when I'm reading about them and going,

741
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:38.360
oh yeah,
that must,
oh you know,

742
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:42.140
so I try and get a little background on that person gives me a little bit more

743
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:46.700
engagement.
That's that.
That's my reading habits.

744
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.000
It's kind of advanced and it makes more sense.

745
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:53.300
I think that like how you say you want to put yourself in the guy's head.

746
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.570
You know,
actively,
I'm going to consciously put myself in the,

747
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:59.800
in the guys that sometimes people are so good at writing where you,

748
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.020
that just happens naturally.
But when you do,
when you do that,

749
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:06.200
it's like you can kind of get,
you get the story of course.
But

750
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.360
most of the time you,
when you do that all the time,
it's lessons learned.

751
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:12.200
Like what do you learn?

752
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.170
It's almost like when you're in your head is in it like that.

753
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.440
All the lessons are just flying into your brain,
you know?

754
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.210
Cause it's almost like you're doing,
like you're,
you're going through that war,

755
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.170
that particular ambush or something like that.
And then,
you know,

756
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.990
they talk about the mistakes and all that.
But you feel that mistake.
Yeah.

757
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:30.920
And also

758
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.950
<v 1>I have some experience with what they're talking about.
Oh yeah.</v>

759
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.390
I'm not saying,
I mean I'm,
I'm telling you right now,

760
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:43.770
I don't have even close to the experience of the books that I'm reading on this

761
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:44.410
podcast.

762
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:49.410
These guys that were in the battle of Iwo Jima and the battle of the bulge,

763
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.290
no,
nothing.
I did compare to anything that they do.

764
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.670
But do I know what it's like to be waiting to go into a bad situation?

765
00:44:56.671 --> 00:44:59.200
Do I know what it's like to be shot at?
Do I know what it's like to have,

766
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.940
you know,
have guys getting wounded?
Yeah,
I know what that's like.

767
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.990
So that's a little connection too.
But I think you know,

768
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:11.130
everybody that's been in stressful situations of any kind,
you can say,
oh,

769
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:15.060
what must that feel like?
Hey,
I know what it's like when I was waiting to,

770
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.100
you know,
go in for a job interview.

771
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.040
And I was completely stressed out and that's what this guy must be feeling right

772
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:22.470
here.
Our only even worse.
So then you make that little Mecca,

773
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.110
mental connection is a little mental leap and you can look like you said,

774
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:29.700
you can then learn more from it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is important.
Yeah.

775
00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:33.360
So if I'm going into this particular situation,
you know,

776
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:36.870
in a book I'm reading it and I'm not as engaged as maybe I could be.

777
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.180
This guy goes through Xyz experience.

778
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.040
I'm looking at it from my opinion like well I could handle that,
you know,

779
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:43.800
kind of thing.

780
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.620
But this guy is the type of guy who that's may be part of his weakness or

781
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:51.060
something like that and vice versa where you know,
like I don't know,

782
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.250
something about claustrophobia.
I might be like,
Dang.

783
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.530
But that cluster for it will be a part of it.

784
00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.600
Part of the story isn't necessarily a huge part of the lesson that you're trying

785
00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:02.610
to get from it.
You know?
So you might miss,

786
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.030
there might be some disconnects there if you don't cause they have a certain

787
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:09.470
intention and you have a certain intention.
So if it's true,

788
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.990
the lesson lessons learned,
you might miss some of those lessons.

789
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.930
Just the feeling for sure.
Missing for sure.

790
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.450
I'm not going to get everything out of a book.
That's why when you,

791
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.670
that's why when you get a really good book,

792
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.020
you read it multiple times and you can get more out of it every single time that

793
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:27.690
you read it.
No doubt about that one.
You know it's true.

794
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.853
Next question.

795
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.960
Is it okay if extreme ownership sometimes feels inauthentic?

796
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.180
Example,
taking ownership of something,
not really your responsibility.

797
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.340
When does extreme ownership become excessive?
Self-Blaming okay,

798
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:50.580
so again,
this was two questions.

799
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:53.640
There was multiple questions like this on the interwebs.

800
00:46:55.050 --> 00:47:00.050
If extreme ownership fuels inauthentic or if you're taking ownership of

801
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:06.420
something that's not really your responsibility.
So yes,
there,

802
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:10.380
there is a chance that you're going too far.
However,

803
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.690
the chances are is that there really is something that you can do about it.

804
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.920
And too often people say,
well,
you know,
it's just,

805
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:22.560
it's just something I couldn't control,
for example,
right?

806
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.630
There's things that you have zero control over,
right?

807
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.420
And you could easily just say,
hey,

808
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.010
that we couldn't control

809
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.430
<v 0>that and therefore I can't take ownership of it for,
for like for instance,</v>

810
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.870
if we were planning an operation and the weather went bad and so now our

811
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:44.830
vehicles got stuck so we can say,
hey,
you know,
whether it got bad,

812
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.910
there's nothing I can do about it.
And that's,
people say,
well,
yeah,

813
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:51.220
you can't control the weather.
No human being can control the weather.

814
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.190
Well guess what?
You could make that excuse and be okay with it.

815
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.200
Guess what else you could do?
Hey,

816
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.850
I didn't have a good contingency plan for bad weather,
for rain.

817
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.800
We should have brought tow ropes with us.

818
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:05.110
We should have brought a winch with us so we could get out.

819
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.500
That's what I should've done.
I should've.
So yes,

820
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.980
even though it's really easy and it's like a 90% to just say,
hey,

821
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:13.480
it was bad weather or nothing I could do about it.

822
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.290
You could do something about it.
And,
and that's when,

823
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.890
when you start making those excuses,
they,
they're going to hurt you.

824
00:48:21.891 --> 00:48:25.330
The same thing in the business world,
right?
Oh,
well,
you know the market,
we can't,

825
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:28.400
I can't control the market,
right?
The market went down,
we weren't expecting,

826
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.880
could go down and now you know,

827
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.120
there's nothing we can do about it wasn't my fault.
Oh really?

828
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.900
Because what you could've done was diversify your income streams,

829
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.530
right?
You get a diversified your income stream.

830
00:48:42.531 --> 00:48:46.240
So you weren't riding 100% on this one segment of the market and now you're

831
00:48:46.241 --> 00:48:49.690
suffering.
But all you do is say,
well,
you know,
not my fault.
You know,

832
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:51.430
we can't control the market.
The market went down.

833
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.960
Well actually you can control your position,
right?

834
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.730
You control how you were set up strategically.
You didn't do that.

835
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.350
So when you do those things,
it's,

836
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.260
it's generally there is something you could have done about it.

837
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.660
There's generally something you could've done about it.

838
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.880
And so if it feels inauthentic,
sure.
Question Yourself,

839
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.290
but then say,
okay,
what could I have done about this?

840
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.120
And I would say this,
even when you're with your troops and you say,
look,

841
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.210
I didn't have full control of the market.
We,

842
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:26.530
I should have done this a little bit better.

843
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.490
We should have planned to diversify our income streams better.
I didn't do that.

844
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.560
Here's where we're at.
Here's what we're going to move forward.

845
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.350
The guys aren't going to say like,
Whoa,

846
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.980
hang you out to dry because you took ownership of that thing.

847
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:42.370
They're going to realize,
look he jock has taken ownership of that.
That's cool.

848
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.400
We did get shafted by the market and oh well lesson learned we're going to move

849
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:52.510
forward.
But when you just come in and say,
hey,
market went down,
not my fault.

850
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.510
You lose respect to your guys.
So no do that.

851
00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:58.270
Now all that being said,

852
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.500
is there situations where,

853
00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:07.501
or are there situations where extreme ownership actually does become excessive

854
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.710
self blaming?

855
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.130
And the answer is yes because there are certain situations where they're

856
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:15.880
actually is nothing that you could do.
So for example,

857
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.140
and this is a great example,

858
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.040
speaking of lessons learned from the book company commander that we just went

859
00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:22.810
over on the podcast,
Captain Mcdonald's,

860
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.410
they got assaulted,
buy

861
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v 1>like basically the entire German army and they were left to try and hold the</v>

862
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:40.640
line with pistols and rifles against tiger tanks.
Right?

863
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.000
An 88 millimeter guns and thousands and thousands of troops attacking them.

864
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.780
He could not have stopped them.

865
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:53.050
That you cannot stop a division of soldiers with a company of soldiers.

866
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.400
You can't do it.

867
00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.380
Especially when they have artillery and they have tanks and you don't have any

868
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:04.310
tank support.
It it's,
it's,
it's an unwinnable situation.

869
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.210
So for him to continually blame himself and say,

870
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:10.970
I should've planned better I could he could he say that?
Sure.

871
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.540
He did what he did with the information that he knew at the time.

872
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.220
If he would've known it was a division attack,

873
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.150
they would have set up differently.

874
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.710
He thought he was just setting up a typical defensive perimeter.
Right?

875
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:26.420
So can you get to a point where you're blaming yourself excessively?

876
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:28.180
Yes,
you can.
And you,

877
00:51:28.181 --> 00:51:32.630
you do need to be somewhat cognizant of that.
I'm going to tell you,

878
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:36.230
those cases are extremely rare,
extremely rare.

879
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.020
Most of the time you have a lot more control over your own destiny than you

880
00:51:39.021 --> 00:51:39.854
think you do.

881
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.900
And the worst thing you can do is continually say,
you know what?

882
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:47.240
This is one of those rare instances where I had no control.

883
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.960
It's probably not probably an instance where you did have control,

884
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.770
so keep it in the back of your mind,

885
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.860
but keeping the front of your mind ownership

886
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.820
seems like excessive self blaming.
That sounds like,
you know,

887
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:08.420
maybe someone who's fully blaming themselves and then like instead of taking

888
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:12.620
action to implement corrective measures,
something like this,
they're like,

889
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.930
I suck.
And maybe they go into a depression or something like that.
Yeah,

890
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:20.990
the gun shy,
I know what you're getting.
Yeah,
absolutely.
They dwell on it,
right?

891
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:22.190
They dwell on the mistake.

892
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:23.990
They dwell on the fact that things didn't go their way.

893
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:27.230
They dwell on the fact that it's their fault and now they're,
like you said,

894
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:32.080
gun shy.
That's great.
Up indecisive people get indecisive,
so no.
Yeah,

895
00:52:32.081 --> 00:52:34.970
those are great points.
You definitely don't want to do that.

896
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.830
Excessive ownership where it gets to a point where it turns you into a,

897
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.370
an indecisive person that's not going to make decisions because you're scared

898
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:45.560
you're going to fail.
You don't trust yourself anymore.
And yeah,

899
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:49.400
that's a great point.
That is excessive.
What you need to do is say,
okay,

900
00:52:49.401 --> 00:52:51.890
this was the problem,
this was my fault.
Here's what I'm gonna do to fix it.

901
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:54.980
I'm going to move on.
We can't dwell on the stuff that happened in the past.

902
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.570
Can't do it.
Great Point.
That,
um,
how you,
you know,

903
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:04.430
how early or how you've kind of started this where if you,

904
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.880
if you,
let's say,
okay,
the opposite.
Let's say you're a blamer,
right?
You're like,

905
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:09.380
oh,
something goes wrong and you blame someone.

906
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.900
If someone's blaming me for something,
for everything,
you know,
all the time,

907
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.530
of course,
you know,
the defense comes up and all this stuff.
That always happens.

908
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:23.270
But after a while they build that rep as being a blamer,
you know?
Oh,
for sure.

909
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:27.240
Now just,
it's starts to automatic that you're defensive against this guy.

910
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.540
You don't trust them all this stuff.
But the same kind of goes the opposite.

911
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.820
You know,
how like,
you know,

912
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.580
if someone's always taking responsibility for the whole deal,

913
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.040
they're not blaming you at all.
They were like,
no,
it was my fault.
No,

914
00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:40.530
it's my fault.
They're correcting it.
There you almost,

915
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.460
you have a bunch of stories like this where guys are like,
no,
it's my fault.
No,

916
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:46.350
it's my fault.
And they all want to jump in.
You know?

917
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:50.280
And so the point there is like after a while you build that rip where it's

918
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:54.540
automatic,
people will automatically not have any kind of defense or whatever.

919
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.250
They're automatically want to solve problems.
Yeah,
that's,

920
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.810
that's true to that rep man.
Building Trust is how you put it.

921
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.300
It is building trust.
It is indeed.

922
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:10.590
Interesting.
Next question.
What made you choose literature for your degree?

923
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:16.800
You know,
again,
I think I've answered this before probably a few times so I'll,

924
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:18.450
I'll keep it brief,
but people,

925
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:22.830
bunch of people did ask along those lines along a question along those lines.

926
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.680
The reason I wanted to become better at English,

927
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:33.681
and the reason I studied English in college is because I had seen the importance

928
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:39.450
of language in the military written and spoken.

929
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:41.790
So written,
you're doing evaluations,

930
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.880
you're writing and reading and receiving orders.

931
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:49.770
You're writing and receiving rules of engagement,
concept of operations,

932
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.930
awards,
field manual,

933
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:56.931
all of these things that you do in the military are written.

934
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.310
Either you're writing them or you're reading them.

935
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:02.940
So to be able to write well and to be able to read and understand well is very

936
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:07.140
important.
On top of that,
the spoken word,
you're doing briefings,

937
00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:11.850
you're giving op orders,
you're doing interviews,
or you're getting interviewed,

938
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:15.930
you're even doing like interrogations.
All of these things are spoken word.

939
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.570
So the better command you have of the English language,

940
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:24.270
the better you're gonna be at those.
And furthermore,

941
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:29.190
in that book that we read,
the Armed Forces officer,

942
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.840
1955 edition,
I think it is,
they,

943
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:35.880
I don't have the quote on me,

944
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:40.500
but leadership is communicating.
That's what it is.

945
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.940
It's communicating with other people what the idea is,
what the goal is.

946
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.630
So communication is the use of words.

947
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.820
So the better you can use words,

948
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.690
the better job you're going to do as a leader.

949
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.030
And that's what I realized when I was,

950
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:00.300
had the opportunity to go to college and got to pick my degree.

951
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:05.040
That's why I picked it.
Pretty simple.
Dig It.
Also,
it seems like when these,

952
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.930
once somebody,
your boss or your leader in whatever capacity,

953
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.200
you know,
like when someone misuses a word like,

954
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:16.430
or they'll say like they'll say Irregardless,
you know,
you don't want it.

955
00:56:16.431 --> 00:56:18.840
Something that like you,
you totally said that wrong after a while.

956
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:22.640
You kind of like that feeling that God disrespect this verse.

957
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.000
Well

958
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.760
<v 0>the guy,
he goes out on Facebook rant,
even if he's not your boss or something,</v>

959
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.910
he's on a Facebook or whatever [inaudible] it goes on this rant,

960
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.220
but then he's like misusing your in your,
you know,
or,
or,

961
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:38.230
or failing to put a period.
So,
you know,
it's like you almost,

962
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.140
it's almost like you have that feeling like you can't take him seriously.

963
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.790
You want them to take you,
which is important.
Yeah,
it is definitely important.

964
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.230
I mean not cause technically,

965
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:50.590
I mean really how much bearing does that really have?
If the idea is sound,

966
00:56:50.591 --> 00:56:53.140
but it just seems that at the same time it does.
And I'll tell you one thing,

967
00:56:53.141 --> 00:56:57.130
I'm not a good speller.
If it wasn't for spellcheck,

968
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.550
I'd spell all kinds of stuff wrong.
Yeah.
But see he never studied spelling.

969
00:57:00.551 --> 00:57:02.050
Cause when I was a kid I wasn't,

970
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.990
cause that's when you learn to spell I think was when you're a kid.

971
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.660
I didn't pay much attention to spelling or never have.

972
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:12.780
So just the fact that you care though,
that's like the major part of it.
You know,

973
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.830
you're like okay there's spell check.
Yeah.

974
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.780
And one thing that's cool is by the way,

975
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.630
you don't need to major in English to get good at writing a good,

976
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:20.560
a good a communicating.

977
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:25.590
You can major in anything as long as you be nice to take a couple courses

978
00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:29.230
though.
Cause when you do start diving in,

979
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.940
and I'll tell you Shakespeare's a big one,

980
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:34.120
when you start diving into understanding Shakespeare for real,

981
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.860
you really learn how to read well.
You really learn how to read well.

982
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:44.310
And when you submit papers that are being graded by somebody that is a

983
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.770
master with grammar and they're picking you apart,

984
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.140
you learn how to write better,
there's no doubt about it.

985
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:57.100
And so that's why I enjoyed both those,

986
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.140
both those aspects,

987
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:04.170
both reading and truly understanding stuff and writing and be graded in such a

988
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:08.440
way that someone's saying,
hey,
you didn't need to use this word.

989
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.950
You could have shortened this sentence.
And,

990
00:58:10.951 --> 00:58:14.410
and basically everyone's goal is to make things cleaner and shorter.

991
00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:19.411
Most of the time clarity though is to me the most important factor.

992
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:25.900
I want to make sure that what I'm saying is very clear.

993
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.750
So yeah,
English,

994
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.490
I took a class called advanced grammar and syntax dig it and I just,

995
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.470
I just,
I would've,
I would've,
I would've taken,
you know,

996
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:41.170
multiple classes if they had,
they only had one.
Those all you,
yeah,
yeah.

997
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.960
That was one of the best things I,
I did was when,

998
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.990
cause my guys had to write evaluations.
The guys,

999
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.360
my subordinate leadership would have to write evaluations when I was at the,

1000
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:53.710
it happens my whole career,
but once I became an officer,

1001
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.290
but when I was at the training command,

1002
00:58:56.890 --> 00:59:00.100
I had a hundred guys or so,
probably more than that,

1003
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:04.660
but everyone had to have an evaluation written.
And so it was the senior guys,

1004
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.460
the senior leader,
my subordinate leadership,

1005
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:09.580
my direct subordinate leadership that would write their evaluations.

1006
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.190
And so if you didn't police these guys up in the get go,
there'd be issues.

1007
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.190
So I brought him in and I said,
hey,

1008
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:20.740
bring me your best evaluation of your best guy.

1009
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:25.120
<v 1>And so they brought them in,
we put them up on the screen and I'd murdered.</v>

1010
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:30.590
I murdered them all and it was so good because they all got so much out of it.

1011
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:33.410
You probably need to go through that drill like one time,

1012
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:37.360
maybe two times of someone murdering your writing because all you do is you

1013
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:41.130
start off,
you just read their sentence to them.
That's all you do is just,

1014
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.080
you just read their sentence,
just what they have written and read it.

1015
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.730
And they go and you say,
is that what you're trying to say?
And they go,
no,
no,

1016
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.030
I just stopped.
Stop.
You know,
we'll,
I'll go back.

1017
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.430
Because a lot of times when you read something aloud to yourself,

1018
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:54.770
you recognize how jacked up you wrote it.
Yeah.

1019
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.630
So that's like lesson number one in writing with more clarity.

1020
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.600
Just read your sentences and see what they sound like.

1021
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.800
So you can't really read your own though,
right?
Because when you read your own,

1022
01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.400
you know exactly what you were saying,

1023
01:00:08.401 --> 01:00:13.401
you know you can read your own butt and that will be helpful.

1024
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.331
But yeah,

1025
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:17.300
sometimes you'll already have an idea in your head so you won't get the full

1026
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:20.970
benefit of having someone else read it aloud to you remember the last picture.

1027
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.443
So yeah,

1028
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:27.830
English is definitely important and it is fun too.

1029
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:32.090
I enjoy one of the odd things,
like for Twitter,

1030
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.550
I have fun fitting something into 140 characters.
That's enjoyable to me.

1031
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:40.310
I know that's like a twisted thing.
So like a little puzzle.
Yeah,

1032
01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:42.410
it's a little puzzle.
And now walk up work,
could I use it?

1033
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:45.620
Maybe I could pick a kid in there.
That's kind of fun for me.

1034
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:49.700
Like there was something that had that kind of fun in some of the English

1035
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.760
classes that I took where I was trying to just get the perfect words.

1036
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.770
And so there's a little puzzle to,
it's a lot of fun.
It can be fun.

1037
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.020
It can be fun if you have that type of personality.
Yeah.

1038
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:02.330
Interestingly you're not,
I don't find you to be a grammar Nazi.

1039
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:03.943
No,

1040
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.950
I wouldn't say I'm a grammar Nazi much because I just don't think I'm an overt

1041
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.920
grammar Nazis.
I think.
I think I find it,

1042
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.880
I think I kind of just say,
oh yeah,
that's,
that's poorly written

1043
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.920
code myself.
I mean,

1044
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.730
unless it's someone that is going to turn something in and I just have to say,

1045
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:27.170
hey man,
this is not good.

1046
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.650
So which technically that's not being a grammar Nazi grandma.

1047
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.150
Nothing was like me.
And you are,
I'm telling you about,
you know,

1048
01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.420
you get through something or be the beach and you're like,

1049
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.480
you know I correct you.
Yeah,
I don't,
yeah,

1050
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:43.481
I don't do that a lot because you know why partially then not only is it not

1051
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:47.470
cool,
but it's a conversation.
Right.
Yeah.

1052
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:51.110
And I was going to say something about like being informed the streets,

1053
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.230
which is a major exaggeration cause I'm not from the streets,

1054
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:58.490
although I spent some time in the streets.
But you know,

1055
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.270
I,
I enjoy language.
Right.

1056
01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.560
I enjoy language.
And so when somebody speaks in properly,

1057
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:10.280
I actually like it.
It's a different,
it's a different thing.
I mean,

1058
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:13.910
even Cormac Mccarthy,
probably my favorite writer,
he doesn't,

1059
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.990
he does all kinds of crazy things.
He doesn't use a lot of punctuation.

1060
01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:21.440
He doesn't use quotes.
So you're dealing with a whole nother ballgame.

1061
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:25.410
I'm not slamming him and,
and,
and honestly,

1062
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.430
it makes it harder in many cases.
It makes it harder to read what he's written.

1063
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.180
Yeah.
And He,
you know,
people say,
well,
he says,
you know,
that it,
it should,

1064
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:35.420
you shouldn't need quotations.
So sometimes you need them.
Yeah.

1065
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.170
But I'm not going to sit here and criticize core Mac.
Yeah.

1066
01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.690
Do it brought that makes so much that I never thought about that.
How you,

1067
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.160
how do things actually where yeah,
you like it.

1068
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:50.160
Like there's these means and they're the,
their sole funny.

1069
01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:52.410
We're able to just have a picture,
maybe familiar,
maybe not,

1070
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:55.290
and then it'll have like some,
you know,
a little thing on top of it,
you know,

1071
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.200
like how,
how or when she goes through your phone,
I don't know,

1072
01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:02.400
something like that.
And a lot of those memes are just no grammar.
No,

1073
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:04.890
it's almost like it's just an ignorant person wrote it,
you know?

1074
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.210
And it makes it way more funny.

1075
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.740
So overall the point there is like people talk talking pigeon or something like

1076
01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:13.650
that or with a crazy accent,
their English doctor,

1077
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:17.760
it can be more enjoyable experience.
It's a more in depth experience for sure.

1078
01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.820
And so there's that.
Um,
and uh,

1079
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.460
but at the same time there are a few,

1080
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:28.530
there's certain situations where if you misuse a comma or misuse or don't put

1081
01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:29.550
quotes or something like that,

1082
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:33.660
you can literally say something different then there misunderstandings can kind

1083
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:35.820
of creep in.
People ask me about,

1084
01:03:35.821 --> 01:03:40.020
I hate to bring this up right now cause this is just like a blood bath argument,

1085
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.720
but the Oxford Comma,

1086
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.800
which you can look at in the Inter webs.

1087
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.800
But it's basically when you say a list of things,

1088
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.350
the last thing that you're going to say,

1089
01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:56.770
which normally you say and this use the Oxford Comma,

1090
01:03:56.771 --> 01:03:58.680
is you put a comma before that,
AMD.

1091
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:02.580
And for me it makes things very,
very clear.

1092
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:06.180
And the reason some people don't use it,
it came from the new,

1093
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:10.410
I think it came from newspaper,
where they're trying to,
you know,

1094
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:13.080
fit stuff into column and they can fit stuff in the newspaper.
So they say,
Hey,

1095
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:15.540
we can get rid of that comment is not needed.
That's kind of where it started.

1096
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:20.880
But it's not proper.
And a,
sometimes it makes sense,

1097
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.700
but a lot of times it doesn't.
So anyways,
that's one small example.

1098
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:25.830
And the other funny thing,
because I was talking about Cormac Mccarthy,

1099
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:28.410
I'm going to say this little thing too,
because it reminded me of it.

1100
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:33.830
Another thing in the success magazine interview or article wasn't interviews an

1101
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:37.410
article.
He said,
uh,

1102
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.470
the writer who's a good dude,
he said,

1103
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:44.850
Jocko rarely does interviews.
Right?

1104
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:49.650
And that's when Tim Ferriss said that two years ago,

1105
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.110
Tim Ferriss was 100% correct.

1106
01:04:52.111 --> 01:04:55.020
Because I had done zero interviews so he could have said,

1107
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.580
and he's never done an interview before.

1108
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:58.710
Tim Ferriss blood would have been speaking the truth.

1109
01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:01.770
And he was at the time since then,

1110
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.660
I don't know how many freaking interviews I have done.

1111
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.870
I have done interview upon interview upon interview about an interview.

1112
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:11.220
It's ridiculous.

1113
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:16.910
And I put in my little Facebook rebuttal to the argument or to,

1114
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.590
or my,
my comments about the or corrections to the article.
I said,

1115
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.330
I actually do interviews all the time.

1116
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.890
If you want someone that rarely does interviews,
that's Cormac McCarthy.

1117
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:33.640
Cause Cormac Mccarthy,
he doesn't do interviews.

1118
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.920
He does.
He's got what?

1119
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:39.430
I think he's done one interview in the past 20 years with Oprah Winfrey.

1120
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:43.820
That's it.
20 years.
One of the most,
uh,
you know,

1121
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:47.530
one of the best writers of our,
of our time living today.
You know,

1122
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:52.300
is he going to come on the podcast?
Nope,
he's not.
He,
he rarely comes on podcast.

1123
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.720
He should,
he should come on this podcast.
I agree.

1124
01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.200
But yeah,
also if you,

1125
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:02.530
if you see a lot of misused grammar and you let it go and you see a lot of it,

1126
01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:05.230
you get better at understanding it.
You know?
You know how like,

1127
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.560
you know how certain people,
they'd be like,
oh,
this guy's accent is too thick.

1128
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.530
You know,
I can't understand them.
Meanwhile,
the guy next to you was like,
oh,

1129
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:13.720
I heard that accent before.
Plenty Times.
You know,

1130
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:18.130
my neighbor is Jamaican or whatever.
So they understand.

1131
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:21.190
It's kind of like that idea,
you know,
people misusing words,

1132
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.560
grammar all messed up.
But if you're used to that,
you're like,
oh,

1133
01:06:23.561 --> 01:06:25.660
I see what they're saying.
It has a lot to do with context as well,

1134
01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:27.880
but I'm just saying if you're familiar with that situation,

1135
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:31.480
so it kind of expands your mind to allow people to use bad grammar.

1136
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.300
That's not to say you should use bad grammar.
I'm just saying from,

1137
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.690
from the standpoint of understanding,
I could see where you're coming from.

1138
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:40.720
I'm not sure that I would like completely buy into that,

1139
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.080
but we'll go with it for this kings down time.
All good.

1140
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.530
Well you're right in the fact that some people can understand accents really

1141
01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:51.310
well.
Yeah.
And for me it depends on the accent.
So I'm accents,
I can understand,

1142
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:53.840
find some accidents.
I can't.
Yeah,
and it has to do with what,

1143
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:56.500
what you're familiar with.
Yes.
Yes you are correct.

1144
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.980
Next question,
Jocko.

1145
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.980
What do you think about mechanical warrior robots in the seal teams?

1146
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.710
Again,
this is,

1147
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.400
this is a question where people ask me this because there's weird hype and uh,

1148
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.880
what's the word,
conspiracy type attitude about,

1149
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.930
you know,
artificial intelligence and robots and all that.

1150
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:31.480
And so my thoughts are robots like war fighting robots.
Awesome.

1151
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:36.660
Let's build the most awesome destruction robots and let's build an army of them

1152
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.610
and let's let him get after it.
I think it's awesome.

1153
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:46.960
You look at what's happening right now with drones and unmanned air vehicles.

1154
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.150
That's where we're going in another,
I forget the name.
I mean,
I mean,

1155
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.640
I forget the specific timeframe,
but in 10,
20,
30 years,

1156
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:59.230
there's not going to be anymore manned fighter jets,

1157
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:01.510
military fighter jets.
So why would you do that?

1158
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:04.840
You can put a computer in there and you can fly it from the ground or you can,

1159
01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:07.510
you don't even need to cry it.
It'll do what your mission that you want it to do.

1160
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:12.870
So when we can come up with a robot that a terminator robot that can go and

1161
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:18.890
attack and take care of the problem,
yeah,
let's do that.
I support it.

1162
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:23.240
I hated the whole idea that robots will turn against us.

1163
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.550
We'll build better robots that will kill those robots.

1164
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.720
I'm not worried about that.
Fight the robots.
Yeah.
I don't care.
I say bring it on.

1165
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:32.790
Bring on the robots.
Yeah,
I'll cross you.
Yes,
tiff.

1166
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:37.220
I know Joe Rogan give you freaking out about some robots,
you know,

1167
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:40.160
and I think you know,
pretty much everybody,

1168
01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.560
I'm probably the ignorant person here,
right?

1169
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:47.330
Because the smart people like Elon Musk and Sam Harris,

1170
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.740
they're all,
you know,

1171
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:51.410
you gotta watch out because this artificial intelligence is going to become

1172
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:52.910
smarter than us.
And then when are we going to do,

1173
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.880
it's going to attack us and control us.
Yeah.
There are things.
If,
if,

1174
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:59.900
if it winds up that they ultimately figure out and they won't be wrong,

1175
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.740
that's the,
that's the view.
If they figure out that they don't need us,

1176
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:09.010
then the logical thing would be to eliminate us like,

1177
01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:11.800
like everybody and everything does ever,
you know,

1178
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:16.280
I got to admit like that sounds pretty cool.
I say bring it.

1179
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:20.300
I want that robot war.
Let's get it on.
Well typically robots,

1180
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.710
I mean we say unmanned.
Hey,
I got a question for you.
How about we unplug them?

1181
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.550
Right.
Cut Their power source.
Yeah,
but typically,

1182
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:32.800
I mean even that when you,
you know,
I don't think it,
I think there's,

1183
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.620
I think that's a simple thing for a robot.

1184
01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:40.790
If they're smart to understand,
oh,
they might very well cut our power source,

1185
01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:42.290
so they're going to figure that out pretty quick.

1186
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:43.340
I would imagine if they're turning,

1187
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:47.120
but I liked the way Sam Harris described artificial intelligence one time
though.

1188
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.600
He said,
imagine that you,

1189
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:55.750
that I ask you a question and then you have a year to go and research and come

1190
01:09:57.411 --> 01:10:01.130
up with the perfect answer and then you come back and you answered that
question.

1191
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.380
But it happens in a millisecond.
That's what a computer is gonna be able to do.

1192
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:06.190
Yeah.
And that's pretty awesome.
Yeah.

1193
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.920
And do they end up then and I don't,
I,
you know,
I'm not a,

1194
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:12.860
I don't even know what you'd call a person that fear rises about this kind of

1195
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:14.240
thing.
I'm not one of them,

1196
01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.110
but that's pretty unbelievable.

1197
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.330
And it'll only get faster and better from there.
I just think that,

1198
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:28.810
I don't think it's too hard to control to put controls in there that prevent the

1199
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:32.840
turning of the robots,
like preventative mechanisms.

1200
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:38.530
Well you talked about unmanned stuff and you know what I'm about to make a

1201
01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:42.950
movie,
reference it,
elbow cop,
robocop,
old school.

1202
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.520
I think the story of that had some kind of a mechanism there.

1203
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:53.430
Directives that derived from direct prime directive wasn't allowed to kill.
Wait,

1204
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.870
what's this?
A prime directive.
What's that?
From death from robocop.
I think so.

1205
01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.510
I know they're up.
Uphold the law,
protect the incident.

1206
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.010
I'm not doing it in an order.
Um,
something about trust.
See,
if you were Ai,

1207
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.680
you'd be able to come back with a perfect answer.
I know,

1208
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.810
but you program in that you can't hurt humans or whatever.
Right?

1209
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.260
Whatever.
Like I over this thing,
let's,
let's,

1210
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:21.180
this is another situation.
Let's see where it goes.
I'm good.
Rock and roll.

1211
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.730
What the unmet that,
I mean,
it's based on like patterns,
you know,

1212
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:25.410
so the unmanned thing,

1213
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.920
usually you're not going to find something that's really technically unmanned.

1214
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:31.770
Even a drone is that unmanned?
It's just less makeup can be,

1215
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.580
it's just less mess somebody.
Well yeah,
somebody programmed at where to go.

1216
01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:38.640
But you can put a drone in the sky that's going to go,
yeah,
but see what you say.

1217
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:41.980
You can put,
someone's got to put them in in the sky.
Someone's got to launch,

1218
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.430
somebody got,
so it's going to be mad.

1219
01:11:43.431 --> 01:11:47.250
Like the intentions of something like that first intention of something that's

1220
01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:51.270
going to be manned for sure.
Once you give that up,
then you're like,
okay,
Nah,

1221
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:54.480
you got some problems.
Yeah.
Again,

1222
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.270
I'm just not sitting around worrying about this kind of thing.

1223
01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:02.630
So I'll let Joe Rogan and Sam Harris and Ilan mosque worry about keeping the

1224
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:07.200
robots in line.
You know what?
I'll be ready to,

1225
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.820
I'll be ready to fight them if they,
if they need me bring it.
Yup,

1226
01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:17.360
sure.
Next question.
Unless you want to talk about robot some more.

1227
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:21.960
No,
that's cool.
Okay.
Or robocop.
No.
See even robocop was man,

1228
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.800
he was a man apartment part moment.

1229
01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.890
That big machine that the initial one that caused the problems.
Who?

1230
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.760
Ed Two oh nine the the thing that looks like a,

1231
01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.960
it had big legs.
Two Oh nine man malfunctioning or malfunction.

1232
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.050
You have four seconds to comply.
You have three seconds to comply.

1233
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.920
You have two seconds to comply.
Hey,
shut it off for seven year.
Watched that Bro.

1234
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:51.630
That was Dallas tenseful.
That was a harsh scene.
Oh he loved it though.

1235
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.630
Yeah.
Savage doing

1236
01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.260
Jocko.
What's your favorite submission?

1237
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:03.360
Real again,

1238
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.500
trying to do a little rapid fire here cause people ask me this all the time.

1239
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:11.250
Favorite submissions cause I gotta go plural on that one.

1240
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.340
Bra come here and Guillotine.
Those are my two favorites.
Emissions.

1241
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:18.440
I think the reason why is because they're both really effective.

1242
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:22.080
[inaudible] and Nogi.
They're both really effective

1243
01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:27.150
from the bottom right.
You can do them from the top,

1244
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.520
you can do them from half guard,
you can do them from mount,

1245
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.050
you can do them from a lot of different positions.
You can do them in the street,

1246
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:37.920
you can do them in Emma MMA and you can do them in Jujitsu.

1247
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:41.850
So I just liked the fact that there are kind of universal positions and very

1248
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:45.490
effective in every aspect of Jujitsu.
Yeah.

1249
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.753
Yeah.
Those are good.

1250
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.470
I'd go for the rear naked choke to rear naked choke for sure.
Yeah.

1251
01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:54.930
Those are ones that you don't,
um,
like

1252
01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.130
they're big.
They're like Granddad,
there's a few of them.

1253
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.340
They're the granddaddy submissions.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1254
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:06.810
And you could say ArmorLoc is one of the granddaddies I just find the community

1255
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:11.250
to be a higher percentage move.
Right.
Right now?
Lately,

1256
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.980
my last several years I've been using more straight arm locks again.

1257
01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.870
But like arm bar that is the straight arm?
Both.
Yeah,

1258
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:23.890
both because all my training partners are so good at defending my computers.
Yes.

1259
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.160
That I have to go to alternate moves.
Yeah.

1260
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.960
Actually I surprised you the other day with a,

1261
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.310
you were kind of like you were kind of depressed to you remember what I'm

1262
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:36.080
talking about cause you like take a few weeks ago it was,

1263
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.710
it was probably more than that,
but I remember your reaction.

1264
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:41.040
Your reaction was sort of,
yeah,

1265
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.280
like I can't believe he got me with an arm bar and I even like made it like a

1266
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.610
comment.
Yeah.
You're getting the role like when you were going for him I like,

1267
01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.090
yeah.
And it's,
it kind of seemed like you turn up,

1268
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:54.250
turn up the heat when I said Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1269
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:57.270
I don't like when people challenge that Jerry shout in church.

1270
01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:03.580
All right.
Yeah,
those are good.
I agree.
Next question,

1271
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.073
Jacqueline,

1272
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.000
you discuss making sure your teams have the freedom to make strategic changes to

1273
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:11.230
the plan if needed.

1274
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.350
What if you're developing a system with your team and you begin to get pushed

1275
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:20.200
back from them before you feel the core values are established.

1276
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:25.840
So this is a really good question.
Once again,

1277
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.470
you start coming up with your plan and you're already starting to get some

1278
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:33.910
pushback from the boys on what it is.
Well,
what do you do?
Listen to them.

1279
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:38.710
Listen to them.
Why are they pushing back?
You know what I mean?

1280
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:43.030
Why are they pushing back?
Maybe they have some good points.
Is that possible?

1281
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.240
Maybe you're a little bit off base on the plan that you're coming up with or the

1282
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.860
strategy that you're coming up with.
Maybe you're not.

1283
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.380
Of course that's always possible to,
maybe they're wrong and you're right,

1284
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.880
but hear them out.
You know,
if I say,
hey,

1285
01:15:57.881 --> 01:16:00.370
we're going to hit the target from this direction here,

1286
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:04.720
and my team disagrees with what I'm saying,
well,
why are the disagree?
What's,

1287
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:09.230
what's the reason for that?
You know,
how do they think we should do it today?

1288
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.410
She think we should come in from the,
from the south,

1289
01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:12.400
and I think we should come from the north.

1290
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:16.450
Why do they think that now if I know something is right,

1291
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.190
<v 3>okay,</v>

1292
01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:22.840
<v 1>and I am right,
then guess what?
I can explain it to them and they'll say,</v>

1293
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.480
oh,
Jocko,
we didn't know that.

1294
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.960
We didn't know that there was defenses that we hadn't been told about to the

1295
01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:30.970
south and why.
That's why we should come into the north door.

1296
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:33.460
We didn't know that the sun would be bad,
are back from the north.

1297
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:35.620
And that's why we didn't know that at the time.

1298
01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:39.610
So you're right now,

1299
01:16:39.611 --> 01:16:41.410
if I can't explain it to them,

1300
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.460
if our kid give them a reason why my strategy or my plan is better,

1301
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.820
then there's something wrong with my plan or there's something wrong with my

1302
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:52.510
ability to explain it to them.
Right?

1303
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.630
So if you're doing the right things for the right reasons,

1304
01:16:55.631 --> 01:16:59.590
you'll be able to convince your team of the strategy or of the plan.

1305
01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:00.730
And if you can't,

1306
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:06.910
it's a hint that maybe you need to adapt your strategy or maybe you need to

1307
01:17:06.911 --> 01:17:09.980
adapt your plan.
Now be advised,

1308
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.670
<v 0>this is not easy.
This is not easy to do.</v>

1309
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.880
First of all,
you have to get your ego in check,
right?

1310
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:19.580
Because you think you've come up with a plan and you think it's the master plan.

1311
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:23.810
So you,
you,
you have to put your ego in check the secondly,

1312
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.000
you might actually have the best plan,

1313
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.240
but maybe you don't have the ability to articulate the nuances of the plan.

1314
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:34.040
And so your guys,

1315
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.300
you get a guy that's a really articulate guy that's arguing with you on his plan

1316
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.750
and he's actually winning the argument even though your plan might be better.

1317
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.780
That's a,
that's a tough situation to be in.

1318
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:49.781
So that means you've got to really get in the weeds.

1319
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:54.500
Now,
one thing that you could do in that situation,
they say,
Hey,
I'm in charge.

1320
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:59.180
Shut up.
Listen to me.
And again,

1321
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:01.460
this might be a situation where you're right and they're wrong,

1322
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.850
but if you can't articulate that properly and now you only way to do it is to

1323
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:08.510
pull rank on them.
Hey,
you're going to go backwards,
right?

1324
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.400
You're going to go backwards.
So you have to be very careful of that.
Again,

1325
01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:14.840
this is why it's important to,

1326
01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.590
to have good command of the English language.

1327
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.150
That's why it's important to listen.

1328
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:25.270
That's why it's important to take people's ideas and that's the thing with being

1329
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:26.474
a leader.
Okay?

1330
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.770
Have an open mind,
have open ears,
listen,

1331
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.700
communicate and lead your team not by rank,

1332
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:43.870
right?
But by being able to,

1333
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:50.020
to discern and uncover and mold and shape the best possible plan in the best

1334
01:18:52.101 --> 01:18:57.101
possible strategy by and through understanding everyone's perspectives and

1335
01:18:58.731 --> 01:18:59.660
ideas,

1336
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:05.060
and then taking all those perspectives and all those ideas and coordinating them

1337
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:10.090
into a unified fought that leads the team to victory.

1338
01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.090
That is hard.
That is hard to do.

1339
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:19.790
But the minute,
again,
the minute that I'm telling somebody,
hey,
no,

1340
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.490
just do it my way.
I know that there's,

1341
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.310
there's something wrong here either I'm not articulating right,

1342
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:30.260
which means I should take the time because if I'm right and you're wrong,

1343
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.870
we should be able to get there to where you see that.
Yeah.

1344
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.050
We should be able to get there.

1345
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:40.100
We could also get to a point where it's six in one half dozen.
The other right.

1346
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.070
We could get to that point too.
And at that point,
you know what I'm going to do.

1347
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.320
You know what I'm going to do?
We're going to use your plan.

1348
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:49.490
If it's six one half dozen,
the other,
I'm going to use your plan.
Yeah.
Echo says,

1349
01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:51.920
come in from the north.
I say come in from the West.

1350
01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.870
We look at the pros and cons of each.
I'm going to go with your plan.

1351
01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.360
What'd you want to come in from the West?
Yeah.
Okay.
If it's,

1352
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.600
if it's 50 50 I'm going to go with your plan.
I'm going to give it to you.

1353
01:20:02.601 --> 01:20:05.870
I'm gonna give you the ownership.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.

1354
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.010
Even I'll tell

1355
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:12.150
<v 1>you,
even 60 40 I'm probably going to give it to you.</v>

1356
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:16.350
We get to,
you know,
70 30 now you're going to see it.

1357
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.310
You're going to see the light.
If you have any brain now,

1358
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:24.150
you could also be an EGOMANIAC,
right?
Who's at my way,
my way,
my way.

1359
01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.910
Now we've got to break through that.
How do we do that?

1360
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.680
It's not by attacking your plan,

1361
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:32.910
which you're going to defend because you're an EGOMANIAC.
Instead,

1362
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:35.070
I'm going to say,
well,
tell me the benefits of your plan.

1363
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.900
Let's wait it out between the year plan and my plan.

1364
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:39.270
Maybe we adapt your plan a little bit.
Oh,
I like what you did here.

1365
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:40.980
I see where you're coming from.
That's a really good point.

1366
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:45.810
I didn't think of that.
But also we need to consider this that I didn't.

1367
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.420
You know we we didn't know before.
So now we got to adjust.

1368
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.520
So those are the things that are hard.

1369
01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.760
Those are the things that are hard about being a leader.

1370
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:57.450
But the best thing you can do,
open your mind,
open your ears,

1371
01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:00.120
listen to what people are saying.
Take it on board.

1372
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.620
If their plan is better than yours,
great.
Use it.
If it's not better than yours.

1373
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.360
Okay.
Articulate the reasons why.
Have the conversations with them.

1374
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:13.860
Don't be scared.
It's a slick move.
I,
I didn't think of that.

1375
01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.290
You
got to build up their ego.
If they've got the big ego,

1376
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:24.120
we got to flank them.
So
yeah,

1377
01:21:24.121 --> 01:21:24.954
that's good.

1378
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:30.030
Get other people's perspectives because it can seem like a 50 50 or it can seem

1379
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:33.490
like
60 40 you know,

1380
01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:38.610
but it can also seem like a 64 or 70 30 year plan is better.

1381
01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:41.910
But to them 70 30 they're planets better because of their perspective.

1382
01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:46.210
Let's say they,
they,
there's rats drawn down this trail.
Yeah,
I don't like rats.

1383
01:21:46.211 --> 01:21:49.540
But if you didn't know that,
you know,
you're like frats who cares kind of thing,

1384
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.160
you know?
Dang.

1385
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:54.960
Well you're advanced dogs would be a better thing to say.

1386
01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:58.150
Rats aren't going to interfere with your mission.
Dogs start barking.

1387
01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.760
And maybe they had,
they had somebody,

1388
01:22:00.761 --> 01:22:04.210
they read an Intel report that said there was a bunch of dogs up in this,
this,

1389
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:07.930
you know,
residents to the north.
So we want to come in from the West.

1390
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.660
And I didn't know that I didn't do good enough.
So now it's easy,

1391
01:22:10.661 --> 01:22:12.940
easy thing to convince me off,
right?
Yeah.

1392
01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:16.510
But all we have to do is have the conversation.
Yeah,
understand the perspective,

1393
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.130
talk and communicate those dogs with teeth.

1394
01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.120
Put your egos in check or snakes.
By the way,

1395
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:25.840
if you're an Indiana Jones or something like this.
Next question

1396
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:32.043
<v 3>Jocko,</v>

1397
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:36.830
<v 1>have you encountered any gaps in the leadership capabilities of officers from</v>

1398
01:22:36.831 --> 01:22:39.890
West Point or the other academy?
Okay,

1399
01:22:39.891 --> 01:22:43.010
so for those of you who don't know what the service academies are,

1400
01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.000
there's west point,

1401
01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:47.560
there's a naval academy which gives you navy and Marine Corps officers.

1402
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:48.840
West Point gives you army officers.

1403
01:22:48.841 --> 01:22:52.850
The Air Force Academy gives you air force officers and the Coast Guard Academy

1404
01:22:52.851 --> 01:22:57.470
gives you coast guard officers there for years.
Their military school,

1405
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.930
they're really hard to get into.
They're extremely competitive.

1406
01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:03.980
They have massive amount of tradition at all of them and they are highly

1407
01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:05.530
disciplined and horror.
Hard to get through.

1408
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.840
<v 0>So
you would think,</v>

1409
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:16.620
right that what I just said would produce a and a standard of very high standard

1410
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:22.690
of an outstanding officer.
The fact of the matter is in my career,

1411
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.370
it really makes no difference because there's other ways that you can have

1412
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:32.230
officers,
other avenues that officers come from.
They can come from ROTC,

1413
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:35.830
which is when you know you go to a regular college and you basically take

1414
01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:39.490
classes about being an officer and you get shown how to wear a uniform and all

1415
01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:42.850
that.
You can go to ocs,
which is when you graduate from college,

1416
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:46.540
you go to a program for 13 weeks or however long.

1417
01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:50.680
Each service has a little bit different in the,
in the navy.
For me,
I went to ocs,

1418
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:54.340
it was 13 weeks.
That was after being enlisted for eight years.
You know,

1419
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:55.780
you can be a prior enlisted guy like me,

1420
01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.700
which is you get your commission after you've been in the military and so all

1421
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.940
those,
I've,

1422
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:05.941
I had outstanding officers or I work with outstanding officers from each one of

1423
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:11.140
those commissioning sources.
I had outstanding Naval Academy guys,

1424
01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.610
outstanding westpoint guys,
outstanding ROTC guys,

1425
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:20.740
outstanding ocs guys.
Just outstanding us,
great leaders.

1426
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.210
And guess what?
I also had crap leaders that were from the academy,

1427
01:24:25.211 --> 01:24:29.110
crap leaders that were from west point crap leaders that were from ocs,

1428
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:33.760
crap leaders that from ROTC so and crap.
And by the way,
probably the,

1429
01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.080
the biggest

1430
01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:40.870
example of the disparity of good and bad is prior enlisted.

1431
01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:43.690
So prior enlisted means that you were an enlisted grunt,

1432
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.960
a front frontline trooper in the seal teams are in,

1433
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.080
in the military and then you get your commission.
That's what I did.

1434
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.470
And I had great officers that were like that.

1435
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:57.910
And I also knew horrible authors that were like that.
So for me,

1436
01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:01.690
it doesn't really matter what your commissioning sources,
it,

1437
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.710
it matters who you are as a person and who you are as leader.

1438
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.800
And if you have those characteristics that make you a good leader,

1439
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.500
if you're humble,
if you listen,
if you're dynamic,
if you're articulate,

1440
01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:17.890
all those things that make a good leader,
if you have them,

1441
01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.890
it doesn't really matter your commissioning source if you,

1442
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:24.250
and if you don't have them,
doesn't really matter your commissioning source.

1443
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.210
That's what I've experienced in my time.

1444
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:33.490
So it is interesting.
I thought when I first joined the military,

1445
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:38.440
I thought these guys that came from the Naval Academy that I'm going to work

1446
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:39.400
with in the seal teams,

1447
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:44.790
they're going to be really awesome because they went to four years of leadership

1448
01:25:44.951 --> 01:25:49.840
training and learning how to lead.
And I mean Brian stands a great example,

1449
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.180
right?
You could hear he'd got a lot out of the,

1450
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:56.890
out of the naval academy a ton.
Just the way he talked about it.

1451
01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:03.930
I bet that Brian Stan would be an outstanding officer if he went to the Naval

1452
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.370
Academy.
If you went to ocs or if we went to ROTC.

1453
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.020
It's just he's got a great you,
did he learn lessons there?
Yes,

1454
01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:16.850
but he had an open mind to learn those things.
And so yeah,
you know,
the,

1455
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:18.630
the,
the,
the service academies are,

1456
01:26:18.631 --> 01:26:23.540
are definitely awesome and re really great tradition in all those.

1457
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.130
But you know,

1458
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:28.640
I don't think you need to go to a service academy to be a good officer.

1459
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.380
And I don't think it really matters what matters is what kind of leader in

1460
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:35.690
person you are.
Is that the kind of deal where

1461
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.990
you just never know who you're going to get at the end.

1462
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:41.620
Because some people they're really good at I,
you know,

1463
01:26:41.621 --> 01:26:44.330
all these people they'll get really good grades but out in the field they'd do

1464
01:26:44.331 --> 01:26:48.710
substandard performance wise cause cause they're good at getting good grades or

1465
01:26:48.711 --> 01:26:52.400
they're good at taking classes kind of thing.
Good at memorizing or whatever.

1466
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:56.870
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then yeah,
interesting.
But you don't know what you get as a person.

1467
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:59.480
Well how were they brought up?
Right.
You know,

1468
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.580
Brian Stann story cool about how he got brought up.
You know,
he'd just very,

1469
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:06.230
you could see that he,

1470
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:10.310
he wasn't taught his leadership ability in my opinion at the Naval Academy.

1471
01:27:10.311 --> 01:27:13.400
Did he learned there?
Yes.
Did he take away a lot from it?
Yes.

1472
01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.770
Anybody that heard him would probably think,
ah,
definitely would,

1473
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:19.340
would love to go to the Naval Academy.
But you know,

1474
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:24.140
you listened to his story of his life.
He learned a lot prior to,

1475
01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:29.000
he learned a lot at when he was at uh,
uh,
the TBS,
the basic school.

1476
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:30.980
He just learned a lot and he had an open mind.

1477
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:34.520
He was a humble guy and a hard worker.
That's what makes you a great officer,

1478
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.950
you know,
that type of thing.
Next question.

1479
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.470
Do smaller built dudes have a niche for sof world?

1480
01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:50.570
For the F F world soft world.
Yeah.
Special Operations forces.
Yeah.

1481
01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.340
Check.
Do you say sof?
Sof is smaller.

1482
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:59.780
Built dudes have a niche for the soft world.
Any advantages,

1483
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:04.280
disadvantages with fit?
Physical sizer of operators?
Well,

1484
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.510
special ops guys come in all shapes and sizes for sure.
They are,

1485
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.470
can be big giant monster guys and they can be little tiny,

1486
01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:15.500
skinny wirey guys and that's the way it is.

1487
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:19.850
And they're all needed in,
in the special operations community.

1488
01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.210
If you look at your average point,
man,
you're average point man.
I said,

1489
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:29.380
why re light guy that's quick and nimble and you look at your average machine

1490
01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:34.550
gunner,
he's a big horse of a dude that can tow it around a bunch of weight.

1491
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:39.910
But also there's a bunch of skinny little guys that are carrying machine gun.

1492
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:44.030
There's some big guys that walk point and that's the way it is.

1493
01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:45.980
So is there,

1494
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:50.240
is there a niche for certain body types?
Yeah,

1495
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:51.440
I mean there is,

1496
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.550
if you're a big guy you should carry something big like a,

1497
01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.530
like a machine gun.
If you're a small guy,

1498
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:03.270
you should try and be in a situation where you're carrying a little bit of a

1499
01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.970
lighter load,
like a point man or a rear security dude.

1500
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:10.920
But both do both.
And there's a bunch of other,
I mean,
you know,

1501
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:13.620
you look at a radio man radio is got to carry a ton of weight too.

1502
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.190
So yeah,
there's no real,

1503
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:22.170
there's no real advantage or disadvantage,
I would say.

1504
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:27.000
You don't want to be that big and you don't want to be that small.

1505
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.320
But if you are,
get some,
you know,
get some,

1506
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.390
there's just the way it is.
There's going to be things,

1507
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.170
there's going to be things that are way harder for a bigger guy in the seal

1508
01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:39.090
teams and in special operations.

1509
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.310
And there's gonna be things that are harder for smaller guy and that's the way

1510
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:44.520
it is.
So you know,

1511
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:47.970
if you've got to do submarine lockouts and you're a big guy,

1512
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.280
you're going to be in a little escape trunk,

1513
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:54.960
a little six foot sphere with a bunch of gear in there.

1514
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:57.360
It's not fun to be a big giant guy at that point.
No.

1515
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.270
And when you get to the beach,

1516
01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:04.200
after you lock out of the submarine and you got to carry a 55 horsepower motor

1517
01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:07.380
across the beach into a cash site and you're,

1518
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.830
you weigh 143 pounds,
that's not going to be fun for you.

1519
01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.980
You want that big 260 pound or to come over and throw that motor on his shoulder

1520
01:30:16.381 --> 01:30:20.420
and carry it into position.
So that's why you have everything at a seal platoon.

1521
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:23.340
That's why diversity is good in terms of body styles.

1522
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:30.270
[inaudible]
good morning.
Do you ever get edgy?

1523
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:32.580
Perhaps hangry

1524
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.560
near the end of a fast if they'll,
how do you deal with it?

1525
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:41.310
I tend to have more difficulty controlling my emotions during the last few
hours.

1526
01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.440
Thank you.
Anyone that
listens to me very often,

1527
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.750
we'll probably know what I'm going to say here.

1528
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.740
If you think you're going to get edgy or you think you're going to get hangry,

1529
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.710
just be of aware of it and don't get angry.

1530
01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.650
Next question.
You know what I mean?
Like,
yeah.

1531
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:05.580
If you're hungry and you're frustrated because you haven't eaten and now it's

1532
01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:10.140
starting to get to,
you just don't do that.
Yeah.
I actually,

1533
01:31:10.650 --> 01:31:15.090
it's kind of like we were talking earlier about surfing without a leash or
about,

1534
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:15.841
you know,

1535
01:31:15.841 --> 01:31:18.510
parachuting under a pressure situation where I don't know what the hell I'm

1536
01:31:18.511 --> 01:31:21.510
doing,
but I'm going to do it anyways and I get focused on it.

1537
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:26.340
It's the same thing for me when I'm doing a fast,
I don't,

1538
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:31.490
I actually enjoy the fact that I'm under some excessive stressful situation.

1539
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.470
In fact,
I like it better,
you know?

1540
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.100
I want to feel that and then I want to be like,
I want to say to myself,
hey,

1541
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:47.250
you might get frustrated right now because you haven't eaten and your blood

1542
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:50.970
sugar's low,
but I'm going to be,

1543
01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:54.390
I'm going to use the Echo Charles approach of a,
that's weakness.

1544
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:56.940
It's weakness for me to be getting angry.

1545
01:31:56.941 --> 01:32:00.010
It's weak for me to be complaining cause on the tail end

1546
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.400
<v 1>of a 72 hour fast,
that's just weakness.
Not going to complain.</v>

1547
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:06.850
What are you talking about?
You don't need to eat for 30 days.

1548
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:10.450
People can go 30 days without eating.
My daughter,

1549
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:14.140
when she was cutting weight for wrestling this past season,
she would say that.

1550
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:16.060
She'd say,
you know,
I'd be getting,
she'd say,
you know,

1551
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:19.810
dad would get really hungry and then I just think people can live for 30 days

1552
01:32:19.811 --> 01:32:22.750
without eating.
I think I can make it through the next eight hours.
Come on.

1553
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:25.750
It's not that big of a deal.
There's no reason to get hangry.

1554
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:28.450
That's just an excuse.
Don't do it.

1555
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:33.330
Carry on with your airborne self.
Allow you to haul.

1556
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:35.830
I said this before,

1557
01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.780
there's a difference between how you feel and then how you behave.
You know.

1558
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.020
Sure you can get hangry on the inside,

1559
01:32:41.170 --> 01:32:45.790
but once you start behaving like Jujitsu,
man,
get angry on the inside

1560
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:51.820
trading places.
Those are pretty good.
Like that.
Very good.

1561
01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.420
Well actually now to think about it,
when I was doing deployments

1562
01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.890
back in the day,
in the 90s we watched,
there was nothing to do on a ship.

1563
01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:06.160
We didn't have an internet.
No one wrote US letters.
No one cared about us.

1564
01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:10.300
There was no,
so all we did was play spades and watch movies.

1565
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:13.960
And when movies we watch,
we're on videotape because this is background and Jay,

1566
01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.810
when before cds,
before Netflix,

1567
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.690
you have videotape and we had a crate full of videos.

1568
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:22.510
And so we were watching the same,
you know,

1569
01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:25.120
cheesy movies over and over and over again.

1570
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:28.270
Probably trading places was one of them.
So if you go cloud,

1571
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:33.280
if you were to go back further in the movies,
you're not cause cause what am I,

1572
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:37.120
five years older than you?
Yeah,
fuck six five or six years.
Yeah.

1573
01:33:37.121 --> 01:33:39.910
So I'm just five or six years ahead of you on movies.

1574
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:43.330
So there's a whole bunch of cheesy movies that I actually know about that you

1575
01:33:43.331 --> 01:33:48.331
might not know about an equation that we're getting an overlap trading places

1576
01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:53.560
polices iconic.
Oh yeah,

1577
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:55.990
but hangry,
right?
Karate man bleed on the inside.

1578
01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.690
Hang.
I like that word hangry,
by the way.
That's
plenty.

1579
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.730
But that implies that you're kind of like,
oh,
I'm hangry.
You know?
Like,

1580
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.880
like you're expressing yourself,
you know,
don't express yourself.
Yeah.

1581
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:17.200
Your emotions and keep it on the end of act like a winner.

1582
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:21.310
If you feel you can feel like a loser on the inside,
yeah,
you can feel hangry,

1583
01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:23.230
but act like don't act like that.

1584
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:27.910
Don't let other people see you be all vedic like that.

1585
01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:31.610
It'd be like,
Oh yeah,
I haven't eaten in four days.
Whatever.
You know,

1586
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:36.400
you hear this joke,
you know what I mean?
Just hey,
I haven't eaten in six days.

1587
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.820
No big deal.
I'm going to go train Jujitsu.
What are you doing?

1588
01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.860
I think so,
yeah.
Oh,
what are you doing?
Sitting around being weak.

1589
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:51.020
Don't do that.
I'll be over here doing something else yet.
So yeah,
separate,

1590
01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.490
separate your feeling and your behavior and typically when it's the fee and you

1591
01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:56.310
know you even have a word for it,

1592
01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:00.940
like we're crept up on you and I had no control over it.
No,

1593
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.730
you identified it,
gave it a name,
everything.
And if,
I mean,

1594
01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:08.840
if my experience serves me a lot of times when people say like,
Oh,
I have,

1595
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.380
I get hangry or um,
pms scene or whatever,

1596
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:17.080
it's explain their common behavior.
Meaning they just let it go.
They embrace it.

1597
01:35:17.081 --> 01:35:21.740
That's how,
that's how it is for them kind of thing.
Please forgive me.
I'm hangry.

1598
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:24.980
Yeah,
yeah,
I get like that sometimes we'll,
what are you talking about?

1599
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:27.710
And you just let it go,
you know,
be like that on the inside.

1600
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:32.150
Be Good on the outside.
Separate the feelings versus behavior.

1601
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.770
Next question.
Stifle your emotions inside.

1602
01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:42.080
You know,
they say like if you get like emotions,
you got to like let it out,

1603
01:35:42.081 --> 01:35:43.040
punch a pillow or whatever.

1604
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.690
I guess as it turns out that's not true because if you intern it,

1605
01:35:46.691 --> 01:35:48.320
you know how you he say stifled.

1606
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.560
The reason I kind of say that with sarcasm is because I think that the,

1607
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:59.570
for instance,
yeah.
You like you're saying people these days,
they say,
Oh,

1608
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:04.040
you know you to let your emotions out.
You got to let your emotions out.
You got.

1609
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:08.810
If you've got to cry,
cry.
If you and I understand where that's coming from,

1610
01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:11.480
and you can get to a point as a person,

1611
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:15.050
if there's something that's really traumatic that's happening and all you do is

1612
01:36:15.051 --> 01:36:15.621
hold it in,

1613
01:36:15.621 --> 01:36:20.360
and I've seen guys get destroyed over that because they're not expressing the

1614
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.740
emotions that they have.
Right.

1615
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.283
<v 3>But that's</v>

1616
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.620
<v 1>at a big level,
right?
At a daily level.</v>

1617
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:35.180
No.
Yeah.
You don't express those things.
You keep them in shock.

1618
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.790
That's why I say it like that.
Like I'm being kind of sarcastic,

1619
01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:40.400
but I'm be in serious.
Yeah.
You know?

1620
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.540
It's just don't let your emotions out and into the world.

1621
01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:47.300
Keep them for yourself.
I'll own them.
Keep them for yourself.

1622
01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:51.320
Don't share them with other people.
If you don't have to.
Yeah.
Now again,

1623
01:36:51.321 --> 01:36:52.970
people are going to freak out that I'm saying this.

1624
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:56.000
Just bury your emotions because that what happens when you bury your,

1625
01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:58.700
when you've got something really traumatic that you Barry,

1626
01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:01.520
then it eats you apart.
And I've talked about that.
I mean,

1627
01:37:01.521 --> 01:37:04.300
talking about things that you go through in life and,

1628
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:07.520
and expressing those feelings that you have about them,
that's good.

1629
01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:10.520
But what we're talking about is not that what we're talking about,

1630
01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:14.660
his daily emotions,
little ups and downs,

1631
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:18.780
little tick marks on your Richter scale.
We're not talking about,
uh,
uh,

1632
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:21.440
an 8.8 on the Richter scale,
right?

1633
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.450
We're talking about just like little twos.

1634
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:29.240
And when you express those twos and threes on the Richter scale out to people,

1635
01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.070
you just look unstable.
Hangry.
That's a two.
Yeah.
Overall,

1636
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.220
and I'm not to split hairs are nothing,
but overall it's,

1637
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:41.990
it's more about dealing with your emotions,
quote unquote.
So yeah,
if you,
if you,

1638
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:45.770
if a good conducive way to deal with your emotions is to let them out.

1639
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.290
And there's all different kinds of emotions.
Like if you're sad,

1640
01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:51.470
if something's eating you up on the inside because of sadness or whatever and

1641
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:55.040
it's conducive to your recovery development,
whatever,

1642
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.620
to express those emotions,
then yes,

1643
01:37:58.621 --> 01:38:03.410
but if you're hangry and you lose your temper on your kid,
that's not going to,

1644
01:38:03.411 --> 01:38:06.120
you're not dealing with your emotions correctly,

1645
01:38:06.121 --> 01:38:10.410
so in stifle your emotion,
but it's not a really,

1646
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:14.040
it is stifling them,
but before you stifle them,
you're identifying them.

1647
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.170
You're like,
oh,
hey,
I'm hangry.
Okay.

1648
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:19.560
I identified that I'm going to separate feelings from behavior that's dealing

1649
01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:21.740
with emotions right there,
that's dealing with,

1650
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:27.310
it's a great point that oftentimes expressing your emotions to the world doesn't

1651
01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:34.200
improve your situation or your position at all.
Correct.
In fact,

1652
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.270
I would say that most of the time,

1653
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.160
expressing your emotions to the world sets you back,

1654
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.700
and that is why I vote.
In many cases,

1655
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:49.110
stifle your emotions.
Keep them in.
Don't let other people see you.

1656
01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.860
Did you put your cards on the table?
Right?

1657
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:54.260
You put your emotional cards on the table.
Now you can't gamble anymore.

1658
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.030
You can't.
You're not in the game anymore.
The person knows what's going on,

1659
01:38:57.230 --> 01:39:00.210
but you're giving it to him.
You're not going to know what I'm thinking.

1660
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:04.110
You're going to think I'm just,
everything's cool with me.
We're training Jujitsu,

1661
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.750
right?
If I'm getting frustrated and I show that to you,
right.

1662
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.930
What does that do?
You're getting also you,
you just go level up.
You Think,
oh,

1663
01:39:12.931 --> 01:39:15.120
I got him.
He's frustrated right now.
He can't,
oh,
I'm working.

1664
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:17.820
This is working against them.
If I'm just saying the same face all the time,

1665
01:39:17.821 --> 01:39:21.720
which is what I do primarily,
hey,
same face all the time.
Just we're,
you know,

1666
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:24.360
moving the same way.
When you do get me,

1667
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:27.450
I forget what you say when you get me to react to something good,

1668
01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:29.840
recognize the urgency.
You say you say,
oh,

1669
01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:32.520
I recognize a little urgency there and I always go down.

1670
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.770
I don't want him to recognize,

1671
01:39:35.190 --> 01:39:38.250
I'd rather just have you just pass my guard and you're just there and we just

1672
01:39:38.251 --> 01:39:41.330
sit there like it's no big deal to us and not humid.

1673
01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.480
They made me get all panicky where then you level up a little bit.

1674
01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:48.510
And it's the same thing with life,
right?

1675
01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:52.800
Every time you express these big emotions to your boss or to your team,

1676
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:57.420
you express these big emotions to your team.
They see all your cards.

1677
01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:02.460
Don't let them see all your cards.
Is this manipulating kind of,

1678
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:06.270
right?
This is one of those things where people think,
oh,
transparency.

1679
01:40:06.271 --> 01:40:09.720
We hear that all the time.
These days.
Transparency.
You gotta be transparent.
No,

1680
01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:11.400
actually you don't.
Yeah know with that,

1681
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:15.690
you don't have to be transparent all the time.
You have to win the game.

1682
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:16.860
You know what?

1683
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.700
Does the football coach go out and Candace playbook to the other football team?

1684
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:23.520
No.
He's got to win the game in a typically no,

1685
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:28.530
and that's not how you win the game.
So are we.
You know what we're doing?

1686
01:40:28.531 --> 01:40:31.770
We're playing chess.
It's emotional chest.
You're playing with other human beings.

1687
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:32.820
You want to win.
Now,

1688
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:36.930
if you're winning so that I can take advantage of you so I can manipulate you

1689
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.510
and get something from you that you don't want to give me.

1690
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.880
That's bad and I'm not talking about doing that.

1691
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:46.890
But if what I'm doing is keeping my calm so that instead of escalating an

1692
01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:47.880
argument with you,

1693
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.180
I'm getting you to see it from my perspective just by remaining calm.

1694
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.040
That's what we're talking here.
You know,

1695
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:57.250
Lave told that story the other day where it,

1696
01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.280
he tells the story lot cause it was hilarious story where I came in,

1697
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:03.070
we didn't have a chance to talk to each other as he was playing in this big

1698
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:07.660
operation.
And I come in 10 minutes before the operation,
I said,
hey,
let me,

1699
01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:11.020
let me see what you're doing.
And he kind of shows me on a map,
hey,

1700
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:12.370
we're going to go here,
here in near.
And it's like,
Hey,

1701
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.030
you should do this instead.
And he was like,
we,

1702
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.780
we're leaving in 10 minutes.
And I said,
man,
but just think about it.
And he goes,

1703
01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:24.970
do you know what?
Just cancel the OP.
And he was all mad.
Right.
And,
and you know,

1704
01:41:24.971 --> 01:41:26.980
he's,
he's like a Jocko kind of like laughed at me.

1705
01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:29.450
I didn't laugh at him like a leg,
like a jerk.
You know,
it was like,

1706
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:33.490
but I was like,
hey man,
listen,
just think about what I'm saying right now.

1707
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:38.560
But that's the,
that's an example,
right?
I didn't show my emotions,
which was,

1708
01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:41.410
which would be more like,
dude,
are you serious right now?

1709
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.010
You're going to cancel an op because we have a difference of opinion and think

1710
01:41:45.011 --> 01:41:48.220
about what your,
I didn't do that.
I was like,
hey man,
I get it.

1711
01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.970
Everyone's stressed out right now.
We got to leave on this thing quickly.

1712
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:54.310
Think about what I'm saying.
They'll look at,
this is all I'm saying.

1713
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:57.880
We could execute this in a better way.
So that's what I'm talking about.

1714
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.570
Does that make me manipulative?
No,
it doesn't make me manipulative.

1715
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:04.810
It makes us as a team do a better job.

1716
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:08.110
And as soon as life saw that and he was like deescalated himself,

1717
01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:11.890
he was good to go.
We move on.
Yeah.
So that's what I'm talking about.

1718
01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:16.810
Stifle your emotions at all times.
But you know,

1719
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:18.850
and,
and just to address that though,
for Real,

1720
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:24.990
when you do see the big emotional impactful things in someone's life and they

1721
01:42:25.871 --> 01:42:29.590
don't express them,
that absolutely is bad.

1722
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:33.730
And I'll tell you where you see this a lot is with kids,
you know,
kids,

1723
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.890
teens where they,
they there something bothering them and they don't,

1724
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:41.260
they hold it in,
hold it in because they don't have anybody to talk to.

1725
01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:43.870
They can't talk to mom and dad because mom and dad don't get it.

1726
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:47.390
Their friends are the people that they're pissed off and pissed off at anyways,

1727
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.640
so they can't tell them what's going on.

1728
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:52.510
So they sit there and they harbor a lot of that anger.
And that can be,

1729
01:42:52.511 --> 01:42:55.210
that can be very problematic.
And it goes through all through,
you know,

1730
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.090
adults as well.
And,
and you know,

1731
01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:01.480
at work sometimes people will,

1732
01:43:01.481 --> 01:43:05.380
they got problems at home so they can't talk to their wife because that's what

1733
01:43:05.381 --> 01:43:05.831
the problem was.

1734
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:08.140
And they can't talk to her husband because that's the source of the problem.

1735
01:43:08.141 --> 01:43:10.420
But then they get to work and they don't want to look like the person that's got

1736
01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:12.280
problems at home.
So I'm not going to say anything there either.

1737
01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:13.750
And the next thing to do,
what are they doing?

1738
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:16.360
They're trying to escape those problems.
How are they doing it?
Instead of,

1739
01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.610
instead of letting those problems out and talking to somebody about them,

1740
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:21.730
they're having a know,
having a drink in the afternoon,

1741
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.050
getting on the alcohol whenever they're doing something that's negative and

1742
01:43:26.051 --> 01:43:27.310
they're not moving forward at all.

1743
01:43:27.311 --> 01:43:32.311
So those are not the kind of feelings that and emotions that you want to subdue

1744
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:33.430
or stifle.

1745
01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:37.990
But these little ones and twos and threes on the Richter scale being hangry,
get,

1746
01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:38.920
get,
get,

1747
01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:43.921
control those things and start stifling certain emotions ones and twos is a good

1748
01:43:44.681 --> 01:43:46.780
way to deal with them because when these,

1749
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:51.130
cause they usually real spontaneous emotions and they'll,
and they'll,

1750
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.650
<v 0>they don't have the power to sustain.</v>

1751
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.830
They're just gonna they're there and then they just fade away and that's cool.

1752
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:00.680
That's why.
Yes,
correct.
Then over time,

1753
01:44:00.681 --> 01:44:02.510
now you're good at dealing with them in that way.

1754
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:05.270
When you get hangry and you've been for one year,

1755
01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:07.520
you've been dealing with it by just ignoring it.

1756
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:10.430
You know in regards to behavior does not acting on it.

1757
01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.690
Now you're good at doing that.

1758
01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:16.660
<v 2>Not so automatic.
Now you don't get,
you don't act hangry anymore.
Not True.</v>

1759
01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.050
Okay.
This is part question,
part opinion.

1760
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:27.430
In podcast 13 you stated effectively not explicitly that Jujitsu is the martial

1761
01:44:28.071 --> 01:44:32.300
art that takes the most time to become proficient.
I disagree and here's why.

1762
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:36.620
As a wrestler have been able to pick up Jiu Jitsu in a matter of about two

1763
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:40.700
months to the point where I can submit a blue belt here and there and mostly

1764
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:44.300
control purple belt possibly.
There's white skill range along belts,

1765
01:44:44.301 --> 01:44:47.570
which I only wrote with lower level players.

1766
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.440
I might just be a bad teacher,
but if not,

1767
01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:56.850
I have not had as much success teaching Jujitsu guys to wrestle after the same

1768
01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:58.650
amount of of time.
They're

1769
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:02.630
after the same amount of time and there may be a low,
high,

1770
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:04.130
high school wrestling level.

1771
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:07.280
I found it extremely difficult to teach you discipline disciplinaries to shoot,

1772
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:11.240
penetrate with their hips or effectively use their hips to defend us or
scramble.

1773
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:15.230
Possibly.
My sample size is too small to form an accurate opinion,

1774
01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.330
but I'm curious of your thoughts on the topic.
Thanks.
Love listening.

1775
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:23.510
<v 0>So yeah,
I guess when I said that I should have said grappling in general,</v>

1776
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:28.430
which is definitely harder to achieve a basic level of competence in

1777
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:33.200
rather than striking.
Now,
don't get me wrong,

1778
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:38.600
you take a skilled boxer,
they will destroy an unskilled boxer.

1779
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:41.060
You take a skilled Moy Thai guy,

1780
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:44.300
they will destroy and unskilled Moitai do you?

1781
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.370
You've changed good Moyie Thai people before.

1782
01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:51.770
The first person that I ever did that with that was a skilled Moitai legit

1783
01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:56.000
skilled Moitai.
It was like black belt versus white belt,
right?
Yeah.

1784
01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:01.180
I would think about throwing a kick at him and he would check in,

1785
01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.060
right?

1786
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.800
And then he would throw a kick at me before I even knew what was happening right

1787
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:09.020
there.
That much better.
They can see your hips.
They moved.
Same.

1788
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:11.090
Same thing with boxing.
If you go against a good boxer,

1789
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.590
they'll jack you up in that sport,
right?
In that sport you will get worked.

1790
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:20.540
So
now that being said,

1791
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:25.460
a good wrestler is a good grappler.

1792
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.520
You are a good grappler and that's why you're able to pick up Jujitsu very

1793
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:35.480
quickly because wrestling is grappling,
which is Jujitsu.

1794
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.190
There are there differences?

1795
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:42.220
Yes there absolutely are differences but it's like Longboard Surfing and Short

1796
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.790
Board surfing.
If you're or or baseball and softball,

1797
01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:49.740
if you played baseball in college,

1798
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:54.720
when you get out on the the the office softball team,
you're a killer.

1799
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:58.440
That's the way it is.
Cause you played softball.
He played baseball,

1800
01:46:58.441 --> 01:47:00.920
you didn't play technically softball.
It's the same thing with,

1801
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:05.990
with wrestling and as far as the fact that it doesn't take long to learn if

1802
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:12.060
you're a high level wrestler to learn Jujitsu.
Yes,
absolutely.

1803
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:15.840
You'll learn it very quickly.
Look at the history of the UFC.
Dan Severn,

1804
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:20.250
Mark Coleman,
Kevin Randleman,
Randy Coachart,
Tito,

1805
01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:23.070
all those high level wrestles and that's the history.

1806
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:27.540
Cause guess what high level wrestlers are there right now to Jon Jones.

1807
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:32.430
DC.
It's,
it's wrestlers,
it's wrestlers.
And wrestlers.
Now,

1808
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:36.240
are there other guys that come in and fill it?
But the,
the,
the,

1809
01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:41.140
I would say the majority base is wrestling,
you know,

1810
01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:42.923
so

1811
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.080
now you also have to look at,
speaking of history,

1812
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:54.110
you have to look at the early UFC or you go to any gym in the fact is the fact

1813
01:47:57.631 --> 01:48:02.631
is a Jujitsu only guy beats a wrestling only guy in a fight nine times out of

1814
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:06.930
10.

1815
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:11.930
That's the way it is that now if the rest of the can learn very quickly,

1816
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.560
but if the rest of their only knows wrestling and Jujitsu guy only knows
Jujitsu,

1817
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:18.750
Jujitsu guy is going to win

1818
01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:23.100
simply because the rest of the doesn't know how to finish the fight.

1819
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:24.480
He doesn't know how to finish it.

1820
01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.800
He doesn't have any submission Holts to finish a fight.
So can the occasionally,

1821
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:32.460
nine times,
you know,
one time out of 10 or whatever get something and,

1822
01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.400
and yes that can happen,
but,

1823
01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:41.170
and also I'm not talking about if you take a NCAA wrestler right and you put

1824
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:46.680
them against the white belt or,
or maybe even a blue belt,

1825
01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:50.340
there's a chance that the blue belt can't submit him for good guys.

1826
01:48:50.341 --> 01:48:52.980
Just too strong.
That's if he has some awareness.

1827
01:48:52.981 --> 01:48:56.170
If he has no awareness whatsoever,
he's going to get tapped out.
Yeah.

1828
01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:00.840
And if you watch the early UFC,
that's exactly what happened.
You know,

1829
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:04.380
the wrestlers,
they might get positioned but they were getting choked.

1830
01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:07.260
They were getting tapped and you go to any gym right now,

1831
01:49:07.261 --> 01:49:10.050
you have a tough wrestler walk in that doesn't know any Jujitsu,

1832
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.940
he's going to get tapped out.
I mean,
for instance,
right now at our gym,

1833
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.810
we got a really good wrestler name Taylor Johnson,

1834
01:49:18.811 --> 01:49:21.780
and I'll bring his name up because it's,

1835
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:23.490
I can remember it all because it's all been recent.

1836
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:28.110
He's been training now for less than a year.
When he first came in,

1837
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:30.930
he was getting tapped out.
You know,
that's the way it is.

1838
01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.230
He's a phenomenal wrestler.
Two months later he wasn't getting tapped out.

1839
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:39.120
Six months later,
he's tapping people out.
So that's what happens.

1840
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:44.820
But if you take physically kind of close people and you put pure wrestling

1841
01:49:44.821 --> 01:49:46.860
against pure Jujitsu,
Jujitsu is going to win.

1842
01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:50.800
Now there's also another thing that you're probably noticing in this situation

1843
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.860
and that is that wrestling,

1844
01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:59.050
wrestling selects for athleticism,

1845
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.550
right?
Wrestling selects for athleticism.

1846
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:08.350
And for you to be competitive in wrestling,
you need to be strong,
quick,

1847
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:11.290
athletic,
agile,
all those things are important.

1848
01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.670
And I've seen that,
you know,
with the,
uh,

1849
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.160
the school where my kids wrestle and you see it,

1850
01:50:18.161 --> 01:50:21.580
what it's like when you get a strong athletic kid and how they're able to

1851
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.880
execute moves better than someone that's not that good of an athlete.

1852
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:30.550
And so wrestling does that.
Wrestling is selective.

1853
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:34.660
So if you wrestled,
guess what?
You're a really good athlete.
You,

1854
01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.300
and if you did well wrestling or he wrestled for a long time,

1855
01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.740
you developed that athleticism because you had to be explosive if you had to

1856
01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:44.800
train hard.
So that's that.

1857
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:48.760
Also blue belts.
You look at a blue belt,

1858
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.910
a blue belt is basically a person that's been doing Jujitsu for a year,

1859
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:54.880
maybe two years.
Right?

1860
01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:00.060
So that's the same thing as a lower level high school wrestler,

1861
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:04.330
right?
A low level high school wrestlers.

1862
01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:07.450
A guy that didn't start wrestling until he was a freshman year started
wrestling.

1863
01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:10.420
Well that's a low level high school wrestler and guess what?
He's getting beat.

1864
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:16.330
So you should be,
if you're a good wrestler,
you should be able to,

1865
01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.960
once you understand the basic principles of Jujitsu or you should be able to

1866
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:23.530
beat blue belts because they're a year into the game.
That's the way it is.

1867
01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.610
Um,
yeah,

1868
01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:30.280
you take a competitive wrestler and you go against somebody that's,
you know,

1869
01:51:30.281 --> 01:51:32.980
seven years in and now there are brown belt.
Well that's,

1870
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:37.120
that's a competitive high school wrestler that's a senior and he started

1871
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.310
training in sixth grade.
That's seven,
eight years.

1872
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:42.850
Go against a seven or eight year Jujitsu guy you've got,

1873
01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:48.120
now you've got a good match and likely the Jujitsu guys going to win.

1874
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:52.300
And now again,
if you take no,
if you take a pure wrestler versus a pure Jujitsu,

1875
01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:55.660
the Jews,
Jesus,
God's going to win all day,
all day.
So,

1876
01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:01.720
um,
you know,
there's no denying and like I just said,

1877
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:03.850
there's a reason that wrestling is the,

1878
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.240
the premier skillset in the UFC that predicts champions,

1879
01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:13.270
no doubt about it.
It is a great and incredible martial art.

1880
01:52:14.230 --> 01:52:15.063
I,

1881
01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:20.850
I wish that that wrestling had kept his roots as catch wrestling and still had

1882
01:52:21.641 --> 01:52:25.060
submission holds and all that cause it would just completely change the game but

1883
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:26.590
it doesn't,
so you have to add them later.

1884
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:28.600
There's also something else too where I think that,

1885
01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.520
I think that people in general wrestling's not for everybody,

1886
01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:34.630
right?

1887
01:52:34.630 --> 01:52:39.630
It's a fairy hard sport and I think that people avoid that grind of as far as,

1888
01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:42.460
as far as the,
okay,

1889
01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:44.820
you're going to get good at wrestling now how much you do to guide now I'm gonna

1890
01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.250
make you good at wrestling.
Jiu Jitsu

1891
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:49.010
<v 1>guys,
avoid the grind.
I shouldn't say all of them,
but some</v>

1892
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:55.570
often do you do two guys avoid the grind of the take downs and the intensity of

1893
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:57.740
wrestling.
They're not looking for that.

1894
01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.430
That's one of the things that make does Jujitsu appealing to a very broad range

1895
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:05.900
of people is that you can train it at a,
at a mellower pace.
Right?

1896
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:11.330
And that's also why if you go do Jujitsu tournaments,

1897
01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:15.470
wrestlers do really well in Jujitsu tournaments because they understand the

1898
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:20.471
intensity of rounds of limited time of smashing someone,

1899
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.740
of going all out,
Jujitsu guy that's been trained in the gym,

1900
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:26.360
they ain't ready for that first tournament.

1901
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:29.180
There's no Jujitsu guy in the gym that goes to the first tournament and says,

1902
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:31.070
yeah,
that was just like what I thought it was gonna be like,
no,

1903
01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:34.400
they are not used to that intensity.
They're not ready for it.
So

1904
01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.180
I mean,
and,

1905
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.210
and of course not taking away from Jujitsu guys that train like mad men with

1906
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:45.350
total intensity and get after it super hard to is those guys exist as well.

1907
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:47.810
And also last little thing on this,

1908
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:53.740
there are also some wrestlers that don't adapt to the slower pace of Jujitsu.

1909
01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:03.610
They can adapt to that and they don't adapt to the slower pace of MMA.

1910
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:05.660
And so they,
their whole career,

1911
01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.560
they gas out and there's plenty of pro MMA fighters,

1912
01:54:09.561 --> 01:54:14.561
UFC that have come in high level wrestlers that they couldn't ever quite make

1913
01:54:15.651 --> 01:54:20.480
the transition to MMA.
So,
you know,
bottom line,
these are,

1914
01:54:20.481 --> 01:54:24.030
uh,
these are points that I pretty much agree with that the,
that this,

1915
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:28.700
this guy made and wrestling is awesome.
I think it's a great base.
I think it's,

1916
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:33.620
it's a form of grappling and it complements Jujitsu and Jujitsu.

1917
01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.970
Jujitsu compliments it.
And I wish that it was one sport,

1918
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.680
but it's not,
so you have to do both,
you know?
And it seems like,

1919
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:49.850
<v 2>like too,
because he was originally not complaining,
wasn't complaining,
but he,</v>

1920
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:54.740
his premise was that,
you know,
did you get to,
is,

1921
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.070
is not in fact the hardest one to master,
you know,
wrestling,

1922
01:54:58.071 --> 01:55:00.890
he's implying that wrestling is harder to,
to master.
You know,

1923
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.080
could because he taught Jujitsu guys wrestling and they didn't pick it up right.

1924
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:06.800
It was kind of,
uh,

1925
01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.880
in Jujitsu you can break all kinds of wrestling rules in Jujitsu and,

1926
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:17.660
but wrestling guys when they'll come in,

1927
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.290
if they have to learn to break some wrestling rules,

1928
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.050
otherwise it's going to be their detriment.
Sure.
A lot of them,

1929
01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:28.010
a lot of them carry over a lot of,
you know,
a lot of the strength and sit out.

1930
01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:33.320
But man,
if a wrestler can't break the rule to,
to go to his back,

1931
01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:34.780
you know,
cause a lot of wrestling,

1932
01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.970
the wrestlers will give up their back all day because they don't want to go on

1933
01:55:37.971 --> 01:55:40.700
their back,
you know,
and that's why they're going to get choked all the time.

1934
01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.830
But if like Taylor you,
that's good example of pro,

1935
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.500
he'll fuck he broke that rule quick.
Yeah.

1936
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:49.320
And that's why he's so good because he can expand his mind and break that rule.

1937
01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:53.190
So what,
consider the Jujitsu guy right now,
he has to learn all these things.

1938
01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.450
So he has to essentially,
and not so much break the rule.
You,

1939
01:55:56.451 --> 01:55:59.880
he hasn't probably break some rules,
you know,
but not going as back,
whatever.

1940
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.080
But if you just look at,
it doesn't have to break any Jujitsu rules necessarily.

1941
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:07.530
So
case in point,

1942
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.440
how much time and effort am I going to put into learning a takedown correctly

1943
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:18.020
when it barely decides the match?
Exactly right.
When you don't have to,

1944
01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:21.610
there's a mental,
there's a mental,
uh,

1945
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:26.190
gap into the desire for knowledge.

1946
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:30.180
Because if I,
if you take me down,
cool,
I'm going to be a teen.
You,

1947
01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.530
I'm going to be,
you're not going to pass my guard.

1948
01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:36.060
Whereas when a wrestler shows up,
he has to learn this stuff.

1949
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:38.590
Otherwise he's losing,
he's getting tapped out.
He,
he's getting choked.
Yup.

1950
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:43.200
So that's a great,
great point there.
Yeah,
very true.
So yeah,

1951
01:56:43.201 --> 01:56:46.890
you'll have to,
you know,
and even when you say,
okay,

1952
01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:50.940
Jujitsu should focus more on takedowns and it's really cool and you should

1953
01:56:50.941 --> 01:56:53.790
definitely focus on takedowns and you got to learn them and it's very important.

1954
01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:59.000
But at the back of your mind,
as a Jujitsu Guy,
I'm like,
just boulevard.
Yeah.

1955
01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.410
I don't really care if you take me down,
it's okay.
Or,

1956
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:02.670
and then now we're talking about,

1957
01:57:02.671 --> 01:57:04.260
in this case we're coming in saying that me personally,

1958
01:57:04.261 --> 01:57:06.540
cause I don't like just saying put 10 potentially,
but,

1959
01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:08.190
and here's the thing to even add to that,

1960
01:57:08.191 --> 01:57:11.790
even if you're considering the comparison of wrestling and Jujitsu,

1961
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:13.410
take the takedown situation.

1962
01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:18.330
Take not all takedowns are quote unquote wrestling take downs.

1963
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:19.410
I can be like,
okay,

1964
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.000
I can not learn wrestling at all and still be good at takedowns if I learned

1965
01:57:24.001 --> 01:57:28.650
judo or if I,
you know,
if I learned something else.
So again,
so it goes,

1966
01:57:28.651 --> 01:57:30.750
it's basically you're taking something really vast,

1967
01:57:31.190 --> 01:57:35.670
a lot of easy ways to maneuver around certain techniques and still be fastly

1968
01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:38.370
successful.
And then you,
you're basically saying,
okay,

1969
01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:43.371
let's take that a person who has that approach and narrow it down to this much

1970
01:57:43.861 --> 01:57:47.220
more difficult approach and way less effective approach.

1971
01:57:47.221 --> 01:57:49.650
Essentially it's the vastness of grappling.

1972
01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:53.050
I can still be successful in graph grappling without learning x,
Y,

1973
01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:57.060
z wrestling moves and then you want to teach them these x,
y,
z wrestling moves.

1974
01:57:57.061 --> 01:58:00.500
Probably some that can go against you,
especially when it comes to energy,

1975
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:05.250
energy conservation and all this other stuff.
That's why a guy,
maybe,

1976
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.120
yeah,
it might be difficult to learn that,

1977
01:58:09.121 --> 01:58:11.440
but how you said there's a gap in the motivation.

1978
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:15.780
So it's difficult to want to learn or kick or care about learning this thing

1979
01:58:15.781 --> 01:58:18.990
when it's going to serve me less in Mike rapidly.
No doubt.

1980
01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:23.460
You can just look at the human facts of Jujitsu.

1981
01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:29.090
There's a reason why takedowns are not emphasized.

1982
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.780
Very much introduced to add a normal academy and normal academy.

1983
01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:38.340
They do not have the focus on take downs like wrestling,

1984
01:58:38.850 --> 01:58:42.130
wrestling,
that takedown wins.
You does it.
We need the match

1985
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.890
<v 1>automatically.
But that's a huge part of wrestling is getting the take downs.</v>

1986
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:51.400
Jujitsu.
It's,
it's a little tiny percentage of the match.

1987
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:52.480
Does it give you two points?
Yeah,

1988
01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:54.980
but it doesn't mean anything to me cause I'm going to submit you.
Yeah.

1989
01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:59.380
And just the nature of the,
of the game,
you know,
wrestling is take down pin.

1990
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.570
There's more to it.
I understand.
But Jujitsu is just submit the guy,
you know,

1991
01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:08.740
so Jujitsu in in a way,
it's like,
just,
just get it to the ground.

1992
01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:11.080
You can read off your back and you can win them from the top.

1993
01:59:11.081 --> 01:59:12.640
You can wear a wrestling is not like that.
Yeah.

1994
01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:17.700
I mean people literally pull guard and then when from their back and zero

1995
01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:21.070
seconds on top zero and win the match.

1996
01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:26.130
And so the fact that you can pull guard gives you this entire out right to get

1997
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:32.770
away from doing take downs and you can still be victorious.
Yeah,
very,
very often.

1998
01:59:32.850 --> 01:59:36.040
Yeah.
And that goes along with these,
even these techniques that he mentioned,

1999
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:40.780
like,
you know,
uh,
you know,
see hit the,
basically the,
there's,

2000
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:43.570
there's a lot of moves in there.
They're big moves,
big moves,

2001
01:59:43.571 --> 01:59:46.210
and they do help you.
But like I said,
that they're just,

2002
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.950
they're simply not necessary.
You know what I mean?

2003
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:53.740
Any physical move is helpful to know and ought to defend,

2004
01:59:53.741 --> 01:59:58.060
whether it be from an offensive or defensive position.
But again,

2005
01:59:58.061 --> 02:00:01.600
if you're trying to narrow it down and teach these guys who their approach and

2006
02:00:01.601 --> 02:00:05.830
their knowledge comes from the vastness of grappling and you want to narrow it

2007
02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:09.010
down to the thing,
it may or may not work,
you know,

2008
02:00:09.011 --> 02:00:11.590
and it may or may not serve you.
It could work against you.
But here,

2009
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:13.270
let's try to learn this real hard.
Yeah,

2010
02:00:13.271 --> 02:00:15.110
you're going to have that gap in motivation.

2011
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:18.740
Actually don't care about the takedowns.
Yeah,

2012
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:22.420
and I'm going to go on record now as saying this,

2013
02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:28.420
just because Jujitsu doesn't focus on takedowns doesn't mean that you shouldn't

2014
02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.190
focus.
You should learn take downs.

2015
02:00:30.191 --> 02:00:33.190
You need to know take downs from a self defense perspective,

2016
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:36.580
from an MMA perspective,
take downs,
wrestling.

2017
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:40.780
You have to do it.
I mean,
that's why my kids wrestle.
You know?

2018
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:45.870
It's because I didn't wrestle and I hate that fact because I go against the,

2019
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:50.470
like he's saying,
you know,
I go against a good high school wrestler.
I,

2020
02:00:50.471 --> 02:00:52.510
it's hard for me to take him to the ground.
You know,

2021
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:56.770
you get somebody that wrestled in college.
I know what I know.
I'm not going to.

2022
02:00:56.950 --> 02:01:00.960
Now I have developed good takedown defense over the years and it's actually take

2023
02:01:00.961 --> 02:01:05.830
down all offense because I have offensive ways of defending the take down.

2024
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:08.260
You know,
I'm going to throw submissions and stuff,

2025
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:13.500
but I can't go back in time and go through the training that you get when you're

2026
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:22.000
a high school wrestler and a and a college wrestler.
I can't do that.

2027
02:01:22.001 --> 02:01:22.990
I can't do it.
I mean,

2028
02:01:22.991 --> 02:01:27.991
I just don't have the time and the motivation to do it because I'm in the same

2029
02:01:30.221 --> 02:01:33.580
boat as,
as you know what?
The guy that you're just talking about,

2030
02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.240
how much time am I going to focus on takedowns I know I go against a college

2031
02:01:37.241 --> 02:01:40.100
wrestler,
he's taken me down.
I go against good high school wrestler.

2032
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:43.730
There's a good chance he's taken me down.
Yeah.
So how much time and effort,

2033
02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.310
I mean,
I could spend the next five years,

2034
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:49.160
I could go through a competitive circuit.
I could join the wrestling club,

2035
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:51.230
but am I gonna do that right now?

2036
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:55.160
Is that time effective or do I just want to get better at Jujitsu and then have

2037
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:59.090
access to the rest of the grappling spectrum that you just talked about?
Will,

2038
02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:03.200
it's an obvious choice.
I'm going to focus on the spectrum that has the most,

2039
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:04.580
uh,

2040
02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:09.440
the most application in every situation I'm going to be in.

2041
02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:13.580
Yeah.
So if you,
if you get the chance to wrestle,

2042
02:02:13.610 --> 02:02:16.540
wrestle as much as you can,
learn your takedowns drill,
your takedowns,

2043
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:19.040
put your kids into wrestling.
Do you did to for sure.

2044
02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:22.880
Put your kids into wrestling.
Yeah.
They don't have to worry about it then.
Yeah.

2045
02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:26.420
The factory main thumb people,
they don't want that beef.

2046
02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:31.100
You know where you got to go wrestle,
man,
that's hard.
You know,

2047
02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:35.230
and even like a wrestling,
you can have out wrestling style to your Jujitsu,

2048
02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:39.230
you know?
But again,
if you,
if you don't know who you know,
who didn't wrestle,

2049
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:44.780
Craig,
Craig Baker eight curse didn't wrestle.
You were trained with him.

2050
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:45.643
You'll be like,
oh,

2051
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:47.990
where did you wrestle in college is what should we be thinking?

2052
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:51.800
He's pure Jujitsu.
Didn't wrestle in college,
didn't wrestle in high school,

2053
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:53.120
didn't even wrestle in high school.

2054
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:56.450
He feels like a total wrestler when you turn with him and his take downs are

2055
02:02:56.451 --> 02:03:00.500
great.
Yeah.
And there's some Brazilian guys that have come up that,
you know,

2056
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:03.560
Brazilian UFC fighters that are very good wrestles,
that never wrestled before.

2057
02:03:03.561 --> 02:03:08.200
They have really good takedowns and,
but you know,
you're gonna,

2058
02:03:08.201 --> 02:03:09.890
you're gonna have to read it if it worked for that.

2059
02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.850
And these kids that come out of high school yeah.
That wrestled in high school.

2060
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:17.840
They got it.
Yeah.
It's a little gift that work hasn't been put in yes.

2061
02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:20.510
Gift that they got.
But for these guys,

2062
02:03:20.511 --> 02:03:23.690
and back to the question for these guys that he's trying to teach,

2063
02:03:23.691 --> 02:03:26.780
and he totally says it could be my sample size.
I understand.

2064
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:30.740
And that's a good point actually.
But um,
because the samples had to be big,

2065
02:03:30.741 --> 02:03:33.440
you can get guys like Craig,
they'll pick that stuff up real quick.

2066
02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:36.830
But at the end of the day when it comes to,
as he put it,

2067
02:03:36.831 --> 02:03:39.140
when it comes time to shoot,
penetrate with their hips,

2068
02:03:39.141 --> 02:03:42.050
are effectively use their hips to defend or scramble,

2069
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:47.180
you can omit all of those things from a Jujitsu guy and he can still win and

2070
02:03:47.181 --> 02:03:50.580
beat vastly successful.
You know,
scramble,

2071
02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.780
scramble scrambles,
a questionable one.
Yeah.
Have to be able to scramble.

2072
02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.160
Yeah.
But again,
I mean you,
let me,

2073
02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:04.460
let me show you scrambling as a very good valuable thing to have in Jujitsu.

2074
02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:08.850
A much more valuable than,
you know,
being able to penetrate on the shop.
Yeah,

2075
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:13.090
yeah.
I agree.
But yeah.
Wrestlers,
right.
That's a weird,
that's,

2076
02:04:13.091 --> 02:04:16.880
let's do an interesting,
I roll with this.
I feel bad that I forget his name,

2077
02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:20.240
but I rode with them every time I see him and he's swallowing me.

2078
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:23.930
I'd give him maybe one 65 maybe and button an awesome wrestler,

2079
02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.960
new guy to under one year and he's giving his wrestling,

2080
02:04:26.961 --> 02:04:28.530
but he's like high level wrestler.

2081
02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:32.630
And also if I play the wrestling game and I know,
I know wrestling,

2082
02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:35.090
like I'm solid,
I can wrestle against good wrestlers.

2083
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:39.060
Maybe not Taylor but good so I can play and I'm bigger than him,
you know.

2084
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:43.680
So if I go and wrestle to wrestle this guy bro,
he like it.

2085
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:48.540
He came on here.
Yeah.
He'll ride his game close.
But if,
uh,

2086
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:52.530
if I just slow down in my mind be like,
okay,
he's a wrestler.
Yeah,

2087
02:04:52.531 --> 02:04:56.820
let's work around the wrestling.
Oh no problem.
Yeah.
You know,
but once,
once he,

2088
02:04:56.821 --> 02:05:00.020
if he can give up the wrestling rules,
you know,
you know how he,

2089
02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:01.860
he,

2090
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:06.860
cause he has that FLS CISM he can switch his hips like all quick base just like,

2091
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:10.700
like he's built into the ground.
That's how good his basis,
you know,
it's,

2092
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:15.030
but yeah,
wrestling.
Yeah.
And I guess from a human nature perspective here,

2093
02:05:15.031 --> 02:05:17.490
if you were to apply this to other situations in life,

2094
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:20.820
think about when you're trying to get people to do things,

2095
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:24.390
think about the motivation that they have and their had not,

2096
02:05:24.391 --> 02:05:27.720
not motivation of like,
Hey,
let's go,
but not the actual,

2097
02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:33.230
the actual mental motivation of what they're going to gain from what you're

2098
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:37.950
trying to give them and do they see the reason of why it's important?
Yeah,

2099
02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:41.220
very got apply that across the board.
Jujitsu.

2100
02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:48.000
Wrestling is wrestling,
grappling,
grappling is like next question.

2101
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.450
Hello.

2102
02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:52.890
Do you happen to have a podcast discussing loyalty to marriage that involves

2103
02:05:52.891 --> 02:05:57.090
marriage to a service member?
I see many marriages,

2104
02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.360
military spouse where the service member has a great background in

2105
02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.400
<v 0>Lateri but lacks marriage at home.</v>

2106
02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:09.110
You know,
I actually have answered this question before,

2107
02:06:09.170 --> 02:06:12.290
and maybe not this specific,

2108
02:06:12.291 --> 02:06:17.180
but I'm going to go over it quickly just because this isn't just about military,

2109
02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:21.800
you know,
relationships,
it's about any relationship,

2110
02:06:21.801 --> 02:06:24.500
but you know from a military perspective,
absolutely.

2111
02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:28.430
Military relationships are very hard.
You've got time away,

2112
02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.080
you got classified work.

2113
02:06:30.081 --> 02:06:32.240
There's a lack of understanding of what's going on at work,

2114
02:06:32.690 --> 02:06:36.110
then you've got lives as deck,
right?
And with that,

2115
02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:42.100
the job has to come first and that's a very hard thing for people to understand

2116
02:06:43.161 --> 02:06:47.390
that the job has to come first.
Why does it have to come first for survival?

2117
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:52.610
Because the harder you train,
the better you know your teammates,

2118
02:06:52.670 --> 02:06:54.440
the battery shot you are,

2119
02:06:55.490 --> 02:06:59.630
the better your chance for actual survival in a combat situation.

2120
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:04.760
So a spouse has got to understand that,
right?

2121
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:10.330
That in order for the service member to take care of the family family,

2122
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:16.000
the service member has to do his utmost to prepare himself and his team for war.

2123
02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.960
The number one priority.
Now,

2124
02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:29.080
what the spouse has to understand is that this doesn't mean that he wants to

2125
02:07:31.251 --> 02:07:33.440
spend time away from his family.

2126
02:07:33.650 --> 02:07:38.650
He doesn't want to prioritize his team over his family.

2127
02:07:39.461 --> 02:07:43.330
He doesn't want to miss the recital,
doesn't want to miss the ballgame,

2128
02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:47.590
doesn't want to miss the teacher's conference,
but he has to.

2129
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:52.180
He has to.
So spouse

2130
02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:58.540
don't be mad when he makes that priority except an understand that the family is

2131
02:08:01.731 --> 02:08:05.540
the number one priority.
It is the number one priority.

2132
02:08:05.541 --> 02:08:08.090
But in order to be there for the family,

2133
02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:15.330
he's got to prepare for war so that he can come home to his family after

2134
02:08:16.451 --> 02:08:19.210
deployment.
Now this,

2135
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:24.240
this obviously also applies to police.

2136
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.740
This applies to firefighters.
And I'll tell you what,

2137
02:08:27.130 --> 02:08:29.410
it applies really to the breadwinner,

2138
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:36.040
man or wife or husband or wife in any walk of life,
right?

2139
02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:40.880
If you're the breadwinner for the family,
you've that,
that's what you're doing.

2140
02:08:40.881 --> 02:08:41.061
You,

2141
02:08:41.061 --> 02:08:46.061
the way that you're taking care of the family is by bringing home money so that

2142
02:08:46.461 --> 02:08:51.461
there is food and housing and clothing and a secure future.

2143
02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:56.210
That's what you're doing.
And so the,

2144
02:08:56.211 --> 02:09:00.930
the spouse in these situations has to understand that the hard work,

2145
02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:05.880
the hard work and the hours and the days and the weeks that are taken away from

2146
02:09:05.881 --> 02:09:06.714
the family

2147
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:11.690
is actually done to provide for the family,
right?

2148
02:09:13.250 --> 02:09:16.850
So that's the,
the key piece that,
that people have to understand that,
that,

2149
02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.030
that the,
the spouse has to understand.

2150
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:26.170
Now the service member,
and again I've,
I've talked about this before,

2151
02:09:26.171 --> 02:09:30.340
the service member or the firefighter or the police officer or the breadwinner,

2152
02:09:30.341 --> 02:09:34.150
what they have to do is they have to make sure that they don't go overboard,

2153
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:38.950
that they draw the line somewhere,

2154
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:42.730
that they don't destroy what it is that you're trying to protect.

2155
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:44.740
Don't destroy what it is you're trying to take care of.

2156
02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:48.280
Don't give the plants so much water that you drown it.

2157
02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:53.110
Don't cook the steak so long that you burn it.

2158
02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.440
Don't work so hard for your family that you don't have a family anymore.

2159
02:10:01.670 --> 02:10:03.920
You got to have the balance

2160
02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:07.000
in.

2161
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.730
One of the things that you've got to do is you got to explain that to the family

2162
02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:13.960
and you got to tell them what's up and you got to tell them that they are the

2163
02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:18.400
most important thing and that all this work that you're doing that's taking you

2164
02:10:18.401 --> 02:10:20.770
away from them is actually being done for them.

2165
02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:24.470
And you got to communicate that to them.

2166
02:10:24.471 --> 02:10:27.250
They got to understand it's hard for them to listen to hard for uh,

2167
02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:30.550
an eight year old kid.
Don't understand why you're missing the,

2168
02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.070
the the baseball game or watch this year old girl while

2169
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:38.150
<v 1>you're missing the digit three tournament or whatever.
It's hard to explain that,</v>

2170
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:40.430
but you've got to at least try.

2171
02:10:40.431 --> 02:10:43.260
You got to make it evident to them and you also have to make sure you don't have

2172
02:10:43.261 --> 02:10:45.470
viewed abuse it.
Right.

2173
02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:50.471
Because work work can be fun and hanging out with our teammates for an extra day

2174
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:59.741
of shooting or an extra day of jumping or having a beer at the pub on the way

2175
02:10:59.991 --> 02:11:03.320
home,
that can also sometimes be more appealing than the recital,

2176
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:08.480
then the ballgame.
So don't abuse it.

2177
02:11:09.590 --> 02:11:09.880
You,

2178
02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.880
you have to take care of your family and you have to talk to each other and

2179
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:19.580
understand this balance together,

2180
02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:26.020
understand the sacrifices that are being made on both sides so that you can work

2181
02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:32.171
it out and maintain the strength of that entity,

2182
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:34.340
the family that you're trying to take care of.

2183
02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:41.420
Great.
Yeah,
and I mean I walk the line on this one.

2184
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:44.600
I work hard and I worked hard for my whole life.
Yeah.

2185
02:11:44.601 --> 02:11:46.550
And it's going to depend too,
right?

2186
02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:49.540
I mean like how you say don't work so hard that you don't have,

2187
02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:54.350
it depends how rigid or resilient like the family is.

2188
02:11:54.351 --> 02:11:55.840
And that has to do with like,
you know,

2189
02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:59.180
UX explaining and it's Kinda like lifting and overtraining.

2190
02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:02.330
I'm lifting so I can get these results when I rest are all this stuff.
Right.

2191
02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:05.000
But if I'm just living live a little lifting,
no wrath and,

2192
02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:08.600
but it's going to depend depending on how strong I am to begin with kind of

2193
02:12:08.601 --> 02:12:12.370
thing.
So I mean,
yeah,
man,
make sense.
You know,
it's,

2194
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:15.800
it's helpful when you got to explain it though.
Like how you say with everything,

2195
02:12:16.130 --> 02:12:19.250
just keep explaining about my daughter yesterday,

2196
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:21.980
last night asked me why she wasn't sad or nothing like that,
but she's like,

2197
02:12:21.981 --> 02:12:25.010
why do you work so much things?
I mean,
let's face,
I don't work so much,

2198
02:12:25.011 --> 02:12:26.090
but as far as she's concerned,

2199
02:12:26.091 --> 02:12:28.500
if I'm not playing with her at that moment or your work to me,

2200
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:32.480
I can work one minute.
She's like,
I work too much.
But I was like,
Oh Dang.

2201
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.070
I had to think of it from her perspective,
you know?
And I explained it,

2202
02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:39.490
I explained it all and she had fun me explaining it,
you know,

2203
02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:42.980
and now she understands.
I had,
uh,
you know,
I was like,
Eh,
sitting,

2204
02:12:42.981 --> 02:12:46.610
having dinner with my,
with my family,
you know,

2205
02:12:46.611 --> 02:12:49.790
and we don't eat together every single night cause we're all busy doing a bunch

2206
02:12:49.791 --> 02:12:50.624
of different things.

2207
02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:53.750
So we were having dinner and for some reason I had something going on.

2208
02:12:53.751 --> 02:12:57.110
It's business where eyes pulled out my phone and I was texting someone going

2209
02:12:57.111 --> 02:13:01.730
back and forth and you know,
one of my kids was,
you know,

2210
02:13:01.731 --> 02:13:05.480
why you on your phone right now?
And then you know,

2211
02:13:05.481 --> 02:13:08.300
my like wife chimed in.
Yeah,
I can't,
you just put that down.

2212
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:12.890
And I said,
hey,
just so everybody knows,

2213
02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:17.360
did you get defensive?
I did get a little bit defensive.
I said,

2214
02:13:17.570 --> 02:13:21.290
just so everybody knows if I could,

2215
02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:26.450
I would take this phone and throw it in the ocean and never look at it again.

2216
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:32.950
But I have work to do and sometimes my work involves working at night and some,

2217
02:13:35.610 --> 02:13:37.590
and most of the time if I'm working at night,

2218
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.520
it's on this little gadget right here that I have to look at.

2219
02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:43.830
So that's why I'm doing this.

2220
02:13:43.831 --> 02:13:46.860
Not because I don't want to listen to you and not because I don't want to sit

2221
02:13:46.861 --> 02:13:49.380
here and just focus on the family right now.

2222
02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:54.150
But guess what I got work to do and the work that I'm doing is not for me.

2223
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.670
It's for this family so we can have a house so we can have food on the table.

2224
02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:00.910
<v 3>Okay,</v>

2225
02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:05.830
<v 1>so back off.
But they got the point,
you know what I mean?</v>

2226
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:08.950
I didn't really yelled the back off point,
but they understand,
they realize,

2227
02:14:08.951 --> 02:14:10.660
you know,
and for you know,
for my,

2228
02:14:10.690 --> 02:14:14.500
for my young daughter that wasn't there five years old at the time,
I said,

2229
02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:18.400
this is how we get food and this is how you get toys.

2230
02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.850
I have to work to buy you toys.
Yeah.
You know,

2231
02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:25.300
do you not want any more toys?
She was like,
no,
I'm good.

2232
02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:29.830
Go ahead and answer the phone.
Did you have work to do?
Yeah,

2233
02:14:29.831 --> 02:14:33.880
tha tha tha that's why you have toys.
That was part of my speech too.

2234
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.300
There you go.
That was it.
All nuts though.
You didn't get nuts like I did.

2235
02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:40.480
It wasn't very confrontational.
She's like smiling.
She is,

2236
02:14:40.481 --> 02:14:42.850
she is a good conference.
Keep in mind when I'm working,

2237
02:14:42.851 --> 02:14:47.020
she has the option to jump on my lap.
Right.
Keep that in mind.
So it's,
it's,

2238
02:14:47.021 --> 02:14:50.020
this isn't a troublesome situation and I understand that,

2239
02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:52.930
but the point still is there though.
You explain it.

2240
02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2241
02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:58.610
<v 1>Like you explained it or like how I explained it and if they know and they</v>

2242
02:14:58.611 --> 02:15:00.980
understand that,
it's like,
it's clear,
you know,
but not,

2243
02:15:00.981 --> 02:15:04.010
that's not to say that they don't have a point though,
because sometimes,

2244
02:15:04.011 --> 02:15:08.120
especially if you don't explain or you're not engaged at all these people who

2245
02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:10.180
yourself,

2246
02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:12.620
you need to check yourself and make sure that you're not going overboard,

2247
02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:14.780
then you're not abusing it because you know what,

2248
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:20.330
as does that client really need to hear from me at this moment?

2249
02:15:20.331 --> 02:15:23.780
Yes.
The answer is,
and this is,
you know,
I figured out years later,
it's like,
no,

2250
02:15:23.781 --> 02:15:27.320
actually they don't need to hear from you right now.
Yeah.
Not all the time.

2251
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:28.490
Sometimes yes,
sometimes,

2252
02:15:28.491 --> 02:15:31.940
but they can hear from you a little bit later after dinner.
Yeah.

2253
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:37.280
When I text you right back,
you have to respond right back.
Yeah.
No,

2254
02:15:37.281 --> 02:15:41.000
you have to respond to that.
One of them busy.
Crazy.

2255
02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:45.980
We got a diaper one morning shake.
No,
we don't,
but we're gonna do that anyway.

2256
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.863
Jocko,

2257
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:52.970
do you have a specific place or time you spend thinking specifically about your

2258
02:15:52.971 --> 02:15:54.500
fallen comrades?

2259
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:59.623
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2260
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:08.880
<v 1>Anytime that things are going</v>

2261
02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.210
good,
then my life.
Any moment of happiness.

2262
02:16:15.650 --> 02:16:16.483
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2263
02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:22.150
<v 1>Anytime I'm enjoying my life from thinking about</v>

2264
02:16:25.570 --> 02:16:27.070
what the future holds,

2265
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:34.390
<v 0>that's when I think about my friends</v>

2266
02:16:35.970 --> 02:16:36.803
that died.

2267
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.213
So

2268
02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.490
surfing after a good wave and waiting for the next one

2269
02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:54.080
after some good jujitsu training after a good workout or a good meal,

2270
02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:02.720
or maybe a smile or a laugh with a friend or having an ice cream cone with my,

2271
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:14.370
with my daughter
or playing guitar with my son,

2272
02:17:14.371 --> 02:17:18.390
or catching up,
catching a little smile from my wife

2273
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:25.840
at those moments,

2274
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.010
at those moments.
Without a doubt.

2275
02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:32.700
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2276
02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:36.360
<v 0>That's when I think of mark and that's what I think of Mikey and that's where I</v>

2277
02:17:36.361 --> 02:17:41.110
think Orion
and that's when I think of,

2278
02:17:44.430 --> 02:17:48.760
when I think of
all those,

2279
02:17:49.390 --> 02:17:50.980
those brave souls,

2280
02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:59.250
those brave souls that a phone

2281
02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:07.760
and I always will
always will,

2282
02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:13.880
but you know,
it's not,
it's not a bad thing

2283
02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:18.350
and,
and I don't want you to think that it,

2284
02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:23.750
that it ruins the moment because it doesn't,
it doesn't at all.

2285
02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:30.520
It doesn't fill me with sadness or with sorrow or with pain.

2286
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:35.203
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2287
02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:38.350
<v 0>It doesn't make me angry or frustrated</v>

2288
02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.890
or depressed or dark.

2289
02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:48.020
It doesn't make me focus on on death.

2290
02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:54.733
No,

2291
02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:58.273
<v 3>it</v>

2292
02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.320
<v 0>doesn't do that at all.</v>

2293
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.983
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2294
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:11.420
<v 0>It makes,
it makes me want to live.</v>

2295
02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:17.050
Makes me want to live more and do more.

2296
02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:18.820
It makes me want to be more

2297
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:24.880
10 to know at those moments,

2298
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.210
those precious moments,
this,
this life,

2299
02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:39.150
this life is a gift from those men.

2300
02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.880
They gave this to me,
they gave me that moment

2301
02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:54.670
and because
they gave it to me,

2302
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:56.860
they don't have it anymore.

2303
02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:03.960
They gave us everything they had,

2304
02:20:06.130 --> 02:20:08.890
everything they had,

2305
02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:11.500
they gave to us.

2306
02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:20.480
So I'm grateful,

2307
02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:29.090
grateful to them.
And when I think of them,

2308
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:33.500
I'm not sad.

2309
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:39.890
When I think of them,
I'm happy,

2310
02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:47.010
I'm happy I knew them.
I,
I'm,

2311
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:51.970
I'm happy I served with such heroes

2312
02:20:56.780 --> 02:20:58.310
and I'm happy

2313
02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:05.920
that day gave me the chance to be happy

2314
02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:10.133
today

2315
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:20.730
and I won't let

2316
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:28.880
the dark specter of death drag me down.

2317
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:37.590
Oh,
remember them

2318
02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:43.960
and,
and for them

2319
02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:51.150
I will live.

2320
02:22:00.250 --> 02:22:01.210
And I think that's

2321
02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:07.870
all I've got for tonight.

2322
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:13.670
So
Echo,

2323
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:21.110
did you take a quick minute or 47 minutes and explain how someone can support

2324
02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:26.100
this if they want to?

2325
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:31.300
<v 2>Yup.
So
I'm going to go right into it.</v>

2326
02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:36.490
If you're into supplements actually,
even if you're not into supplement on it.

2327
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:40.480
Supplements.
It's actually not just supplements though.

2328
02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:45.540
It's like all kinds of stuff to improve your whole life game physical like so

2329
02:22:47.171 --> 02:22:52.150
yeah.
Supplements,
whatever.
So mental,
mental,
physical,
um,

2330
02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:58.940
emotional,
even new mood.
It's called noon.

2331
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:04.200
Tried that.
I don't want a new mood.
Yeah.

2332
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:09.660
Somebody told me I should smoke pot.
Sure.
Like,
Hey,
you should go,

2333
02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:12.320
you should just try it.
You know,
you're out of the military now.
You should just,

2334
02:23:12.321 --> 02:23:16.760
you know,
she'll try some pot.
And I was like,
oh,
interesting.
But like why,

2335
02:23:16.761 --> 02:23:19.990
why do you think you know I should do that?
And they said,
well,
you know,
you,

2336
02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:24.530
you won't be so angry all the time then.
And I said,
I like being angry.

2337
02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:27.410
I don't think I'll try your potion.
Yeah.

2338
02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:30.860
Which is also kind of strange.
Even that,

2339
02:23:30.861 --> 02:23:33.890
I mean I know you don't actually like being angry.

2340
02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:37.430
You are also not angry all the time.
That's true.

2341
02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:42.560
I don't think I've ever seen you angry,
but me be three times ever.

2342
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:48.540
Where did I get angry?
You were angry at Dean for something.
Okay.
Well.
Yeah.

2343
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:54.540
And then something else actually.
So one time though,

2344
02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:57.620
that was the only time I could actually,
it was at dean twice.

2345
02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:03.170
Dean can be frustrating.
Hey Man.
And if you're angry all the time,

2346
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:08.690
there's this thing called new mood by taking it.
I took it once but

2347
02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:12.910
I didn't feel like I was in a new mood.

2348
02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:17.560
But from the people that other people that take it cause you don't like,
okay,

2349
02:24:17.561 --> 02:24:19.360
so someone is like anything else.
It's like you're,

2350
02:24:19.361 --> 02:24:22.600
you're probably going to take the ones that you feel like you need or you want

2351
02:24:22.601 --> 02:24:24.190
help with.
You know,
like if you're like,

2352
02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:27.400
okay I got to recover better from it cause I work out so much,

2353
02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:31.210
you're going to take some kind of recovery thing.
You know my joints or whatever,

2354
02:24:31.211 --> 02:24:33.340
you're going to take krill oil or something for your gentle water.

2355
02:24:33.341 --> 02:24:37.060
So new mood is one of those ones where I was like,
okay,
I'm sleeping fine.

2356
02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:41.570
I don't have necessarily like hangover situations or depression or,

2357
02:24:41.571 --> 02:24:45.700
or anything where I need some enhancement.
Not to say that I couldn't benefit.

2358
02:24:45.701 --> 02:24:48.640
I'm not saying that,
but I'm saying I'm not gravitating towards,

2359
02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:53.380
I hear good things,
man.
I hear good thing.
Let's see what else.

2360
02:24:53.410 --> 02:24:55.060
Probably in the back of your mind you're like,
you know,

2361
02:24:55.061 --> 02:24:57.760
I'm cruising right now but I could probably cruise harder.

2362
02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:02.560
Actually no,
I bought it from my wife because she,

2363
02:25:02.561 --> 02:25:07.330
you know how like she's the kind where she like if there's a task like well

2364
02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.810
let's do the task,
real task,
you know?

2365
02:25:09.850 --> 02:25:13.210
Oh you're someone that likes to get stuff done.
Yeah,
yeah,

2366
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:20.770
yeah.
You can see what you didn't like making videos.
The scenario right now

2367
02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.040
I it for her so was she wouldn't be so productive.

2368
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:30.490
I like going to go cause she,
she said that stresses from it.

2369
02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:33.640
Especially with the new bay.
I mean kind of new six,
seven months,
whatever.

2370
02:25:33.641 --> 02:25:37.000
But you know like when it's time to go sleep,
you know the kind where,

2371
02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.970
I don't know if you're like this,
but you know the kind where me,
if I'm like,
Hey,

2372
02:25:39.971 --> 02:25:44.680
I'm going to go take a nap from three to four when I go in at two 59 to go take

2373
02:25:44.681 --> 02:25:47.170
a nap.
In the advent of me doing that,

2374
02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.240
I go into two 59 at three Oh one I'm probably either sleeping or close to sleep,

2375
02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:52.660
you know,

2376
02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:55.720
not everyone's like that where there'll be like all this stuff was on my mind

2377
02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:59.770
because you're going to take a nap and I'm like PTF,
PTF,
PTF,
PTFE.

2378
02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:04.120
TFB tiff canceling.
Yes,
exactly.
So this new moon,

2379
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:07.450
I took a nap the other day though.
I took a like serious nap.

2380
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.010
I was just tired.
Slack,
tired on the couch.

2381
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:17.350
That's kind of how it's,
yeah,
no couch naps are sort of,

2382
02:26:17.410 --> 02:26:19.350
I don't like the couch snaps to bet.

2383
02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:22.280
They're pretty dope cause I think you got to go,
I'm going to nab,
boom,

2384
02:26:22.290 --> 02:26:26.530
going to feed up,
elevate,
set the alarm clock,
couch Napa.
Just like what happened.

2385
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.840
It was weird.
In a way.
And

2386
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:34.510
I guess I'm just speaking from experience,

2387
02:26:34.511 --> 02:26:37.840
I don't have any like technical reason,
but what else

2388
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:42.340
seems like the couch nap,

2389
02:26:42.341 --> 02:26:45.670
you're in this mental state that is kind of like you have low expectations and

2390
02:26:45.671 --> 02:26:48.100
comfort,
you know,
so your body is like,
you know what,

2391
02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:51.280
you might not be the most comfortable but hey,
you're not moving.
So boom,

2392
02:26:51.281 --> 02:26:53.140
you just bossy.
But when I,

2393
02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.970
when you can go like in your room and you lay down and you're like,
wait,
wait,

2394
02:26:57.971 --> 02:27:01.390
wait,
the temperature is just a little bit not cool.
And then you're like,
okay,

2395
02:27:01.391 --> 02:27:03.880
let me adjust the temp.
Oh wait,
wait,
wait.
I hear something outside.

2396
02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:04.930
Let me close the door.
You know?

2397
02:27:04.931 --> 02:27:08.530
So it's almost like you can't sleep because the conditions aren't perfect when

2398
02:27:08.531 --> 02:27:11.470
you have that expectation of perfect conditions.

2399
02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:14.050
But on the couch you don't have that expectation.
You're just like,

2400
02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:16.930
it's like if you're not being outside on a blanket,

2401
02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:21.460
I'll just pull this pillow over my left arm and that'd be good to go.

2402
02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:26.590
So yes,
I mean there just has to do with naps.

2403
02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:31.390
But the new mood one that's for like if you have like stress,

2404
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.290
don't talk about.
If we don't know then talk about another thing.
Yeah,

2405
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:37.440
I think we do know.

2406
02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.550
I think the conversation went in that direction of its own momentum.

2407
02:27:41.551 --> 02:27:45.910
I think the next thing you know we're talking about naps.
I know,

2408
02:27:46.270 --> 02:27:50.950
I know.
So on it.
Yeah.
Okay.
On is the best supplements.
That's it.

2409
02:27:50.951 --> 02:27:55.410
Let's get that out of the way.
Like straight up factually.
Um,

2410
02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:58.150
brother also they have like,
you know,

2411
02:27:58.151 --> 02:28:02.410
more your bar proud the other day so I got some more,
your bars already had them,

2412
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:05.380
whatever did a workout and I like to eat after work.

2413
02:28:05.381 --> 02:28:08.020
I've got to get a certain amount of protein in there and not necessarily,

2414
02:28:08.021 --> 02:28:10.630
oh I'm going for counting my macros,
nothing like that.

2415
02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:15.010
But if you only have like one small piece of half piece of chicken leftover from

2416
02:28:15.011 --> 02:28:18.250
that,
you kind of need more.
My opinion,
I needed more so I was like,

2417
02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:20.770
but I made cool like he was like this brown rice.
It was good,

2418
02:28:20.771 --> 02:28:23.000
but I only had like this half piece of chicken.
So I was like,
shoot,

2419
02:28:23.001 --> 02:28:25.520
I need more meat in there.
Look in their fridge like nothing.

2420
02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.740
So like I got a worry to worry wears and chopped them up and like put it in

2421
02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:33.200
there and like did in no microwave.
He's actually good.

2422
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:37.230
So it was like a buffalo meat,
chicken,
rice,
um,

2423
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.670
concoction concoction.
It was good though.
Even you're used to worry about,

2424
02:28:42.671 --> 02:28:46.340
it's kind of like beef jerky or like,
uh,
was it like soft and moist?

2425
02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:49.880
It was,
no,
he wasn't solid.
It was still the warrior bar.

2426
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:53.930
It was just a warm warrior borrowed.
It worked.
It worked.

2427
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:58.340
The flavor profile or majestically Oh,

2428
02:28:58.350 --> 02:29:00.160
I have to give that one a anyway word.

2429
02:29:00.161 --> 02:29:01.340
Whereas if you didn't know what that is there,

2430
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:06.230
look on on a.com and this buffalo meat in it still gluten free,
by the way.

2431
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:10.100
Anyway.
So the main ones is what?
Krill oil for your joints.

2432
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:14.420
You'd be surprised how much joint degeneration we all have.
That's what I think.

2433
02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:18.260
Okay.
Just get the Krill oil.
Also,

2434
02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:21.560
your genuine entice me into the longer conversations on that page.

2435
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:26.840
I don't want to know about your joint degeneration.
No,
of course.

2436
02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:31.190
You're the one who turned me on to it.
So you can't degeneration joint.

2437
02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:35.220
I gave me for the oil for joint maintenance.
Okay.

2438
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:40.550
This is why Krill.
Okay.
So this Greg,
Greg train back entire asked me,

2439
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:43.640
not yesterday,
not the last time I saw him Sunday.

2440
02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:50.240
I hear your fish oil.
Like what?
No,
he was one who asks it greatly.

2441
02:29:50.250 --> 02:29:54.540
Sister each.
Yeah.
He said Phil,

2442
02:29:54.570 --> 02:29:56.660
what's the difference between fish oil and Krill oil?

2443
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:59.000
Cause I take fish oil or whatever.
What's the difference?
Okay,

2444
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:01.890
here's the difference.
My,
uh,

2445
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:05.240
my wife's dead would say that this dude for Krill is better.
This is why.

2446
02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:08.660
Because Krill oil,
the Omega threes,
Omega threes,
that's what you're going for.

2447
02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:10.790
So they both fish oil and Krill Omega threes.

2448
02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:14.510
So fish oil attaches to your triglycerides.

2449
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:19.250
Krill oil,
Omega three attached here,
phospholipids.

2450
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:23.960
So what does that mean?
Who Cares?
Right?
Who Cares?
Well,
I just want it,
you know,

2451
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.130
am I doing it?
So

2452
02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:31.730
let's say your joints are in nightclub.
Okay,
follow me.

2453
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:34.910
This is perfect analogy.
Your joints,

2454
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:38.420
joints,
or a nightclub.

2455
02:30:38.421 --> 02:30:43.250
That's your joints and you want the Omega threes to get in there,
right?
Right.

2456
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.610
So e Omega threes,
are these your crew?

2457
02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:53.840
Jocko is triglycerides.
Echo is phospholipids.

2458
02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:57.850
Okay.
Hey Jocko is cool.
His crew,
they'll make it a three.

2459
02:30:57.851 --> 02:30:59.330
So we both have Omega threes with us.

2460
02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:02.210
They're attached to me were me and you are on the guest list.
Hey,

2461
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:07.370
who am I going to let in?
Jocko and his rowdy crew of Omega threes,

2462
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:11.600
AP seals.
They do burpees at random times.
They want,
you know,

2463
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:15.410
or echo cause they're just cruising.
They both spend money.

2464
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:19.320
They both all though make it three spend money.
They gotta be in the nightclub,

2465
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:24.360
but we do Omega threes is the bouncing going to let in your Omega threes,

2466
02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.850
threes attached to you.
The triglyceride

2467
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:33.640
or to the phospholipids.
Whose me?
Who probably me.

2468
02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:36.300
So anyway,
boom.

2469
02:31:36.301 --> 02:31:40.490
That's why the Krill oil gets led in better 14 minutes.

2470
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:44.100
40 minutes.
I like two minutes.
But you see what I'm saying?

2471
02:31:44.101 --> 02:31:48.030
That's basically how your body is.
So it's like,
hey,
it's better absorption.

2472
02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:52.980
Krill oil in that,
you know,
Krill oil,
Krill oil format.

2473
02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:56.190
Okay.
For lack of better term.
It just gets better absorption.

2474
02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:00.270
There's other stuff too.
Some antioxidants stuff,
donations university here.

2475
02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:02.910
Anyway.
Get the Krill oil,
take care of your joints.

2476
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.870
You'd be surprised the roles they play in everything.
That's my opinion.

2477
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:11.820
If you're not on that,
get on that.
Also,
a good way to support Amazon,

2478
02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:15.090
click through what you do is you go be free.

2479
02:32:15.091 --> 02:32:18.180
Do Your Amazon shopping even don't already before you do your Amazon shopping,

2480
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:21.780
go to the website Jocko,
podcast.com or chocolate store,
whichever.

2481
02:32:22.410 --> 02:32:24.990
Click on the Amazon link.
Also,

2482
02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:30.260
it's also called support.
Click on support where the Amazon link,
whatever.

2483
02:32:30.261 --> 02:32:31.940
Then you can sell,
you click through the website.

2484
02:32:31.970 --> 02:32:35.350
Then you go do your Amazon shopping.
Outstanding way to support

2485
02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:41.290
really good support.
Then you do shopping as you normally would in boom,

2486
02:32:41.291 --> 02:32:44.290
instant support and you know it doesn't cost you anything.

2487
02:32:44.291 --> 02:32:48.100
It costs you two seconds of your time for big support.
So it's like,
you know,

2488
02:32:48.101 --> 02:32:49.420
small action,
big reaction

2489
02:32:51.730 --> 02:32:56.380
like sodium and water.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,
yeah,
so you understand now if you're,

2490
02:32:56.381 --> 02:32:58.570
if you know what happens to sodium metal when you put it in water,

2491
02:32:58.571 --> 02:33:01.450
that's going to be used.
That's the Amazon Click.
I'm just saying,

2492
02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:06.120
I think it's important to like remember that cause it's,
that's important.

2493
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:08.310
That's dope.
That's dope time.

2497
02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:26.710
if our podcast is in good ranking,
that's cool,

2498
02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:28.213
<v 3>right?</v>

2499
02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:33.530
<v 2>Yeah,
I guess so.
I think so.
Uh,
or subscribe to or an subscribe to Youtube.</v>

2500
02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:35.450
If you're into youtube,
you watch videos,

2501
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:40.570
you can see this podcast obviously in video format or all the excerpts that we

2502
02:33:40.731 --> 02:33:44.440
put on there.
You said that like there's this massive,
there is,

2503
02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.130
there is and there's more coming.

2504
02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:49.550
And you know these are good because you can share them with your friend.

2505
02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:52.370
You know,
if so,
okay.

2506
02:33:52.371 --> 02:33:54.860
So I have some technical knowledge of,

2507
02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:58.580
so I know how to share the link and then in the link that I share,

2508
02:33:58.581 --> 02:34:02.840
I can manipulate the little URL or whatever.

2509
02:34:02.841 --> 02:34:06.500
So when they click on the link,
it'll start at a certain moment in the video.

2510
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:09.650
Right.
It's not hard to do it.
You just,
there's little setting.
But anyway,

2511
02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:13.010
I can do that.
So if I'm,
if I'm like,
Hey,

2512
02:34:13.011 --> 02:34:17.740
let me share Jockos take on this with,
with my friend Jill or whatever,

2513
02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:21.130
then he,
cause I think he could benefit or this is what he was asking me about,

2514
02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:23.590
hey,
here it is.
I can send them the whole podcast.

2515
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:28.480
I just manipulated the thing to the little bookmark place where he can start.

2516
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:31.390
But if you don't,
you don't want to do all of that.

2517
02:34:31.391 --> 02:34:34.330
You can just find the excerpt that I put on the youtube channel,
you know,

2518
02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:38.620
they're just more sharable so they don't have to listen to the whole podcast to

2519
02:34:38.621 --> 02:34:41.770
get the,
that's a civic lesson.
That's really cool.

2520
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:46.150
You'd think that there would be a lot of those from your excitement about them?

2521
02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.670
Yeah,
it depends on what you mean by a lot,
but I think,
yeah,

2522
02:34:48.671 --> 02:34:53.210
there's some significant,
you know.
Okay,
we're putting more on there.

2523
02:34:53.211 --> 02:34:56.110
You'll be the judge of that over here on this end.

2524
02:34:57.790 --> 02:35:02.080
Also Jocko has a store.
If you didn't know,

2525
02:35:02.081 --> 02:35:05.920
it's called Jocko store.com if you,
um,
you know,
if,

2526
02:35:05.921 --> 02:35:10.300
if you like these shirts that we make and we put effort into the shirts,

2527
02:35:10.330 --> 02:35:13.870
they're not like the cheap,
make a Stencil,
spray paint,

2528
02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:18.370
cheap Hanes,
nothing.
Hanes is cheap but cheap shirt here.

2529
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:21.580
Can you give away for it?
It's not that kind of,
they're good like quality

2530
02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:24.693
seems scene.

2531
02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:28.240
I say the spray paint thing cause I've made shirts like that before when I was a

2532
02:35:28.241 --> 02:35:32.230
kid.
Yeah.
So they're not that kind of,
they're good.
They got some,
you know,

2533
02:35:32.530 --> 02:35:35.280
some cool does that.
Hey if you like,
I'm so check out those.
Go there Jacqueline,

2534
02:35:35.290 --> 02:35:36.970
store.com if you want to support in that way,

2535
02:35:36.971 --> 02:35:39.730
get a shirt and represent in the wild

2536
02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:44.650
boom women's stuff,
whatever.
Shirts,
patches,
rash guards,

2537
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:46.990
19% performance increase,

2538
02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:52.150
proven hundred 47% proven 19% improvement.

2539
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:55.810
Who does as well.
It's getting warmer.
I understand,
but still it's cold.

2540
02:35:55.820 --> 02:36:00.820
Someplaces Michigan called the hoodies are probably good for this time of year

2541
02:36:01.181 --> 02:36:04.810
right now know because they are the heaviest of weight.

2542
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:10.120
Next winter we're going to go Jocko style on the hoodies.

2543
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:14.860
They're gonna be heavy weight.
This year we would echo style,
lightweight,
Kohai,

2544
02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:20.200
Kohai there's still hoodies but they're not as heavy duty.

2545
02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:24.040
They're like medium,
heavy,
medium.
I think technically there,

2546
02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.610
I think there are medium heavy light detecting.
Next year we're going to heavy,

2547
02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:30.470
heavy,
heavy,
heavy.
Yeah.
Um,

2548
02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:33.250
or we could go light for the spring summer as well.
Oh,

2549
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:37.060
let's not just do the whole fashion thing where I'm going to make one time for

2550
02:36:37.061 --> 02:36:41.500
now.
Anyway,
go there and tell us,

2551
02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:44.530
look at what you want.
Bring Line of moving.

2552
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:49.690
Stop bringing collection.
Yeah.
But yes,

2553
02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:53.290
if something looks good to you,
support that way.

2554
02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.850
Represent also psychological warfare.
Now look,
support the podcasts.

2555
02:36:57.970 --> 02:37:02.770
I dig it and thank you
everyone who supported,

2556
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:07.000
but psychological warfare.
That one is a support yourself situation.

2557
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:12.100
Really.
If you're weak,
this is what it is.
Psychological warfare.

2558
02:37:12.101 --> 02:37:14.680
If you didn't already.
I know.
Explain every time,
but I'm gonna explain it again.

2559
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:18.890
If you're feeling moments of weakness in regards to your workout or waking up

2560
02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.010
early or slipping on the,
on the whole diet program.

2561
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:27.020
And I don't mean Diet like I'm just saying,
eating correctly and not incorrectly.

2562
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:29.780
If you're about to slip on that you get enticed,

2563
02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:34.250
like my sister explained she did with her son,
brings home some brownies,

2564
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:36.200
she couldn't help it eat the brownies.

2565
02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.260
Now she's paying for it on the treadmill according to her,
her words,
not mine.

2566
02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.620
At the moment of the introduction of the brownies or donuts as the case may be,

2567
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:51.470
you put on one of these tracks,
it's called sugarcoated lies,
snack time,

2568
02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.550
shoes,
Gert coated lies.
Listen to Jocko.

2569
02:37:55.551 --> 02:38:00.551
He'll explain to you some stuff that will cause you to not slip on that plan.

2570
02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:06.200
And this goes for,
like I said,
waking up during the workout,
uh,

2571
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:08.570
pushing yourself during the workout,
all this stuff,

2572
02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:11.930
getting your work to all this stuff.
So if you need a spot in those areas,

2573
02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:17.450
look into that.
It's called psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink.
It's on iTunes.

2574
02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:22.190
Good way to support yourself and by happenstance it supports the podcast as
well.

2575
02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:23.053
Double whammy

2576
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:27.830
<v 0>double gravitational thing.
Also,</v>

2577
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:33.830
while you're clicking through Amazon,
you can order Jocko white tea.

2578
02:38:34.970 --> 02:38:38.900
You can get on amazon.com do the click through,
try it,
be careful,

2579
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:43.580
be careful what you use it,
but give it a try,

2580
02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:48.640
see what happens and I've got a couple more just reviews from amazon.com

2581
02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:55.910
since taking it with me to the gym over ice.

2582
02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:59.930
I not only get to enjoy the semisweet flavor of the tea,

2583
02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:04.910
but I have also noticed increases in strength on squats.

2584
02:39:04.911 --> 02:39:09.911
I've noticed a 15 to 20% increase in strength while using it and my dead lift

2585
02:39:10.971 --> 02:39:15.971
has gone from four 75 to eight oh five extra minutes.

2586
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:20.360
And by the way it says same I suite.
There's no sweetener in the tea.

2587
02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:23.180
It just is what it is,
you know,
sugar in there.

2588
02:39:23.210 --> 02:39:27.170
That would be just hypocritical and I would have to close down my life.

2589
02:39:28.310 --> 02:39:30.830
Another one,
no big deal.

2590
02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:36.940
I'm not a tea drinker but needed a sound substitute to kick the Diet Soda Jocko

2591
02:39:37.641 --> 02:39:40.040
White Tea is what the reviews say.

2592
02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.680
I drink it iced and I love the taste.
Since Drinking Jocko White Tea,

2593
02:39:46.130 --> 02:39:51.130
Mike Total and free t levels have increased.

2594
02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:58.220
I don't have the labs to back up my claim,
but my voice is deeper,

2595
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:59.810
my muscles are leaner,

2596
02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:04.960
energy increased and my wife's favorite result is increased stamina.

2597
02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.850
I feel 21 again,
enjoy the tea and support the podcast.

2598
02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:15.660
Tang again,
science,

2599
02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.210
these are from Amazon,
right?
These are peer reviewed,

2600
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:26.190
reputable,
reputable and Jocko white tea.

2601
02:40:26.250 --> 02:40:31.020
You can get it and you could write a funny review like everybody else is doing a

2602
02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:35.610
little book coming out called way of the warrior kid.
By the way,

2603
02:40:35.611 --> 02:40:36.510
it's coming out soon.

2604
02:40:36.570 --> 02:40:41.570
It's coming out May 2nd it's going to sell out and once people read the initial

2605
02:40:42.751 --> 02:40:46.080
ones that sell out the people that got it,
they're going to order more.

2606
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:48.420
It's going to be back ordered and you're not gonna be able to get one.

2607
02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:51.480
It's ordered now real easy.
Also,

2608
02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:55.740
discipline equals freedom field manual that's coming in October.

2609
02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:00.210
Same thing.
Order it so you can get a copy.

2610
02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:05.100
When it comes out the manual,
we'll show you how to get after it.

2611
02:41:05.610 --> 02:41:09.090
That's it.
It's the field manual.
You will know how to get after it.

2612
02:41:09.150 --> 02:41:12.420
You get the field manual,
there's money equals freedom.
You've heard that.

2613
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:16.890
You probably think that.
You actually probably know that.
How do you execute it?

2614
02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.600
You get the field man,
you following instructions,
workouts,
thoughts,

2615
02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:26.550
food intake,
sleep habits.
Everything's in there.
No factor.
Extreme ownership.

2616
02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:31.440
Also
it's just word of mouth,
keeping it in the top.

2617
02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:35.520
One to 200 on Amazon.
That's insane.

2618
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.310
Thank you all for spreading the word

2619
02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:42.540
and getting your people in the game.

2620
02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:45.600
Get them a copy you don't want.

2621
02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:49.050
Write a little note in the copy that you get for your team.

2622
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:55.680
I'm a little advice what chapter you think is suited for them.

2623
02:41:57.270 --> 02:42:00.390
Get them on board up and down the chain of command.
By the way,

2624
02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:04.650
you don't want your whole team to be outperforming your leadership,

2625
02:42:04.651 --> 02:42:07.620
which is what will happen if you just get the book for them and you

2626
02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.130
Ashkelon Front leadership and management consulting,

2627
02:42:15.810 --> 02:42:17.160
keynote speeches.
Yup.

2628
02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:22.830
We do those long range leadership alignment programs.
So yes,

2629
02:42:22.831 --> 02:42:26.610
that is what we do.
So me,

2630
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:30.480
Lafe JP,
Dave Burke,

2631
02:42:31.650 --> 02:42:36.650
combat leadership applied to business and life and check the website echelon

2632
02:42:37.501 --> 02:42:42.501
front.com or email info@echelonfront.com also the muster,

2633
02:42:47.130 --> 02:42:47.963
and again,

2634
02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:53.100
this is not a seminar about getting pumped up.

2635
02:42:54.090 --> 02:42:57.840
No,
it isn't a seminar about finding yourself.

2636
02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:04.520
It's not going to help you channel your internal ci towards the eternal bliss.

2637
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:11.770
It's not going to do that.
This is not what the musters about.

2638
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:13.390
The muster is about leadership,

2639
02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:20.160
pragmatic leadership skills for you to use in your business and your life.

2640
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:24.100
You work with people,

2641
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:30.120
you lead people or you aspire to lead people who's going to teach you how to do

2642
02:43:30.371 --> 02:43:33.880
that?
Where are you gonna learn that from?
Actual question.

2643
02:43:33.881 --> 02:43:37.450
Where do you learn that from?
Who's going to teach it to you?

2644
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:42.040
That's the question.
The answer is the muster.

2645
02:43:44.410 --> 02:43:49.210
Learn to lead your people.
Learn to lead yourself.

2646
02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:54.190
May 4th and fifth New York City Marriott,
Grand Marquis.

2647
02:43:54.430 --> 02:43:59.290
Are we playing around?
No,
we are not.
The first minister was awesome.

2648
02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:03.100
Agree.
Why are we having a second muster?
Because the first semester was awesome.

2649
02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:07.090
That's why we're having a second muster.
So come to it

2650
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:14.250
and until we see you at the muster,
because by the way,

2651
02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:19.170
I'm going to be,
their life's going to be there.
Jp is going to be there.

2652
02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.340
Dave Burke going to be there.

2653
02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:24.530
That's not enough for you and you need something to kind of close the deal.

2654
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:26.520
Don't worry cause Echo Charles is going to be,

2655
02:44:26.521 --> 02:44:29.760
they're probably giving the four hour speech to the public

2656
02:44:32.730 --> 02:44:33.600
until the muster.

2657
02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:39.560
You can also find us more on the interwebs cruising and an echoes case cruising

2658
02:44:40.681 --> 02:44:43.380
hard.
We're on Twitter,

2659
02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:46.680
Instagram and Facebook.

2660
02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:52.290
Echo is at Echo,
Charles and I am at jockowillink.

2661
02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:53.520
And lastly,

2662
02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:58.710
thanks for listening and giving us feedback and inspiring us to do this.

2663
02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:03.150
Inspiring us to do better and to be better

2664
02:45:05.650 --> 02:45:09.710
knowing that we aren't alone on this mission.

2665
02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:15.120
No one that you all are with us in the game.

2666
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:20.500
Standing Watch,
not backing down,

2667
02:45:20.501 --> 02:45:24.430
not settling for average,
not just going through the motions,

2668
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.713
but living,

2669
02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:30.560
living life,

2670
02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:35.270
living life hard and fast and aggressively,

2671
02:45:38.310 --> 02:45:42.660
and taking every opportunity to step up,

2672
02:45:43.290 --> 02:45:44.790
step forward,

2673
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:49.720
step on fear and step on failure

2674
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:54.010
in step toward a better you

2675
02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:01.930
and step out
into the unknown

2676
02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:05.560
to get after it.

2677
02:46:08.590 --> 02:46:10.450
So until next time,

2678
02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:16.300
this is echo and Jocko
out.
