00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.110
This is Jocko podcast number one 68 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.480
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.870
Beowulf spoke.

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.390
Why Sir do not grieve.

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.620
It is always better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.970
For every one of us.

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
Living in this world means waiting for our end.

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.790
Let whoever can win glory before death.

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.230
When a warrior is gone,
that will be his best and only bowl work.

10
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.880
So arise my lord and let us immediately set forth on the trail of this troll

11
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.520
dam.
I guarantee you,

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
she will not get away not to dens underground nor upland groves,

13
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.410
nor the ocean floor.

14
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.320
She'll have nowhere to fleet to and dirty your troubles today.

15
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.300
Bear up and be the man I expect you to be.

16
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.290
There is some more Beowulf to start this podcast and it's an interesting note

17
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.660
that Beowulf,
the poem started not as a written poem,

18
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.170
but a poem passed on as a story from generation to generation of the Pagan Anglo

19
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.760
Saxon Warrior people.

20
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.200
It was part of their oral history in their oral tradition and that's basically

21
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.034
what we're doing here.

22
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.090
Capturing stories from our modern day warrior people,

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.320
which we are continuing with today during part two of my brother Jason Gardner.

24
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.530
Part one was the last podcast number one 67 so if you haven't listened to that

25
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.260
one,
just stop listening to this one right now.

26
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.220
Go back and listen to one 67 and then when you get done with that you can come

27
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:12.170
back and hear the rest of it.
And if you have listened to 61 67 when here we go.

28
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.960
We're going to start kind of where we left off.
What's up Jason?

29
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.900
Now much happy to be here.
Check.
So we left off yesterday.

30
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.850
You had basically you'd stayed at team three you're going to an ops tour,

31
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.800
an ops task unit,
ops tour,

32
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.940
but then you made senior chief and then that's where we left off.

33
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.710
So you get done with that and where'd you go seal things happen.

34
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.040
<v 2>The one over to the senior enlisted academy and knock that out because that is</v>

35
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.990
basically a prerequisite for making ie nine but it's difficult to get away from

36
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:50.850
NSW for that long course.
That one was six weeks.
There's two of them,

37
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.930
there's another one that's three months and it's just trying to cram that in.

38
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220
It is difficult.
So it made sense to go then and then they,
they pop me over

39
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.780
<v 0>for a,
uh,
a troop,
senior enlisted advisor over its seal team seven.</v>

40
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.710
And so for people that don't know what that means,
you're going into a task unit,

41
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.550
your task,
would you,

42
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.170
did you guys have a two platoon task unit or was it it was to check and that

43
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.700
means explain your position of senior enlisted advisor in a sealed tasking it.

44
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.680
So there are two seal platoons,
which are the two maneuver elements.

45
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.100
And then over the top of the seal platoons,
there's myself,

46
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.520
I was a senior chief at the time and then there was a,
uh,

47
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.360
a lieutenant commander at the time it was the,
the task unit commander.

48
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.930
It was the same position that you had in a tea brews.
Yup.

49
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.400
And then you were the senior enlisted guy in there.

50
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.030
And I was actually looking at one of my old briefs leadership briefs from the

51
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.090
teams.
I don't know if you remember this cause I haven't,

52
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.550
I don't do it when I do it for civilians now.

53
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.930
But I used to do the roles and responsibilities of everyone inside the the task

54
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.800
unit and be like,
okay,

55
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.170
this is what the task and the commanders and should be doing.

56
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.970
This is what the senior enlisted guy should be doing.

57
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.210
And a keyword there is this sort of platoon chief should be doing and this is

58
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.580
what a platoon commander should be doing.
One of the key words there is,

59
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.423
should be,

60
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.050
because there's a lot of leeway depending on personalities and what skill sets

61
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.681
people have.

62
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:13.660
And sometimes people are capable of doing a part of someone else's job but

63
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.150
they're maybe not so great at doing something they should be doing.

64
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.520
So you gotta figure that out inside of a platoon.
Now,

65
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:22.090
I used to say that when you take a platoon,
if you take a platoon,

66
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.760
you've got to get to,
like,
you could pick a number,

67
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:29.320
like you've got to get to a level 10 with the top four leadership,

68
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.260
meaning the Lpo,
the assistant platoon commander of the platoon commander.

69
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.400
And the platoon chief,
those,
they have to have a number equal to 10.

70
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.220
Like you can't have a bunch of guys that are ones,
cause that's only a four,

71
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.160
but you,
if you have a chief that's an eight,
well then cool.
It's like,

72
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.690
doesn't really matter that the platoon commander is not that great or the

73
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.010
platoon commanders a wand or whatever.
Um,
and,
and that's fine.

74
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.000
Sometimes you're going to get some guys that are really good at something.

75
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.440
Sometimes there's people that aren't.

76
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.070
And as long as you have some good leadership in there,
you'll be all right.

77
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:02.800
And that's what I realized when I was running trade it,
you just basically need,

78
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.690
you need one leader,

79
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.190
one person that knows how to lead things and everything will be fine.
You,

80
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.620
but you actually should have two people that know how to lead things.

81
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.990
So that way if something happens to the number one guy and then they can kind of

82
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.420
communicate and they can talk to each other and they can bounce stuff off and

83
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.620
they'll just be like infinitely better.
Um,
but yeah,
it's uh,

84
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.960
it's always a little bit different in every task unit and well that was great

85
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.040
because that roles and responsibilities brief that you gave at the time,

86
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.590
the tea,

87
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.940
you tasking your leadership going through the unit level training was,

88
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.920
was new and it was kind of a new position all the way together.

89
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:43.300
So it wasn't really well defined.

90
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.130
I was really like where the hell is my role here?
Um,
so that,

91
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:49.060
that was really helpful.

92
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:54.061
And I think what you and your troop sea did is you kind of define,

93
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.980
cause you guys participated in training and not all

94
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.300
<v 2>the troops,
troop commanders in troop sea days,</v>

95
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.110
we're going out to every you lt block.

96
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.053
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.</v>

97
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.900
I didn't know you guys did everything and then after that that was the standard.

98
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.310
Everybody set that standard and it's a good standard to have.
Yeah.

99
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.110
And I was lucky cause my first deployment to Iraq I had a task unit commander

100
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.360
and in a task unit sea.

101
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.320
And we both are friends with both of those guys and they really,

102
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.210
like I was watching what they were doing going,
okay,

103
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:27.010
that seems to work pretty well.
You know,

104
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.850
just looking at how they interacted with me and they set a good example.

105
00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:32.680
And I kinda just took that when I came back.
And,

106
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.570
and that's the position I put myself into was kind of mimicking what those two

107
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:40.870
guys had done.
And they bet were really well balanced,
you know,

108
00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:44.050
not micro and they're just this guilt,
just really good leaders,
you know?

109
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.920
And so I just,
okay,
that was cool.
That worked.
And so that's what I did.

110
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:50.890
And then luckily I got to go through workup and then go to Ramadi.

111
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:54.590
So I kind of knew how it,
you know,
I,

112
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.020
I carved that out and they're there.
It was,

113
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.710
and then I wrote the rules and responsibilities because believe me,
when I was,

114
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:03.710
when I first took over trade,

115
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:07.210
that there would be all kinds of ways waylay things going on with guys and not

116
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.000
having any idea of what they should and should not be doing because they were,

117
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:13.090
everyone was just going,
what should I do?
Like you said,
it was a new position,

118
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.710
a relatively new position.
I mean,
we had tasking to commanders back in the day,

119
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.100
but it was,
they would be completely detached in and they'd show up,
hey,

120
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:24.330
I'm an o three or no,
four,
I'm in charge of you and everyone to be a little good.

121
00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:26.490
That sounds cool.
Whatever.
Who's this guy?
Yeah.

122
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.090
And you wouldn't see him until deployment.
Yeah.

123
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.790
<v 2>And then now,
now the new thing was,
are you like there from day one,</v>

124
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:34.610
which was really cool.
How we evolve that way.

125
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.700
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
and it's,
it's as it should be.</v>

126
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820
So you get there and form up your platoons and start going through training.

127
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.650
<v 2>You start doing work up.
And so,
you know,
uh,
the task unit commander,</v>

128
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.000
he had a lot of experience.
The both the,

129
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.010
all the platoon leadership had a lot of experience too.
So it was,
it was,

130
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.780
I would say it was stacked.

131
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.800
We had great all the way down to like some of our [inaudible] had deployments to

132
00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:09.220
Iraq.
They had good experience.
So it looked like,
you know,
hey,
this is,

133
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.590
everything's going to be easy.
Um,
and then we started,

134
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.240
started you lt,
uh,
went out to the land warfare block,

135
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
which is really always been where I have a soft spot in my heart because it's,

136
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.230
it's hard,
it's dirty and it's mean.

137
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.610
But,
uh,
you know,
we train out there in the desert.
We were,

138
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.180
we'd gone through the first two weeks of the land warfare block,

139
00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:40.020
which is doing our immediate action drills,
a lot of our range work,
our demo,

140
00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:43.530
all that stuff.
And then we were coming into the phase the last week,

141
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:46.230
which is the field final training exercises.

142
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.630
And so we're,

143
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.160
we're in this big classroom and we're getting the brief on,
you know,
uh,
uh,

144
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:57.000
feedback on,
on the brief that we've just given for our first operation.

145
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.500
And after that,
the,
your,

146
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.330
your land warfare senior enlisted advisor came in,
he's like,

147
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.141
hey everybody,

148
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:12.141
listen up every task unit that's come through here before you guys has had a

149
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.850
blue on blue during this training.

150
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.680
So you need to be really aware of your blue pours picture.
And,
and so,
well,

151
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.330
I'm like,
I'm rolling my eyes and my internal dialogue is,
I'm like,

152
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.110
oh my gosh,
what a bunch of clowns are you kidding me?

153
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.820
Everybody's shot each other.
That is never going to happen to us.
You know,

154
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:37.070
I'm like,
heck,
I used to run land warfare training when I was at,

155
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:40.170
at a training sell at a team and this just isn't that hard.

156
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.830
There's no way we're going to shoot each other.
Okay.
Like,

157
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.910
let's just go four hours later.

158
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.880
It is just mass pandemonium.
We've,
we went in,

159
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.930
we hit a target,

160
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.000
things kind of were going really smooth and then all of a sudden everything fell

161
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.280
apart.
We were,
we had like,

162
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.350
I think we had seven down guys that we were tracking and then,

163
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.670
but that we couldn't even get clear word because everybody was talking on the

164
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:15.810
radio at the same time.
We're trying to break off the target.

165
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.880
There was no organization,
there were guys all over the high ground around us.

166
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.160
I remember real specifically one of the fire teams pointing up to a mountain

167
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:30.480
that was just to our left saying,
Hey,
do we have friendly's up there?

168
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.220
And someone else saying,
no,
we don't have anybody.
You know,

169
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:37.020
and looking at a battle now,
no,
we don't have anybody up there.

170
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.040
And then that fire team wiped out what was our sniper element.

171
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.150
So we had a whole fire team just wipe out,
uh,
you know,

172
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:48.350
our Forman sniper element trying to come down high ground when the down man of

173
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:51.470
their own
and in,
so we,

174
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:55.710
we made it to the extract a dragon,

175
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:59.640
all our bodies out of order,
everybody talking,
get back to the camp,

176
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:03.720
realize we're missing a piece of sensitive equipment.
Um,

177
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.780
and then in the debrief we discover that we'd had this heinous blue on blue and

178
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.290
you know,
a fire team.

179
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:15.291
It pretty much wiped out another fire team and we're just like,

180
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.033
oh man.

181
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.100
So we pushed guys back out to the field to find a gear that we'd lost and thank

182
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:26.910
goodness they found it before we get to stop training to,
to find that gear.

183
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.980
Um,
and then,
you know,
we,

184
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.140
we did by no fault of my own,

185
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
we did a really healthy assessment of what you guys as the training attachment

186
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.310
had put us through.
And instead of going,
Whoa,
you know,
blaming,

187
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:48.060
you guys are making excuses are like,
okay,
let's make a list.

188
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.170
And we knocked out like four things that we messed up the worst for things that

189
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:56.110
we messed up and then how we were going to fix them.
Like,
okay,

190
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.710
well this down man thing,
we don't have it.
Right.

191
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.160
We better start caring and stretchers in the field.
Um,

192
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.870
and then we're going to stick,
each fire team is going to have a pair of bag.

193
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:09.100
So when a guy gets killed,

194
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:11.860
we're taking all the sensitive stuff off of him so we can move them easy.

195
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:16.750
We put them in the pair bag so we don't lose it.
Okay,
that's done.
Alright.

196
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.700
Um,
guys,
we get,
everyone's got to stop talking on the radio at the same time.

197
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:25.840
We got to get some comms disciplines.
We ran some drills.
Uh,

198
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:29.350
we ran drills on how we were going to get head counts.
Um,

199
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.140
and you know,
then we,

200
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:37.141
then we did the drills on how are we going to identify each other in the dark as

201
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:42.820
soon as their bullets without,
you know,

202
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.720
with no coms.
And,
uh,

203
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.060
and so we laid that out and like,
hey everybody,
here's where,

204
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.120
you know,
carry the,
the BS 17 panel.

205
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.890
It's like everyone's going to have that in your left shoulder pocket,

206
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.010
the little three foot ones down.
So that's during daytime.

207
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:07.090
At nighttime we're going to use our strobes.
And,
uh,
well,
you know,

208
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.870
they're at the time and even today,
I'll tell you what,

209
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:14.800
if I was going out today and I was worried about the enemy having night vision,

210
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.120
I would be more worried about,
and this is me personally,

211
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:22.840
and I don't want to argue this with anybody and you can hit me up about my own

212
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:27.070
guys shooting me because they can shoot and they have big guns.

213
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.100
Then the enemy's seeing my strobe.

214
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.450
So that,
that was something that panned out later.

215
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:39.190
So we did that.
I thought we did it in a real healthy way.
We,
we Kinda,

216
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.150
we were really cutting corners with our rehearsals because we don't get graded

217
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:46.900
on a rehearsals.
We get graded on a brief.
So all the effort goes into the brief,

218
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.100
but the brief doesn't stick with you mentally until you go out and rehearse it.

219
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.050
And so we're like,
hey,
here's the way we're going to do are,
uh,
you know,

220
00:13:56.051 --> 00:14:00.400
our head counts and,
and we,
we would do head counts by fire team.

221
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240
Someone would say headcount and then fire team six is up,

222
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.880
five's up for up threes,
up two's up,
one's up like okay we go out,

223
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:14.320
rehearse it and we get to fire team three and the guy would be spacing it and

224
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:18.670
we're like hey fire team three and okay and we get to the point where that was

225
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:22.480
just second nature.
And then to the point where everybody,

226
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:26.770
cause we got decentralized command going on now when we're moving off target

227
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.430
sit,
fire team,
six nos,

228
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.120
a headcount is coming and they just kick it off and it just rolls through and

229
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:38.140
there's,
there's no issues.
So we got that done,

230
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.170
we did our Nascar next FTX we did considerably better but you guys ramped up the

231
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:48.691
pressure and then we had other issues and we're like okay hey when we get all

232
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:53.900
mixed up we got to be able to reorganize without sounding like a high school

233
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.680
cafeteria.
So then I think the next thing we punched into us,

234
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.580
our reorg perimeters in the dark and we would go out and just mix everybody up

235
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.560
and I go boom,
someone won't pass this.

236
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The hand signal for perimeter and then we would go get it and get reorg and uh,

237
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.710
and he ended up like that.
And,
and,

238
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.640
and what I've really enjoyed about the training,

239
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:20.840
and I told people who came through it later was that it was,

240
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.070
it was like,

241
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.300
it was super challenging and it was like,

242
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.110
it was like going to a haunted house and,

243
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.150
and like I enjoy going to haunted houses because I like to go through and

244
00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:36.530
something startles me and I'm not really happy that something like a guy popping

245
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:40.190
out with a chainsaw or whatever startles me.
And so I'll go through it,

246
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.060
then I'll assess how I reacted and I'll go next time,
let's do something new.

247
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:49.061
But it's completely new and unexpected and you guys continued to turn that dial

248
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.190
up of completely new and unexpected and that panned out to work out so well for

249
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.940
us because we had the right attitude about it.

250
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.360
And later on when I'm moving in that position,
when you talk about that later,

251
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.410
I could see a healthy way to deal with that and the not healthy way to deal with

252
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.010
it in a healthy way is all was owning it and taking responsibility and then it

253
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.490
just,
it was so much fun.
I just be,
we'd be done,

254
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.190
we'd be covering sweat,
everybody was yelling and uh,
um,

255
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.490
was a great experience.
And then we just,

256
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.260
we took that and then the other blocks of training and,
and the,

257
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:31.250
the most intense for leadership is definitely land warfare.

258
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.410
And then south,
which is our urban training and we just got hammered there too.

259
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:41.090
And then it's paint ball and a,
a bunch of other stuff.
But uh,

260
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.770
that was great.
One other thing,

261
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.960
like when you did your roles and responsibilities,

262
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.770
you didn't really define a position for the,

263
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.850
the troops senior enlisted advisor because in that you're still like,

264
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:56.440
hey,
you're not really going to be the,

265
00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:01.220
the assault lead or anything else like that.
Because honestly like you've said,

266
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.770
<v 0>yeah,
the thing was could run in a song.
The thing I used to say is,</v>

267
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.160
is the senior enlisted advisor is the action arm for the task unit commander.

268
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.030
So there's going to be things that are going to be need to make be made happen

269
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.400
and that's the guy that's going to make it happen.
So,

270
00:17:17.401 --> 00:17:20.720
oh we got a building that's got a problem or we got to a position that's needs

271
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:24.780
support or we get a wounded guy like in the army and the Marine Corps,

272
00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:28.410
their sop is it who runs a Casio Vac?
It's the senior enlisted guy.

273
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.850
Cause that's the guy that goes,

274
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.210
oh he has the experience to make this happen under a massively stressful

275
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:37.020
situation.
So my word to the senior list of guys were like,
you're the action arm.

276
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.950
This the task unit commander can't make things happen.
He,
he's got to,

277
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.410
he's got to look at what else is going on and he's got to figure out what the

278
00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:45.810
next step is going to be.
He's talking,
getting information,

279
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:47.310
he's passing information.
All that stuff is going to,

280
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.400
he can't take time to go clear an extra building or set up a security perimeter

281
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.210
on this.
Rich talked like he can't do that.

282
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.950
That's the senior enlisted guy that goes,
hey boss.
And obviously he's saying,

283
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.510
hey boss,
if if you want to get out of here,
here's what I'm going to make happen.

284
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.890
I'm going to go set up a perimeter over here.

285
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:06.300
I'm gonna put gunner's up on that high ground.

286
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.760
And then you guys can peel through here and that's where we'll leave.

287
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.350
And the tea,
you commander goes awesome.
Yes.
Execute.
So that's,

288
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:17.400
that to me has always been the best way to utilize the senior enlisted because

289
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:20.640
if you put the senior enlisted actually in charge of something,

290
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.361
but guess what they're doing,

291
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:24.870
they're doing that thing and then when something else goes sideways,
who's,

292
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.920
who's going to handle that now?
And it always seems to happen in a seam.
Yeah.

293
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.140
So it's like the most complicated thing to,
right.

294
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.630
The thing that's hard to handle is the thing that you didn't plan for.

295
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.970
And so if you don't have,
it's just like,

296
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.340
it's just like you don't want to commit your reserves,
right?

297
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.490
You don't want to commit your reserves in,

298
00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:45.270
in a situation where you don't have to.
We don't want it as a tea.
You commander,

299
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.100
you have one guy as like the reserve that you have reserved brainpower and your

300
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:55.101
reserve brainpower is your is your SCA because if something goes wrong you can't

301
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:55.980
get on it,

302
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.960
but you need the most experienced tactically savvy guy to go and handle whatever

303
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:03.120
it is,
which you may not even know how to handle,

304
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.980
but you just know that you've got,
you know,

305
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.460
enemy approaching on a road from the north,
you're getting intel,
you're,

306
00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:08.970
you're getting fed information.
Hey,

307
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:10.830
there's enemy approaching on the note road from the north,

308
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.330
a senior get it taken care of.
And then senior goes,
I got it.

309
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.990
And it goes and handles it.
And,
and that's basically how we execute it.

310
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:19.530
And what was it,

311
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.530
what's really interesting is that overcomes and guys would,

312
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.820
<v 2>and comms would be up and a lot of times comms go down but overcomes the word</v>

313
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:32.910
would be like,
hey,
we're leaving breakdown your security.

314
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.650
And then you're waiting for a call and waiting for a call and waiting for a
call.

315
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.070
And then,
you know,
I'd have to run over there and say it,

316
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.550
looking at someone actually say it and then they're like,
oh.

317
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.590
And for some reason they're there,

318
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.420
they're hearing it in their headset and uh,
um,
it,

319
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.550
it just,
it ain't happening and you just got to go guys get,
they get jammed up,

320
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.360
you know,

321
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.720
and that hourglass is just turning and turning and turning and you got to go

322
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:02.220
back,
you know,

323
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:06.480
hit him to get things moving at that process or moving and going again.

324
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:11.250
And then sometimes just your presence there and what,
you know,

325
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.940
talking about yelling,
you're not yelling at them,
but like,
hey,
boom,

326
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.380
get the 60 gunner down.
Let's go.
Yep,
we're moving this way.
Hey,

327
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.850
get that wounded man over there.
The strategy,
ditch the stretcher,
we're done.
Go.

328
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.130
And then hustling everybody up and just trying to keep everything moving around.

329
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.310
And I'll say this now,

330
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.620
everything that we faced in combat

331
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:41.150
was easier than the stuff we faced in training because you'd put the screws on

332
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.900
us so hard that we were like,
oh,
okay,

333
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.630
we've seen something pretty Dang close to this before.

334
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.920
So when when a guy stepped on a,

335
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:58.060
on an ID and lost his legs that we didn't experience and training,

336
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.560
but everybody dealt with it in a professional way in a course that was a

337
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:07.150
horrible situation.
But that was not something that we were new to.

338
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.890
We were like,
Oh,
okay,
we've done it down men,
we've,
we've had this situation,

339
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:16.630
you already had a couple of guys get pretty severely wounded.
Um,

340
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.980
and it was,
it was a factor in their pain,

341
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:25.270
but it was no factor in how we fought and,
and how we dealt with the situation.

342
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.700
Uh,
there were there a couple of times that we came ludicrously close to blue on

343
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.340
blues,
but because we had,
we had,

344
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.510
you'd reinforced everything and training because we mitigated those blue and

345
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:42.160
blue's bloodlessly in training.
We didn't have them on the battlefield.
Yeah,

346
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.370
<v 0>well it was,
I mean for me coming into that role coming home,
I was,</v>

347
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.800
I was,
I was,

348
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.980
I was pretty emotionally connected to the fact that I wanted you guys to be

349
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.670
ready and just,
you know,

350
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.650
like the whole down down man thing.
Like,
it's not easy to carry it down,
man.

351
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.410
Especially not easy when the guy helps you and he kind of,

352
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.710
it's in training and he kind of jumps up on your shoulder and puts his hand in

353
00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:17.160
that right spot on your back to stabilize himself and all those little things

354
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:21.570
that they do to help each other out.
It's like,
it's not that easy.
It sucks.

355
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.080
And the blue on blue thing,

356
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.600
and I remember I a task unit,

357
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.250
you're tasking and included would have a blue on blue and I'd bring them into

358
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.230
the office and everyone in the chain of command would sign like a safety

359
00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:38.490
violation.
And,
and I would tell everyone,
I'd say,
listen,

360
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.820
I'm not doing this degrading you because they'll person in this room that's had

361
00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:47.970
a real blue on blue where people got killed is me and I,

362
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.340
the one thing I don't want is for it to happen to you.
So there's so much,
uh,

363
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.920
driving me just to,
to,

364
00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:00.090
to try and make it as realistic as possible.
And then,
you know,

365
00:23:00.091 --> 00:23:03.120
you get the kick ass team guys that are running all the training.

366
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.740
Once you give those guys that direction,
they're just going to go.

367
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:09.660
And that's just,
you know,
so I mean,

368
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:14.070
I'd show up for the training sites and the guys would be so amped to make the

369
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:17.850
training awesome.
And you know,
the amount of effort that,

370
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.410
the amount of effort that guys would put in to make the training realistic was

371
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:25.470
crazy.
I mean,
some of those out at land warfare,

372
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:29.700
some of the demolitions that would get set up,
they would take him three,

373
00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:33.510
four days.
They'd stay out on the training on a site for three or four days,

374
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.340
setting demo up everywhere.

375
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.300
So there's stuff blowing up and catching on fire and just smoke everywhere.

376
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.560
Total,
total mayhem.
And you know,
there's,

377
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:46.340
there's only,
this is the,
when you're training,

378
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.730
there's only so much you can do to simulate combat because what you can't do,

379
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.960
there's a line that you cannot cross.
You can't shoot people,

380
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.440
you can't do it.
You can't wound your men in training.

381
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.980
And so that line can never get crossed.

382
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.390
And so what can you do to get it as close to that line as possible?

383
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.250
And the the laser system that we had and the explosives and then all just

384
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:17.870
unleashing all that chaos and mayhem and I was lucky that I got to experience

385
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:20.540
that on the battlefield and come home and be like,
Bro.

386
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.600
And you know you mentioned it quickly like your attitude towards it,

387
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:28.601
but your attitude towards it is what the winning task unit attitude always was

388
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.740
because it's really easy to go through those bullshit.

389
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.860
You had a bunch of good sit up on that hill like yeah and you don't think

390
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.960
alcaide is going to set people up on a hill.

391
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.650
You don't think the movie is going to set people in a spider hole in the middle

392
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.930
of a compound.
You don't think,
by the way,
all that stuff,

393
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:47.840
we got it from actual after actions reports.

394
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.380
So the fact that you and your,

395
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:56.410
your task unit instead of looking at everyone else as to why you didn't do a

396
00:24:56.961 --> 00:25:01.130
good job,
you looked at yourself and said,
okay,
well can we actually do better?

397
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.160
How about we actually try and improve some things?
How about we pick three,

398
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:04.680
four things.

399
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.150
We try and do those things better and then you do those things better and you're

400
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.040
right because,
and you know this from working in training your,

401
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.260
you already know what's going to happen.
Like you can see you,
you put a guy here,

402
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:17.060
you put a bad guy over here,
you put a bad guy over there,

403
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:18.560
you've got a terrain feature like this.

404
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.550
You know what's going to happen and you watch it unfold.

405
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.600
And then you also know that if the leadership can make some good calls,

406
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.030
it's going to be no factor.
If the,

407
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:32.540
if the platoons have good standard operating procedures,
it'll be no factor.

408
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.930
But if they're not and the leadership starts to fall apart,

409
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.020
I mean everything falls apart.
And that thing you just said about the firearm,

410
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.340
I used to tell the task and Krannert says,
I used to say,
imagine you got,

411
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.020
you got your fire teams out there.

412
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.200
Imagine if each one of your fire teams was doing something good that was moving

413
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:55.010
you in the direction that you wanted them to move.
Just imagine if that happened.

414
00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.140
And what happens when that occurs is the leader doesn't actually have to say

415
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:04.940
barely anything other than we're getting out of here.
And as soon as everyone,

416
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.140
we're heading south,
we're getting out of here,
going to our old rally point.

417
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.070
As soon as everyone knows that they just make it happen and do you commander can

418
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.900
do whatever he wants to do because the fire team leaders are going to make

419
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:21.030
things happen themselves.
And,

420
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.680
and w and the opposite of that is there's no possible way you can control all

421
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:26.690
these people if you have to tell them everything that you want him to do.

422
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.810
You can't say,
hey,
you can't talk to all those people.
At the same time,

423
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.940
you can't know what the vantage point,

424
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.360
the best vantage point for us to 60 gunner is going to be on that little note.

425
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.223
You can't do it.

426
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.880
That guy has to understand what it is that is wanted from him and why it's

427
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:44.100
important for him to do it.
And then once he knows that he makes it happen.
Yeah.

428
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.050
And then,
um,
I think it was my tea,

429
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:50.990
you commander that you're talking about when you do,

430
00:26:50.991 --> 00:26:52.890
you said that you didn't initially,

431
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:56.280
you weren't sure if quiet guys could lead because he wasn't,

432
00:26:56.281 --> 00:27:00.240
he's not allowed God,
like I'm a allowed God.
Yeah,
he's,
he's,

433
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:05.130
his personality is,
is,
is different.
He's not super loud,

434
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.750
but he was direct,
clear and concise.

435
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:13.500
And he did a fantastic,
I really enjoyed working with him.

436
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.870
And he's a good example of that.
I mean,
he's,

437
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.500
he's not the guy specifically I'm talking about,
but he's a guy that was,

438
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.270
you know,
especially like the little things you were just barking out.

439
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.110
Put a 60 over there,
get put that stretcher away.
We're leaving it,
get that wound,

440
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.000
admit those things.
If you're not loud,
it's it.

441
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.980
They just don't get hurt.
And so with your task unit commander,

442
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:39.000
I noticed that and was kind of like,
hey man,
you know,

443
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.730
you need to get louder.
And,

444
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.200
and what he did was this,
you know,
get,
Hey,
you know,
he's pretty loud.

445
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.830
My stupid sta standing over and all those,
those tattoos on his arm.

446
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:52.320
He might not be the smartest dude in the world,
but he's loud.

447
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.500
And when he tells you,
hey,
tell him to put that stretch away,
whatever,

448
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.120
then you or whoever in your in your task and starts barking out the orders and

449
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:02.630
it happens,
you know?
And so yeah,
he did.

450
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:07.730
He did a great job of that and had the same attitude as you cause he was

451
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:10.780
experienced.
You know,
that was another cool thing,
you know,
you'd get,

452
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.690
I'd get guys that were coming through training more experience than me and the

453
00:28:15.691 --> 00:28:18.440
good seal leaders would come through that training,
be like,

454
00:28:18.441 --> 00:28:21.960
oh that was awesome man.
Yeah,
you just kicked our ass.
Thank you.

455
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.540
We're going to try and do better.
What did you see?

456
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.640
Like they would just want feedback,

457
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:31.080
just want suggestions and then you'd get other guys coming through that it was

458
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:35.760
everyone else's fault and the training wasn't really with no realistic to get

459
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:38.680
hit from three sides really.
Is that,

460
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.640
where do you see that in the Geneva Convention?

461
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.070
That you're not allowed to ambush from three sides.

462
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.480
And that attitude never turned out well.
It just never,

463
00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:53.010
it zero 0% of turning out well of,
hey the training is unrealistic.

464
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:53.880
The training is this,

465
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:58.881
the training is at like no actually just do the sop step up and lead and

466
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.170
everything works.

467
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.050
And that was the other amazing thing is you'd see the same problems and once uh,

468
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.920
once a tasking that got good [inaudible] you couldn't even stop him cause it's,

469
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.730
cause it's 40 guys against four or five.
As you know,

470
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:16.260
the training that's training guys are,

471
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.910
it's like four or five guys out there shooting them up.
So yeah,

472
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.790
I mean when you're running those scenarios,

473
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.450
you can't bring your guys back to life,

474
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:32.451
which you can remotely do fast enough to apply a decent amount of pressure to

475
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:33.691
win.

476
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:38.691
That troop has just gotten up on steel and then then everybody is so happy.

477
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:44.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't,
you're right.
You can't reset people.

478
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.240
You can't reset the op for quick enough because the,
because the,

479
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.890
when you get a seal troop that's just in straight of aggressive merger mode and

480
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.130
going hard,
every little thing they see,
they're assaulting.
It's awesome.

481
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.570
It's a beautiful thing to see.
So,
um,
now when you,

482
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.460
you guys,
were you guys planning to go to Afghanistan knowing that workup?

483
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.250
I don't think you were right.

484
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.491
<v 2>Where are you?</v>

485
00:30:07.491 --> 00:30:11.360
We were slated to go to Bosnia and so we were going to be going down to southern

486
00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:14.360
Iraq and a working out of there.

487
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.420
And then the request for forces popped up that they were asking for a seal troop

488
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.160
back in Afghanistan.
And I think

489
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.870
<v 3>yeah,</v>

490
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.291
<v 2>on the,</v>

491
00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:31.850
on the numbered seal teams had been out of Afghanistan since somewhere around

492
00:30:31.851 --> 00:30:33.290
2005.
So they,

493
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.640
there had been no presence whatsoever for a number of seal teams and Afghanistan

494
00:30:37.641 --> 00:30:40.310
in a while.
This is a 2009.

495
00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.250
So initially there was a,

496
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.840
it popped up and then,

497
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.930
then it was confirmed and then like over the Christmas holiday they said,

498
00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:52.880
okay,
hey,

499
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:58.460
we're going to send that my troop is going to be the trip to Afghanistan.

500
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.590
What that looked like,
no one knew.

501
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.690
Is that what you're going to Afghanistan because there's a deployment order that

502
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:07.160
has to get signed to go anywhere.

503
00:31:07.161 --> 00:31:09.980
That's got to be signed by the secretary of defense.
Right.

504
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:15.010
And ours to deploy a troop to a sealed troops to Afghanistan was in the book.

505
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.000
It hadn't been signed yet.
And so myself,

506
00:31:20.001 --> 00:31:23.480
the task unit commander and one of the oics who deployed with you?

507
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:28.260
We did a pre deployment site survey and uh,

508
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.070
you know,
I think it was like in February we went,
oh.

509
00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:34.810
And usually on a PD predeployment site survey or pre pdss you go over,

510
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.740
you see what's going on,
then you come back.

511
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.470
We went over there and I stayed in a CV.

512
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:44.830
Chief came with me who was,
uh,

513
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.480
who was going to set up our birding and stuff was one of our support or,

514
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:50.720
or all four of us went.

515
00:31:50.721 --> 00:31:54.800
And then he and I never came back from that predeployment site survey.

516
00:31:54.801 --> 00:31:57.320
We just stayed there.
So

517
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.340
yeah,
so going into,
you know,
in an awkward situation where we're,

518
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.710
we're going over there,
they were working for the army,

519
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.030
um,
SF and they don't even know what they're going to do with us.

520
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:15.230
A lot of them didn't want us because they'd had bad experiences.
Unfortunately,

521
00:32:15.231 --> 00:32:16.250
it was seals before.

522
00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.570
And so what I did was I kind of tore a page out of your book.

523
00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:21.980
I didn't know this is what you guys did,

524
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:25.040
but this is what I did is I usually wear my hair like this.

525
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.760
I went ahead and got high and tight to shift over to look a little bit more.

526
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.900
Um,
well,
like the army does because it's just a,

527
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:38.420
it's just another way to establish rapport.
And I don't care about my hair.

528
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.230
I don't.
Um,
and,
and so,

529
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.170
so when we got there,
the first place we went was to,
to the CG soda if,

530
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:51.860
which is the,
uh,
the o six that's running everything there.

531
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.240
And I went into the sergeant major's office was the senior enlisted advisor.

532
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:57.720
I went in his office and stood at a time,

533
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.940
I introduced myself and stood at parade rest and he looked up from his desk and

534
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:06.860
stared at me.
Um,
and you know,
like I got a clean uniform on,
I got a high end,

535
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:08.510
tight end.
He goes,

536
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.900
I have never seen a cliq before.

537
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.390
And I kept it real professional with him.
And then he's like,
hey,

538
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.510
we don't know where we're going to put you.

539
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.160
We don't know what we're going to do with you guys.
We're working through that.

540
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.660
Um,
you guys have got to go ahead and brief the colonel at the time.

541
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:34.661
So we worked up a brief for the colonel on my task unit commander went in and,

542
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:37.730
uh,
had a meeting with them and he was,

543
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.020
he's a pretty fired up type of guy.
Um,

544
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.820
and he asked,
he asked the tea,
you commander like,
Hey,
what do you,

545
00:33:45.821 --> 00:33:50.190
what do you need?
What do you need from me?
And uh,

546
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.680
the boss told him,
Hey,
we need the SEC def to sign,

547
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.400
sign our line item to get us to deploy here.

548
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.720
And a week later that happened,
legit and eat.

549
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:07.721
So it's in order where the SEC def is supposed to sign stuff and ours was like

550
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:13.310
ninth back and he went straight to our line item and signed it.

551
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:15.710
So that colonel,
we made a good impression on him.

552
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.300
He had some pull obviously and uh,
made an impression,

553
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.400
um,
moving forward.
So then we were looking at,
well,
okay,
where are we going to go?

554
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:30.070
We still didn't know where we were going to go.
Um,
and,
and we talked to the,
the,

555
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.530
the,
we had a briefing with the general and he explained,
Hey,

556
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.990
I don't have enough partner forces for all of my,
uh,
you know,

557
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.520
Sfo,
da teams that are here because normally we're working by with and through.

558
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.571
And he goes,

559
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:49.571
so you guys are going to go on whatever con op is hot and plus up my ODH you are

560
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:58.790
going to attrite the Taliban and deny them freedom of movement.

561
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.790
I thought,
Hallelujah.
Yeah,
it doesn't get any better than that.
It doesn't.

562
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.420
And then we uh,
we moved down to Camp Brown.
Um,

563
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:15.190
and a third group was running the Special Operations Task Force West down there.

564
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.600
And we got there and I met with the senior enlisted advisor there and he's like,

565
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:23.630
hey,
we really don't,
we don't know where we're going to put you guys.

566
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.580
We don't have any space for you here.

567
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.430
And we just stayed good,
you know,
and,

568
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.960
and we established a relationship with him and this,
the,
the,

569
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.310
the commander there and the Xo and the ops guys.

570
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.410
And then two days later they're,
the,

571
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:45.030
the sergeant major takes me out and he's like,
Hey,
you see this big tank,
this,

572
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.870
this is,
they had this big tent right inside the gate.
And he goes,

573
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.530
this is where we were doing all our vehicle maintenance.
And he goes,

574
00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:54.960
we're getting ready to move those guys over to another yard.

575
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.090
You guys can have this.
And so,

576
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.710
so that was awesome.
We were basically like initially where we were the unwanted,

577
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.520
um,
you know,
in law showing up for Christmas,

578
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.290
like Randy Quaid and Christmas story.
And then now we were like,
Hey,

579
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.900
old college buddies that had come into town.

580
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.820
And third group was just so good to us.

581
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.060
There was absolutely no parochialism whatsoever and that was just a great

582
00:36:27.511 --> 00:36:31.200
experience working with them across the board.
So how did you,

583
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.200
when did you start putting together,
how did you say,
okay,

584
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:36.780
this is what we're going to do?
How'd that come about with they just,

585
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.140
they just told us there's like,
here's what,
here's,
here's what we laid out,

586
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:42.660
here's our capabilities.
And there was like,
well,
here's how we'd like to use it.

587
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:46.350
And we said,
Roger,
that where can we help?
We never came in and said,

588
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.690
hey,
this is,
you know,
this is what we do when we come in and do this x,
y,
and Z.

589
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:53.160
Because they're targeting in their whole,

590
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.240
their whole philosophy was completely different than what they did in Iraq.

591
00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.900
In Iraq,
we were very personality based and NSW as a whole,

592
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:03.870
we were were reduced to personality based talk targeting.

593
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.900
They're more about disruption.
They'd be like,
Hey,

594
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.670
Talibans over here in freedom movement.

595
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.810
We're going to go do stuff over there and then they're going to have to come

596
00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:15.570
find us and then it's going to slow them down,
you know,
everywhere they're going.

597
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:17.060
Or Hey,
um,

598
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.910
they're funding this war with opium.

599
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.030
So are we going to burn down opium fields and punish the farmer?

600
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:29.031
Or do we wait till the Taliban collects the opium up into one spot and then go

601
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:33.000
destroy it?
And that's the kind of stuff that,
that we would do.

602
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:37.560
We would go to the opium cassez after the poor farmer who doesn't have a choice

603
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.500
about what he's growing is harvested,

604
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:43.920
that they moved it to one spot and then we pop in,

605
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.980
destroy all their opium,
stay there for,

606
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:51.240
for a couple of days and fight them and then leave.
So,
so that was good,

607
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:54.720
but our attitude was like,
how can we help?
Where can we help you?

608
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.620
And there they just gave us work and it was great.

609
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.260
And you guys had some pretty crazy ops.
Yeah,

610
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.060
I would say like,
so,

611
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:11.090
so the first op we had to add von crew that was there and we went out with a,

612
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:16.080
um,
uh,
three,
one,
one six in there commandos,

613
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:19.710
and they had an op where they went in and,
and took a,
uh,
uh,

614
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.473
a bizarre,

615
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.500
which is like a strip mall basically where they facilitated a bunch of opium,

616
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.360
went in,
held that,

617
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.900
destroyed all the opium for a day and then fought everybody that came at us.

618
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.920
So we went out on that operation with them and,
uh,
it was good.

619
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:39.430
It was a lot of fun.
Um,
and,

620
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.450
and then that got them used to us and,
and,
and what we brought to the table,

621
00:38:43.451 --> 00:38:48.451
and that was an op that was setting up in a concept of operations called see Jen

622
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.720
Jen.
And that was like the,
I think the first frag order under it.

623
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:54.850
And they would do a concept operation like,
hey,

624
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:56.320
here's what we want to do with this stuff.

625
00:38:56.321 --> 00:39:01.321
And this is CJ engine was basically hammering the opium in the Helmand river

626
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:02.380
valley.

627
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.380
And it culminated with the last frag order and was when we went into Helmand in,

628
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.910
or we went to Hellman into Marcia,

629
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.420
which is like at the heart of the Taliban.

630
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.670
It was a Taliban controlled town.

631
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.440
Coalition forces had never been inside of it.
In a year later,

632
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:24.580
it was 2010 or 11 the marines went in there and cleared it and it was a huge

633
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:29.560
fire,
huge firefight prior to us going in there,
this operation.

634
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:33.310
And it was,
why when I say we,
it was us,

635
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:38.290
the Afghan commandos,
the NSF,
Oda and the OIB above them.

636
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.780
I think that gets Oeb,
right?
Yup.

637
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.730
So that detachment above them and we just plus them up and they're,

638
00:39:44.731 --> 00:39:49.731
they're only be commander was equal rank to our task unit commander rank.

639
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:55.420
But like my boss was just like,
he didn't push back.

640
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:57.810
He was like,
Hey,
what do you need me to do?
And that,
that,
oh,

641
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:02.380
we be commander really appreciated that relationship that he didn't have to,

642
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.950
you know,
bump heads,
ego battle over.

643
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.360
I wouldn't be in this position.
Exactly.
Or I want to make this call.
So

644
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.510
coalition forces have never been inside of Marcia.

645
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:19.510
They'd tried to go close to us and just gotten shot out.

646
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.070
We choppered into a bizarre,

647
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:25.360
which was,

648
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:30.930
we took for the corner four blocks and a like a pretty huge area where there was

649
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:34.700
a ridiculous amount of opium consolidate it.

650
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.620
They were refining opium into heroin,
um,

651
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.770
and make an IED,
improvised explosive devices,

652
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:45.490
all kinds of stuff there in the middle of their town.

653
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:50.080
We went in there at night,
we stayed there for four days and just,

654
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.340
just got after it wholesale.
Um,

655
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.700
yeah,
I think there was 8,000 pounds of opium that we destroyed numbers.

656
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.080
It was a big operation.
There was a,
the uh,
the DEA was involved,

657
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:08.110
there were FBI agents.
There was a huge,

658
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.290
was a huge crew and it,
and it was good to go.
Uh,

659
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.760
and some of the lessons,
lessons learned from,
there's a that's okay.

660
00:41:18.761 --> 00:41:23.140
So like the first day we're,
I was in one of the,

661
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.200
the blocking positions there and we were taking fire basically from the east end

662
00:41:29.661 --> 00:41:32.020
to the south because the way the different positions,

663
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:34.310
it was kind of like cross the way it crossed out.

664
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:38.930
So when we were taking fire from the south,
you had to be aware that like,

665
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.680
hey I can't see him but my bullets can see them in that way.

666
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.090
There's a bunch of guys.

667
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.540
And so we took fire from a tree line that was probably 50 yards from the

668
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.940
compound that we were holding.
And I was up on a,

669
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.890
whereas up on a rooftop with another guy and then I saw like four guys walking

670
00:41:57.891 --> 00:42:00.410
around in cammies and we were getting ready to light him up,

671
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:03.440
but they were wearing the,
the like the stuff the commandos were wearing like,

672
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:06.560
hey we got guys moving down here.
We need a head count.

673
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.710
Who's got the Afghany commandos?
Cause these guys look just like him.

674
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.580
And then they came back with,
oh hey,
we got everybody.

675
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:18.230
No one's outside of our position.
And then so we were getting ready.

676
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:22.970
I'm like,
don't shoot,
don't shoot.
And then we called again.

677
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.750
They confirmed again.
No one's outside our position.
Then finally,

678
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:31.280
20 minutes later and they're like,
oh wait,
we had some guys walk out to go to,

679
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.040
I don't know what they do and if they're going to the bathroom or what they were

680
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:38.750
screwing around doing,
but we could have just completely lit them up.
Um,

681
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.340
we used a lot of 50 cal on that.
We had the air support,
this,

682
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:50.470
we had everything from Hueys to B one bombers overhead all day long bombs were

683
00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:58.991
falling that the Taliban was absolutely furious that we'd come into this strong.

684
00:43:00.481 --> 00:43:05.360
All there's cops are this much,
you know,
all the opium.

685
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.770
I think there was somewhere like 800 pounds of refined heroin and heroin was

686
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:11.090
like packaged in these,

687
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.400
these bags that were like this big and it had like a Scorpion on it and it said

688
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:19.610
like 2008 after,
you know,
it had like a label,

689
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.880
little marketing brand marketing like I,
you know,
made,

690
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:24.800
made here in Afghanistan or whatever.

691
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.690
And so it was a huge affront to them that we were there.

692
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:34.691
So after like the first two days we basically killed off every local fighter and

693
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:40.320
then they started bringing guys up from Pakistan.
And then the,

694
00:43:40.321 --> 00:43:44.000
then it got kind of lively because the local fighters knew every piece of dead

695
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:48.110
space.
But the guys from Pakistan weren't really familiar with the area,

696
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:50.330
so they would be bumbling in the open look in the other direction.
You're like,

697
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.570
ah Ha bum,
bum bum,
get them.
Um,
you know,
we,
we,

698
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.150
I think the third morning

699
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.360
this we got up and there's no fighting or like,
well when's it going to,

700
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:05.420
cause it gets,
it's like you get to set your watch by like,
okay,

701
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:08.290
Sun's up and uh,

702
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.110
we should start getting some shooting by now and there is nothing and there's

703
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:16.100
nothing.
And so we radioed up to the,

704
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:18.650
to the headquarters where like,
Hey,
what,
what is going on?

705
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:23.120
But they quit and they're just laughing hysterically on the radio.

706
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.810
And they were able to tell this and I can't describe to you how,

707
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:31.811
but the guy who had the keys to the armory where they were storing all their

708
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:37.260
weapons and they couldn't find him probably because we bombed him over the night

709
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.550
and they couldn't get into the armory to get their stuff to come us attack us

710
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.220
with that.
You guys going to get a bead?
Yeah.

711
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.610
Oh,
but uh,

712
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:56.820
it wasn't just an audacious operation that worked out great.

713
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.080
And then do you guys take any casualties during that or did the Afghans or did

714
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.710
the army?
So we had,
um,

715
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.490
a rocket hit the compound over next to mine and our dog handler and one of our

716
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:12.000
Korman got fragged the corpsman,

717
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.050
the frag knocked a tooth out and then the launch stuck in his tongue.

718
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:18.510
So he's real lucky at is to slow down the momentum.

719
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.570
And then the dog handler got hit in the back.
Uh,

720
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.830
there were several of the army guys that got straight up shot.

721
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.700
And then here's the awesome part,
like the,
um,

722
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.190
I feel like their call sign was Pedro,
but it was air force medivac.

723
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.300
And as soon as they heard that we were troops in contact,

724
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.160
they lifted it up and they would just be loitering real close to the firefight.

725
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:49.740
And then like as soon as that,
that Mr port came over and were like,
hey,

726
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:51.210
we got a guy down,

727
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.870
they came in and it would be like,

728
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.900
I would be watching going,
we're going to get that helicopter shot down.

729
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.530
And they would just come in.
They had a,
um,
many,

730
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.000
the door gunner had a mini gun

731
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.660
and they would just land right?

732
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:10.110
Like on top of the guy in the middle of a firefight.
We don't care.

733
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.430
And like I would just,
I was so proud,

734
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.380
I could just be crying because it's such an awesome thing to see because it's

735
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:23.580
complete disregard for their own personal safety and they're just waiting to

736
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:28.110
jump in there and get guys.
So luckily I'm on that operation and uh,

737
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.720
no one was lost.
And then everybody was,

738
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.240
the guys that were shot were all recover from their wounds.

739
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.420
And what kind of damage,
what kind of damage did you guys do to the enemy?

740
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.080
Significant?
I think it was,
it was pretty significant.
I mean,
um,

741
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.770
there was just a huge amount of drugs and,

742
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:49.440
and their equipment and things that we destroyed.

743
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:54.150
And then it just had to hurt them psychologically that they thought that that

744
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:55.920
was the complete freedom of movement.

745
00:46:55.921 --> 00:46:58.800
And then all of a sudden we came in and stayed there and just did the meet stomp

746
00:46:58.801 --> 00:47:00.000
on them for four days.

747
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:05.070
And you guys weren't only doing urban situations,

748
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:08.820
you guys were going into other scenarios where you're like digging in on

749
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:13.710
hillsides and whatnot too.
Right?
Right.
So later on,
we,
you know,
we that,

750
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:17.700
that,
that same take the high ground or it will take you because all of our

751
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.650
operations,
I think we only did,

752
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.230
we did two 23 total operations on that thing.

753
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.620
Most of them were multi day.
And um,

754
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.290
so there were only two that we were in and out in the same cycle of darkness.

755
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.930
And,
uh,
typically,
you know,
we would do terrain studies and we're like,

756
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:39.820
hey,
we got to defend these positions.

757
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:43.120
And so when we had a compound that we're like,
here's the compound,

758
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.310
this is the compound that we're going to take and hold,

759
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.680
where's the high ground around it?

760
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.360
And then we need to get elements up on that high ground as well.
Uh,

761
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.240
there were also,
there was,
there were two like

762
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:02.430
time sensitive targets where we came in as a quick reaction force where other

763
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:07.450
elements where there's another um,
coalition,

764
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.940
soft element and um,

765
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.940
SF element that got an assaulted in a valley and they had a strong point of

766
00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:17.890
building because they'd been hit in this valley.

767
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.910
And then we came in on the high ground,
um,

768
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:26.080
during the night and then the next morning because that most times the Taliban

769
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:29.020
didn't fight at night because we had the advantage the next morning when the

770
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:30.910
Taliban assaulted them,

771
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.110
we were on the high ground behind them and lay the hammer down and then we're

772
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:39.910
able to,
to get stuff to the word.
Those guys were able to get out that day.
Uh,

773
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.800
yeah.
So we were taking,
we were taking high ground positions quite,
you know,

774
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:45.940
when it made sense.

775
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.080
There's one operation we were on where there,

776
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:55.060
what really wasn't any high ground.
And so there were some there,

777
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.960
there were like the furthest we could clear away from the compound that we were

778
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:02.050
holding was 30 yards.

779
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.950
And then it was a dance like Green Zone and a wall peak.

780
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.930
People could completely creep up.
So we had guys go,

781
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:13.270
you know,
we identified that were like,
okay,
what are we going to do?

782
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.170
And then someone's like,
hey,
we can put,
well,
let's go put pop flares out there.

783
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.220
You know?
And so it,
that's like going back to the,

784
00:49:22.221 --> 00:49:23.950
to Vietnam stuff,

785
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:28.210
but guys went out and place those and then boom,

786
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.010
you know,
we,
we,
when,

787
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.510
once the bullets started flying and we were the troops in contact,
the tick,

788
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:38.320
as we say in the vernacular started to really get up to speed and then all of a

789
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:42.670
sudden you're like,
oh,
those pot flares are going off.

790
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.850
Okay,
start pumping 40 Mike,
Mike over there or whatever.
And uh,

791
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.420
um,
yeah,
it was,
it was cool.

792
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.020
There's a,
one of the stories we have bat back in Marsha,

793
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.930
the guys brought a,
uh,
the Alg l,

794
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:03.931
which is like this 40 millimeter chain gun and then it has this,

795
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:08.260
the new one has like a computer mount that goes on the top.

796
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.790
And so you look at the screen and then you,

797
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:17.680
you put the little cursor on,
on what,
what your target is.

798
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.620
Okay.
And then it lays is it,

799
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.700
and then gives you an elevation correction based on the ballistics for the 40

800
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:28.760
millimeter.
And then you raise it up,
you depress the lever

801
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.610
and then just book book,
book,
book book.
So there was a,

802
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.700
there was guys in it in a tree line,
um,

803
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.230
that were shooting at our guys and they had set this thing up and basically it's

804
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:46.730
a 40 millimeter sniper rifle.
And there they had the uh,
uh,

805
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.990
like a Predator was overhead watching,
giving them feedback on the fire.

806
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.930
So they shoot it,

807
00:50:52.931 --> 00:50:57.931
these guys in this tree line and then they ask the Predator for a battle damage

808
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.540
assessment and the Predator comes back with two e Kia,

809
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.100
which enemy killed in action.
One ran away on fire.

810
00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.370
That's good.
And

811
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.480
<v 4>uh,
what about,</v>

812
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.310
I know you told me a story one time about you guys weren't in the high ground.

813
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:25.620
He was somebody that there was somebody like across the valley that had a little

814
00:51:25.621 --> 00:51:29.370
elevation on you and you guys were digging in and digging in and digging in.

815
00:51:29.371 --> 00:51:31.290
Sandbag,
sandbag,
sandbag as much as it.
Good.

816
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.410
<v 2>Yeah.
So there,
there was one,
one in the operations that we were in.
Um,</v>

817
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.260
so while he caught and that this was one of the places that was bad enough where

818
00:51:40.261 --> 00:51:42.210
they actually came at us at night.

819
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.480
So we did our insert hilos dropped us off and we were in our perimeter getting

820
00:51:48.961 --> 00:51:51.660
ready to start our offset patrolling to hit these compounds.

821
00:51:51.661 --> 00:51:55.890
We get when PKM in two RPGs just come zipping overhead.

822
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.570
And Luckily we had,
uh,
whenever we got inserted,

823
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.370
we always had a Paches that escorted us in.

824
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.140
They went over and started hammering these guys,
they mount up getting,

825
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:10.160
I want to kill him,
kill him like 30 people.
And,

826
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.360
and what had happened was as it turned out,
we were all set from a target,

827
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.750
but where our offset was put us right next to where some other,

828
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:22.770
a bunch of other Talibans guys happen to be and they thought we were coming to

829
00:52:22.771 --> 00:52:25.220
get them.
So they maneuvered.
Then when we,

830
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:30.250
we did our offset patrol God to our target guys came at us in the dark.

831
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.520
Uh,
we could see them coming from the high ground.
We laid a fire team,

832
00:52:35.521 --> 00:52:39.510
pushed out,
shot them right when they came around the corner,

833
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:44.130
completely no factor.
And then,
uh,
you know,
just dirty,
wet.

834
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:45.001
When they got within,

835
00:52:45.001 --> 00:52:48.630
they came around a corner at 30 yards away from to aaw gunners who just caught

836
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:51.030
them down.
And then a,
a,
one of those guys,

837
00:52:51.031 --> 00:52:54.600
I think later we figured out was probably some big wig with the Taliban.

838
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.010
So we took that compound and we took the high ground immediately behind it,

839
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.160
but it was in a mountain range.
So there was,

840
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:06.420
there was always going to be high ground around our high ground the next day,

841
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.480
once they figured out where we were at and then they got on all the high ground

842
00:53:11.641 --> 00:53:16.160
around us and then they just brought it and I can remember.

843
00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:20.100
So the,
where we were out on that high ground,

844
00:53:20.101 --> 00:53:22.890
it was like the crown was too hard to dig.

845
00:53:22.891 --> 00:53:27.630
We always brought 10 empty sandbags per guy so that you could fill them up and

846
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:28.680
make defensive positions.

847
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.830
We couldn't fill sandbags up cause it was like trying to dig in your parking
lot.

848
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.700
So we just stacked all the rocks we could stack around us.

849
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:41.300
And then they kicked this thing off with a barrage of RPGs.

850
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.890
And then,
uh,
just a steady stream of PKM fire,
which is,
you know,

851
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:48.330
their belt fed machine gun.

852
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.690
And I remember being laying flat on my chest and there's like eight inches above

853
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:57.960
my head are the right.
And,
and by the way,
I'm not,

854
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:00.030
I took my body armor off cause I was Ooh,

855
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:04.980
thought I'm gonna take my body armor off and my helmet and I'm like,
Oh God,

856
00:54:04.981 --> 00:54:08.490
my home went back on and I snaked into my body armor.
Everybody did.

857
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.920
And then these,

858
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:14.950
the bullets are hitting the rocks steadily 80 inches above my head.

859
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:17.710
And the gunner is,
he's a,

860
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:22.020
he's 1100 yards away and he's just basically,
you know,

861
00:54:22.021 --> 00:54:25.890
almost lobbing lobbing them in because I had been shooting,

862
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.490
we'd been shooting at the guy a little bit and we just couldn't be kept sliding

863
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:34.110
behind a rock and it was too windy to get him.
And,
uh,
we had,
uh,

864
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.510
I think we had a reaper overhead,

865
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.020
but in the middle of the day in Afghanistan when the rocks are 90 degrees and a

866
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:45.090
person's 90 degrees,
it's worthless.

867
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:48.450
They can't see people and the Afghanis are not sitting out in the open world and

868
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:53.430
kill him.
So I was like,
and at the moment I wasn't scared,

869
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:57.620
but I'm like,
okay,
I'm getting ready to get shot and I'm good.

870
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:02.080
I'm getting ready to die by the sword.
This is what I get.
And that would,

871
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.631
and that was it.

872
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:08.631
And then our Satcom radio antenna got shot and got knocked over.

873
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:14.490
And so now we had no comms to get air support because we desperately needed to

874
00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:19.140
get some more air in.
And then my boss,
I don't know how he got shot,

875
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.260
he didn't get shot.
But the t you commanders like all right.

876
00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:27.150
And he just got up there and fixed the antenna and uh,
um,

877
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.930
it was hitting it well down in the compound.

878
00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:35.670
Our guys just started lobbing mortars and we used,
uh,
uh,

879
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.533
we had the,
uh,

880
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:42.830
they started using the delayed fuses so they were detonating 25 meters above the

881
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:43.884
ground,
which,

882
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:49.160
which lays down an impressive frag pattern and tamp things down a bit.

883
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:54.300
And then we just got hammered and hammered and we're like,

884
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:57.930
oh this is not going to be good.
I'm

885
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.230
like 15 minutes later they're like,
hey,
we got some air to you.

886
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.780
And it's not,
it's not like we weren't without air cover.

887
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:10.200
Cause we did have a reaper and I think a Predator showed up too.

888
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:15.000
But there's limited so to French jets,

889
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.560
soda and the,

890
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:20.460
a lot of the coalition forces will be difficult with you sometimes when you're

891
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:22.200
calling for air support and argue with you.

892
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:27.040
And I'm sure that these guys would have argued with us,
but we just said,
hey,

893
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.570
there were two main ridge lines that we were taking heavy fire from.
And we said,

894
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.980
do you know,
like give us a show of force flights where you've,

895
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:40.240
they'll fly real low over those ridge lines and see if it pushes their heads

896
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:42.090
down.
And they came in

897
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:48.700
right over both ridge lines and that tamped it down cause they got down.

898
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.050
And then a little while later,
uh,

899
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.900
that that slowed things down and it was more manageable.
Now for us,

900
00:56:55.901 --> 00:56:58.150
we'd get our heads up and start to shoot back a little bit.

901
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.190
Then the B one bomber shows up and they've got bombs to waste,

902
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:06.460
you know,
and they gave us a four,

903
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:10.000
500 pound bombs on each ridgeline,

904
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.770
air burst at hundred yard increments,
boom,
boom,
boom,

905
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:18.430
boom,
boom.
You know,
and then that hammered them a bit.

906
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.400
Then we were able to isolate some of the other guys,

907
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:26.110
use our own organic weapons to hammer the other guys.
And then we were like,
man,

908
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.250
this place is bad the next day.

909
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:35.320
So we were supposed to extract that ne night and we were like,
hey,

910
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:40.120
when's our extra?
Oh and at two in the afternoon on the high ground position,

911
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:44.140
we ran out of water and it was 114 degrees.

912
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.810
So there's no shade,
there's no water.

913
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:51.180
It's just a massive suck fest.
And uh,

914
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.450
nothing's come until it gets dark.
So we just waited.

915
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.160
The hilos came in after dark,

916
00:57:57.161 --> 00:58:01.060
kicked out pallets of water and Ammo to resupply us and they're like,
by the way,

917
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:03.010
you're staying for another 24 hours.

918
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:08.410
Because what we didn't know is that us being there was having a huge effect on

919
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:09.670
the whole battle space.

920
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:15.130
And some other elements were able to adjust their position and some of the

921
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:19.480
Afghan,
uh,
surrogate forces were able to get a whole bunch of stuff done.

922
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:25.120
But,
oh,
we got that over the radio.
I was like,
oh,
we're going to stay here.

923
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:30.160
Don't they know that we almost got heavy hammered,
like this is the first time.

924
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.720
Up until then we always had the upper hand.

925
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:39.450
They weren't really worried about getting,
like,
just getting overrun.

926
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.890
And in this point there was a real fear.
Any second,

927
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:45.370
now we're going to get overrun.
Um,
and then they're like,

928
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.490
you're staying for another day.
And I remember talking to my two platoon chiefs,

929
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.110
I'm like,
Hey,

930
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:55.060
we're staying here for another day and you're going to push out and clear this

931
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:58.180
stuff and we're going to reinforce this position and here's what we're going to

932
00:58:58.181 --> 00:59:03.010
do.
And then they took a deep breath and they're like,
okay,
Roger that.

933
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:08.050
And um,
we stayed another day and the next day we,
we,
uh,

934
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.060
we got into it.
They threw it,
came at us pretty hard again.
But then we,
uh,

935
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:15.100
we did a little bit more air support.

936
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:20.730
We had developed a relationship with the 82nd airborne combat air brigade there,

937
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.190
Apache helicopters,
which are like tanks in the air.

938
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.600
They lived right down the road from us.

939
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.620
And so we would have barbecues with them and we would have,

940
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:36.200
we would run a range and have them over and then they would come see what the

941
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:39.830
range and we'd stand around in bullshit.
They broke their sleep cycle.

942
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:41.570
So this is really important for pilots.

943
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:46.460
They have got to have a x amount of rest before they can fly and they do not

944
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.960
break their sleep cycle lightly.

945
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.910
They broke their sleep cycle to come support us and then they put themselves at

946
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:56.060
risk where like Afghanis don't like helicopters.

947
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.210
So when a helicopter shows up,
they'll sink.

948
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.790
They flew low on purpose cause they'll go all of that helicopters low.

949
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:07.100
I think I can hit it and then they,
they can't resist.

950
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:12.101
They come out and then they'd have these guys would just hammer on and uh,

951
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:17.120
they came in the next night and that,
that was awesome.

952
01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:21.570
<v 0>Yes.
So I was still at trade out while all this was going on.</v>

953
01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:26.160
And I remember I would get emails from you from the,

954
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.880
from your task unit commander as well.
And we were just be talking about,

955
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:34.870
you know,
hey,
this is what's going on.
And I remember I was signing the um,

956
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.220
emails back to you guys as the spiritual advisor.

957
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:45.720
<v 2>I was there in spirit dude.
Yeah.
And we,
and,
and yeah,
we were,</v>

958
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.000
we were hitting back up to you in,
because there was a lot of,

959
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.650
there's a lot of massaging and stuff that has to get done.
You know,
we got like,

960
01:00:52.651 --> 01:00:57.651
I was looking at a picture in the hallway the other day and it's that classic

961
01:00:58.111 --> 01:01:01.710
picture with the yellow smoke and Mikey's there and,

962
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.330
and sets right behind him.
And I never really studied everyone's gear,

963
01:01:06.331 --> 01:01:10.200
but I looked at Seth and sets,
got the enhanced battle rifle,

964
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:15.230
which is the m 14 that just in,
you know,
the situation it was,

965
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:19.520
it didn't work for our lasers and our sites.
So they,
these guys up at war calm,

966
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:23.040
fixed it up so you could use it and have seven,
six,
two on the battlefield.

967
01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:27.780
And you guys all had that and we got there right away and they were just getting

968
01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:29.880
ready to,
to feel the scar heavy

969
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.970
and we got them to field it first overseas,

970
01:01:35.971 --> 01:01:37.680
which is not what they like.

971
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:39.960
They like to feel that first everyone trains with it.

972
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:45.420
We got them to feel that oversees.
That was awesome because all of our guys add,

973
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.493
you know,

974
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.560
173 grains of democracy and justice flying out there.

975
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.610
So when you,
when we would take,
when we take an APP,
when we take a compound,

976
01:01:56.611 --> 01:02:00.510
right,
take Kate clear,
clear,
compound,
hold a compound,

977
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:05.760
the Afghanis would,
they were used to five,
five,
six so they would know like,

978
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:10.770
okay,
it's pretty windy today and um,
I'm out at 500 yards.

979
01:02:10.771 --> 01:02:14.100
It's not likely you're going to hit me with your 500 year,
five,
five,
six rounds.

980
01:02:14.101 --> 01:02:18.120
So they would be like kind of out in the open and we would just kill him.

981
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:23.430
And then,
then,
then that,
that circle would go out.

982
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:28.431
And our guys were regularly getting guys at five,

983
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:32.170
six,
seven,
800 yards.
Um,

984
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.250
and those are just the scarred heavy with the date.
So here's what they did.

985
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:40.440
Most of our snipers took the knife force three by five to 15 scope that was on

986
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:43.980
our,
I'm sorry,
sorry,
sorry.
20 fives,

987
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:46.480
which that that gun had some issues and,

988
01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:49.290
and would jam a lot and then just put them on their scars.

989
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:50.400
And that's what they patrolled with.

990
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.010
So they would have it all the way down in three and a half power.

991
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:54.750
So if you're patrolling you can just swing it up.

992
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.080
It's got a low magnification so you have both eyes open,

993
01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:03.090
you can shoot and then they can put the bipods out and hit stuff far out and,

994
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:09.120
and,
and,
and those things were,
were in fricking valuable.

995
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:13.470
And,
and it just brought a whole new dynamic to the battlefield.

996
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.930
And,
and you know,
the scar had some problems.
There's a,
it's not a,

997
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:23.040
uh,
a direct impingement thing where the gas doesn't go all the way back as a gas

998
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:24.810
piston,
like the m 14 did.

999
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.360
They told us don't lube those and guys would still lube them and then,
oh,
jam up.

1000
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:32.610
And you're like,
wow,
this gun sucks.
I'm like,
well,

1001
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:34.680
I hope you lose your gas piston.
You haven't put a lot of lube on it.

1002
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:38.000
I don't do that.
Don't do that.
So,

1003
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.130
so that worked great.
And that,
that was,

1004
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.810
that was awesome that we were able to get,
get that over there.
And the,

1005
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.440
the common or at the time basically gave us whatever we wanted and asked for.

1006
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.710
This is the support we got from group one was an incredible,

1007
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.610
now you guys do,

1008
01:03:56.611 --> 01:04:00.300
you guys didn't really take that many can be,
no one got killed,
right?

1009
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:03.330
No one got killed.
How many guys got wounded?

1010
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.020
Two guys got wounded with frag.
Um,
you know,

1011
01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:14.020
we had a couple of concussion injuries where guys got knocked out.
Uh,

1012
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:18.290
and it's hard to quantify how serious that is.
And then,
um,
on,

1013
01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:22.980
on our turnover operation when seal team one came to relieve us is when,

1014
01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:24.870
uh,
when,
when Dan can,

1015
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:29.871
Austin got hit by the IED and lost both his legs and,

1016
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:32.040
uh,
that,
I mean

1017
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:38.490
Ho horrible event and,
and thank goodness we're just like,

1018
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:43.491
there's so many things that lined up to save Dan's life because we'd been

1019
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:49.150
inserted for an offset patrol,
went in there,
um,

1020
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:55.410
got,
got in there,
uh,
secured the,
the bizarre,

1021
01:04:55.411 --> 01:05:00.411
and then we push guys up to high ground like we always do except for the Taliban

1022
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:03.810
suspected,
you know,
oh,
well they'll,
if they come to take it,

1023
01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:08.820
they mined the entire high ground.
So as that element was pushing up,

1024
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.050
um,

1025
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:14.480
there was an explosion and then there was quiet and then two,

1026
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:19.240
you commander gets on the radio.
Hey,
was that a debt?
And uh,

1027
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.440
on,
oh,

1028
01:05:22.441 --> 01:05:26.070
I see who deployed with you came back.
And he's like,

1029
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.150
it was not a controlled that we've got some wounded.
And we're like,
okay,

1030
01:05:30.151 --> 01:05:34.860
work through it.
Get on the Satcom,
the,
uh,

1031
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.060
the 40 sevens that had dropped us off.

1032
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.930
It was an sop for them to have a flight surgeon on one of their birds.

1033
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.090
And so they hadn't made it all the way to back base or it may have been that

1034
01:05:48.091 --> 01:05:50.910
they loitered around for a little bit.
That could have been too.

1035
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.360
So they were right there and there was surgical stuff right there when cause

1036
01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:03.040
Dan's wounds were absolutely horrible.
Um,

1037
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.680
and then once the EOD guy started,
once that happened,

1038
01:06:07.681 --> 01:06:11.880
and it was lucky because the charge went low water or snow it going high order,

1039
01:06:11.881 --> 01:06:13.470
it would've killed like six guys.

1040
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:18.110
He discovers that they're in a minefield,

1041
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:22.370
basically his metal detectors getting overrun.
So he's got a bay,

1042
01:06:22.371 --> 01:06:27.371
a net or a big screwdriver and he's probing the way out in front of the guys so

1043
01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:34.080
they could get Dan out and onto the mat of act that later.

1044
01:06:34.081 --> 01:06:34.914
Got them back.

1045
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1046
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:40.570
<v 0>How long had you been on the ground for like a matter of 10 15 minutes?
No.</v>

1047
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:45.460
<v 2>Um,
w we did like we did an offset.
So we,</v>

1048
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:48.560
we patrolled in for like three or four clicks.
So,
okay.

1049
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.900
It was a little your hours.

1050
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.930
It wasn't a couple hours but it was inside of an hour.

1051
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:58.170
That's why I'm not sure how long was 40 sevens were loitering or if they were on

1052
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:01.730
their way back and they were able to turn them around,
but they,

1053
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.870
they were back quick and they had that surgeon on there,

1054
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:09.940
which I think really made the difference for,
for Dan who,
you know,

1055
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:14.020
now he's the guy's running marathons.
I haven't run a marathon.
Lat Yeah,

1056
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.000
I feel like such a loser.

1057
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:19.900
He's competed in the Olympics a couple times right now.

1058
01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:22.960
He got a gold and the Paralympics,
right?
There you go.
Yeah.

1059
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:26.980
<v 0>Yeah.
He's awesome.
Awesome guy.
Yeah,
that was,
that was,</v>

1060
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.090
that was devastating.
Devastating.
I remember

1061
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:36.790
we got word back that,
you know,
one,

1062
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.290
one of the guys and we just assumed it was one a year guys actually cause I

1063
01:07:40.291 --> 01:07:42.460
don't think we even knew the turnover that,
you know,

1064
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.650
the turnover was taking place.
I assumed it was one of your guys.
But,
you know,

1065
01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.440
and then,
then I heard it was Dan and um,

1066
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.340
I remember the first phone call that I got and I was like,

1067
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:56.730
is he gonna live?
Oh yeah.

1068
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:01.200
And at this point they were like,

1069
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.580
yes,
he is.
Because I mean,
I know it was like touch and go,

1070
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:11.130
but then the first person that I don't,
I don't remember who it was,
was like,
yes,

1071
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:15.120
he's stable,
he's going to live.
And I was like,
then we're good to go.

1072
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:17.930
And I just remember thinking,
thank God he's,
you know,
he's gonna make it,

1073
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.793
you know.
Yeah.

1074
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:24.360
<v 2>The uh,
the like are on like the second or third op we were there,</v>

1075
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:25.890
one of our guys were mic,

1076
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.760
we're doing an op with the one we always had Afghany commander knows with us

1077
01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:32.910
because they were the partner of course though the Odh we were doing.

1078
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:38.370
And one of them stepped on a mine and it blew both his legs off and part of his

1079
01:08:38.371 --> 01:08:40.320
arm.
And,
uh,

1080
01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:45.570
one of our guys got cut in the face with his femur.

1081
01:08:45.571 --> 01:08:49.110
And then there were some issues where when they were putting,

1082
01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:54.120
all of our tourniquets were failing because it had a plastic windlass that was

1083
01:08:54.121 --> 01:08:57.090
was going.
And so the,
the one guy,

1084
01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.630
he that got hit and then he got caught in the face with his femur and it messed

1085
01:09:03.631 --> 01:09:06.870
him up mentally for a little bit.
And I didn't know what to say to him.

1086
01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:12.090
So I didn't say anything to them.
And I've,
you know what I wish I had,

1087
01:09:12.091 --> 01:09:16.710
because I've come to a conclusion now with a lot of this pain that everybody

1088
01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:19.000
carries around that,
that it's,

1089
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:22.290
it's a poison you carry inside of you and if you talk about it,

1090
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:27.450
it lets it out and then,
then it's kind of detoxing you a little bit.
And so like,

1091
01:09:27.451 --> 01:09:29.730
I don't know,
you know,
if you're listening to this and you're in a situation,

1092
01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:32.700
if someone's gone on something through horrible and you don't know what to say,

1093
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.370
say something,
just sit down there and just talk with them about it.

1094
01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:40.350
You know,
ask how they're doing,

1095
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:43.860
see if they can get it off their chest because it helps.

1096
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:47.480
<v 0>Yeah.
I the same thing.
We had guys that got,</v>

1097
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:51.290
like I had one guy that got shot in the chest plate and got shot through the

1098
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.200
camelback on his back.
Those are two different operations too.
I mean like,

1099
01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:59.100
so what does that do to you when you're thinking,

1100
01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:02.760
how close was I to just getting killed twice,
you know,

1101
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.640
in two different scenarios and for sure I think,
you know,
if you don't,

1102
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.160
what does,
you know,
what,
what do we do in the teams?

1103
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.680
Like make a joke about everything.
Everything's a big joke,

1104
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:17.420
which probably helps in some cases.
Uh,
but yeah,

1105
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.950
let,
let you definitely got to,

1106
01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:23.750
if you get the opportunity to talk to people about what's going on and what I

1107
01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:28.250
think it does is even more than like,
well I'm sure,
I don't know,

1108
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:30.860
cause I'm not a psychologist,
but okay.

1109
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:33.950
There's the idea that you're like letting this stuff out,
right?

1110
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.873
I'm going to let this stuff out.

1111
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:39.350
There's also the idea that when you talk about something you,

1112
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:44.590
you articulate what you're thinking and you have to like put it into words that

1113
01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:49.550
somehow they become a thing that you can manage you.
Yes,

1114
01:10:49.551 --> 01:10:52.340
it makes complete sense.
Like when you don't talk about it,

1115
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.240
it's just like you have a conversation with somebody about whatever you,

1116
01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.860
you want to debate with somebody about some subject.

1117
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.080
If you never debated about it before,

1118
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.380
you're going to be at a disadvantage because you don't really understand all the

1119
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:06.140
INS and out,
but when you actually talk to someone about it,
then you say,
Oh,

1120
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:06.710
here's,

1121
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.230
here's a point that I could make here and here's our point that could make
there.

1122
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:11.030
If you don't talk about this stuff,

1123
01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.010
it's just sitting in there and it doesn't get any better.

1124
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:15.450
You don't understand it any better.

1125
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:19.110
You talk when you just like we were talking on the last podcast,

1126
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.550
how when you teach something,

1127
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:24.360
you understand it more because you have to detach from it to look at it from the

1128
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:26.940
outside.
Well,
if I explain something to you,

1129
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:32.280
I'm explaining it to myself too.
You know,
I'm explaining it to myself too.

1130
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.680
And I told you this yesterday,
you know,
when,
um,

1131
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.470
when I had Tom Phifer on the podcast who was in world war two,

1132
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.310
Korea and Vietnam and got a purple heart and all those in,
and I asked him,

1133
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:48.810
I asked him some question about losing guys when he was a battalion commander in

1134
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:52.980
Vietnam 60 years ago.
I didn't say that part about like,
you know,

1135
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.880
what was,
what was,
how did you guys handle casualties or something like that.

1136
01:11:56.881 --> 01:12:00.950
And I don't know what the question was,
but here he is,
this,
you know,

1137
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.580
army colonel retired army colonel and he's talking about the guys that he lost

1138
01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:08.130
60 years ago and he got choked up.

1139
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.530
And I remember looking at him and I'm thinking to myself,
okay,

1140
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.430
this is the way I'm always going to feel about the guys that I lost.

1141
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.660
It's never going to go away.

1142
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.710
And like just hearing him talk about it and seeing that reaction,
I was like,

1143
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:23.520
okay.
And that's what I tell all my,
all my bros now I'm like,
Hey,

1144
01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:26.130
you're always gonna feel that way.
Like it's,
it's just,

1145
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:28.650
here's a guy that was in World War II,
Korea and Vietnam.

1146
01:12:28.651 --> 01:12:33.300
He got a purple heart in all of those and he gets choked up talking about the

1147
01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:36.640
guys that he lost in Vietnam and Korean War,
World War II,
but you know,

1148
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.290
I specifically asked him about Vietnam.
So when you talk about these things,

1149
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:44.220
I think you get some kind of handle on them because you have to articulate them

1150
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:48.540
in such a way that you can then,
it's like a,
what?
You have to name your enemy,

1151
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:50.460
right?
You have to,
you have to name your enemy.
They say,

1152
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:52.830
if you don't name the enemy,
then you,
how are you going to fight them?
Well,

1153
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:54.840
it's the same thing when you actually say,
Hey,
you know,

1154
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:58.320
I really feel bad about this,
or whatever,

1155
01:12:58.321 --> 01:13:02.040
or I think I could've done this better,
or I think I made a mistake,

1156
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.940
or I wish we would,
or whatever it is that you're thinking,
you know,
whatever,

1157
01:13:05.941 --> 01:13:10.050
survivor's guilt,
whatever that thing is that you have.
When you say it,
you're,

1158
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:12.810
you're,
you get to look at it and you get to look at it from the outside and go,

1159
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.480
okay,
yeah,

1160
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.440
I'm explaining this to Jason and I'm telling him what I'm thinking.

1161
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:22.050
And then while I'm explaining it to you,

1162
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.410
I'm explaining it to myself is what's happening.

1163
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.930
And that's why I think talking about it,
not only is it get it out,

1164
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:29.550
but it gets you a handle on it somewhat.

1165
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.690
<v 2>Yeah.
The process of it coming out of your mouth and then back into your ears are</v>

1166
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:39.320
maybe letting different parts of your brain adjust and deal with it.
But

1167
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:45.740
<v 0>yeah.
Check what else?
Uh,
so you come home</v>

1168
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:48.880
from Afghanistan,
Amy,

1169
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.060
<v 2>so like [inaudible] and here's another thing I want to talk about too and,</v>

1170
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:54.760
and you brought this up in this,

1171
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.990
the book you are covering the last couple podcasts about fear of like once that

1172
01:14:02.081 --> 01:14:07.081
first bullet goes by or that it just like everything shuts down and you just go

1173
01:14:08.771 --> 01:14:11.890
to what you're supposed to do and then you do it.

1174
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.570
It's like in the moment all emotion goes away.
There is no fear.

1175
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:21.571
But then afterwards and before is when you have the fear.

1176
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:25.720
Like I was lay in my bed there and I would completely was,

1177
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:30.520
would picture notification going on for my wife.

1178
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.700
Like I could see the guys in blues driving out to my house or you know,

1179
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.450
okay,
this is a good chance that I'm going to get severely maimed and I,

1180
01:14:42.451 --> 01:14:47.200
I could picture myself sitting in a wheelchair outside of,
uh,

1181
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.280
you know,
the,
the,

1182
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:52.360
the paddock that I have my horses in and I can't even ride them anymore.

1183
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:54.030
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1184
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.500
<v 2>And,
uh,
you know,
now I'm getting emotional about that,
which is kind of,</v>

1185
01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:01.860
it's odd to me,
but that,
that's,
that's weird how,
how it,
you know,

1186
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.880
when you're in the moment,

1187
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:07.120
you're not afraid later on when you're thinking about it is,
is when these,

1188
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.510
you start to freak out about it a little bit.

1189
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:15.090
<v 0>There's no doubt.
And this has been confirmed over and over and over again,</v>

1190
01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.610
that the waiting is the worst.
I,

1191
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.700
that's just,
it just,
you're just anticipating and then once you're going,

1192
01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.070
why you're going and you got stuff to do.

1193
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.210
And I was never in situations where I like didn't have anything to do.

1194
01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.610
And there was other things happening where I was like,
well,
the I,

1195
01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.900
the few times I've been mortared where I'm like sitting there waiting for a

1196
01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:40.830
mortar to either hit me or not hit me.
That sucked a lot,

1197
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.360
but it wasn't a,
it wasn't like,
it wasn't like an hour though.
You know?

1198
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:50.550
It's like foam foam.
Okay.

1199
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:55.470
We got about 30 seconds.
I Dunno,
maybe a minute before we find out where,

1200
01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.550
where it's going to be at.
But I also think that,

1201
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.720
you know,
if you're scared of dying,

1202
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.260
it's going to be real nightmare all the time,
I think.

1203
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:09.580
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1204
01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.560
<v 2>Yeah.
And like paralyzing.</v>

1205
01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:16.060
I said that one point in us while he caught where I'm like,
okay,

1206
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.960
I'm going to get,
this is what I get.
It was just,
was,
there was not fear.

1207
01:16:19.961 --> 01:16:23.470
It was just an acceptance.
I'm going to get shot here pretty soon.

1208
01:16:23.471 --> 01:16:27.700
I wonder how bad it's going to hurt or burn or whatever it is.
And it's like,

1209
01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:32.710
all right,
that's going to happen.
Okay.
Now,
later on,
you think about it.
Um,

1210
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.760
there's one other thing.
I think on an earlier podcast,

1211
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:41.761
people were asking a question about if you had a routine,

1212
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.980
because I had a really definite routine that I went through prior to going out

1213
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:50.890
in,
in Afghanistan and it wasn't like anything religious,

1214
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:55.120
but I w I'd sit down,
I'd be in my room and he,
you know,

1215
01:16:55.121 --> 01:16:59.740
we'd have everything but like,
well we had everything in our room,

1216
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:01.240
but we had a ready room and all that.

1217
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.900
So Iris had sent me the CD from this country,
singer,
core blonde.

1218
01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:06.010
I'd put that down.

1219
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.220
And then the first thing I'd go through as I change out every battery in all of

1220
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:14.150
my gear because you got like your belt or headsets,
you're not,

1221
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.070
all that stuff's getting new batteries.

1222
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.330
Then I would go through and look at all my battle maps,

1223
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:25.040
clean out the ones from the last one,
get my new battle maps for this one,

1224
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.310
study them.
Then I'd always,
always,

1225
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:33.311
always carry 24 hours worth of water with me and then pack out my food.

1226
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.350
Then I would go get fresh batteries from my radios.

1227
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:43.550
Then I would go through all my gear,
strip it down,

1228
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.030
put it back together for anything that I had,

1229
01:17:46.031 --> 01:17:50.360
any special gear and equipment I needed for that up.
There is a,
uh,

1230
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:54.800
later on I like to carry a 60 power spotting scope because I was spending a lot

1231
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:58.250
of time on high ground nature that was all clean up.
Um,

1232
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.410
make sure that my radio is charged with Crypto,
all that stuff.

1233
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.910
It would take me like two hours to go through that whole process and then we

1234
01:18:07.911 --> 01:18:12.440
would go outside,
we would do our comms checks together and uh,
um,

1235
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.790
go out and get on the helicopters and get after.

1236
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.441
<v 0>And so that,</v>

1237
01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:20.790
that routine right there is like so good because if you had all that stuff ready

1238
01:18:20.791 --> 01:18:25.050
and you just sat there for two hours,
that would not be fun.
No,

1239
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:29.840
<v 2>no.
And I mean,
you gotta go,
you gotta check everything three or four times.</v>

1240
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.770
I remember riding with a guy on a,
on a ride and his,
uh,

1241
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:36.890
his a battery died on his nods in the middle of the,
you know,

1242
01:18:36.891 --> 01:18:40.160
when he's driving on a convoy,
I'm like,
good grief.

1243
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:43.280
He didn't put a fresh one in the costs,
like 90 cents.
Dude.

1244
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:47.390
<v 0>My first deployment to Iraq,
we were doing that and we stopped.</v>

1245
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:53.020
We stopped changing batteries for every op like after a week because the ops

1246
01:18:53.421 --> 01:18:58.421
were like an hour long and all of a sudden we realized we were going to run out

1247
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:02.300
of batteries.
Like we just didn't have enough batteries.
So we just went to like,

1248
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:05.750
hey,
carry an extra battery and if,
you know,
if it dies then whatever,

1249
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.060
change it now we're always all night.
Yeah,

1250
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:10.520
you guys are going on all night isolated.
You know,

1251
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:13.710
we were 10 feet from our Humvees or whatever,
20 yards from our home.

1252
01:19:13.711 --> 01:19:15.620
These have a big stack of batteries and it didn't matter.

1253
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:19.190
It's totally different scenario.
Yeah.
I think that,
um,

1254
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:22.730
I would always be super busy with doing stupid,
you know,

1255
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:26.840
officer stuff ever for old out,
you know,
getting this brief,

1256
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:29.110
checking in with this guy,
whatever,
doing all that stuff and I,

1257
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.450
I would just get all ready and I,

1258
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.090
it seems like I would work up until I got into home.
V

1259
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.520
T you commander did too.
And it was hard

1260
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:43.770
<v 2>because he would go on the op already on arrest deficits.
Yep.</v>

1261
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.380
Yeah.
And then when you're going to stay out there for two days,
eventually,

1262
01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:52.480
you know he's got to go down.
But they,
we figured out like,
uh,
um,

1263
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.170
he would,
he would pass it off to one of the other OIC.
He used

1264
01:19:56.170 --> 01:20:00.070
<v 0>to be the GFC cause he didn't want me to be the guy talking to the Jay Tac about</v>

1265
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.880
what to drop.
He had more sense.

1266
01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.710
Well I would be pretty liberal.

1267
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:13.080
Here's a picture of me and Dave Burke.
Good.
Yeah.
Good deal days.

1268
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:15.720
And it's,
it's in downtown Ramadi.

1269
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:19.500
I think it's on the roof of Cop Falcon and we're both just completely asleep

1270
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:22.800
sitting there and just asleep cause and the same thing,

1271
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:26.310
cause when I'd go out a lot of times I'd been awake and you know late,

1272
01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.040
all of us would be awake for a long time.

1273
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:31.110
So you get in the field and you're like,
cool,
I can sleep now.

1274
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.090
<v 2>And again that was like,
okay.</v>

1275
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.320
So that was like one of the hardest things as a leader is like you get there,

1276
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:41.250
you get in the oop and everybody wants to stay awake and that meets,

1277
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:44.970
we're all going to hit the wall in like six hours.

1278
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.640
So it's you gotta like go and say,

1279
01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:52.170
hey you four guys get in there and I need you to take sleep.

1280
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:54.570
So you're ready to bump out on the security positions.

1281
01:20:54.571 --> 01:20:58.600
Are they fighting positions or whatever it is because it's common.
Yeah.

1282
01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:02.160
Everyone's just going to hit the wall at the same time and you're all asleep.
So,

1283
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:09.760
<v 0>all right,
so that's a real,
was that the last op you did was with Dan,</v>

1284
01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.220
was that the very last opera?
Did you do a couple more?

1285
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.501
<v 2>I don't remember.</v>

1286
01:21:14.501 --> 01:21:18.280
It was pretty close to the last dot because one of our platoons had already

1287
01:21:18.281 --> 01:21:21.780
redeployed at that point.
Um,
you know,
in,

1288
01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:24.550
in leadership you're the first one there and the last one to go.

1289
01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:28.000
So we didn't go until the last bird,
but I think,

1290
01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.950
I think that was our,
if it wasn't,
it wasn't one our last one,

1291
01:21:32.951 --> 01:21:34.420
it was our second to last one.

1292
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:36.050
<v 0>It was going.</v>

1293
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:40.040
Was coming home from this deployment any different than coming home from your

1294
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:40.820
other deployments?

1295
01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.600
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1296
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:48.350
I've been there for eight months and it was the most kinetic deployment of,

1297
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:53.730
of my career.
So yeah,
they,
and,

1298
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:56.830
and uh,
NSW started doing that.

1299
01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.660
The third location decompression stop where they're like,
hey,

1300
01:22:00.661 --> 01:22:01.740
before you get home,

1301
01:22:01.741 --> 01:22:06.420
we want you to sit down and blow off some steam and a sit down with a,

1302
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.590
you know,
psych and talk to the cycle a little bit.
And our,

1303
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:13.560
our redeployment flight kept getting bumped.

1304
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:18.561
So we redeployed like I think eight days later and then we were supposed to,

1305
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:24.920
and every day it was like,
Hey,
the bird's gonna go tomorrow,
get up muster.

1306
01:22:24.921 --> 01:22:27.330
And they're like,
nope,
maybe tomorrow.

1307
01:22:27.331 --> 01:22:28.900
And we did that for eight days in a row of filing.

1308
01:22:28.901 --> 01:22:32.300
We got on it and it was getting so long.
I was really angry at me.

1309
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.070
Now you just let us go home.
And uh,

1310
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.090
they held their ground and I'm really glad that they,
you know,

1311
01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.450
held their ground because when we got to the other location and you start

1312
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:47.070
drinking,
I was just a frigging idiot.
Drank way too much.
Um,

1313
01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.190
but I needed it.

1314
01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:53.850
I needed to blow off some steam and stuff and it was good to have the other guys

1315
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:58.390
to talk to and,
and,
and to be somewhere where,
you know,
uh,

1316
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.190
my loved ones didn't have to see me being just a complete buffoon.

1317
01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.970
And then,
you know,
and then I got home.

1318
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:12.000
Um,
and uh,
yeah,
that,

1319
01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.560
that it took a lot.
So,

1320
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.160
so I live kind of in at the time was living in east county,

1321
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:23.161
San Diego and the area I live in is really similar to areas of Afghanistan.

1322
01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:27.270
So I would find myself in my yard,
you know,

1323
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:31.620
and I was back and constantly scanning the high ground and,

1324
01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:34.840
and doing a technique called ballooning and that's where,
you know,

1325
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:38.020
I'm here and then all sidestep here and then all backstep here.

1326
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:42.160
And it's so like you're just making it difficult if a sniper's aiming at you

1327
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.880
that you're hoping that he's squeezing the trigger as you're stepping to the

1328
01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:50.380
side and you're going to step out of his,
his crosshairs doing stuff like that.

1329
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.030
And then,
um,
you know,
when,

1330
01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:59.060
when you go eight months and every stressor that you have is a fight or flight

1331
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:05.140
full Broan stress or whether it's the enemy shooting your indirect fire coming

1332
01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:05.974
in,

1333
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:11.130
it's hard for your body to come back and then differentiate between somebody not

1334
01:24:12.071 --> 01:24:16.780
agreeing with you on something you just said or anything else.

1335
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:21.700
Um,
my sleep was completely jacked up based on us operating a lot at night.

1336
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:25.540
Uh,
and I,
I had,

1337
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.930
I've always had issues with my sleep.
So on the deployment I'd started taking,

1338
01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.880
take an Ambien,
then they were given to giving it to me.
And so,
uh,

1339
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:37.990
I was having difficulty sleeping without that.
Um,
and then,

1340
01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.400
you know,
I think it was the first night or second night I was home,

1341
01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:46.990
the dog started barking and I kept a gun on the nightstand,

1342
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:49.720
which is just,
just an sop.
Now it's in a safe,

1343
01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:53.470
cause I have kids but dogs are barking.
I roll out of bed,

1344
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:58.400
grabbed the gun and I'm at the ready waiting,
just like,
oh,

1345
01:24:58.401 --> 01:25:00.340
okay.
And then Iris,
you know,

1346
01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:04.570
rolls out of bed and she or looks up and sees me standing there naked,

1347
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.300
holding a gun next to the bed,
breathing heavy,

1348
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:12.280
scanning both the entrances and she's just like,
oh wow.

1349
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:15.730
What came back.
And you know,
I didn't get a chance to talk about,
um,

1350
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:21.610
my wife and where I met her,
but she was a wrangler on a ranch that,
uh,

1351
01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:26.170
we go to a lot for training when I met her and she's just,
just hard.

1352
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:30.760
A good,
good,
good partner,
soulmate and uh,

1353
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:35.710
and she's been extremely patient and put up with a lot of stuff that most women

1354
01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:39.820
wouldn't have.
And when I came back,
I was doing,

1355
01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:43.390
I was drinking heavily just in mainly,
you know,

1356
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.670
as I assess my drinking issues,

1357
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:51.390
it was because I was so wound up that it would be four beers is to where I could

1358
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:56.860
get myself back to where everybody else walks around in their daily life where

1359
01:25:56.861 --> 01:26:01.450
they're just calm because I was just like her.
Um,

1360
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:07.350
and that's just a from one is not sleeping and then the other one is just coming

1361
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.620
back from a deployment like that you get,

1362
01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:13.760
it takes you a while to decelerate when people are shooting at you and all these

1363
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:18.640
horrible things are happening.
And then now you're back in society,
but you're,

1364
01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:22.980
you're not really where you're back here in the u s but you're not really,

1365
01:26:22.981 --> 01:26:27.050
you're,
you're,
you're not all the way back.
And so,

1366
01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.250
and,
and my temper was like a millisecond fuse.

1367
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:36.200
We'll get mad about stupid stuff and all kinds of stuff.

1368
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:40.220
And finally she said to me,
she said,
you know,
hey baby,
you're not,

1369
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:44.270
you're not the same guy you were when you left.
And,
uh,

1370
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:49.880
I really want you to talk to somebody.
And so immediately I got on the phone,

1371
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:53.900
I called up the psych and I started seeing the psych and talking through a lot

1372
01:26:53.901 --> 01:26:58.901
of this stuff that I had going on and started working at getting better.

1373
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:03.980
Um,
and it's,
uh,
it's a long process and it was,

1374
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:07.020
it was helpful to talk to those guys.
Uh,

1375
01:27:07.410 --> 01:27:12.350
it to say that you have PTSD and,
and is,

1376
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.550
is somehow maybe admitting a weakness.
And I dunno if it's,
you know,

1377
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:21.740
how do you define PTSD?
For me it's like,
okay,

1378
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:23.900
well if I'm in a crowd,
I'm getting hyper alert.

1379
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.770
And when I came back from deployment,
I was hyper alert all the time.

1380
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:31.640
And adrenaline is just a constant,
steady drip of adrenaline going in.

1381
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:36.200
And that's why I was kind of a drinking heavily to calm down.
Um,

1382
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:41.300
you know,
and in the vicious cycle I got into it,
the Ambien and that's a,

1383
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:43.070
and then my sleep and jacked up.

1384
01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:47.300
And then inflammation and all the other health health issues that came with
that.

1385
01:27:47.301 --> 01:27:49.610
So that was like kind of the first step.

1386
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:54.980
The second step was at this time I came over to the training of detachment and,

1387
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:59.870
and you know,
2010 and was now running the land warfare section for you.

1388
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:04.050
Um,
and doc parsley,
Kirk Parsley was our,

1389
01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:08.270
are a diving medical officer,
group one and he's a seal.

1390
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.230
Later on went and got his,
uh,
his,
you know,

1391
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:13.850
doctorate and became a doctor.

1392
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:18.910
He kind of at that point was discovering that all these health issues that we

1393
01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:22.430
were dealing with was,
we're were revolved heavily around sleep.

1394
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:28.270
And so he was able to help me like get off the Ambien,

1395
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.960
start doing stuff to take,
you know,

1396
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:35.840
natural things to get my sleep back in order.

1397
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:39.370
Did you ever do the sleep study?
Did he puts you on the third?
He didn't,
but I,

1398
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.400
I did a sleep study later and uh,
um,

1399
01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:46.910
I have sleep apnea and so I've got a c pap machine and asleep with,

1400
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:49.970
for that and that helps.
But you know,

1401
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.930
sleep and diet are a linchpin.
Click sleep,
diet and exercise.

1402
01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:57.500
There's three pillars of good health probably.
Is there a fourth pillar?

1403
01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.410
Probably like hypnosis or I don't know.

1404
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.370
Those are the big three I would say.
And uh,

1405
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:09.410
getting that sleep fixed up help my mental state a huge bit and how my physical

1406
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:12.630
state,
I was in terrible shape at the time.

1407
01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.790
I had a lot of different joint pains and ailments and so that was good.

1408
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:20.850
You know,
I was taking Melatonin and he goes,
how much Melatonin you take?

1409
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:24.420
I'm like,
Oh,
I'm taking six milligrams.
He's like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1410
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.080
You know,
you need,
your body is going to not make its own.

1411
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.250
And ideally you get to the point where you're not even taking,

1412
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:38.040
you know,
like some magnesium at night to to help you calm down.

1413
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.130
And so that,
that started me on the,

1414
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:45.660
on the path in that I was really glad because otherwise I know guys that can't

1415
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:48.840
sleep without ambien and I don't think that they're really,

1416
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:53.490
they're not really getting into the sleep and it's just,
it's not good.

1417
01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.440
And that this time you were working at trader came back and took over the land

1418
01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:01.314
warfare,

1419
01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:07.090
a senior enlisted role there as it should be.
Yeah,
that's a,

1420
01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:11.820
that was my dream.
Usually guys don't ask to go to an island and I was like,
Hey,

1421
01:30:11.821 --> 01:30:15.330
please send me out there.
This is what I like.
And uh,

1422
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:19.960
that was good to go.
Um,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1423
01:30:19.961 --> 01:30:24.060
it's really interesting and we talked about this earlier as we applied pressure

1424
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:29.160
to the different troops,
we would see troops that were,

1425
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.160
that were loaded with superstars.

1426
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.770
They had so much raw talent,

1427
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:39.780
but then they didn't own their mistakes and they were just terrible.

1428
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:43.290
There'd be terrible.
I really like what,
I know you guys are good to go.

1429
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:44.430
What is going on here?

1430
01:30:44.431 --> 01:30:48.690
And then we would see troops that necessarily did not,

1431
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.760
I'll have a whole lot of raw talent,

1432
01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:56.840
but they were very humble and they were,
they kept their,

1433
01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.390
there are plans,
super simple and they would just,
they would be the troops that,

1434
01:31:00.391 --> 01:31:02.880
that like we couldn't the op for just couldn't,

1435
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.950
our opposition forces couldn't keep up with them.

1436
01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:10.460
<v 0>That's just a fact and it's over and over and over and over again and again and</v>

1437
01:31:10.461 --> 01:31:14.450
again and the people that people that,

1438
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:18.590
it's interesting too because you might think,
well,

1439
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.360
if you're not humble,

1440
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:23.600
then you're going to be cocky and if you're cocky with the training guys,

1441
01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:27.140
then they're going to be more judgmental and they're going to push you harder

1442
01:31:27.141 --> 01:31:29.540
and they're going to jump on everything that mistake you make.

1443
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.780
It's not like that.
It's like it's so clear that when a,

1444
01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:38.540
when a troop was humble,

1445
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:42.590
they would fix themselves and fix the problems and the mistakes that they made

1446
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:46.670
and when they weren't.
You know,
you get four or five guys,
six,

1447
01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:51.590
seven guys in a troop that are cocky and arrogant and they not only are they not

1448
01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:52.360
owning their own mistakes,

1449
01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:56.360
but they were blaming everyone else inside their own troop.
It just turns,

1450
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.710
it's so horrible to watch.
It's,

1451
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.570
it's horrible to watch because they're at each other's throats.

1452
01:32:01.571 --> 01:32:05.020
They're blaming each other for everything and no one's taking ownership.

1453
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:08.800
It's just a total nightmare and it has nothing to do.

1454
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:12.940
It's like even completely objectively looking at a troop,
you just,

1455
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.630
you just watch him fall apart because someone doesn't say,
Hey,
you know what?

1456
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:20.320
Maybe we should just work together and try and do better,

1457
01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.920
which is essentially all you need to do is say,
wait a second.

1458
01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:28.950
It took us 12 minutes.
The trade that guys timed us on getting our headcount,

1459
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:29.621
leaving that building,

1460
01:32:29.621 --> 01:32:33.700
it took us 12 minutes and in that 12 minutes we took four more casualties.

1461
01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:37.630
Maybe we should look at how we're getting our headcounts,
whatever,

1462
01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:39.070
just whatever little thing,

1463
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:44.890
and if you're an arrogant person,
you just,

1464
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.600
it just,
I think it.
Guess what?

1465
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:48.880
Then you end up with a bunch of new guys that are all arrogant because they're

1466
01:32:48.881 --> 01:32:51.880
all just imitating you.
You know?
They're all imitating the senior guys.

1467
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.850
There's not a new guy that checks into a team goes,
you know what?

1468
01:32:54.851 --> 01:32:58.150
My chief seems a little bit arrogant.
I'm going to be more humble.

1469
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.060
That doesn't help.
No,
you're a new guy.
You're like,

1470
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:03.370
I'm going to act like my platoon chief.
That's what I'm going to do.

1471
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.080
And that's what you do.

1472
01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:10.081
And you end up with a whole task unit of just people that don't want to say that

1473
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:13.030
they did anything wrong.
Mean again.
It was just horrible to see,

1474
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:18.250
cause it'd be guys that were all over me and guys,
we like,
we know everyone,

1475
01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.800
you know,
no everyone on,

1476
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:23.680
on the west coast and know every guy like they're all friends and be like,
Bro.

1477
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:29.130
No.
And it was so hard.
That was the hardest part of the job was,

1478
01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.110
was was having to,
you know,

1479
01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:36.210
you're looking at your friend and saying,
Bro,
man,
um,

1480
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:40.120
I'm not like,
you're not,
I'm not just saying this,

1481
01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:41.770
you guys are doing really,

1482
01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:45.430
really bad and you need to fix some of this stuff or it's,

1483
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:48.550
you're not going to get through it.
You're gonna get reloaded.

1484
01:33:49.410 --> 01:33:53.320
And yeah,
that was,
that was the worst part of the job there.
My opinion.

1485
01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.910
Absolutely.
And then it's super tricky just to,

1486
01:33:55.911 --> 01:33:58.320
to be able to debrief these guys and doing a manner where you're,

1487
01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:02.200
you don't sound condescending.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

1488
01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:07.120
God,
I loved that job.
I would,
I would,
you know,
go out there.

1489
01:34:07.121 --> 01:34:10.000
I had my little voice recorder and I would sit there and I would take all my

1490
01:34:10.001 --> 01:34:11.680
notes and the voice recorder,
she can't write while you're,

1491
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:12.670
all this stuff's going on.

1492
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.470
And sometimes I would just record the guys as they're freaking out,

1493
01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:19.900
total panic,
screaming at everyone.

1494
01:34:19.901 --> 01:34:24.070
I just record them and I'd get back and I'd be like,
hey man.
Okay.

1495
01:34:24.071 --> 01:34:27.100
When you guys got strong pointed in that building,

1496
01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:29.470
what were you thinking you wanted?
If want to do?
He's like,

1497
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:31.060
they just needed to move.
And I go,
okay,
let me do it.

1498
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.480
Let me just play what you were saying.
And you'd press play on the recorder.

1499
01:34:34.481 --> 01:34:38.530
And the guy would be like,
and you couldn't even understand him,

1500
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:43.180
couldn't even understand him.
And they'd be like,
man,
Bro,
this isn't just like,

1501
01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:46.660
this isn't just me.
And there's some guys that did it didn't like me,
you know,

1502
01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:49.690
or whatever.
It's like,
it's not just me.
I like you actually.

1503
01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:52.140
I think you seem like a good dude.
I'm just saying like,

1504
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:56.350
these mistakes are bad and they're not just made up,
man.

1505
01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:59.810
They're just like,
I'm not just making it up.

1506
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.840
You guys ran to the wrong target and the whole task unit brand to the wrong

1507
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:06.074
target.

1508
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.640
You're in charge of the assault and you ran to the wrong target and everyone

1509
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:13.940
followed you.
And that just,
you know,
you didn't,

1510
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.480
you didn't do what you were supposed to do.
And that's not good.

1511
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.860
And I'm not just saying this because I want to be cool.

1512
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.480
I'm saying this because it's not good.
It's just,
it was crazy.

1513
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:31.590
<v 2>And w the great opportunity of that is it was a nonstop experiment to where you</v>

1514
01:35:32.081 --> 01:35:35.770
could watch how guys organize themselves and how they,

1515
01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:41.010
their organization structure responded depressure and you could see like,

1516
01:35:41.170 --> 01:35:46.170
oh well these guys are using decentralized command and we can put all the Dang

1517
01:35:46.931 --> 01:35:51.490
pressure we have to bear short of killing every other guy and they can still

1518
01:35:51.491 --> 01:35:55.570
function.
Or these guys have over centralizer command or there just isn't any.

1519
01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.810
And I can put a fraction of pressure and then it just cracks everywhere and

1520
01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:04.810
falls out.
And that's cool that that,

1521
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:06.460
I mean,
again,

1522
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:11.790
I learned so much from the several years that I was doing that,

1523
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.940
but I could see the personality traits that guys were exhibiting as they came

1524
01:36:18.221 --> 01:36:20.330
through there.
And then what,

1525
01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.680
how they were organized functionally and what worked and what

1526
01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.900
<v 0>yeah,
and the other,</v>

1527
01:36:25.901 --> 01:36:30.190
and I just set a bunch of negative stuff about how much it sucked,

1528
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:33.640
but it was so awesome.
You'd get these studs,

1529
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:38.760
these young seal beasts,
he fives that would just be like off,

1530
01:36:38.761 --> 01:36:43.630
take her this element,
we're moving.
And you be like,
I love this guy.
And just,

1531
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:46.900
they would just be awesome.
And so you'd see that all the time too,
of course.

1532
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:51.010
And so that was what made it so cool.
And yes,

1533
01:36:51.011 --> 01:36:55.360
it's the ultimate leadership laboratory to,
to experience from the outside,

1534
01:36:55.361 --> 01:37:00.361
from the instructor cadre perspective of we're going to put 28 platoons through

1535
01:37:01.811 --> 01:37:04.480
this little problem,
the same problem.

1536
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:08.830
And the only differences,
and you could say there's some difference in the guys,

1537
01:37:08.831 --> 01:37:12.940
but there's really not,
there's actually like the seals in the platoon,

1538
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:16.900
they're good,
they're solid defined.
There's a couple of knuckleheads,

1539
01:37:16.901 --> 01:37:18.450
there's a couple of great guys,
there's a couple of guys,

1540
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:21.070
there's guys in the middle.
But that's not the difference.

1541
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.560
The difference is so blatantly clear,

1542
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:28.450
the leadership that you just get to see that over and over and over again.

1543
01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:31.900
So that's awesome.
Yup.
How long did you stay there for?

1544
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:36.300
It was there three years.
And then what came next?

1545
01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:41.170
You made master chief [inaudible] and then wrapped up your time at trade at.

1546
01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.770
And then when it was time to

1547
01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.510
<v 2>go over to team five check,
I went over to team five.</v>

1548
01:37:48.511 --> 01:37:50.050
And the way the progression as you,

1549
01:37:50.051 --> 01:37:55.051
you do a slot as the operations master chief and then the next we're built on a

1550
01:37:56.101 --> 01:38:00.810
two year cycle you'd fleet up to become the command master chief.
And uh,

1551
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.100
operations is just,

1552
01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:07.420
it is a crazy job because you are responsible for every single moving part that

1553
01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:10.290
the seal team does.

1554
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.890
So you're looking at what all nine platoons are doing for training.

1555
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:20.100
You're involved with where everybody is going to deploy.

1556
01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:25.470
Uh,
all the gear.
They got all the ammo that the order,

1557
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:30.530
anything in between outside you're dealing with all the other commands.

1558
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:35.430
Um,
and then so halfway through our workup,

1559
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:40.431
the ice isol went and took Mozal and uh,

1560
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:43.350
then deployed,

1561
01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:48.660
they split up how the team was organized so that that kind of threw a wrench.

1562
01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.450
It,
uh,
uh,
how we were deploying.

1563
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.480
We had to come up with a plan to possibly deploy half of the team during unit

1564
01:38:56.611 --> 01:38:58.950
level training.
Um,

1565
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.070
and it was busy,
but then it was,

1566
01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:08.140
was a fantastic experience because basically learn how to do everything.

1567
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.490
And then every time,
so working with,

1568
01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:19.230
with like if someone came to me and they complained to me about our admin

1569
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:22.590
department,
and then I would go to admin and like,
Hey,
what's going on here?

1570
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:24.090
And then I would find out that like,
well,

1571
01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:29.091
half the blame and sometimes all of it lies with the guy complaining about it.

1572
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.830
Or Hey,
this other unit over here,

1573
01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.420
they're not doing this right.

1574
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.690
And then I just go over and talk to them and find out that hey,

1575
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:41.220
they've got some issues.
I don't know about that.

1576
01:39:41.221 --> 01:39:45.780
We could help them out with or we're not doing everything correctly.

1577
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:50.120
And so I got,
I took that stuff that I learned from,
you know,
like Danny,
Carolyn,

1578
01:39:50.121 --> 01:39:55.121
Steve Hines and monetary size and started to apply it outside of just a platoon

1579
01:39:55.171 --> 01:40:00.170
level but to a command level and relationship level.
And uh,
it,

1580
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.740
it worked out great.
We got,
we got a lot of stuff done.
Um,

1581
01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:10.810
and uh,
yeah,
I'm rambling a little bit but there you have that,
that,

1582
01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:14.170
that stuff.
Every time there,
there was,

1583
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.150
every time there was a complaint,
this isn't doing the right,
they suck at this.

1584
01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.350
I dig into it and there are a couple of times I didn't dig into it and then I'd

1585
01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:25.140
wind up with egg on my face and now I just dig into everything.

1586
01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:27.150
I take what someone tells me,

1587
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:32.010
like somebody gets in trouble over the weekend and it's like,

1588
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.400
okay,
this is what we heard right now.

1589
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:40.110
The first story is never the real story.
And then let's just,
hey,

1590
01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:41.310
we don't have to make a call now.

1591
01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:46.050
Let's wait and let things develop and find out what the real facts are before we

1592
01:40:46.051 --> 01:40:48.210
do something.
Knee jerk that we can't take back.

1593
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.950
And sometimes it winds up that it's worse and sometimes the winds out it's then

1594
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.550
better.
Uh,

1595
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.080
I remember one of the things I heard a general say on,
on,

1596
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.460
on the deployment that I was on later on,
he says,
he says he's,

1597
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:07.330
he's not going to make a decision until he has to,
like,
they were like,
hey,

1598
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:11.950
we want to do this.
And he goes,
do I need to make that decision today?
No.

1599
01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:14.980
Okay,
then I'm not Gunna,
cause he can let more facts come in.

1600
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:17.350
He can deal with more stuff.
Uh,

1601
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:20.530
which made sense that it was general Nagata,

1602
01:41:20.531 --> 01:41:24.670
which was the soccent commander when that stuff went on.
And he was,
uh,

1603
01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.350
I've never met him personally,

1604
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.490
but he believed in real flat communications.

1605
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.860
So when he sent out an email,

1606
01:41:32.861 --> 01:41:36.010
there'd be like a couple of hundred people cc'd on it.

1607
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.110
And he,

1608
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.220
cause there's a tendency for people on staffs to use the flag officer there.

1609
01:41:46.091 --> 01:41:49.550
They're working for,
they're using them like the,
uh,
um,

1610
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:55.840
the wizard of Oz,
right?
They're like,
oh,
the general just said this.

1611
01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:00.070
And then you're like,
well,
I saw his email and that's not what he said.
In fact,

1612
01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:03.130
here's,
let me forward you the email and highlight it.

1613
01:42:03.131 --> 01:42:06.770
And everyone else would be cc'd and no one does that.
But there's,
I,

1614
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.630
I've seen it happen a lot of times with other leadership who doesn't,

1615
01:42:09.631 --> 01:42:12.910
don't use flat comms where people below them,
we'll start saying,

1616
01:42:12.911 --> 01:42:15.340
this guy says this,
or this guy says that,

1617
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:20.740
and start doing a little bit of manipulation to maneuver whatever their agenda

1618
01:42:20.741 --> 01:42:24.790
is or just get things going the way they want to do.
But one thing I heard,

1619
01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.633
you know,

1620
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.180
<v 0>that's on that,
uh,
don't make a decision until you have to.</v>

1621
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:32.540
And there's a weird dichotomy in that because you know,
every,
there's,

1622
01:42:32.541 --> 01:42:37.460
there's plenty of quotes that are,
are the opposite of that,
which is,
um,

1623
01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.740
you know,
a good,
well,
like we said,

1624
01:42:39.741 --> 01:42:44.090
the though good plan right now is better than a great plan executed tomorrow or

1625
01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:46.010
whatever,
or you know,
you gotta be decisive.

1626
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:50.600
And the reality is there's,
and,
and I've,
I've,

1627
01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.170
I say this a lot,
which is,
if I know that we're a,
we get intel,

1628
01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.770
if there's bad guys in this building,
in this town somewhere,
and they're like,

1629
01:43:00.771 --> 01:43:03.860
we want you to go hit it.
That doesn't mean it's like,
okay,
okay,

1630
01:43:03.861 --> 01:43:05.990
I decide right now,
okay,
yes,
we're going to go hit it.

1631
01:43:05.991 --> 01:43:09.860
We load up the vehicles and we start driving and we drive there and hit it.
No,

1632
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:10.910
we actually go,
okay,

1633
01:43:10.911 --> 01:43:13.430
well let's let the inflammation develop and we'll start planning.

1634
01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.940
So I made a decision.
The decision was to start planning.

1635
01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.910
The decision is to go hit the target and then it's like,
okay,

1636
01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.130
well now it's nighttime.
We have a good plan,
but we're not sure.

1637
01:43:25.131 --> 01:43:28.730
We haven't confirmed the Intel.
Okay,
well let's,

1638
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:32.270
let's drive to a forward operating base and get staged,
right?

1639
01:43:32.271 --> 01:43:35.480
So we've still flexed.
I've decided to do that,

1640
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:38.570
but we haven't decided to go hit the thing,
but we're still prepared to,

1641
01:43:38.571 --> 01:43:41.840
if we need to.
We've moved in the right direction and then we get,
you know,

1642
01:43:41.841 --> 01:43:43.460
Intel that,
well,
we don't know,

1643
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:48.490
but a vehicle arrived at this person's house and we think it might be him.

1644
01:43:48.921 --> 01:43:53.660
Okay,
well let's push to a staging,
right?
We still haven't decided to hit it,

1645
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.080
but we've moved in that direction.
But this happens with businesses too,

1646
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:00.740
where there's something unfolding,
a new market,
right?
Hey,

1647
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:02.300
just new market might open up.
Okay,

1648
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.440
let's invest all of our money into this new market right now.
No,

1649
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:10.640
that's not a good move.
What you do is,
okay,
let's,
let's find out.
Let's,

1650
01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:14.120
let's invest a little bit of money and find out how big that market really is.

1651
01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:16.310
Okay,
cool.
We do a little study.
Oh,

1652
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:18.830
it turns out that that market does look pretty big.
Okay.

1653
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:22.340
Let's do a little research and see what it would take for us to push into that

1654
01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:25.040
market.
Okay,
cool.
And so you're moving in the right direction,

1655
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:30.041
but you're not just jumping in with this decisiveness to say,

1656
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:33.350
okay,
I've seen all I need to see.

1657
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:36.110
I've decided that we're just going to go all in right now.

1658
01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:41.180
That doesn't make a lot of sense.
Sometimes there's other times where it's like,

1659
01:44:41.181 --> 01:44:41.661
guess what?

1660
01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:44.090
We're standing in a hallway or we're standing in the street and we're getting

1661
01:44:44.091 --> 01:44:46.790
shot at,
we're going to get into a building.
That's what we're going to do.

1662
01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.250
Like there's no,
we're not going to think about,

1663
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:50.570
we're not gonna move towards the building.
No,

1664
01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:54.080
we're going in the building cause right now out here,
we're going to die.
So yes,

1665
01:44:54.081 --> 01:44:57.410
be decisive in those situations.
Be Decisive when you have to be decisive.

1666
01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:01.820
But if you don't have to make a decision,
the big decision right now,

1667
01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.580
and you can make a series of smaller decisions,

1668
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:09.440
iterative decisions that move you towards what you think decision you will have

1669
01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:13.430
to make,
then go that route.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1670
01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.950
Okay.
So you guys deploy to,
and this is when you guys,
uh,

1671
01:45:20.250 --> 01:45:21.083
get an emotional,

1672
01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:25.090
<v 2>no,
not as a following deployment.
Okay.
What'd you guys do on this deployment?</v>

1673
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:29.140
I went to the,
the,
the command split up.

1674
01:45:29.141 --> 01:45:32.950
So the um,
CEO and,
uh,

1675
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:37.330
the command master chief,
we're up in Iraq and then,
uh,

1676
01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:42.331
I was at another spot nondisclosed location on a crisis response element with

1677
01:45:43.811 --> 01:45:47.800
the expo.
And that was,
that was six months.
That was sick.
Wow.

1678
01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:51.700
We did five months cause at the time they said you have to be front door,

1679
01:45:51.701 --> 01:45:55.450
the front door in six months and because you can't predict the airflow,

1680
01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:00.130
we did a five and a half month
deployment.

1681
01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:04.340
And then that was a big eyeopener to,
because we on that deployment,
I start,

1682
01:46:04.341 --> 01:46:09.310
I was going to an embassy once a week.
Uh,
how the boys handle it.

1683
01:46:11.530 --> 01:46:14.740
I mean they,
they did good.
We had a,
um,

1684
01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:19.360
we had guys kind of spread out in different spots.
And uh,

1685
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:24.390
there was a big operation that went on on there that one of the national mission

1686
01:46:25.541 --> 01:46:29.500
force did.
And uh,
our guys participated in it and it was,

1687
01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:34.000
it was a good like shooting deal.
Uh,

1688
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:37.490
nothing happened up in Iraq.
I think it was frustrating for them.
Um,

1689
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.850
and then by the nature of how everything was,
there was a really strong,

1690
01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:43.750
slow strike process.

1691
01:46:43.751 --> 01:46:48.751
So when our guys could see like a vehicle born,

1692
01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:53.910
I e d driving towards Iraqi counterparts to blow them up,

1693
01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.470
it would take 20 minutes to get clearance to drop a bomb on and,
and,

1694
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:02.300
and only 15 minutes to drive there in like five minutes to drive there.
So you,

1695
01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.450
they just watch it happen live on TV and they're like,
ah.
So that,

1696
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:09.750
that aspect of it was frustrating and there wasn't,

1697
01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.430
wasn't a real clear decision made on what was going to happen at that point.

1698
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:19.260
So there wasn't,
I don't know,
the guys up there didn't do much,
but just spin,

1699
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:24.330
spin and spin and spin,
which is really difficult.
Okay.
Get ready.
Oh,

1700
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:28.920
nevermind.
Hey,
get ready on ever mind.
And uh,
um,

1701
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:34.620
yeah,
that,
that was,
uh,
that was good.
So it was a good deployment.
Overall,

1702
01:47:34.621 --> 01:47:37.140
it was a good experience for me to kind of like,

1703
01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:42.170
because I was the senior enlisted guy where I was at and so that was great.

1704
01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:44.570
And,
uh,
um,

1705
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:50.490
came back from that and we did our change of command and then I fleeted up to be

1706
01:47:50.491 --> 01:47:55.491
the command master chief and you don't really know who you're going to get

1707
01:47:57.031 --> 01:48:02.031
paired up with when you're in that leadership role because there's a commanding

1708
01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:05.160
officer in a commanding mass,
Steve.
And as it happened,

1709
01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.290
I got paired up with a guy that was just awesome and I'd known for ever,

1710
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:15.770
and the two of us are a lot of like personality wise,

1711
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:18.550
which we really,
you know,
like we,

1712
01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.760
we went to a couple of leadership seminars and they're like,

1713
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:23.070
you guys are almost the same person,
so hey,

1714
01:48:23.071 --> 01:48:25.860
here's what you're going to have to watch out for it because both of you are

1715
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:30.540
really blunt and um,
yeah,
I really won the lottery.
It was a,

1716
01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:33.220
it was a real pleasure working for him.
Um,

1717
01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:38.780
he was a fantastic leader in what he did really well specifically was,

1718
01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.450
he communicated a lot.
So He's,

1719
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.500
he always speaking with his,
his Xo is opposite officer and myself.

1720
01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:52.590
And then the task unit commanders,

1721
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:57.180
he spoke with the all once a week,
he would have a meeting with them once a week,

1722
01:48:57.181 --> 01:48:59.720
you know,
and he was all,
all the way down to the platoon OIC end.

1723
01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.720
He did it in a manner where he wasn't stepping on other people's toes and there

1724
01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:08.610
was never any,
there was never any,

1725
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000
any guessing on where he was coming from or what he expected.

1726
01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:20.620
And everybody knew that he cared about them was,
was,

1727
01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:23.550
is his first priority.
And then the mission came after that.

1728
01:49:23.551 --> 01:49:28.200
So that was really good.
But Hey,
you know what,
if you,
if you,

1729
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:32.990
if you messed up,
he don't hold you accountable.
He,
he,
oh,

1730
01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:35.460
he give,
give you a written counseling.

1731
01:49:35.461 --> 01:49:39.030
And he did that for some of his guys who just did some shady stuff and they're

1732
01:49:39.031 --> 01:49:43.390
good dudes.
And he was like,
okay,
well,
hey,
you know,

1733
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:46.860
hopefully this stops here and did,
do,
does a written constantly.
So,

1734
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.850
so that was good.
But uh,

1735
01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:52.560
<v 0>yeah,
again,
it's the same message that we talked about in the last podcast,</v>

1736
01:49:52.561 --> 01:49:56.640
which is just knowing where you stand.
Absolutely.

1737
01:49:56.641 --> 01:50:01.470
Having predictability and know when,
when you know a guy's got a reputation,
like,

1738
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:05.580
oh,
if you step out of line,
you're going to get formal written counseling.

1739
01:50:05.670 --> 01:50:07.290
That tightens people up immediately.

1740
01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.710
Whereas if you think on this guy's kind of a pushover,
guess what you do?

1741
01:50:10.711 --> 01:50:12.930
You cause more trouble and you cause more problems.

1742
01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:17.760
<v 2>Yeah,
you really do.
And it,
and it was like,
it was all as an escalation with it,</v>

1743
01:50:17.761 --> 01:50:21.120
but it was a,
it was straightforward.
And then everybody,
all his understood like,

1744
01:50:21.121 --> 01:50:25.110
Hey,
I'm,
I'm not mad at you.
These are just the standards we have here.

1745
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:29.730
And you did this.
Here's the consequences is that,
you know,

1746
01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:33.540
we need you to fix yourself.
I'm rooting for you to fix yourself.

1747
01:50:33.541 --> 01:50:37.700
I'm not mad at you.
And then let's just move forward from here.
Uh,

1748
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:42.960
got back from that deployment and then I got back in February.

1749
01:50:42.961 --> 01:50:47.910
You started this podcast and December Iris had started listening to it and then,

1750
01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.150
like I said,
podcast six is when I started listening to it.

1751
01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:55.880
And then I was caught up within a week because I was able to do it with my,

1752
01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.090
my longer commute.

1753
01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:01.560
And then just you talk about,

1754
01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:03.030
I wish I had this Ivan,

1755
01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.350
I had the luxury of having this when I was in a really important leadership

1756
01:51:07.351 --> 01:51:11.340
position,
threefold as a husband,

1757
01:51:11.341 --> 01:51:13.710
as a father and as a seal,
right?

1758
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:19.040
And those and the priorities are almost always the same or it's weighted heavily

1759
01:51:19.530 --> 01:51:23.440
husband,
father seal.
And so all this stuff that,
that,

1760
01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:28.460
that is discussed here through all these lessons from these books and all that

1761
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:33.810
it can take and apply to every stinking aspect of my life.

1762
01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.101
And I did it.

1763
01:51:35.101 --> 01:51:40.080
And like the hardest thing for me was that to really get introspective and

1764
01:51:40.081 --> 01:51:43.140
honest with myself about what my shortfalls where,

1765
01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.420
and it's not something that you can do overnight.

1766
01:51:45.421 --> 01:51:49.680
It's not like I can get a shot and get inoculated at something that is water

1767
01:51:49.681 --> 01:51:51.390
tortured in.

1768
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:57.480
And then I just growing so much from it and like I'm gone.

1769
01:51:57.481 --> 01:51:59.370
It's,
you know,
the,

1770
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:04.410
the like starting with the Dang see of machetes seasoned in the Michelle.

1771
01:52:05.670 --> 01:52:09.730
That was like the first really dark pocket and I was driving and I was wincing,

1772
01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.950
listened to that.
And I'm like,
why did he do that to me?
Um,

1773
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:19.940
but then I appreciated how good I had it right then then,

1774
01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.040
then.
And so now as those,

1775
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:28.041
those podcasts are so dang necessary to understand how evil I could,

1776
01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.910
cause I could,
I could completely go down any of those roads.

1777
01:52:34.050 --> 01:52:36.780
And then once you understand that that's in your heart,
you can control it,

1778
01:52:36.781 --> 01:52:40.570
but then you can appreciate how good you have it.
And,
and,

1779
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:43.650
and you've got that like the,
the um,

1780
01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:47.900
the episode that you did on the my Lai massacre,

1781
01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:53.380
I had to pull my car over because I was crying cause I was so ashamed that this,

1782
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:56.360
this is,
or like I was just like,

1783
01:52:56.361 --> 01:53:00.590
can't this story be about somebody else and not Americans.
And then

1784
01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:07.100
later on when,
when I,
when guys make chief and I talked to you about this,

1785
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:08.690
I'm like,
Hey,
when my guys make chief,
we,

1786
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:10.580
we have to put them through all this training.

1787
01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.800
A lot of the training I don't think is good.

1788
01:53:12.801 --> 01:53:14.180
One of the things I did for them is like,
hey,

1789
01:53:14.181 --> 01:53:19.181
we're going to listen to these three podcasts in my lay was one of them.

1790
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.730
The other one was a steal my soldiers hearts,

1791
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:27.050
which was an awesome podcast and awesome lessons and they're all awesome
lessons.

1792
01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:30.200
But it was all good because the guys listened to it and we'd have discussions

1793
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:32.660
and then,
you know,
you came in and,
and uh,

1794
01:53:32.661 --> 01:53:37.661
we VTC and talk to him and that was such good stuff.

1795
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:43.750
But going down that road and then being in all these different situations at the

1796
01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:46.670
executive levels,
levels of leaderships in the seal teams,

1797
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:51.920
and I could see in real time,
I'm like,
oh,
okay,
this is uh,

1798
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:54.380
this is I,
yeah,

1799
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:57.530
my face is getting flushed and I'm a little emotionally attached to this idea of

1800
01:53:57.531 --> 01:54:01.610
my Mike.
My fists are clenched.
What did he say?
He told me to breathe

1801
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.390
and then I come back and like,
oh,

1802
01:54:05.391 --> 01:54:09.770
or someone said something and I disagree with them and I just ran headlong into,

1803
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:13.610
you know,
a pill box and like that did not work out well.

1804
01:54:13.611 --> 01:54:15.320
Maybe I can learn to finesse it.

1805
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:20.350
And then it worked out great because our,

1806
01:54:20.361 --> 01:54:25.361
I think we did the feedback I've gotten anyway is that we did really good at the

1807
01:54:26.481 --> 01:54:30.670
team and we dealt well with a lot of other people.
Uh,
and,

1808
01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.420
and so that is,

1809
01:54:34.421 --> 01:54:39.421
is a huge degree for myself was having the podcast to learn these things and

1810
01:54:39.971 --> 01:54:44.971
miss military history and then being able just to be introspective and improve

1811
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.330
on,
uh,
on my life is all.
And then having these discussions with my,

1812
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:53.710
because she listens to the podcast all the time and when we discuss it and it's

1813
01:54:53.711 --> 01:54:58.220
just been good for,
for us across the board.

1814
01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:00.500
Um,
you know,

1815
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.300
when we deployed on that deployment,
and that's during the deployment,

1816
01:55:05.301 --> 01:55:08.050
when we did the,
uh,
the Clarence into Mosell,

1817
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:13.330
we had one platoon that went to an area and they were working on under the

1818
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:17.840
conventional Marie every,
well,
it was all,

1819
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:19.700
we were all working for the conventional,

1820
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:24.760
the conventional forces in Iraq in 2016,

1821
01:55:26.151 --> 01:55:26.661
17.

1822
01:55:26.661 --> 01:55:31.370
They were the main effort we were in support of and then our guys weren't to a

1823
01:55:31.371 --> 01:55:36.371
location where they inherited a pretty toxic relationship and they took some of

1824
01:55:37.731 --> 01:55:42.140
the lessons that you talked about and they went in there humble.
They said,
hey,

1825
01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:46.320
how can we help?
What can we do?
Oh Hey,
when are your,

1826
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:49.440
when do you have,
when are your normal battle rhythm meetings?

1827
01:55:49.441 --> 01:55:52.350
We want to send a representative there so we make sure we're doing everything

1828
01:55:52.351 --> 01:55:55.320
right and we're getting the word and all that.
And they really leaned into it.

1829
01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.620
They turn that relationship around in a matter of a month completely around and,

1830
01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:09.150
and then they were in an area of Iraq out west that was not,

1831
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.660
there wasn't a lot going on out there at the time,

1832
01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:17.490
but that colonel was so impressed with them and liked them.

1833
01:56:17.491 --> 01:56:21.540
He bent over backwards to make sure that he could get them outside the wire so

1834
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:22.590
that they could get after it.

1835
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:27.590
And we were able to get them outside the wire and at the end of deployment,

1836
01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.320
all five of our platoons had been in combat.
They were the last ones,

1837
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.850
the fifth platoon that hadn't.

1838
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.690
And then they got the opportunity to really mix it up on to operations.

1839
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:40.500
And it was 100% because of that,

1840
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:45.501
that colonel liked them as people and trusted him and wanted to see them do

1841
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:50.310
well.
He wanted to celebrate it.
And when people don't like it,
they want to see,

1842
01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:55.230
they'll walk across the street to see you get screwed over relationships are

1843
01:56:55.231 --> 01:56:58.890
stronger than the chain of command.
Absolutely.
And they had written in there,

1844
01:56:58.891 --> 01:57:03.650
I love this cause I've copied this on their,
on their whiteboard in there.

1845
01:57:03.710 --> 01:57:05.880
They're,
they're joint opera there,
jock,

1846
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:10.140
they had at the top in all caps relationships equal mission success.

1847
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:15.090
So when one of their [inaudible] went over and talked to a Marine Corps e five,

1848
01:57:15.810 --> 01:57:19.830
they were really cool with them.
They didn't manage their own security.

1849
01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:22.350
Like the Marines did security around their camp.

1850
01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:26.700
They would bring dinner out to the guys that were standing watch at night just

1851
01:57:26.701 --> 01:57:31.080
like it was.
It was awesome.
And then everybody,
there was a,
you know,

1852
01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.040
a real,
a real sense of teamwork and stuff out there.
Um,

1853
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.640
so that was good.
That was,

1854
01:57:38.641 --> 01:57:43.641
but you guys did some real tough fighting inside of Mozel.

1855
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:48.660
Yeah.
Now our,
our platoons that were up north,
um,
you know,

1856
01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:51.540
when they kicked off the liberation of Mosul,

1857
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.100
which was the biggest military operation since the invasion of Iraq,

1858
01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:59.640
and there were,
I believe,

1859
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:04.700
three different main lines of approach going towards the city.

1860
01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:09.720
And Isis pretty much controlled everything on the outside guys.

1861
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:11.610
The first couple days of that,

1862
01:58:11.611 --> 01:58:16.611
there were semi trucks that were loaded with explosives vehicle born.

1863
01:58:16.801 --> 01:58:20.940
IED is,
that was a semi,
like,
I don't think outside of the Moab,

1864
01:58:20.941 --> 01:58:25.230
we don't have a bond that's carrying that much stuff coming at them.
Um,

1865
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.610
and that's where,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1866
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.460
EOD chief finding was killed.
Um,

1867
01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:35.830
on the first couple of days when a,
our guys,
uh,

1868
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:40.150
had gotten into an area,
they were,
they were partnered up with the,

1869
01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:43.630
the Peshmerga,
which are the,
uh,

1870
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:48.050
who were the guys that Kurt Kurt's,
yeah.
Hurts.
Yeah.

1871
01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:52.130
So they're partnered up with them and they were pressing into an area and they

1872
01:58:52.131 --> 01:58:56.960
got into an area that was just too laden with ids.

1873
01:58:57.350 --> 01:59:01.340
And they were having to back up their,
uh,
their Matt ve,

1874
01:59:01.341 --> 01:59:06.341
the truck they were driving in and Jason had the door open so he could make sure

1875
01:59:08.781 --> 01:59:13.190
that he was in the same tire tracks of that he'd just driven over.
Unfortunately,

1876
01:59:13.191 --> 01:59:17.600
they driven over a crush plate,
wants it,
crushed it halfway.

1877
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:21.500
They hit the rest of the cross plate.
And,
uh,

1878
01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:27.140
it was a daisy chains of explosives.
It went off,
he ate a bunch of it,

1879
01:59:27.141 --> 01:59:28.340
hit him right in the face.

1880
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:34.070
It was a fairly horrible experience for our guys that were there because he was

1881
01:59:34.071 --> 01:59:35.720
still breathing

1882
01:59:38.190 --> 01:59:38.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

1883
01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:43.490
<v 2>Biologically he was alive for like the hour that they were with him before they</v>

1884
01:59:43.711 --> 01:59:46.080
could finally get them mad of back to him.
That was too hot.

1885
01:59:46.081 --> 01:59:50.400
The Medivac wouldn't come in,
so they had to offload them off the truck,

1886
01:59:50.401 --> 01:59:54.630
get them in the back of a pickup truck and then drive through all this heavy

1887
01:59:54.631 --> 01:59:59.160
fire and a lot more ideas to get them on,
on,
uh,

1888
02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:04.230
on board,
uh,
the medivac and then,
you know,
then he expired.

1889
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:09.120
And uh,
it,
it,

1890
02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:13.260
it's the worst case scenario period.

1891
02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:16.710
And it's something that we drilled.
We started drilling,

1892
02:00:16.711 --> 02:00:21.711
we call it a Keiko drill for when you lose a guy back on the strand.

1893
02:00:21.721 --> 02:00:24.990
And we would do full blown drills like,
okay,

1894
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:28.650
here's what we need to do,
um,

1895
02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:30.200
<v 1>okay</v>

1896
02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:34.070
<v 2>to to cover down on that so that we're ready and an on a little bit</v>

1897
02:00:34.071 --> 02:00:36.710
superstitious.
I think if we practiced to do something a whole bunch of times,

1898
02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:40.670
it's not going to happen.
And then it happened.

1899
02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:42.740
But luckily it's something that we,

1900
02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:46.040
it's not lucky that it happened,

1901
02:00:46.041 --> 02:00:50.990
but it's something that we drilled and more so we had like a book because

1902
02:00:50.991 --> 02:00:54.110
there's an incredible amount of emotion and everybody wants,

1903
02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:57.150
everyone gets excited,
they all want to do stuff in there.

1904
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:59.180
Sometimes you can do,

1905
02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:03.830
there's too much that you can do and you can confuse the situation.

1906
02:01:03.831 --> 02:01:07.700
So we just opened up,
we had the Keiko book,
we opened it up and we're like,

1907
02:01:07.701 --> 02:01:11.960
our admin or guy is like,
hey,
what's step one?
And it goes down.
He goes,

1908
02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:16.340
alright,
we need to do this.
What?
Step two,

1909
02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:20.960
we need to do this.
There's no way we would remembered that we went through it,

1910
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:25.970
went through the steps.
One of the things that,

1911
02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:31.220
that I was pretty adamant about is because I had a good idea,

1912
02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.160
although I haven't experienced it directly about what my guys had gone through

1913
02:01:37.161 --> 02:01:40.070
that were there with him.
Um,

1914
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:42.380
and I wanted to get a,

1915
02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:49.360
a psych out to just help them unpack some of the stuff they went through before

1916
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:53.300
the end of deployment.
So he could do two things.

1917
02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:56.810
He could get out there and help them unpack what they were,
you know,

1918
02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:01.010
what they went through.
And then he built up some rapport.

1919
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:02.930
So at the end of deployment on the,

1920
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:06.860
the next stop they had some rapport with them.

1921
02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:11.960
So the,
the group sent,
sent the guy out.

1922
02:02:11.961 --> 02:02:16.961
Now this is like three weeks after this happened because the best thing to do is

1923
02:02:17.421 --> 02:02:18.200
to do something.

1924
02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:21.980
And the guy stayed busy because there was a freaking war to fight.

1925
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:27.380
But then when stuff taper down for them and now like others downtime,
Hey,

1926
02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:28.214
guess what?

1927
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:33.440
The psychs coming out and he's going to hang out there and you don't need to

1928
02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:38.000
speak with him,
but he's available.
And typically he,
he,
you know,

1929
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:40.230
he'll get out there,
he puts the thing up.
Hey,
he wants to be quit.

1930
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.210
No one signs it.

1931
02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:46.490
But then he's just there and at lunchtime a guy hits him up and then later on

1932
02:02:46.491 --> 02:02:49.040
another guy hits him up and

1933
02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:56.600
yeah,
and the guys went through and there was,

1934
02:02:56.601 --> 02:03:01.340
there was heavy fighting up until the day that,

1935
02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:02.440
that we redeploy.

1936
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:07.310
Like team seven basically came in and were doing turnover ops and going out and

1937
02:03:07.311 --> 02:03:11.720
doing stuff there.
And Mozal we had just,
there was a little bit low of a law one.

1938
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:16.750
Eastern Mozal was finally cleared and then there was a big reassessment on

1939
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:21.410
moving over to the other side of the,
uh,
the river.
But,
uh,
um,

1940
02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.700
it,
it was,
it was busy and it was,
uh,

1941
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:28.070
it was pretty good.
I mean,

1942
02:03:28.071 --> 02:03:33.071
we had a couple of vehicle borne IED that got within a hundred yards of our guys

1943
02:03:34.401 --> 02:03:37.770
before they were able to kill him with,
and then the,
the,

1944
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:41.810
the drivers got like a kill switch on him.
So when he dies,

1945
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:42.860
it gets released,

1946
02:03:42.861 --> 02:03:47.861
it gets released in detonates and there was no shortage of the,

1947
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:53.060
I think there was at least like seven or eight of these things coming at us a

1948
02:03:53.061 --> 02:03:56.240
day.
And then they,
they'd been prepping for months.

1949
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:59.120
So they were laid in all across Mozal.

1950
02:03:59.121 --> 02:04:01.670
There was a garage underground that had a v bid in it.

1951
02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:04.580
And so as the frontline move closer,

1952
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:09.230
all of a sudden this car would just drive out and drive right into the Iraqis

1953
02:04:09.231 --> 02:04:12.200
and blow them up and there is no time to,
uh,

1954
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:16.940
hit it with a hell fire or,
uh,
or,
or stop it or whatever.

1955
02:04:16.941 --> 02:04:21.870
And they may have them come in pretty quick.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,

1956
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:26.700
going back to the casualty plan,
it's,

1957
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:31.360
you're giving me a hard time,
but you were harassing me saying like,

1958
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:35.810
when are you going to write your protocol book?
Because I've talked about,

1959
02:04:35.811 --> 02:04:38.220
you know,
how you've got to have protocol for certain situations

1960
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:40.710
<v 0>that aren't right?
Like you said,
things that are real emotional,</v>

1961
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.240
things that are moving real quick.
Things that you know you're,

1962
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.650
you need to be thinking about,

1963
02:04:46.651 --> 02:04:49.680
but you won't be able to think clearly about when they're actually going on.

1964
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.020
And that's what you're talking about.
You know,

1965
02:04:52.021 --> 02:04:55.620
you guys put together a protocol to follow and the navy has one and the teams

1966
02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:57.000
have one.
But you know,

1967
02:04:57.001 --> 02:04:58.890
you got to look at it and actually understand what it means.

1968
02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:02.490
You can't just open up a book that you've never looked at before,
so,
but,

1969
02:05:02.491 --> 02:05:06.270
but that protocol idea for,

1970
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:09.840
for your life is definitely a powerful thing.
Weather,

1971
02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:13.750
especially for things that are going to be emotional and,

1972
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:18.090
and rough to go through if you have a good protocol,
commence the protocol.

1973
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:18.953
Step one.

1974
02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:23.010
And you also talked about the guys continuing to be busy and that's absolutely

1975
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:26.700
true.
If you're going to sit around and wait,
if you're going to sit around,

1976
02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:30.510
you're just going to think about the,
the horrible event you just went through.

1977
02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:34.350
And that's not gonna go well cause you're not ready to deal with it.

1978
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.120
So get back to work,
work,
let it settle a little bit and then you'll,

1979
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:40.980
you know,
you'll,
you have to deal with it later,

1980
02:05:40.981 --> 02:05:42.420
but you do have to deal with it at some point.

1981
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:47.810
<v 2>Yeah.
I know that like one of the Times that I got to go out to the,
to the,</v>

1982
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:49.460
uh,
to the,

1983
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:53.720
to basically the flott with our guys who are going advise and assist and they

1984
02:05:53.721 --> 02:05:58.721
would be about three blocks back or four blocks back from the front lines.

1985
02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.413
Um,

1986
02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:09.220
the civilians that lived in Mozel would just move away from where the fighting

1987
02:06:10.731 --> 02:06:15.731
was and then just kind of mingle around just outside of it and then go back to

1988
02:06:16.191 --> 02:06:18.470
their houses.
So we were at this,

1989
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:23.300
this one location where the guys were providing support to the Iraqi cts and we

1990
02:06:23.301 --> 02:06:24.950
had snipers up on rooftops.

1991
02:06:24.951 --> 02:06:27.980
We're able to see all the way to the front lines and take shots.

1992
02:06:27.981 --> 02:06:30.320
And then we were also using mortars pretty heavily.

1993
02:06:30.321 --> 02:06:34.580
We got some 80 ones in that are just frigging awesome.
So

1994
02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:39.590
two things art.
So one thing and another story I'd have to,

1995
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:44.420
so there's all these civilians around which a little nerve wracking because

1996
02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.830
who's who,
right.
And there are a bunch of kids,

1997
02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:52.370
there were some kids right next to it living in the building next to a,

1998
02:06:52.730 --> 02:06:56.610
with their families next to where our trucks were parked.
And uh,

1999
02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:04.100
they were really nice kids and they spook pretty clear English and they wanted

2000
02:07:04.101 --> 02:07:06.890
candy and stuff.
So we were chatting with them a little bit and,

2001
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:08.990
and messing around.
And then,

2002
02:07:08.991 --> 02:07:13.730
so we were there all day and then in the evening a bunch more kids came out.

2003
02:07:13.731 --> 02:07:17.630
There was a whole group of kids and I don't know if they just come in the area

2004
02:07:17.631 --> 02:07:20.380
or was the evening and they just want to come out and play.
And so there is,

2005
02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:23.090
we are in this area where there weren't a lot of buildings,

2006
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:26.900
so we're right in the middle of this big field.
So,
you know,

2007
02:07:26.901 --> 02:07:31.550
we could see anything coming and the kids were all playing.

2008
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:36.850
And then a salvo of one twenties came in and so 120 millimeter more boom,

2009
02:07:39.710 --> 02:07:44.680
boom.
And they basically kind of bracketed us.

2010
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.380
But then where,

2011
02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:52.650
where one of them landed was right where those stinking those poor kids were.

2012
02:07:52.810 --> 02:07:57.810
And I looked over there and I saw like this beautiful little girl hop in a way

2013
02:08:00.911 --> 02:08:03.160
in the smoke and she's missing a leg.

2014
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:09.290
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2015
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:12.350
<v 2>I saw a guy run out and snatch up a little body</v>

2016
02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:18.480
and he's just wailing.
I thought,
you know,

2017
02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:20.400
I thought about my kids at home

2018
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.180
and what those people are going through and how awful it must be.

2019
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.080
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2020
02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:32.080
<v 2>And how are we just got to redouble our efforts to stop this freaky crap that</v>

2021
02:08:32.361 --> 02:08:37.250
was going on with sold because it is just so unsat because little kids are

2022
02:08:37.251 --> 02:08:41.210
little kids are little kids,
you know,
wherever they're from or what,
you know.

2023
02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:44.320
And to see innocent shattered like that.

2024
02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:49.233
It was rough.

2025
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:58.070
But that's,
that's part about,
you know,

2026
02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.270
knowing the darkness and what does that do that makes me appreciate my kids more

2027
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:07.760
and then never pass up an opportunity to hug him or tell him I love him or

2028
02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:10.100
anything like that.

2029
02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:15.370
<v 0>Yeah.
And that does those kinds of stories right there.
Um,</v>

2030
02:09:16.770 --> 02:09:17.320
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2031
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.170
<v 0>you know,
I</v>

2032
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.583
<v 5>all right</v>

2033
02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:25.250
<v 0>pretty regularly have to explain to people that there are evil human beings in</v>

2034
02:09:28.591 --> 02:09:33.450
the world,
that they're,
those,
those people that dropped those mortars,

2035
02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:36.870
they don't care about those kids at all.

2036
02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.830
And I heard other stories from guys coming back from Mosul after you were,

2037
02:09:40.831 --> 02:09:45.000
there were one of the biggest risks that was going on.

2038
02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:49.860
Was the,
the guys doing the EOD job?
Well,
what does the EOD guy do?

2039
02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:51.360
He dismantles bombs.

2040
02:09:51.630 --> 02:09:55.530
Well they do that in the lowest possible risk way that they can,

2041
02:09:55.650 --> 02:09:57.810
which often means if we find,

2042
02:09:57.811 --> 02:10:01.230
or if they find an IED of some kind,
what are they?
Do?

2043
02:10:01.231 --> 02:10:02.550
They just blow it up in place.

2044
02:10:02.551 --> 02:10:05.910
They send a robot robot over there and detonate the thing and just blow it up.

2045
02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:09.930
And that makes your job a lot less risky.
Well what was happening over there,

2046
02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:13.200
it was suicide.
There was suicide bombers.
Okay.

2047
02:10:13.201 --> 02:10:14.970
So what do you do with a suicide bomber?
Well,

2048
02:10:14.971 --> 02:10:18.630
what you do with a suicide bomber that comes up that's wearing a suicide vest,

2049
02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:21.780
you shoot them and kill them and that makes your job pretty easy.

2050
02:10:21.810 --> 02:10:22.800
Cause then you can then,

2051
02:10:22.801 --> 02:10:25.050
once you've got a dead person with a bomb on their chest,

2052
02:10:25.051 --> 02:10:28.770
you can send a robot over there and blow up the bomb.
Well,

2053
02:10:28.771 --> 02:10:31.200
what happened and what the,

2054
02:10:31.201 --> 02:10:36.201
some of the stories I got told was that isis was putting these suicide vests on

2055
02:10:38.691 --> 02:10:39.650
little kids.

2056
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:44.960
And so you can't shoot the little kid and you don't want the little kid to get

2057
02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:47.180
that name.
And it was one of the riskiest things that they had to do.

2058
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:50.870
And you know,
that's,
and again,
that's what,

2059
02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:55.310
that's the kind of thing that,
that,

2060
02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.960
you know,
there's,
there's uh,
like,

2061
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:09.763
<v 5>okay,</v>

2062
02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:14.580
<v 0>there's a lot of,
I'm not saying America is a perfect place because it is not,</v>

2063
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:15.623
but

2064
02:11:18.610 --> 02:11:21.150
that kind of duty,
you hear a story like that.

2065
02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:22.083
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2066
02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:24.050
<v 0>And you know that there is a,</v>

2067
02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:29.120
some random EOD guy with a wife and kids at home and whatever else he's got

2068
02:11:29.671 --> 02:11:30.504
going on.

2069
02:11:30.570 --> 02:11:35.570
And he puts all that on the line to try and help some little Iraqi kid from

2070
02:11:36.481 --> 02:11:37.500
getting blown up.

2071
02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:43.050
That's say what you want about America.
But that right there is America.

2072
02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:50.030
<v 2>We went out to the,
to the,
well I,</v>

2073
02:11:50.110 --> 02:11:51.960
I the guys were going out to the floor every day.

2074
02:11:51.961 --> 02:11:55.710
I got an opportunity to go out with him another time when they were right on the

2075
02:11:55.711 --> 02:11:58.710
edge of,
of Mozal going into it.

2076
02:11:58.711 --> 02:12:02.940
And the building that they were occupying,
um,
was a school.

2077
02:12:04.530 --> 02:12:09.530
And one thing I noticed as I was walking through the buildings of the school is

2078
02:12:11.191 --> 02:12:14.130
that on the walls of the school,
like okay,

2079
02:12:14.131 --> 02:12:18.810
inside the classrooms had all the Disney princesses,

2080
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.000
Dora the explorer,

2081
02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:26.790
all this stuff that our kids enjoy there.
So it's two fold.

2082
02:12:26.791 --> 02:12:27.250
There's,
there's,

2083
02:12:27.250 --> 02:12:31.080
there's a thought like all our western culture and lifestyle is going to get

2084
02:12:31.090 --> 02:12:36.090
overrun negative because western culture on the whole,

2085
02:12:37.111 --> 02:12:40.920
while you said it's not perfect,
is still the best thing going.

2086
02:12:41.130 --> 02:12:43.260
And it is completely contagious.

2087
02:12:43.590 --> 02:12:47.870
And even over there in Iraq and an art school that was controlled by Isol,

2088
02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:53.020
they're little kids are looking at the Disney princesses and Dora the explorer

2089
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:59.310
and you know,
that stuff,
western things because it's good.

2090
02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:03.120
It's appealing.
Yeah.
And that that gave me,

2091
02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:05.820
that gave me a tremendous amount of hope

2092
02:13:07.590 --> 02:13:09.900
in just our culture and way of life

2093
02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.410
<v 0>forward.
That's the whole idea of months ago when I had said that,
oh,</v>

2094
02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:16.780
you want to solve the problem in North Korea?

2095
02:13:16.810 --> 02:13:21.810
Give those people I phones so they can start watching youtube because you watch

2096
02:13:21.941 --> 02:13:25.820
a couple of youtube videos and you look around at your,
you know,

2097
02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:30.890
baron neighborhood where you're eating like a water with salt in it is your

2098
02:13:31.651 --> 02:13:36.651
dinner and you watch a youtube video of people eating steaks and Mcdonald's and

2099
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:39.540
subway and you think yourself,

2100
02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.010
the something's not right here and it's not going to take real long before those

2101
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:45.510
people say,
look,
we're doing this wrong.

2102
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:47.480
And you've probably heard that story about Gorbachev would,

2103
02:13:47.490 --> 02:13:51.030
Gorbachev came to America and went in if you're the story,
no.

2104
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:56.090
Gorbachev came to America from the Soviet Union and he went into like a a a Vons

2105
02:13:57.181 --> 02:14:02.181
or whatever supermarket he went into and he went into the cereal aisle and saw

2106
02:14:02.251 --> 02:14:07.251
that there was 390 different kinds of cereal in there and he realized that they

2107
02:14:10.981 --> 02:14:12.540
needed to stop what they were doing.

2108
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:16.200
Cause you know how many different types of cereal there was in the Soviet Union.

2109
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:17.123
One,

2110
02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:22.460
you know that's it and when you try and control everything it doesn't work.

2111
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.430
And actually I remember you called me up one day,
you're like,

2112
02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:28.860
hey this was like I was listening this podcast,

2113
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:31.800
this applies to everything cause like it's the same with government.
I'm like,

2114
02:14:31.801 --> 02:14:34.140
yes it is.
You can't control everything.

2115
02:14:34.410 --> 02:14:37.860
If one person tries to make all the decisions it doesn't work.

2116
02:14:37.861 --> 02:14:42.660
I was actually going to read this Thomas Soul chunk from when I,
when I,

2117
02:14:42.661 --> 02:14:47.400
last time I had Jordan Peterson on because he lays out this thing about how the

2118
02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:47.910
government,

2119
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:52.910
the government trying to control the pricing of some kind of pelt,

2120
02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:57.060
some kind of pelts in,
in,
if the government raises the prices,

2121
02:14:57.510 --> 02:15:01.620
every hunter goes and goes and gets all these pelts and it turns them into the

2122
02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:05.340
government and then the government,
what do they have now?
An excess of pelts.

2123
02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:06.930
And so now where are they?
Do with them all?

2124
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:09.840
They don't do anything because there's nothing to do with them because they

2125
02:15:09.930 --> 02:15:11.850
don't have,
they aren't needed.

2126
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:17.010
And his whole cycle unfolds where things just don't work with centralized

2127
02:15:17.011 --> 02:15:22.011
command and the things like Dora the explorer and the Disney princesses and

2128
02:15:27.330 --> 02:15:32.330
Thomas the tank engine and all of these Mikey and the dragons,

2129
02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:35.940
these things are going to spread.

2130
02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:39.870
And those evil bastards,

2131
02:15:40.170 --> 02:15:42.390
what do they do to try and stop it?
You know,
what do they do?

2132
02:15:42.391 --> 02:15:44.700
They try and control anything,

2133
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:49.170
any and any form of freedom and especially freedom of speech,
you know,

2134
02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:53.490
controlling the Internet.
All those things and it's disturbing to see.

2135
02:15:53.550 --> 02:15:58.550
But I believe that like in Jurassic Park,

2136
02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:04.680
echo movie reference my [inaudible],
what's he really?
Yeah,

2137
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:08.310
he's like one of the first guys to appear on the screen.
He just walks past.

2138
02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.960
He's in.
I still still in that movie.
I think the line,

2139
02:16:12.961 --> 02:16:17.580
his life will find a way,
right?
Life will find a way.
That's what happens.

2140
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:22.590
That's what happens.
You know,
with all these,
um,
these,

2141
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:26.700
these folks will remember those folks in Mozel,
they'll remember that.

2142
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:31.420
They'll remember who gave freedom.
And by the way it was Iraqi troops,

2143
02:16:31.421 --> 02:16:35.500
which was amazing to hear the Iraqi troops fighting hard and sacrificing.

2144
02:16:35.590 --> 02:16:39.580
Because in Ramadi it was pretty rough to get the Iraqi troops to take lead.

2145
02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:40.750
And when they would take lead,

2146
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:46.150
the insurgents would be waiting for them and would be deal heavy blows to those

2147
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:50.260
guys.
And it was a nightmare to watch.
But it's,

2148
02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:54.250
it's awesome that they stepped up and they did the house to house clearance.

2149
02:16:54.310 --> 02:16:56.800
What do they have at least supported by coalition forces,

2150
02:16:56.801 --> 02:17:00.210
by Americans firepower and all that.
Yeah,
but guess what?
How many,
how,

2151
02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.600
how many people did they lose?

2152
02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:05.950
<v 2>Uh,
at one point we thought we were going to lose our entire partner force.</v>

2153
02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:10.120
When they first kicked it off,
they were losing,

2154
02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:16.360
they are losing 15 to 20 guys a day and,
and we did the math.

2155
02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:18.910
We are like at this rate and it was because our,

2156
02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:22.240
our strike process was really Sloan and hadn't gotten decentralized yet.

2157
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:25.810
That was fixed later.
But we're,
we're like okay,

2158
02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.840
at this rate in three weeks these guys were in our entire part of horse is going

2159
02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:34.180
to be gone.
Yeah.

2160
02:17:34.470 --> 02:17:39.450
<v 0>And what's really impressive is there,
we lost a battalion aid,
Ramadi,</v>

2161
02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:42.870
they deserted and w they had shown up,

2162
02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:47.250
they did a couple of operations,
they took some casualties and they left.

2163
02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.270
And so for,
for those guys,
when you were in Mosul,

2164
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:53.580
take massive casualties and stick it out,

2165
02:17:53.581 --> 02:17:58.320
that shows you that how much that's just leaves and it's,
it's,
it's in comparable

2166
02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:01.690
<v 2>day one was third before it was their CTO,
their counter terrorism unit,
which is,</v>

2167
02:18:01.691 --> 02:18:05.500
they're like premiere basically tier one.

2168
02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:09.130
They were all really,
really good to go dialed in.

2169
02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:14.070
And it was just,
the fighting was so brutal.
They were losing guys heavily.
Yeah.

2170
02:18:15.450 --> 02:18:16.950
<v 0>And the other funny thing,</v>

2171
02:18:16.951 --> 02:18:21.330
somebody put this on social media the other day and it was like Jocko Willink,

2172
02:18:21.331 --> 02:18:25.380
he predicts the future or something like that because I was with on with Joe

2173
02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:27.600
Rogan and Joe Rogan's,
I get,
what do you do about these isis guys now?

2174
02:18:27.601 --> 02:18:29.010
How could you ever defeat them?
And I was like,

2175
02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:33.060
if you gave the isis problem too,

2176
02:18:33.061 --> 02:18:36.240
like a Marine Corps second lieutenant and said like,
Hey,

2177
02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:39.180
figuring a plan and how to beat these guys,
they could do it.

2178
02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:40.650
It's like there's a bunch of bad guys.

2179
02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.530
You're surround them and move through and killed them all.

2180
02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.240
That's what we're going to do.
And he's like,
yeah,
that actually did happen.
And,

2181
02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:49.920
and that is what happened.
And it was,
it was beautiful.

2182
02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.420
And the amount of attrition that took place was

2183
02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:56.220
<v 2>awesome.
Yeah.</v>

2184
02:18:56.970 --> 02:19:00.840
And for those people that think that you can't kill an idea,

2185
02:19:02.490 --> 02:19:05.100
they're wrong,
you know?

2186
02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.690
And then there was some of the stuff where isol had gotten so hysterical was

2187
02:19:09.691 --> 02:19:11.730
something,
there was a video.
They,
there's one of those,
you know,

2188
02:19:11.731 --> 02:19:14.250
like do those horrible videos.
Yeah.
And it was,

2189
02:19:14.251 --> 02:19:18.600
something happened over in Syria and they released a video where they,
you know,

2190
02:19:18.601 --> 02:19:22.230
they killed like nine guys,
but they were from the local area.

2191
02:19:22.350 --> 02:19:26.100
And then I guess the tribe was like,
Hey,

2192
02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:30.830
can we have the bodies back of our guys you just killed?
And they're like,
no.

2193
02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:36.080
So the next day a suicide bomber walks into the isol headquarters in that area

2194
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:39.350
from that tribe,
which the way the tribal is more,

2195
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:44.390
they're willing to do that and boom,
clocked off,
killed like 30 people.
They just,

2196
02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:45.771
you know,

2197
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:50.771
and I think there's one or two people that are kind of hardwired maybe to do

2198
02:19:52.221 --> 02:19:57.221
that out of a thousand and they have to do these videos and force people to do

2199
02:19:59.511 --> 02:20:03.470
that stuff because it's not in their nature.
Certainly as an in mind,
another,

2200
02:20:03.471 --> 02:20:06.550
that's another big misconception is like,
oh,
they're just willing to die.
No,

2201
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:10.310
they're getting coerced and forced into those situations.
You know,
that's,

2202
02:20:10.311 --> 02:20:12.500
that's what's actually happening.
Like you said.
Sure.

2203
02:20:12.501 --> 02:20:15.770
Is there one out of a thousand that's like so brainwashed that they're like,
yes,

2204
02:20:15.771 --> 02:20:19.580
I'm going to go be a Marger.
Sure there is some of those,
but most of them are,

2205
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:21.260
hey,
if you don't do this,
we're going to kill your whole family.

2206
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:25.880
So which one do you want?
And the guys go,
yeah,
okay,
go ahead.
Go on over there.

2207
02:20:25.881 --> 02:20:28.520
And I'm talking about situations to where they've got,

2208
02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:32.990
they all like a guy strap to a post with the thing on and then they tell someone

2209
02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:36.110
go stab him.
And the guy did,
no one wants to do that.

2210
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:38.510
You don't like there.

2211
02:20:38.511 --> 02:20:41.630
They were doing what the Japanese were doing in world war two.
Oh,
okay.

2212
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:44.240
I see what you're saying.
Hey,
go hike off some heads for training today.

2213
02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:48.830
Go kill some poor Chinese farmer.
Go and no one wants to do.

2214
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.080
Most people don't want to do that.

2215
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.760
And that's like an in their situation to a lot of those people that are going,

2216
02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:57.800
I don't want anything to do with this now go,
you got to do it.

2217
02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:00.500
Or the result is we're going to kill your family.

2218
02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:04.880
And then they just get into a situation where they're doing it and it's not
good.

2219
02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:09.260
Anyhow,
on a positive note,

2220
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.410
like on that deployment,
I cleaned my dang diet up as a result.
As you know,

2221
02:21:15.411 --> 02:21:17.890
Peter Attia being on this podcast and nine,

2222
02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:22.610
I'm listened to Peter t as podcasts and keeping smart on my health and started

2223
02:21:22.611 --> 02:21:26.270
doing a,
basically I did pretty strict Kido.

2224
02:21:26.310 --> 02:21:31.310
There's a couple of weeks where I ate nothing but eggs and sardines and man,

2225
02:21:31.901 --> 02:21:34.520
that is boring.
Oh.

2226
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.870
But uh,
I felt,
I've found,
you know,

2227
02:21:38.871 --> 02:21:43.280
my inflammation went away.
I dropped pounds and I was getting in good shape.

2228
02:21:43.310 --> 02:21:45.980
And then I started experimenting with intermittent fasting,

2229
02:21:45.981 --> 02:21:49.540
which is something that I'm still doing now and now is,

2230
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:52.440
that's good stuff.
You start that,
uh,

2231
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:56.390
during deployment before Flint on the deployment limit,
I'm like,
Hey,
okay,

2232
02:21:57.350 --> 02:22:01.220
I'm going to quit eating sugar.
Cause you,
you'd mentioned sugar's bad for you.

2233
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:06.221
And I never really paid attention to it because we're sugar is bad.

2234
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:11.390
And then I'm like,
uh,
okay.
I see.
I'm like,
Hey,

2235
02:22:11.391 --> 02:22:14.330
I'm going to stop eating sugar.
And I was eating big salads and stuff like that.

2236
02:22:14.331 --> 02:22:14.810
And uh,
and,

2237
02:22:14.810 --> 02:22:18.300
and there was a guy that I was deployed with is really smart on this stuff and,

2238
02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:21.290
and he's like,
well,
hey,
if you're,
if you stopped eating sugar,

2239
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:24.830
then you need to quit eating that yogurt and that milk's got a lot of sugar and

2240
02:22:24.831 --> 02:22:29.040
it guess what?
That fruit has got a lot of sugar in it.
So man,

2241
02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:33.060
then I started looking at labels,
getting smart,
picked up a book,

2242
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:37.750
read it on basically,
you know,
how I eat now is,

2243
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:40.710
is,
is round about a Paleo thing.

2244
02:22:40.711 --> 02:22:45.630
Like I try to avoid grains and carbohydrates and stuff that's processed.

2245
02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:46.963
Um,

2246
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:50.800
<v 0>because the other day you're like,
you know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,
you know,</v>

2247
02:22:50.801 --> 02:22:52.960
I'm staying,
I stay that way.
But then you're like,

2248
02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:56.260
but if I go to someone's house and they say like,
Hey,
do you want to,
you know,

2249
02:22:56.261 --> 02:22:58.480
do you want a piece of bread or whatever?

2250
02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:01.170
<v 2>Yeah.
I eat it.
Yeah.
Cause there's it,</v>

2251
02:23:01.330 --> 02:23:06.330
there's another aspect to that I don't want to be the Vegan guy is like,

2252
02:23:07.391 --> 02:23:11.950
hey,
you know what?
I'm better than you because I'm a Vegan,
so I'm,
I'm the,

2253
02:23:11.951 --> 02:23:13.880
I'm better than you.
It.
Yeah.

2254
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:18.990
And so it's like really uncool if someone offers you food to say no.

2255
02:23:20.470 --> 02:23:24.070
So that's,
that's where,
that's something that I weigh out.
If it was like,
oh,
okay,

2256
02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:26.740
I go over to your house and we're having pieces of dinner,

2257
02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:30.970
that's what I'm going to eat because I can afford to eat a piece of pizza or

2258
02:23:31.350 --> 02:23:32.400
that guy.

2259
02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:41.420
<v 0>And then you just gotta watch out for this slippery slope because it is,</v>

2260
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:45.980
I say no to bread all the time.
Oh No,
no,
I'm good.
Um,

2261
02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.870
and then like you said,
if it's someone,
hey,
if it's,

2262
02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:52.700
if it's a situation that unfolds where it's like,
oh,

2263
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:57.500
I'm going to look like I'm going to be bringing attention to myself is really

2264
02:23:57.501 --> 02:23:58.334
what it boils down to.

2265
02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:03.580
I'm going to make everyone talk to me about me and my little thing it's like no

2266
02:24:03.981 --> 02:24:05.180
I'm not that important.
You know,

2267
02:24:05.230 --> 02:24:10.230
I'm just some dude who like is weird so I'm not going to make a big thing out of

2268
02:24:11.211 --> 02:24:13.760
that and breads handy.

2269
02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:18.710
I mean eat some meat without getting your fingers all dirty.
Yeah,
no it's,
it is,

2270
02:24:18.711 --> 02:24:23.711
it is handy and the the lettuce wraps while good in theory and actually have you

2271
02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:30.270
had someone make a burger.
I had one the other day was an iceberg.

2272
02:24:30.470 --> 02:24:35.470
I said I asked for like lettuce on a burger and it was iceberg lettuce cut and

2273
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:38.210
like basically in half.

2274
02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.130
So it was big too big giant chunks and it worked really well.
I was pretty,

2275
02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:44.480
cause normally it's like,
oh,

2276
02:24:44.481 --> 02:24:47.480
they give you that one big piece of lettuce that's all wilted.

2277
02:24:47.481 --> 02:24:50.450
By the time it gets you,
you can't pick that thing up.
It's not happening.

2278
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:52.520
You actually got to use a fork and knife to eat a burger,

2279
02:24:52.521 --> 02:24:55.490
which in its own right is kind of disturbing.

2280
02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.050
If we're eating burgers and we're using a fork and knife,
we don't respect that.

2281
02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:03.140
I mean that's just not something that we're doing,
but all of a sudden we are,

2282
02:25:03.141 --> 02:25:07.780
if we've got wilted lettuce on the his
shit.

2283
02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.950
And so you started,
so you cleaned up your diet.

2284
02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:11.690
What did you weigh when you went on deployment?

2285
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:16.200
<v 2>193 pounds and I'm five foot six.
And then what'd you weigh when you got home?</v>

2286
02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:20.040
Uh,
I think I was one 65.
How did you feel?
Mentally?

2287
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:23.030
Way Better Way and,

2288
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:26.640
and Akbar's lead already cleaned up your habits.

2289
02:25:26.850 --> 02:25:31.490
So you were basically getting on step right as,
as I've been,

2290
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:35.170
I've been on step probably for two years and,
and you know,
it's a sleep psych.

2291
02:25:35.171 --> 02:25:37.350
Anything else?
It just got to be disciplined with it.
Um,

2292
02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:41.950
I don't get up at four 30 in the morning.
I get up around five 30 or six,

2293
02:25:42.310 --> 02:25:46.000
but I'm really careful that that like,
you know,

2294
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:51.030
the lights are all out because for me even stupid little lights will wake me up

2295
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:55.300
and,
and it's quiet and all that.
And then I got,

2296
02:25:55.301 --> 02:25:58.150
I got one of those weighted blankets,
which is pretty cool.

2297
02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:03.250
Do you must've told my wife about that or iris did because we both have a

2298
02:26:03.251 --> 02:26:05.800
weighted blanket now too.
It's not on my side of the bed.

2299
02:26:05.801 --> 02:26:07.520
It's just on her side of the bed.
Yeah,

2300
02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:10.870
they're not cool in the summertime cause they're too hot.
Oh yeah man.

2301
02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:14.630
I just go to sleep and sleep.
I don't wake up at all.

2302
02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:17.980
Told him til the next morning and I'm like normally you wake up a couple of

2303
02:26:17.981 --> 02:26:20.590
times during the night and that they needed to get under there and you feel all

2304
02:26:20.591 --> 02:26:24.980
safe and you're like,
oh I feel like I'm in the womb.
You're,

2305
02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:27.490
you've got the weighted blanket,
you got the c pap machine,

2306
02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.440
you're just keeping it real.
One of our mutual friends that has a c pap machine.

2307
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:35.410
And his wife was like,
you know,

2308
02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:36.820
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2309
02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:37.211
<v 2>when you,</v>

2310
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:42.211
when you mask comes off d do you know I'm trying to wake you up so you can put

2311
02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:45.430
it back on.
And he's like,
don't,
you know,
don't just leave me alone.

2312
02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:48.940
And she's like,
well what if your mass comes off and then you stop breathing?

2313
02:26:48.970 --> 02:26:51.280
And he's like,
just let me die.

2314
02:26:56.470 --> 02:26:59.320
So that's good.
So you come home from that deployment

2315
02:27:00.970 --> 02:27:02.800
and then what you do when you got back,

2316
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:08.110
did you over to trade and three became the command master chief there and then

2317
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:10.360
started,
you know,
preparing her roommate,

2318
02:27:10.390 --> 02:27:14.470
making sure all the fundamentals that you stayed in place.

2319
02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:17.230
We're still there and they were still there.

2320
02:27:17.231 --> 02:27:21.630
The guys are just really hard and doing a good job.
And then,
uh,

2321
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:27.400
and how was it overrunning unit level training and,

2322
02:27:27.810 --> 02:27:32.450
and seeing that and then,
uh,
working myself out of a job,
getting the,

2323
02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:33.410
the,
the,

2324
02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:37.650
the guy that's my replacement set up to take my job in and,

2325
02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.790
and here's the deal.
Like as I leave naval special warfare.

2326
02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:45.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2327
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:46.850
<v 2>They are so good to go.</v>

2328
02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:51.440
And I see the younger guys now that are coming up at every level.

2329
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:54.520
The people like to complain about the millennials and I,

2330
02:27:54.521 --> 02:27:58.220
I really don't see any issue with them cause they're doing good and it,

2331
02:27:58.221 --> 02:28:02.630
and when I measure myself against who they are when I was their age,

2332
02:28:03.050 --> 02:28:05.030
they're way better.
I'm like,
oh my goodness.

2333
02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:07.940
Biggest problem I have with millennials right now as I look at him and I'm like,

2334
02:28:07.941 --> 02:28:12.200
how are you so much bigger and stronger and smarter than I ever was when I was

2335
02:28:12.201 --> 02:28:17.201
22 I told you this the other day I roll in here and I hear some like guys

2336
02:28:18.771 --> 02:28:22.040
training over on like another.
Matt and I looked over there

2337
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.070
<v 0>and you're clearly young frog men and there's six of them and they're all</v>

2338
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:31.310
dripping with sweat because they've been getting after it hard and they all look

2339
02:28:31.311 --> 02:28:36.311
like they're yoked and just ready to go start just killing people.

2340
02:28:36.410 --> 02:28:38.220
And I'm like,
what's up fellas?
Yeah.

2341
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:41.660
Like we're getting ready to go to land warfare.
I said Legit,

2342
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:46.830
just so happy.
Then it just,
yeah,
you're,
you're right.
These guys in,

2343
02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:49.670
in the teams right now and in the military at large.

2344
02:28:49.671 --> 02:28:51.950
If you're going in the military,
you're doing it for a reason.

2345
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:55.070
You know when you and I joined there one no war going on,

2346
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:57.350
we were hoping there would be,
but you're going to now look me,

2347
02:28:57.351 --> 02:28:59.330
you know what's up,
you know what you're doing,

2348
02:28:59.331 --> 02:29:04.250
you know what you're stepping into and now retirement you're going to go,

2349
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:08.980
<v 2>I think so I'm really excited but 30 years is a long enough time to where I'm</v>

2350
02:29:08.981 --> 02:29:09.814
like,
Ooh,

2351
02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:12.710
<v 0>yeah.</v>

2352
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:17.620
My hardest part is that like I'm glad that you're going with a feeling like,
hey,

2353
02:29:17.621 --> 02:29:22.540
things are good to go is the hardest part is you start thinking that you like

2354
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:26.770
that you are so critical and now like,
oh what?
It's like no,

2355
02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:29.920
there's 10 guys that are just as good as me,

2356
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:32.140
better than me and they're all going to get in there.

2357
02:29:32.141 --> 02:29:35.230
They're going to do a better job than I could've ever done.
And,

2358
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:38.770
and then the other thing is like when you hear some rumor or whatever about

2359
02:29:38.771 --> 02:29:40.900
something going sideways and you get,

2360
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:46.590
you get all freaked out because do you want to be like back where you can help

2361
02:29:46.991 --> 02:29:49.660
and you got guys going on deployment.
Like if something,

2362
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:53.230
it just like that you have to you,
it's just hard to let go.

2363
02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:56.680
And I mean I'm not saying you're going to be able to let it go,
but it's,

2364
02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:01.230
it's hard to not just think about it the same all the time.
Like

2365
02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:04.240
it's hard to,

2366
02:30:04.390 --> 02:30:08.560
it's hard to come to grips with the fact that you're not in the teams anymore.

2367
02:30:08.650 --> 02:30:09.410
That's all it is.

2368
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:12.170
<v 2>Yeah.
And then that's what I mean,</v>

2369
02:30:12.171 --> 02:30:15.410
I'm super appreciative that I'm getting to work with echelon front because of

2370
02:30:15.411 --> 02:30:19.160
work that the best thing about being in the teams is the peer group.

2371
02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:23.750
And so I'm trading right into the same peer group of just a bunch of awesome

2372
02:30:23.751 --> 02:30:27.110
people and then getting to go.

2373
02:30:27.111 --> 02:30:32.111
And I've really enjoyed like a third of my career as a seal team five.

2374
02:30:32.810 --> 02:30:36.530
The other third of it was at trade yet.
And I've really,

2375
02:30:36.531 --> 02:30:40.760
really enjoy working with people.
Um,
teaching,

2376
02:30:40.761 --> 02:30:45.480
passing stuff on learning.
I'm always learning and that's,
um,

2377
02:30:45.530 --> 02:30:47.000
I'm super excited about it.

2378
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:50.650
<v 0>Yeah.
It's like I said,
once you get over the fact and um,</v>

2379
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:54.880
I'll give you a little heads up.
Have you cleaned out your locker yet?
It's,

2380
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:59.390
it's like 80% done.
Okay.
Yeah,
that last 20% sucks.

2381
02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:01.550
That's the worst part for me.

2382
02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:06.170
Loading that stuff into my van and knowing and then your,
your car,

2383
02:31:06.171 --> 02:31:08.240
your access card doesn't work anymore.

2384
02:31:08.260 --> 02:31:12.390
It's just like game over and you just drive out.
And you know,

2385
02:31:12.391 --> 02:31:17.000
especially for guys like you and me and you know,
you even 10,

2386
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:20.100
I mean I was in for 20 years.
You were in for 30,
but

2387
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:24.390
<v 4>I mean,
how many memories do you have at the seal team?</v>

2388
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:28.890
One grinder at the seal team,
three grinder at the trade,
at building.

2389
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:33.720
It's like my whole life is right there.

2390
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:37.410
And you,
you know,
when you're leaving you're just [inaudible].

2391
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:43.230
It's scary because all of those memories are there,
but man,

2392
02:31:43.231 --> 02:31:46.650
they're good memories.
And I know that if I pick up the phone guys will answer.

2393
02:31:47.220 --> 02:31:50.010
And uh,
yeah.
You know,

2394
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:52.780
when not when faculty died

2395
02:31:55.020 --> 02:31:59.430
last year and I was like the what I felt like

2396
02:32:00.990 --> 02:32:03.540
all that.
Yeah.
I just felt like all of that memory,

2397
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:08.490
all that memory that he had of us is gone like that he had of me and all my

2398
02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:11.360
little running mates that I used to run around with.
We were all team one guys.

2399
02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:12.990
We are all in like,

2400
02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:17.991
he had these images of Austin knew us when we were little kids and kept us out

2401
02:32:18.511 --> 02:32:21.140
of trouble and all that stuff.
And I'm thinking all of those things you eat,

2402
02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:24.390
which he had a perspective that only he could have.
I was like,
oh,

2403
02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:26.550
those are all gone.
And that was,

2404
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:31.380
that was a crappy feeling of just,
damn,

2405
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:35.100
why does that have to go?
And I never got him on the podcast either,

2406
02:32:35.250 --> 02:32:38.030
which is a freaking shame.
Yeah.
Um,

2407
02:32:38.730 --> 02:32:41.460
but the good thing is,
like you said,

2408
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:46.890
we're still all just kicking it.
Yeah.
I mean really it's like just this

2409
02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:51.120
naval special warfare in the organization or team.

2410
02:32:51.810 --> 02:32:56.810
We're just in that for that little time and then it's shaped us way more than we

2411
02:32:57.661 --> 02:32:58.261
shaped it.

2412
02:32:58.261 --> 02:33:02.100
We had our influence and it'll just keep on going and that's what that's like.

2413
02:33:02.101 --> 02:33:04.200
There's a piece of piece of onsets never,
ever,

2414
02:33:04.201 --> 02:33:09.201
ever going to die as long as this country's around or are there are guys doing

2415
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:12.390
frogman stuff?

2416
02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:16.110
There'll be a little piece that it gave us and we gave it.

2417
02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:20.250
They're moving forward.
Yup.
Yup.
That's good to go.

2418
02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:23.280
It's about as good as it gets about as good as it gets.

2419
02:33:25.410 --> 02:33:26.820
I think that's probably a good spot.

2420
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.880
<v 5>And</v>

2421
02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:34.120
<v 4>the,
we might both be retired Echo Charles,
but we're not done yet.</v>

2422
02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.560
In fact,
we're just getting warmed up.
Plenty of fighting.

2423
02:33:38.890 --> 02:33:43.120
I'll be it in a different way.
Sure.
That is left to do and we're going to do it.

2424
02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:45.540
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2425
02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:47.580
<v 4>You got any suggestions on how we can stay in the fight?</v>

2426
02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:50.880
Seeing the fight and on the path big time.
Yeah.
Okay.

2427
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:53.670
First thing you get to grate a little bit more direct

2428
02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:59.040
relationship to the expression.
Fight Jujitsu.

2429
02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:02.430
You're not doing it.
Do it for many benefits.

2430
02:34:02.431 --> 02:34:05.770
So we always talk about not going to go too deep into it.
I wanted to,

2431
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:06.960
cause I was thinking about it.

2432
02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:08.540
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2433
02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:08.711
<v 4>You know,</v>

2434
02:34:08.711 --> 02:34:12.230
some people don't call a Jujitsu match or did you get to training or what?

2435
02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:14.440
Some people do,
some people don't.

2436
02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:19.680
So this is what I kind of discovered or realized that if other types of fighters

2437
02:34:20.861 --> 02:34:25.120
or or martial arts practitioners,
they tend to not call Jujitsu will fight.

2438
02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:30.970
You know like,
oh no,
it's not a fight,
it's a match or it's whatever.

2439
02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:35.470
And then you have the totalitarian kind of attitude,
which is like,
hey,

2440
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:38.860
anything that you're struggling against another person or another force,

2441
02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:39.760
it's a fight.

2442
02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:43.690
Even for you going to the grocery store looking for a certain kind of,

2443
02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:47.710
it can be a spaghetti sauce
sometimes,

2444
02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:50.770
especially when I'm doing it for somebody else.

2445
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:53.550
It's another element in the last two,
the way I look at it.

2446
02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:58.030
If you and I roll yes and we go hard.
Yes.

2447
02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:01.750
Is that a fight?
That's a fight for that car?
Well,

2448
02:35:01.770 --> 02:35:03.940
you can't cause I look at it in that way.

2449
02:35:03.941 --> 02:35:07.430
Anything that I'm struggling against another person or force or in your case at

2450
02:35:07.431 --> 02:35:11.860
another person and force,
it's a fight.
So the,
you know,
with you,

2451
02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:14.260
that's essentially a good example.

2452
02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:19.660
Unless fighting all out war,
total war,
total war,

2453
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:24.070
a war.
It's good to exercise that fee and lives,

2454
02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:28.630
that whole book psychology for the fighting man.

2455
02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:29.740
It's just so good.

2456
02:35:29.770 --> 02:35:33.250
But just starting off with total war and when you start to view your life

2457
02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:37.630
through the aspect of just total war.
Yeah.
Oh,

2458
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:42.250
because they were,
now we're taking it to the next level.
This,
this workout.

2459
02:35:42.251 --> 02:35:46.030
I'm going to be total war.
Yeah.
This person that's trying to get somebody,

2460
02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.910
somebody hit me up on social media today,

2461
02:35:49.170 --> 02:35:53.620
said said he was getting emotionally blackmailed.
Okay.
He said,
what would you do?

2462
02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:55.900
And I was like,
I'm not getting emotionally black,
black male,

2463
02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:59.930
no factor stifle your emotion to say,

2464
02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:03.960
well you're not because well it's like you don't even have emotions,

2465
02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:07.930
so how can you blackmail you on prison?
So yeah,
I mean,
but makes sense.

2466
02:36:07.931 --> 02:36:12.910
So I don't know though,
because what emotions sometimes can be more,

2467
02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:16.450
you know,
more of a thing for certain people,
you know,

2468
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:21.570
a peanut kind of everything.
Yeah,
for sure.
Unless if you have no emotion,

2469
02:36:21.571 --> 02:36:24.760
so then you're gonna have real problems.
It's like me,

2470
02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:27.310
but you should learn to control your emotions.

2471
02:36:27.311 --> 02:36:31.720
And one thing that can help you learn to control your emotions is Jujitsu.

2472
02:36:31.810 --> 02:36:32.620
Jujitsu,

2473
02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:37.620
because it's an exercise in prepping for all out war in life.

2474
02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:41.980
Very good direct anyway.
It won't doing Jujitsu,
we need a gate and rash guards.

2475
02:36:42.100 --> 02:36:46.240
That's essentially the uniform uniforms for the shoe shit soup.

2476
02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:48.610
And you get that at the best ones anyway,

2477
02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:53.920
at origin or didn't mean.com.
That's where you get it.
It is in Farmington,
Maine,

2478
02:36:53.921 --> 02:36:58.390
all made in America,
which is not a small deal.

2479
02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:03.250
Not a small deal at all.
You can say,
oh,
whatever.
No,
it's,

2480
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:04.103
it's a big deal.

2481
02:37:04.390 --> 02:37:08.800
And what's awesome about speaking of America is going up to Farmington,

2482
02:37:08.801 --> 02:37:12.760
Maine and seen a factory with 40 people working in it.

2483
02:37:12.850 --> 02:37:15.410
Craftsman making stuff here.

2484
02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:16.753
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2485
02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:22.500
<v 4>Bringing back a town.
Right.
Bring it back in an industry.</v>

2486
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:27.690
That's what we're doing here.
Movement check starts other clothes,

2487
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:30.750
joggers,
athletic gear,

2488
02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:35.160
apparently genes from what I hear.
Yeah.
You don't know about those yet.

2489
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:38.460
American denim and then we've got supplements.
Yeah.

2490
02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:43.910
Jason Gardner talks to me about origin Jocko supplements coming at you live.

2491
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:49.670
<v 2>Yeah,
I am on the,
uh,
joint warfare in the morning,
two at night.</v>

2492
02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.760
Krill oil every morning.
And uh,
I am on the milk train.

2493
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:58.180
I am on the mold train.
You know,
when I get,

2494
02:37:58.190 --> 02:38:03.050
when I want to have some dessert and I'm like,
Eh,
you know what,
all almond milk.

2495
02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.250
And then a scoop of the uh,

2496
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:10.880
mint chip hit that with a stick blender.
It satiates me.

2497
02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:14.240
And then every morning my coffee,
I got a scoop of the Vanilla Malt.

2498
02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:15.770
<v 4>Actually,
now that you know that,</v>

2499
02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:20.710
you know the video you made with Tim Tim for where he's like probiotics.

2500
02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:23.010
Yeah,
it was Jason.
Jason was like,
you know,

2501
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:25.810
I wasn't sure if I was going to get that stuff,
but then I saw it had probiotics

2502
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:30.890
just ordered it
cause that's what you needed.

2503
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:34.600
Did you know that was you?

2504
02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:36.500
<v 2>Yeah,
I pretty much figured it out.
I'm like,
Hey,</v>

2505
02:38:36.501 --> 02:38:41.210
that guy is in his mustache when he gobbles.
Exactly.

2506
02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:45.650
I was on the site looking at mine.
I'm like,
man.
So first of all,

2507
02:38:45.651 --> 02:38:48.590
it said Kido complaint on there.
I'm like,
Oh,
good to go.

2508
02:38:48.591 --> 02:38:51.020
Because a lot of the protein stuff is loaded with sugars are,

2509
02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.750
and then I saw probiotics and I'm like,
okay,
I'm done.

2510
02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.190
<v 4>Here's the,
here's the,
here's the issue.</v>

2511
02:38:56.191 --> 02:38:59.880
It's either loaded with sugar or it tastes horrible.

2512
02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:03.150
Cause even you put whatever a sweetener,

2513
02:39:03.151 --> 02:39:06.510
artificial sweeteners tastes horrible except for one,
the one that we use,

2514
02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:10.560
which is not artificial.
It's actually from nature itself.

2515
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:14.130
Monk Fruit.
Yeah.
So yeah,

2516
02:39:14.131 --> 02:39:18.840
you can get all those from origin main.com and,

2517
02:39:18.841 --> 02:39:19.580
and I,

2518
02:39:19.580 --> 02:39:23.340
I also realize that you haven't tried the warrior kids strawberry milk yet,

2519
02:39:23.690 --> 02:39:27.380
and I'm going to get that to you.
You're going to get nuts,
bro.

2520
02:39:27.690 --> 02:39:32.370
It is ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.
So get some of that check.

2521
02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:36.630
It's true.
Also,
Jacqueline is a store,
as we all know by now,

2522
02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:38.160
it's called Jocko store.

2523
02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:42.240
So you go to [inaudible] dot com this is where you can get your shirts more rash

2524
02:39:42.241 --> 02:39:46.100
guards,
trucker hats,

2525
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:50.130
flex fit hats.
We're doing both.
Did we?

2526
02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:53.690
Do we know which one sells more?
They're even really,

2527
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:56.840
are you just making that day where even when I checked,
when did you check?

2528
02:39:56.960 --> 02:39:59.460
This is like such as damn what he's doing.

2529
02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:03.530
He just said that he did.
Eddie says

2530
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:09.800
kids brought a bit of riled matter.
You can't look at me and say it's equal.

2531
02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:14.430
That's so just don't lie to me,
Dude.
It doesn't work.
I'm like,
smell it.

2532
02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:16.430
How would this all,
I'll check it out.
We'll get back to you.

2533
02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.070
[inaudible] we're good now.
We're good now.
There's no factor.
I'm good.

2534
02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:20.790
Now here's the thing.

2535
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:23.490
They're not trying to look at me and tell me something that you don't know.

2536
02:40:24.820 --> 02:40:28.750
At the end of the day,
it doesn't even matter because look what if I'm like,
hey,

2537
02:40:28.751 --> 02:40:31.660
I like flex fit.
Oh,
but the trucker hat.

2538
02:40:33.370 --> 02:40:35.910
Semetic we're not talking about it.
I worry about being truthful.

2539
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:40.950
I want the hear what you want.
Tell me the truth.
That's what I'm saying.
Well,

2540
02:40:40.951 --> 02:40:44.430
I'll report back and calm about that.
Is that cool?
Anyway,
hoodies,
like I said,

2541
02:40:44.431 --> 02:40:46.530
women's stuff on there.
If you want to represent,

2542
02:40:48.430 --> 02:40:52.580
we are on the path.
That's where you can get the stuff to represent.

2543
02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:57.040
You also get some,
uh,

2544
02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:01.430

You can get it from commercial wherever.

2559
02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:58.460
Well who made that well?

Yeah.

2560

2562

that's something you're going to,

2563
02:42:07.191 --> 02:42:10.260
you're going to definitely want to see what Jason Gardener it looks like.
Does,

2564
02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:13.460
do you think Jason does?
And people please let me know.

2565
02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:16.910
Does Jason Gardner look how he sounds?

2566
02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:22.970
I think so.
Yeah.
I think so.
You think so?
Well the thing is I've,

2567
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:27.590
I you already saw,
I saw you and didn't hear you.
A lot of people in this room.

2568
02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:31.250
Yeah.
Pizza's going to be,
I think you probably,

2569
02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:35.160
I think you probably look how you sound,
I think.
I think,

2570
02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:39.180
but it's hard for me to make that judgment because I know you,
I,

2571
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:44.060
I kinda,
I got to find that picture.
I'll post a picture of you and me age,

2572
02:42:44.061 --> 02:42:46.870
whatever,
2019 yeah.
And,

2573
02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:52.040
and we want to go completely insane.
You guys went in at the same time?
No,

2574
02:42:52.041 --> 02:42:53.810
he went in a few years before,
years before.

2575
02:42:53.811 --> 02:42:58.220
And then we ran over and do each other overseas and just really hit it off.

2576
02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:04.530
Uh,
what else?
Psychological warfare.
Yes.

2577
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:10.110
What that is.
I used to go into this LDP,

2578
02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:13.120
he'd get mad every time that that probably is the one that broke me.

2579
02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:14.260
This is the one that I was like,
Bro,

2580
02:43:14.261 --> 02:43:17.830
we're not doing this whole support thing anymore.
We're done doing it.
We're done.

2581
02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:20.570
I'm not doing anymore.
I'm not going to listen to you.
It's not happening.

2582
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:23.950
But I was going to go Joe Rogan's downs to recorded afterwards by myself

2583
02:43:23.951 --> 02:43:27.040
somewhere.
Well,
you can just be cool.
Why yet?

2584
02:43:27.650 --> 02:43:29.210
The roof is going to be in the pudding.
Jason Garden again,

2585
02:43:29.211 --> 02:43:32.680
what psychological refers.
Oh actually,
you know what?

2586
02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:35.710
It's not because Jason Gardens in the game deep in the game.

2587
02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:40.080
So for him to know what psychological warfare is,

2588
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:43.150
isn't a big stress is not going to be very surprising.
Yes.
So for the,

2589
02:43:43.151 --> 02:43:45.430
for the people who don't know what it is,
this is what it is.

2590
02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:49.570
It's an album with tracks,
chocolate check.

2591
02:43:49.571 --> 02:43:51.130
The thing you got to remember about this,

2592
02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:56.220
this whole segment of us just sitting around and talking for the quote unquote

2593
02:43:57.911 --> 02:44:01.150
supports,
which at barely is right.
It's more just like

2594
02:44:02.650 --> 02:44:03.790
just a session of,

2595
02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:09.300
but it was because when we got done with some podcasts early on,

2596
02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:14.700
it was like being drug through like the emotional freaking hell yeah,

2597
02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:19.550
and you get done and you want to just go home.
Like do you want to just like,

2598
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:23.710
okay,
let's,
it's like my,
my youngest daughter,

2599
02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:29.430
she'll,
if she sees something scary or whatever or you know,

2600
02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:32.070
she'll say like,
can we watch something funny just,

2601
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:37.390
and so that's what this actually is,
is hey,

2602
02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:41.650
okay,
we're going to talk about people getting killed,
people getting blown up,

2603
02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:45.490
people getting butchered,
real people,
real people,
by the way.

2604
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.140
And when we get done with that,

2605
02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.170
we're going to lighten it up a little bit so we can carry on.

2606
02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:51.490
We're not going to forget about it,

2607
02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:56.320
but we're going to have a little bit of levity towards the end.

2608
02:44:56.410 --> 02:44:57.940
That's what this originally was.

2609
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.800
Somehow you ended up just saying the same thing over and over again with that

2610
02:45:01.810 --> 02:45:05.440
one to take about tacos.
Getting good at saying it.
You see what I'm saying?

2611
02:45:05.441 --> 02:45:08.740
So yeah.
So what I did was I did lose sight of some things,

2612
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:13.600
but we're back and you know,
I'm going to explain what psychologic warfare,

2613
02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:15.910
but people don't know.
It's an album with tracks.

2614
02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:19.960
Jacqueline tracks talking about how you can overcome certain moments of weakness

2615
02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:23.140
on the path.
Boom.
That's pretty concise.
Yeah.
Cool.

2616
02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:28.510
Next on it on it.com case on it.

2619

the rings boom.
That's the,

2620
02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:44.880
that's the original thing that you need to get right.

2621
02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:47.020
The first thing you need to get.
I didn't use to think that.

2622
02:45:47.021 --> 02:45:49.420
I used to think it was a pull up bar,
but I changed my mind.
Yeah.

2623
02:45:49.430 --> 02:45:54.190
Cause more versatility.
Yeah.
Cause rings or a pull up bar.
Rent guests.

2624
02:45:54.191 --> 02:45:55.024
They are and they're,

2625
02:45:55.090 --> 02:46:00.090
and they're also a dip bar and they're also a a ring pushup bar to thing.

2626
02:46:00.310 --> 02:46:04.270
Oh yeah.
Big Time.
It's a thing.
I got my earnings from on it anyway.

2639
02:46:51.650 --> 02:46:55.070

They loved it.

2641
02:46:59.061 --> 02:47:03.440
That book is awesome.
Thank you.
I have people that,
this is odd,

2642
02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:04.333
but I have people that,

2643
02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:10.660
I have people that say I get a got a tears in my eyes when I was reading the

2644
02:47:11.061 --> 02:47:14.930
letter to his son.
You know,
that can be kind of heavy.

2645
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:19.640
So when I made that original short video about it,
whatever.
Yeah,
I should,

2646
02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:23.810
I think I said this story,
I showed it to my brother and he's like,
he's like,
man,

2647
02:47:23.811 --> 02:47:25.800
I'm kind of like tearing up.
I don't know why.

2648
02:47:26.250 --> 02:47:30.200
Then we're watching the video and it's not like it's a super sad thing,

2649
02:47:30.201 --> 02:47:34.460
but it just,
it's like,
I guess it's like so like real,
you know,

2650
02:47:34.461 --> 02:47:37.340
like these are things you kind of got to deal with and they get to take on this

2651
02:47:37.341 --> 02:47:41.650
courage kind of thing and it's like,
I don't know.
It was weird.
Yeah.

2652
02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.030
So check out that,

2653
02:47:44.031 --> 02:47:49.031
check out the warrior kid books where way the warrior kid and Mikey or and

2654
02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:51.430
Mark's mission.
Somebody asked me,

2655
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:56.060
people sometimes ask questions that center around themselves.

2656
02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:58.550
They're asking you a question,
but somebody asked me a question.

2657
02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:01.940
It said two words.

2658
02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:07.600
What is the theme of way of the warrior kid go into words that that was the

2659
02:48:08.451 --> 02:48:09.210
question.
So,
so,

2660
02:48:09.210 --> 02:48:14.210
so now this person just wanted me to say like sum up this book in two words and

2661
02:48:15.981 --> 02:48:18.570
this was a mandate.
It wasn't like,
hey man,
could you kind of give you a fish?

2662
02:48:18.890 --> 02:48:23.720
It was like two words.
So I was like,
cool.
You know what I said?

2663
02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:25.880
It's really,
it's actually really easy.

2664
02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.200
What is the underlying theme of the way of the Warrior kid book series?

2665
02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:33.380
The underlying theme is this where your kid,

2666
02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:40.100
there you go.
It's like you want your kids to be warriors.
What does that mean?

2667
02:48:40.101 --> 02:48:43.790
Does that mean you want them to join the military and and go fight?
No.
I mean,

2668
02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:48.650
do you want to be warriors whole thing,
which actually gets explained in there,

2669
02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:52.730
man,
that's the warrior kid books,

2670
02:48:53.810 --> 02:48:56.280
discipline equals freedom field manual.
You,

2671
02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:59.120
I've signed a lot of those for your people.
Yeah.

2672
02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.740
I bought like 10 of them and had you sign them to a bunch of guys and send them

2673
02:49:03.741 --> 02:49:08.520
out.
They love him and help people out.
Yeah.
I've had guys

2674
02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:12.510
<v 0>in the last year lose somebody,</v>

2675
02:49:12.570 --> 02:49:15.720
like have someone in a family or friend die and then I'm like,
okay,

2676
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:19.260
go look at this page,
you know?
Yup.
Where are you?

2677
02:49:19.350 --> 02:49:21.070
Describe how to deal with it.
Yeah.

2678
02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.750
I actually had to use that page myself and

2679
02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:29.700
hopefully you don't have to use that page,

2680
02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:34.980
but there's other things that go on in your life that can steer you off the path

2681
02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:39.000
and there's other pages of that book that will keep you on the path.

2682
02:49:39.001 --> 02:49:41.760
This because freedom field,
manual,
extreme ownership,

2683
02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:44.551
everything.

2684
02:49:44.551 --> 02:49:49.170
Jason was talking about what we did at Trey debt.

2685
02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:52.890
Everything that we tried to teach to the seals that were going to go overseas.

2686
02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:56.910
It's in the book extreme ownership.
It's in the book.
The dichotomy of leadership.

2687
02:49:57.300 --> 02:50:00.900
They're both in.
There you are.
Show me your notes the other day,
Jason,
from,

2688
02:50:02.190 --> 02:50:06.630
from when I in briefed your troop,
it's like,

2689
02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:10.680
oh,
here's your notes.
You gave him me little picture.
What did they say?

2690
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:14.370
They say covering move,
simple,
prioritize and execute and decentralized command.

2691
02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.140
That was why,
I dunno,
12 years ago or something like that.

2692
02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:24.120
10 years ago,
same words coming out to see him.
Word hasn't changed.

2693
02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.140
Learn those
extreme ownership and the dichotomy.

2694
02:50:29.141 --> 02:50:30.550
Leadership national on front,

2695
02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:36.480
that is our leadership consultancy where we solve problems through leadership

2696
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:40.570
and every organization has problems,
all kinds of problems,

2697
02:50:41.290 --> 02:50:46.290
all kinds of problems and every single one of those problems is a leadership

2698
02:50:47.231 --> 02:50:50.410
problem.
That's what's going to fix it is fixing the leadership.

2699
02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:54.650
That's what we do.
It's me.
It's late,
Bab and JP to know Dave Burke,

2700
02:50:54.651 --> 02:50:57.230
Flynn Cochran,
Mike Cirelli,
Mike by Emma

2701
02:50:57.730 --> 02:50:58.563
<v 1>and</v>

2702
02:51:00.770 --> 02:51:03.260
<v 0>does this make you a new guy?
You're a new guy.</v>

2703
02:51:03.270 --> 02:51:07.550
That's why frog bro and our latest member,

2704
02:51:07.551 --> 02:51:10.700
I won't call them a new guy because it really does matter.

2705
02:51:10.701 --> 02:51:14.180
You went to bud's before me,
right?
So that's like a real thing.

2706
02:51:14.181 --> 02:51:16.370
Like I'm a new guy.
Yeah.
Apparently

2707
02:51:19.170 --> 02:51:23.150
not ever say.
Yeah.
Anyways,
our latest,
um,

2708
02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:29.380
Jason Gardner who you've just listened to for five hours is also on the team and

2709
02:51:29.931 --> 02:51:34.400

organization,

<v 1>okay.</v>

2712
02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:39.820
<v 0>Also we have to muster</v>

2713
02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:45.920
the monster is a leadership conference gathering magical,

2714
02:51:45.980 --> 02:51:50.030
magical.
It actually actually it's just muster and it is a monster.

2715
02:51:50.060 --> 02:51:51.800
That's what it is,
right?
We're all gonna get together.

2716
02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:53.030
We'll talk about leadership,

2717
02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:58.130
get granular and delve into leadership from a lot of different angles.

2718
02:51:59.330 --> 02:52:02.930
May 23rd and 24th in Chicago,
September 19th and 20th and Denver,

2719
02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:06.970
December 4th and fifth and Sydney extreme ownership.com.

2720
02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:10.890
I haven't posted about this yet.
Just the muster in,

2721
02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:14.860
I haven't posted at all when I post.

2722
02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.380
It's a lot of stuff.
It's cells,
so if you want to go,

2723
02:52:20.390 --> 02:52:23.780
awesome.
Same is if you want to go register now,

2724
02:52:23.781 --> 02:52:28.781
Code Echelon front.com actually go to extreme ownership.com and that's where you

2725
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:34.000
can register to come to the muster in one of those locations.

2726
02:52:34.030 --> 02:52:38.550
We will see you there.
Eif,
online,
online,
interactive leadership training,

2727
02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:42.550
starting to see the cool feedback from people on that.

2728
02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:45.580
So e f online.

2729
02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:50.820
It is [inaudible] dot com we have leadership training courses online,

2730
02:52:52.960 --> 02:52:55.750
interactive.
What else?

2731
02:52:55.751 --> 02:52:59.260
What other verbs or adjectives to describe interactive,

2732
02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:03.820
<v 4>engaging in very engaging,
what name your adventure.</v>

2733
02:53:04.090 --> 02:53:07.210
Choose your own adventure,
choose your own adventure kind of scenarios.

2734
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:12.550
<v 0>The unfold and we're updating it and adding different content to it monthly.</v>

2735
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:19.990
So it's going to continue to grow and educate both you and us as we all learn to

2736
02:53:21.771 --> 02:53:24.770
become better leaders if you want.
In on that,

2737
02:53:26.010 --> 02:53:31.010
<v 4>I went through that obviously to make the video and coincidentally few like a</v>

2738
02:53:31.831 --> 02:53:36.690
month,
maybe month and a half before I went through an online training for CPR.

2739
02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:38.970
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.</v>

2740
02:53:39.550 --> 02:53:43.540
<v 4>So the online training for CPR,
well,
CPR,
you got to do the physical thing too,</v>

2741
02:53:43.541 --> 02:53:44.920
you know,
for the certification,
whatever.

2742
02:53:44.921 --> 02:53:48.850
But there's an online training part of it,
so you know,
and not too bad,

2743
02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:52.690
not too bad.
The online thing,
you know,
I really went through it,

2744
02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:55.470
kind of committed myself to it,
not as long or whatever,
but you know,
kind of,

2745
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:58.030
I went through,
I was like,
cool,
good.

2746
02:53:58.630 --> 02:54:01.510
But there were tangible things that have been,
you know,

2747
02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:04.720
you could've done this a little bit more different to actual actually get the

2748
02:54:04.721 --> 02:54:09.040
training,
quote unquote training that someone might need,
whatever.

2749
02:54:09.610 --> 02:54:12.070
So,
you know,
a few months later I do

2750
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:17.120
go through the eff online and I'm thinking to myself,

2751
02:54:17.121 --> 02:54:18.430
when I think back on those CPR,

2752
02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:22.810
this is what they should of did with the CPR thing.
Granted the CPR,

2753
02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:25.550
he could tell us a lot older.
It wasn't quite as contemporary.

2754
02:54:25.551 --> 02:54:29.600
So I'm not really blaming them,
but that's the way I really saw it.
I was like,

2755
02:54:29.601 --> 02:54:32.720
okay,
this is good.
This will give you like the training training,
you know,
it'll,

2756
02:54:32.850 --> 02:54:34.610
it'll allow you to make mistakes.

2757
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:37.850
On an online training or do the wrong thing and then get corrected as a,

2758
02:54:37.851 --> 02:54:42.140
hey you did this,
you know kind of,
well that's one of the things that worried me.

2759
02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:46.010
But cause you remember the navy like navy course,

2760
02:54:46.011 --> 02:54:49.970
you take on something that was online and it will be horrible and boring and

2761
02:54:49.971 --> 02:54:52.700
everyone just copy each other and just click through the things to get it done

2762
02:54:52.701 --> 02:54:57.170
when you don't take anything away from it.
That was my fear or how does this,

2763
02:54:57.260 --> 02:54:59.030
if we,
if we don't do this right,

2764
02:54:59.031 --> 02:55:01.640
but then as soon as I started looking at the technology and the things you could

2765
02:55:01.641 --> 02:55:03.920
do and the way you could make engaging,
it's,

2766
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:06.680
<v 0>it's,
I don't want to say it's better,</v>

2767
02:55:06.681 --> 02:55:11.300
but if you're sitting in or if you're sitting at the muster and I say something

2768
02:55:11.660 --> 02:55:13.100
and you're like,
wow,

2769
02:55:13.101 --> 02:55:16.820
when you go to write that down and then you hear me say this tail end of

2770
02:55:16.821 --> 02:55:20.750
something else and you missed it,
you can't press rewind,

2771
02:55:21.310 --> 02:55:24.950
rewatch it.
You can't press pause and be like,
that was a really good point.

2772
02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:29.450
I know how I can apply that to my world and just write down how to handle

2773
02:55:29.451 --> 02:55:33.830
something.
You can't do that at the muster on online.

2774
02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:36.440
Oh,
let me rewatch that.
Oh,
oh,

2775
02:55:36.441 --> 02:55:40.310
Jocko and Leif just did a role play on dealing with uh,
uh,

2776
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:45.020
someone in the office.
I actually need to deal with a person like that.

2777
02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:46.820
How should I,

2778
02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:49.550
how should I tell him to watch that again and to see those little maneuvers take

2779
02:55:49.551 --> 02:55:50.384
place.

2780
02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:54.380
So that's what we did and we realized that we just don't have the reach for the

2781
02:55:54.381 --> 02:55:56.360
demand that's out there for echelon front.

2782
02:55:56.430 --> 02:55:59.060
We appreciate the demand and we want to satisfy the demand.

2783
02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:04.120
So that is f online.com if you want to get fully engaged in our leadership

2784
02:56:07.251 --> 02:56:10.250
training,
that's it.
And of course we have EIF,
Overwatch,

2785
02:56:11.050 --> 02:56:16.050
where we're taking all these experienced leaders that have been in combat for

2786
02:56:16.970 --> 02:56:19.250
the last couple decades.

2787
02:56:19.970 --> 02:56:22.190
And as they move into the civilian sector,

2788
02:56:22.610 --> 02:56:27.610
placing them into jobs where they can help lead organizations using the

2789
02:56:28.521 --> 02:56:32.120
experience they have and their understanding of the principles that we talk

2790
02:56:32.121 --> 02:56:37.121
about@echelonfrontinthebookextremeownershipandonthispodcastgotoefoverwatch.com

2791
02:56:38.930 --> 02:56:43.700
where they're standing by waiting for you.
By the way,
Andy,

2792
02:56:43.701 --> 02:56:44.570
if you

2793
02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:51.400
got done or get done listening to this three hours of conversation and you want

2794
02:56:53.571 --> 02:56:58.130
to continue it further,
it's it wasn't enough and you're not sure what to do,

2795
02:56:58.340 --> 02:57:03.020
well then that's cool because you can actually get in touch with us and have a

2796
02:57:03.021 --> 02:57:06.620
little calmer,
a little mini micro conversations with us

2797
02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:11.870
on the interwebs,
on Twitter,
on Instagram and on that shaft.

2798
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:15.800
Half-Asian we'll keep,
we'll half echoes adequate.
Charles,

2799
02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:19.880
I am at at Jocko Willink and Jason has multiple handles.

2800
02:57:19.881 --> 02:57:24.881
Go Jason and Gardner on Twitter,

2801
02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:30.200
Jason.
Dot.
N.
Dot.
Gardner on Instagram and Jason and Gardner on Facebook.

2802
02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:32.150
You're going to have fun with Twitter.

2803
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:37.750
I'm just going to let you know because Twitter is the place for somebody with

2804
02:57:37.761 --> 02:57:42.761
little one liners to hang out and participate and throw one lighters out into

2805
02:57:44.871 --> 02:57:49.871
the world and make people laugh or make people think and it's just,

2806
02:57:50.331 --> 02:57:53.660
it's,
it's pretty fun.
It's member.

2807
02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:57.470
You ever feel like the Terminator robot,

2808
02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:00.740
you don't feel like that?
No,
I do.

2809
02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:05.370
And one of the ways that I feel that is when I'm having a conversation with

2810
02:58:05.371 --> 02:58:10.371
someone and I see little one liners of what I can say and sometimes,

2811
02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:16.710
I mean if I'm answering questions for a client,
I'll be like,
okay,
here's like,

2812
02:58:16.711 --> 02:58:17.640
as soon as they're asking me,

2813
02:58:17.641 --> 02:58:22.350
I'm seeing little possible answers of how they fit in their world and does it

2814
02:58:22.351 --> 02:58:23.040
make sense to them.

2815
02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:26.730
And I've got all this and then I just kind of choose one to go and when I'm

2816
02:58:26.731 --> 02:58:31.470
having,
but I remember that in like when I was a school child,

2817
02:58:32.010 --> 02:58:33.450
I was a little kid going to school,

2818
02:58:33.630 --> 02:58:37.710
especially like around what grade is fifth,

2819
02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.810
sixth and seventh grade.
How old are you?

2820
02:58:41.130 --> 02:58:46.030
Not Fourth is 11 like 11 1213 right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2821
02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:46.873
Saturday.

2822
02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:51.980
It was like every single comment or statement that it's school teacher made was

2823
02:58:55.441 --> 02:58:59.640
just a prime setup to knock it out of the park with a one liner from the back

2824
02:58:59.641 --> 02:59:04.570
row.
You know what I'm saying?
I would just be sitting there going,
oh Aye.

2825
02:59:04.610 --> 02:59:08.250
I,
I,
I would want,
I would be so Tim and I have to bite my tongue all day long,

2826
02:59:08.251 --> 02:59:10.950
as much as I could.
Because when you're 12 years old,

2827
02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:16.080
you can only hold it in for so long.
It'd be four.
It just comes out and then,

2828
02:59:16.260 --> 02:59:16.890
so anyways,

2829
02:59:16.890 --> 02:59:20.070
you're going to like Twitter because you can use your little one liners,

2830
02:59:20.071 --> 02:59:24.420
which you are very,
very good at and they're always,
like I said,

2831
02:59:24.421 --> 02:59:29.421
they're always very educational or humorous or they at least make you think so

2832
02:59:29.670 --> 02:59:34.670
you'll have fun with that and don't feed the trolls and don't feed the Russian

2833
02:59:35.131 --> 02:59:39.510
bots.
No,
that's my new thing.
Be careful.
Don't click on anything.

2834
02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:44.550
Don't click on anything.
Check.
All right.
Echo,
anything else?
No.
Awesome.

2835
02:59:45.210 --> 02:59:46.043
Jason?

2836
02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:48.080
<v 2>Yeah,
I'd like to thank my parents,</v>

2837
02:59:48.081 --> 02:59:51.320
Jim and cookie Gardner for all your unconditional love and support.

2838
02:59:51.321 --> 02:59:55.940
Over the years.
My sister Ari,
who's a blue belt into Jujitsu.

2839
02:59:56.760 --> 03:00:00.740
How'd you did?
You did sir.
What,
how'd you get into the podcast?

2840
03:00:01.340 --> 03:00:02.900
Listen to the podcast immediately.

2841
03:00:02.901 --> 03:00:06.140
Found a Jujitsu place up there and San Clemente and started training.

2842
03:00:06.470 --> 03:00:07.350
And then um,

2843
03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:11.180
my brother thought he as soon as a tattoo artist tattoos up in San Clemente at

2844
03:00:11.181 --> 03:00:13.130
San Clemente Tattoo.
If you're going to get some ink,

2845
03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:18.160
go see him if you're local and thanks to everybody else and thanks to all the

2846
03:00:19.191 --> 03:00:23.600
frog men out there past,
present and future.
Get some

2847
03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:26.273
<v 0>hell yeah.</v>

2848
03:00:26.670 --> 03:00:31.670
And we always think everyone in uniform that protects us at home and abroad from

2849
03:00:33.661 --> 03:00:35.940
the evil that we talked about today.

2850
03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:42.390
And that includes obviously our military personnel,
police and law enforcement,

2851
03:00:42.391 --> 03:00:47.040
firefighters,
paramedics,
EMT is correctional officer's border patrol,

2852
03:00:47.041 --> 03:00:48.690
all the first responders.

2853
03:00:49.770 --> 03:00:54.180
And also thanks to all of those that did serve

2854
03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:00.800
and that have done their part as veterans for our great nation.

2855
03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:05.950
Like my brother here,
master chief Jason Gardner.

2856
03:01:06.850 --> 03:01:07.900
Thanks for your service.

2857
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:11.860
Thanks for coming on.

2858
03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:17.520
And of course I'm looking forward to another bunch of good years together.

2859
03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:20.970
Thanks for everything Bra.

2860
03:01:22.330 --> 03:01:24.910
And to everyone else that's listening.

2861
03:01:26.130 --> 03:01:26.720
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2862
03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:28.640
<v 0>I'll go back to Beowulf.</v>

2863
03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:36.680
For every one of us living in this world means waiting for an end.

2864
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:44.010
Let whoever can win glory before death.

2865
03:01:46.110 --> 03:01:49.830
So endurer your troubles today.

2866
03:01:50.130 --> 03:01:54.120
Bear up and be the man I expect you to be.

2867
03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:01.730
That's how our ancestors lived,
and that's how they died.

2868
03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:06.410
So let us do the same.
Arise,
set forth,

2869
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:08.340
<v 1>okay.</v>

2870
03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:09.173
<v 0>And get after it.</v>

2871
03:02:10.450 --> 03:02:11.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2872
03:02:11.010 --> 03:02:12.120
<v 0>And until next time,</v>

2873
03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:17.600
this is Jason Gardner and Deco and Jocko out.
