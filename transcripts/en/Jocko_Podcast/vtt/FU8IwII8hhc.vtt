This is Jocko podcast number one 55 with me,
Jocko Willink

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
on the island.
The dead were piling up.

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.320
<v 0>In the mission report,</v>

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.740
the head of the convoy wrote at 2:00 PM on May 20th I went to the island of

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.840
[inaudible] know with command dirt taps scoff.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.540
There was a terrible scramble.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.770
People crowding and fighting around the bags of flour,

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.140
dead bodies everywhere.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.680
A hundred or more and Matsu people crawling about and crying give us bread boss.

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.730
It's been two days since we've been given anything to eat.

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890
They're trying to make us die of hunger and the cold.

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.200
They told us that people had begun eating the dead bodies,

14
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.520
that they were cooking human flesh.

15
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
The scene on the island was dreadful.
Appalling.

16
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.240
On May 21st alone,

17
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.720
the three health officer's counted 70 additional dead bodies in five cases.

18
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.530
They emphasized the liver,
the heart,

19
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.160
the lungs and fleshy part of bodies.

20
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.340
<v 0>Had been caught off.</v>

22
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.310
<v 0>On one of the bodies,
the head had been torn off along the,</v>

24
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.930
along with the male genital organs and part of the skin.

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.660
These mutilations constitutes strong evidence of cannibalistic acts.

26
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.643
In addition,

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.170
they suggest the existence of serious psychopathology.

28
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:58.370
He's on the same day.

29
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:03.371
May 21st the deportees themselves brought us three individuals who had been

30
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:09.161
caught with blood on their hands and holding human livers.

31
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.320
Our examination of these three individuals did not reveal any extreme and

32
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.230
maceration

33
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.100
and there an elderly,

34
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.820
local peasant woman who reported the things we saw.

35
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.900
People were dying everywhere.
They were killing each other.

36
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.070
There was a guard name Kostia the Nico off a young fellow.

37
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.010
He was courting a pretty girl who had been sent there.
He protected her.

38
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.960
<v 0>One day he had to be away for a while.</v>

40
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.810
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.300
<v 0>and he told one of his comrades.
Take care of her.</v>

42
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.763
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 0>but with all the people,</v>

44
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.160
<v 1>the comrade couldn't do much.</v>

45
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.710
<v 0>People caught the girl,
tied her to a tree,
cut off her breasts,</v>

46
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.440
her muscles,
everything they could eat.

47
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.000
They were hungry.
They had to eat.
When costs do you came back.

48
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.830
She was still alive.
He tried to save her,

49
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.620
but she had lost too much blood.
She died.

50
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.670
That was the kind of thing that happened
when you went along the island.

51
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.190
You saw flesh wrapped in rags.

52
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.320
<v 0>Human flesh that had been cut</v>

54
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.320
and hung in the trees.

55
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.140
<v 0>And that right there is from a book called Cannibal Island by Nicholas worth,</v>

57
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.020
who's written books about communism.

58
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:12.021
I think his most famous as the black book of communism and Cannibal Island

59
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:17.571
specifically breaks down one of the small individual nightmares of the Soviet

60
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:20.484
gulags.

61
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.830
But the nightmare was not small and it certainly was not specific.

62
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.710
It was widespread and it was broad

63
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.250
and it was almost incomprehensible

64
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.170
and very little about it would be known or not.
For one man,

65
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.310
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,

66
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.060
who not only survived the gulags but lived on to write incredibly detailed and

67
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.010
very well researched books about the gulags.
Some of them were fictionalized

68
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.670
like a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich and for the,

69
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.810
for the good of the cause,

70
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:12.890
but most comprehensively and his three volume tome,

71
00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:17.630
the Gulag archipelago.
And this series is,

72
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.870
is a massive series and it's been cut down to an abridged version that was

73
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:25.970
actually approved by the author himself.

74
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.520
And the abridged version has just been rereleased in Europe with a forward by a

75
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:34.580
man that I think repopulate,
buys that book,

76
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.370
a man that is here today to discuss that book.
And among other things,

77
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:45.371
I'm sure a man that I needed to give an introduction to the first time he was on

78
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:50.300
this podcast,
but now who needs no introduction whatsoever,

79
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.800
a man by the name of Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson.

80
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.480
Jordan,
thank you for coming back on.

81
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.010
<v 2>How's it rough beginning Jocko.
Jesus.</v>

82
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.610
<v 0>Uh,
yeah,</v>

83
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.300
I remember when I started listening to you,

84
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.490
you would say something along the lines of that,
you know,

85
00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:19.491
we are quite capable of creating hell for ourselves as human beings and that

86
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.460
clearly that situation.
I don't know.
I mean that's,
that's,
that's hell yeah.

87
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.590
And close enough.
Yeah.
And it's,
it's,

88
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.700
it's created by us.
It's created by us,
which I think is,
um,

89
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.090
obviously horrific and the Gulag archipelago,
um,
you know,
you,

90
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.860
you talked about that book a lot and,

91
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:48.861
and one of the things that in that book hits you hard obviously for me,

92
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.710
uh,
uh,
there's a book called about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

93
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.420
I'm from a different world I guess.
Then you,
in many ways,

94
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.450
the book that hit me hardest in my life was,

95
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.910
was that book about face and it's,

96
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.180
it's one of those things that when I read it,
I started putting it together.

97
00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:11.530
It's like things started to fit and

98
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.530
I remember that and I was wondering,
I guess from my perspective,

99
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.590
at what point did you read the Gulag archipelago and at what point did you start

100
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:29.350
to say,
okay,
there's something really,

101
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.710
really important here for me to try and understand?

102
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.430
<v 2>Well,
I read it back in the 1980s,
early,</v>

103
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.020
I would say I'd read some Solzhenitsyn before that.

104
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.100
I read the light of day,

105
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.170
day of a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich when I was about 13 or 14.

106
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.700
And then I read the Gulag archipelago in my early twenties,
uh,

107
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.580
when I was reading a lot of psychological material too when I started reading

108
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:02.300
young and Freud and the great clinicians and uh,

109
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.630
or he's reading a fair bit about what had happened in Nazi Germany at the same

110
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.320
time.
And also Viktor Frankl's man's search for meaning.

111
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.680
And Solzhenitsyn's book is in some ways like an elaborated extension of Frankel

112
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.220
Frankel of course described what happened to him in the Nazi concentration
camps.

113
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.590
And it's a relatively short book and it's a great book.

114
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.240
But soldier Nixon's book is,
it's,
it's much broader and,

115
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.280
and I would say deeper.

116
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.790
And the thing that affected me most particularly was the psychological take on

117
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.990
the,
on the totalitarian states.
You know,

118
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.020
I had been studying political science up to that point and the political science

119
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.830
scientists and the economists who I would say we're under the sway of Marxists

120
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:55.710
thinking,
although not nearly to the degree that they are now,

121
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.490
we're convinced that the reason that people engaged in conflict was basically a

122
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.000
consequence of argumentation over resources,
you know,

123
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:07.980
is basically an economic argument.
And I never bought that.

124
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.960
It never made sense to me.
I mean,

125
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.000
obviously there are circumstances where that's true,

126
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.280
but it didn't seem to be fundamentally the case.

127
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:17.820
Like tribal warfare isn't precisely about resources.

128
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.820
It's maybe it's about territory or maybe it's about identity.

129
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:25.650
But it never seemed to me to be simply about resources.
Um,

130
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.240
partly because,
well a resource is something that people value,

131
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.690
but it isn't obvious why people value what they value.

132
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:36.300
And so it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.
Anyways.

133
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.760
When I was reading Frankel and Solzhenitsyn,

134
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.390
I started to more deeply understand the relationship between the individual and

135
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:46.110
the atrocity.

136
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.720
And that's what I found most interesting was that Frankel's claim and

137
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.250
Solzhenitsyn's claim as well,

138
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.580
that it was the moral corruption of the citizenry that allowed the totalitarian

139
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.790
catastrophes to occur.

140
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.530
And that that in some sense was the responsibility of every individual in the

141
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.760
system who looked the other way or who participated actively.
I mean,

142
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.370
even in the gulag camps themselves,

143
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.040
they were almost all run by the prisoners.

144
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.840
There wasn't enough administrative manpower to run the prison system without the

145
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:25.890
cooperation,
so to speak,
of the prisoners.
So it is,

146
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.920
it is a surreal sort of hell where you imprison yourself and Solzhenitsyn's

147
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:34.830
fundamental claim.
And this was true for Franklin as well,

148
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:39.720
and also for Vaclav Havel who eventually became president of Czechoslovakia,

149
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.220
or at least of the Czech Republic,
I don't remember which,
you know,

150
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.230
they believe that it was the individual proclivity to accept lies that fostered

151
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:54.570
the ability of tyrants to destroy the state.
And then,

152
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.031
well,

153
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:01.800
and that also led to complicitness with regards to all the absolute atrocities

154
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.760
that were occurring in both the Nazi state,
in the and in the Soviet state.

155
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:07.950
And I think that's true when I read,

156
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.210
like I read soldier knits and spokes in a lot of the books I read about Nazi

157
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:16.170
Germany to not as a victim and not as a hero,

158
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:19.380
but as a perpetrator,
you know,
which I think it's really important.

159
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.820
It's something that's really important to do when you read history is that it's

160
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:25.920
easy to cast yourself as a victim.

161
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.790
It's easy to cast yourself as the person who would have been heroic in the

162
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:30.630
circumstance,

163
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.340
but it's also unbelievably useful to understand that there's a good chance.

164
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:39.630
Had you been in those situations that you wouldn't have been on the side of the

165
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:44.040
good guys and no,
and that's a terrible,
it's really a terrible realization,

166
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.270
but it's,
it's necessary realization.

167
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.010
Again,
just going back to this idea of what you get of reading,
because people

168
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 0>ask me now because I read books all the time on my podcast and what you just</v>

169
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:01.630
said,
it struck me as something that's,

170
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.140
people have told me,
I read that book before,
but I didn't really get out of it.

171
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.790
What you got out of it and when I heard you read it [inaudible] I was saying,

172
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.160
wow,
how did I need to go reread this book?

173
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.960
And I think one of the key things is you looked at these books as you were not

174
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:23.140
the victim,
but the perpetrator.
One thing that when I read books,

175
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.700
I know I read a lot of books,
mostly about war for me,

176
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.820
I always think about the,
the peep.

177
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.660
I don't know what we see myself as the person that goes and heroically storms

178
00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:40.180
the beaches and survives every,
you know,

179
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:43.060
in a war book,
there's these people that get mentioned for it,

180
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:45.940
for up for a half a paragraph,
for,
for two sentences.

181
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.600
And that sometimes they don't even have a name because you know,

182
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.880
you're the battalion commander is storming the beach at Normandy.
You don't,

183
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.330
you're not going to name every single person,
but for some reason,

184
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.140
and maybe it's just my experiences of being in combat,

185
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.980
when I read about that two sentences of that guy,

186
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.760
that that gets shot,
that gets killed,
that gets blown up.

187
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.860
I completely understand and relate to that person.
Like I,

188
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.950
I don't just see it as me being the guy that is always winning and always doing

189
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:18.070
okay and always surviving.

190
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.530
I feel and relate to those guys that didn't.

191
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.700
And part of that is just because of my friends that I lost in combat.

192
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.300
Like those guys,
they're their people.

193
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.260
And I think that key thing of,
of reading it and going,
man,

194
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:37.820
every single person,
like when you read about these group,

195
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.400
you're talking about millions of people that were tortured,
died,
murdered.

196
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.540
Every one of those people,
the keyword is people.

197
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:48.880
Every one of those people is a person.

198
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.090
And to your point,

199
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.780
every single one of those executioners,

200
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.280
every single one of those murderers is also a personal,

201
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.730
there's a great book called ordinary men.
Oh yeah,
we,

202
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:07.660
we reviewed that on this podcast.
Right,
right.
And so,
you know,
it's,
it's,

203
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.500
it's one of the greatest books written about what happened in the Second World

204
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:13.870
War,
I think on the end of,

205
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.140
on the atrocity and [inaudible] because the author does such a lovely job of,

206
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.700
while it's a strange way of putting it in this context,
but you know,

207
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.400
it's about this police battalion that was moved into Poland after the Germans

208
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:28.120
went through and,

209
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.440
and occupied the country and they were there to establish order like police do,

210
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:36.610
but also to participate in the mopping up,
let's say.
Uh,

211
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.930
that was part and parcel of the war.
And you know,
these were ordinary policemen,

212
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.330
um,
middleclass guys,

213
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.540
most of whom had been educated and socialized before the Nazi propaganda machine

214
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.220
really got rolling.
So they weren't like Hitler youth.
Um,

215
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.630
<v 2>they were ordinary men and they were brought and they had a commander who had</v>

216
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:05.141
made an explicit case that if they weren't able to tolerate the conditions in

217
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:08.060
Poland that they could go home.

218
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.710
So there was no top down order that you had to do this or else.

219
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.440
And then they were,
you know,

220
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:18.740
first of all they started rounding up while mostly Jewish people,

221
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.200
men between 18 and 65 and then,
you know,

222
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:25.370
they started to participate in the entire atrocious mess and they were,

223
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.090
they ended up many of them taking naked pregnant women out into fields and

224
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:30.470
shooting them in the back of the head.

225
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:35.471
And what the author does is outline how that happens to you,

226
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.970
you know,
one step at a time.

227
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.740
And so it's a really horrifying book and it's a brilliant book because there's

228
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:47.741
no attempt to make the perpetrators like some creatures that aren't human,

229
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.390
like just pure psychopaths.

230
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:55.390
And of course in an situation like Nazi Germany and and in the horrors of the

231
00:15:56.241 --> 00:16:00.260
communist states,
there was no shortage of places for psychopaths to prevail.

232
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.440
But that's not really the issue.
The issue is,
well,

233
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.680
how does an ordinary person come to participate in a global horror,

234
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.230
let's say?
And what does that mean about being an ordinary person?

235
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.820
And then the next question is,
well,

236
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:17.000
what does it mean about how you should conduct your life?

237
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:19.250
And one of the things that,
I mean,

238
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:24.251
I think what happened to me when I read all this material in the 80s was that I

239
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:30.350
became convinced that there wasn't anything more important to do in the

240
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.900
aftermath of what had happened in the 20th century.

241
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.290
Then to try to build people who were responsible enough as truth telling

242
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:39.771
courageous,

243
00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:44.771
responsible citizens so that the probability would increase,

244
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:47.990
that if they were in a position to make a terrible choice,

245
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:49.580
that they would make the right one.

246
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.730
And I would say this lecture tour that I'm doing,

247
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.630
which is now extended over more than a hundred cities,

248
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.300
is an extension of the same thing.
Well,

249
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:01.760
I think it's the same thing that you're trying to do with your book.

250
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:04.760
Like we were just looking at your Mickey and the dragons book,
right?

251
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:09.140
And you're trying to lay out,
um,
uh,
uh,

252
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:14.141
psychological pathway that guides people towards responsibility and courage and

253
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.570
truth and all of that.
And that is the bull bark against tyranny.

254
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:20.750
And it's actually the,
it's actually at the individual level.

255
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.930
And we kind of know that,
like,
we,
we know that in the west,

256
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:27.710
I think that's part of the core ethos of,
well,
certainly that of,

257
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.540
of the English common law system,

258
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:34.541
certainly of the American way of looking at the world is that each citizen is

259
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:39.620
the bulwark against tyranny.
And that's actually true.
It's,
and,

260
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.370
and that's a terrible thing to,

261
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.430
to think through because it means that you are responsible for the integrity or

262
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:51.820
lack thereof of your state.
And it's,
it's on you,
you know,
and,

263
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:55.740
and there's something great about that because it means that your existence

264
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.250
actually matters to you and to your family.
And,

265
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.670
and to the broader community in a really major way,

266
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:07.470
in a way that's much more significant than you might think.
And that the,

267
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.800
your proclivity to abdicate your moral responsibility echoes way farther than

268
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.760
you might consider,
especially under some circumstances,
you know,

269
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:18.391
in soldier knits.

270
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:21.840
And one of the things that's so amazing about the Gulag archipelago is his

271
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:26.841
stories not only of the absolute bloody catastrophe of the Soviet state and his

272
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800
incredibly astute documentation of the role that the utopian,

273
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.560
political and philosophical assumptions of Marxism played in creating the
system,

274
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:42.810
right?
It wasn't an aberration,
it was a direct,

275
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:47.640
logical consequence of that collectivist viewpoint.
And to document all that,

276
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:51.750
but also to tell endless stories about people who were able,

277
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:56.310
at least to some degree,
to not become corrupted,

278
00:18:56.311 --> 00:19:00.560
even under unbelievably horrific conditions,
you know?
And,

279
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:03.600
and that's something you also get out of Viktor Frankl's book man's search for

280
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.430
meaning,
you know,
and um,

281
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.970
and so the Gulag archipelago is a story about horror in some sense,

282
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:16.251
but it's more a story of the triumph of the fundamental triumph of the human

283
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.410
spirit and perhaps no more,
uh,

284
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.980
perhaps most evident in the case of soldier.

285
00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:27.930
And it's an himself because he memorized this book in some sense while he was in

286
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:31.230
the camps and then wrote it under extreme duress afterwards.

287
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:35.550
And it's an immense undertaking and it's unbelievably emotionally intense.

288
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:37.800
The entire book.
It's like one,
you know,

289
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.920
1700 page scream of outrage.

290
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.930
You just can hardly believe that someone can write at that white hot intensity

291
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:48.090
for such a long period of time.
And you know,

292
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:52.380
his book had an unbelievable global impact.

293
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:56.340
I think it's sold 30 million copies and it definitely,

294
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.290
for at least a reasonable period of time made it completely untenable for,

295
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.990
um,
utopian resentful,

296
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:08.991
Utopian intellectuals to ethically justified their radical leftist collectivism.

297
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.680
It,

298
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.540
it just blew the slats out from underneath any ethical credibility that

299
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.170
communism,
that,

300
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.810
that remained of the communist doctrine by the 1970s and that that's a hell of a

301
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:23.490
thing for someone to manage on their own.

302
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.800
<v 0>It's a pretty big task.
Uh,</v>

303
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.700
so while you were going through that,
I was thinking myself sauce,

304
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.720
I was talking to,

305
00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.050
I still talk to military folks and I was talking to some military leaders,

306
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.920
young leaders,
so like platoon level and company level leaders.

307
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:46.240
So these are guys that are in charge of,
you know,
40 guys or maybe 150 guys

308
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.940
and,
and you know,
you can have some real ethical problems.
And,

309
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.050
and one of the things that I said to this group was I said,

310
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.830
hey,
in your s in your platoon,

311
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.380
you've got a murderer in your platoon,

312
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.310
you've got someone in your platoon that has a sadist.
And the,

313
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.650
they were kind of looking at me,
um,
suspect,
you know,

314
00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:17.700
a little bit like,
oh,
come on now,
come on.
What are you talking about?

315
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.720
How big is the platoon?
A platoon is 40 guys.
Oh yeah.
And I was,

316
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.340
I was actually going to ask you how accurate I was and then I was going to

317
00:21:26.341 --> 00:21:30.170
actually say that no matter what you say,
how accurate is even if it was,

318
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.690
even if it was one out of every thousand,
you have to act as a leader,

319
00:21:33.691 --> 00:21:36.480
as if in your platoon you've got one of those guys are two of those guys.

320
00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:38.110
That's a way you need to act.
Look,

321
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.080
and there's another book called the Rape of Nan King.
We've covered that.

322
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.760
So one of the things that was really horrifying about that book is,

323
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:51.390
so imagine that there's maybe let's say that there's one in a hundred just for

324
00:21:51.391 --> 00:21:55.670
the sake of argument that's really got cruel and psychopathic traits.

325
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.690
What do you think professionally,
what do you think that number is?
Oh,

326
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.010
I think 1% isn't unreasonable and it could be higher than that.

327
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:04.110
I mean there's gradations,
right?
Right.
Yeah.

328
00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:05.640
There's probably in a group of 40 people,

329
00:22:05.641 --> 00:22:10.320
there's going to be one guy in there who's proclivity in that direction is

330
00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:13.950
sufficiently strong so that you better keep an eye on him.
That's for sure.

331
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.820
And this is a group of people that joined the military,
right?
So they're already,

332
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:20.580
you know,
you've already gotten,
you've already got a group that's okay with,

333
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.150
with theoretically having to kill other people.
So this is,
you know,

334
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:28.200
so if it's 100 islands,
that's likely an underestimate.

335
00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:32.310
So I think your estimate is perfectly reasonable and it might be conservative.

336
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.830
What happened in Nan king was that the most sadistic people became the targets

337
00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:42.510
of imitation and emulation.
And that's when things really get out of hand.

338
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.890
Right?
So,
and that's the same thing for me,
Lai massacre.
And,
and that was so,

339
00:22:46.891 --> 00:22:50.970
so when I was talking to this group and I'm getting it,
I said to him,
I said,

340
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.370
you're looking at me like right now.
Like,
I'm like,

341
00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:56.910
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Or like I'm crazy.
Who knows about the meal?

342
00:22:56.911 --> 00:22:58.850
I'm masker and,
and you know,

343
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.350
all of a sudden it got quiet because if you know anything about the mee Lai

344
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:03.900
massacre,
it was a normal group of guys.

345
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.670
It was a normal group of guys.
It was a normal company of American soldiers.

346
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.700
And you know what,
they'd been through some stress they'd been through,
you know,

347
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.160
they'd,
they'd had their friends killed and it was in Vietnam.

348
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:16.080
There was no one really to react against or to,
to,

349
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:19.410
to take your aggression out on because the enemy,
you couldn't see them.

350
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.430
They would hide.
And it was,
but then they turned and they snapped.

351
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:25.790
And the same thing you had the leader,
um,

352
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:30.360
a guy named lieutenant Calley who was a platoon leader who eat,
Yo,

353
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.000
I'd love for you to do a psychological profile maybe who he used one of these

354
00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:36.690
guys that was kind of like,
was it totally insecure about everything?

355
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.120
And so he got those shoulder boards on,
which is the way,

356
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.540
which is the way Soltra missing.
He describes his,

357
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.040
his experience being a platoon leader.
Yeah.
And what it did to him.

358
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:48.740
And he goes through that.
This book is fantastic to hear.

359
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.850
When he talks about what he did,
he knew he was looking back saying,
oh,

360
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:56.450
I did this and I didn't listen to this little rampage of things that he,

361
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.660
how he acted as a commander.
I ate the food,

362
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:01.740
the good food right in front of my guys when they weren't getting from,

363
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.180
I was getting the good food and he did took advantage of all the little,

364
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.700
all the little comforts that you got being an officer and you know,
yeah.

365
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.240
<v 2>Well he was trying in the whole book and especially in that section,</v>

366
00:24:12.241 --> 00:24:14.130
which I think is in volume two,

367
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.740
which I think is the greatest of the three volumes,

368
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.830
especially the last half of it,
which is just absolutely

369
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.240
genius level writing.
Unbelievably compelling and brilliant.
And yeah,

370
00:24:27.241 --> 00:24:27.990
I mean he,

371
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.350
he said that when he was in the camps that one of the things that he did,

372
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.550
especially once he started to identify people that he truly admired,

373
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.060
was to go over his life with a fine tooth comb and try to try to remember

374
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:47.390
everything that he did wrong by his own estimation and then try to set it right

375
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:51.330
in some manner.
And so there was a,
that's a repentance and then a redemption,

376
00:24:51.331 --> 00:24:53.730
right?
There's,
there's a real,
there's a real fundamental,

377
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.700
like a medieval Christian undertone to all of that.

378
00:24:56.701 --> 00:25:00.690
But it was one of the things that's quite interesting is that when you talk

379
00:25:00.691 --> 00:25:03.660
about issues that are this serious,

380
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:08.160
you're almost inevitably in a situation where you're going to find yourself

381
00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:12.300
compelled to use some kind of quasi religious language because you end up

382
00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:16.080
discussing good and evil and and issues of redemption and issues of repentance

383
00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:19.110
and issues of conscience and sin and all of that.

384
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.720
There isn't language that's deep enough to get out it otherwise.

385
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:26.721
And what Solzhenitsyn did was scour his conscience and try to put himself

386
00:25:27.391 --> 00:25:29.940
together partly because he was shamed.

387
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.320
He was ashamed of himself in the face of these extraordinarily extraordinary

388
00:25:34.321 --> 00:25:38.850
people who seem to be able to keep their moral compass under circumstances where

389
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.080
no one should ever assume that they would keep their moral compass.

390
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.020
Because certainly,
like I said,
when I was reading this,

391
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.270
the Gulag and other books like that,

392
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.320
I never assumed that if I was in those situations that I would have been one of

393
00:25:52.321 --> 00:25:54.180
the people who kept their head.

394
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:59.181
And we're able to withstand the temptation to become a trustee,

395
00:25:59.551 --> 00:26:00.241
for example,

396
00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:04.260
and to take things the easy way and to Lord it over the other prisoners and to

397
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.170
and to adopt that position of authority.
You know,
it's like,

398
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.620
it's like a head slave among slaves,
but you know,

399
00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:13.830
you could say well better to be the head slave than to be the bottom slave.

400
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.280
And while that's true in some sense with regards to creature comfort,

401
00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:19.560
but as Solzhenitsyn point out points out,

402
00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:21.480
it might be a little bit hard on your soul.

403
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.460
And that actually turns out to be something of of crucial,
not only crucial,

404
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:30.810
important psychologically,
but crucial importance sociologically and politically.

405
00:26:30.811 --> 00:26:34.920
Because if you sacrifice that,
then you warp the structure around you,

406
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:38.730
which is exactly what happened in the establishment of these camps.
You know,

407
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.960
in the Soviet Union was just one big lie.

408
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.220
What was their old joke?
They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.

409
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.533
It's like

410
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.690
<v 0>the whole,
the whole book and the whole Soviet Union.
When you,</v>

411
00:26:53.691 --> 00:26:58.530
when you read about it now it seems like it's,
it,
it seems like a bad joke.

412
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:01.100
It seems like a bad movie.
You could,
just,
the way,

413
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.260
the way that Stalin would do something and,

414
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.610
and the way that that order would come down,
it seems like one of those cheesy,

415
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.600
um,
you know,

416
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.460
comedic movies about these decisions that they're making and it's surreal.

417
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.400
It's completely,
it's completely insane.
You know,

418
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:19.060
at one point he's talking about the,
there was a,

419
00:27:19.061 --> 00:27:22.790
a new penalty for what they call it,
sh clipping corn or,

420
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.140
or they're basically a 12 year old kid would be starving and you'd go into a

421
00:27:27.141 --> 00:27:31.340
field and eat and,
and clip a cure,
a,
a core,
an ear of corn.

422
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.280
<v 2>And that happened in the Ukraine during the DQ localization,
right.</v>

423
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:39.780
It was against the law to go out after the fields were,
were harvested.

424
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.620
It was against the law to go out and pick grain off the ground to feed your

425
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.454
family.

426
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.080
<v 0>Right.
And the prison sentence was like a tenor,</v>

427
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.360
which is their little work for 10 years.
So you're going to get,

428
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:54.610
you steal a piece of corn or you've pick up corn off the ground and you're

429
00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:58.540
getting 10 years.
Yep.
You can't comprehend that.

430
00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.950
That is very hard to come here.

431
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.630
She worked and they were the,
the,
you know,

432
00:28:04.631 --> 00:28:08.350
he does in the earlier parts of the book when he starts going through the trials

433
00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:12.960
that they were doing on people.
Yeah.
It's completely crazy.

434
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:13.680
It's king.

435
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.270
<v 2>It's cash.
Well that's why I hate to see the kangaroo courts emerging all over,</v>

436
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.400
all over the west,
you know,
and,
and,

437
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:23.490
and with the university sort of at the forefront of that.
So we're,

438
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:27.180
we're building these alternative court systems constantly that don't follow

439
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:31.280
standard legal procedure and it's really,
we're messing with things that,

440
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.540
that we shouldn't be messing with.
And Yeah,
the whole,
I mean there,

441
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.760
there are accounts,
I believe it's in the Gulag of,
of,

442
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.420
of applause after Astellas,
the speech,
right,

443
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:46.260
where people would stand up and applaud and they,
and they'd applaud until,

444
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.660
until literally the old people were falling over.

445
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:52.500
Because if you were the first person to stop applauding,
then you were,
well,

446
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:54.180
it was off to the camps with you.

447
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:59.580
<v 0>Absolutely.
Outlines.
That sounds so crazy to say.
And he,</v>

448
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:02.470
he outlines a specific thing that happened.
Is that right there?

449
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.020
These no one will stop applauding.
Yeah.

450
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.130
Because they're afraid they're gonna get ratted out by there.
Bye Bye everyone.

451
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.660
<v 2>Yeah,
well Ben and by the people who are in fact watching,
and I mean,
you know,
by,</v>

452
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.860
by the end,
by,
by the,
by the collapse of East Germany,

453
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.030
one third of the people were in Fort Informers for the state.

454
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.220
And so if you had a family of six people,

455
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.500
two of your family members were direct government informers you know,
and it's,

456
00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:31.350
it's so it's,
it's creepy in some sense.

457
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.960
It's a very weak word to use in this situation.
But I'll go,

458
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.270
when I was at New York University talking to Jonathan Heit about,
I dunno,

459
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:41.330
it was about a few months ago,
um,

460
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.580
he just wrote that book called the coddling of the American mind,
you know,
and,

461
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.060
uh,

462
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.290
he took me into one of the men's washrooms there and there was a poster on the

463
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:55.291
wall asking students to turn each other in four instances of bias or offensive

464
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:01.660
speech.
And they have a whole bureaucracy that's designed to do nothing else but

465
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.380
adjudicate these instances of biased speech.

466
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.550
And these posters are up on the walls as if this is something to be proud of.

467
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.151
You know,

468
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:13.960
and the same thing is happening now in Scotland with the Scottish police are

469
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:18.190
doing exactly the same thing.
They're asking citizens to turn each other in for,

470
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.870
for hate crimes.
You know?

471
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:23.680
And the problem with that is the fundamental problem with that and the,

472
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:29.130
the unsolvable problem is well who defines hate and,

473
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.990
and where's,
where's the line drawn?
It's like,

474
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:35.530
well anything that upsets me that you say is hate that.

475
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:37.150
And then it's worse than that.

476
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:41.650
It's like what happens is the people who define hate ended up being those who

477
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:46.651
are looking to take offense so that they can find someone they can define as a

478
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:52.231
victimizer so that they can persecute them morally and justify that inner

479
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:53.224
sadism.

480
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.860
And those are the people who end up defining the laws and then they mask this

481
00:30:56.861 --> 00:31:00.820
with the morality saying,
well,
we're doing this to make our society a safe place.

482
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.090
It's absolutely,
it's,
it's absolutely dreadful.

483
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:08.560
And to see that happening in the UK was just,
it's just awful because I mean,

484
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:12.510
you know,
the UK is center a center,
a center point of,

485
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.970
of the idea of free speech.
I mean,
a lot of America,

486
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.990
obviously a lot of American ideals.
America is a great center of free speech,

487
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:22.660
but I mean,
it's a variation on the English system.

488
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.050
So to see that happening in the UK is just,
it's awful.

489
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:29.350
And to see the police doing this and being,
you know,

490
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.710
I'm encouraged by the politicians and,
and,
and,

491
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.000
and to see this put forward as some sort of moral action,
it's just,

492
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.230
<v 0>well,
it's,
it's an echo of this kind of catastrophe that,</v>

493
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.790
that we're discussing.
So I think about that sometimes.

494
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:53.300
And I also have a tendency to look at things in La,

495
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.280
not be too worried about him.
Like,
Hey,
c'mon,
yeah,

496
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.200
but what's really going to happen?
Right.
And that's,
yeah,

497
00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.880
that's actually part of my personality.

498
00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:02.070
And part of that comes from my old job where,
hey,

499
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.720
I can't worry about these little things.
Oh,

500
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.780
there's some little problem going on over there.
That's,
that's not gonna be,

501
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.200
that's not gonna affect us.
It's not going to,

502
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.410
and you got to pay attention a little bit,
make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

503
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.510
But that thing about speech and you just mentioned the,
uh,
the Kulak.

504
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.760
Is that how is that our school lacks?
Yeah.
Yup.

505
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.530
<v 2>They were the Ukrainian,</v>

506
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.810
they were the Ukrainian farmers who were good at farming.

507
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.970
<v 0>When I read this part,
um,</v>

508
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.110
it got me worried about my own personal,

509
00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:31.100
lackadaisical attitude towards things that I think all that's not big of a deal.

510
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.960
Let me,
let me read this little section about the,

511
00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:37.180
about the escalation of the word Kulak Yep.
And,

512
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.880
and where it started and where that,
yeah.
That's good.

513
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.500
So here we go.
Um,
in Russian,

514
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:48.830
a Kulak is a miserly,
dishonest,

515
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:53.210
rural trader who grows rich,
not by his own labor,
but through someone else's.

516
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.360
<v 0>In every locality,
even before the revolution.</v>

518
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.860
Such cool acts could be numbered on one's fingers and the revolution totally

519
00:33:02.861 --> 00:33:05.110
destroyed their basis of activity.

520
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.610
Subsequently after 1917 by a transfer of meaning,

521
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.880
the name Kulak began to be applied to all those who in any way hired workers.

522
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.510
Even if it was only,

523
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.100
even if it was only when they were temporarily short of working hands in their

524
00:33:24.101 --> 00:33:25.240
own families.

525
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:26.650
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

526
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.160
<v 0>but,
and that doesn't stop there.
The inflation of this scathing,</v>

527
00:33:30.161 --> 00:33:35.161
the term of this scathing term coop Kulak proceeded relentlessly and by 1930 all

528
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.190
strong peasants in general,

529
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.360
we're being so called all peasants strong in management,

530
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.050
strong in work,
or even strong merely in convictions.

531
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:52.230
The term Kulak was used to smash the strength of the peasantry and I gotta I

532
00:33:53.501 --> 00:33:57.130
gotta go a little bit further because hell of a good thing for the workers party

533
00:33:57.131 --> 00:34:00.130
to do a crazy.
Yep.
They went further though.

534
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.510
Beyond this in every village there were people who in one way or another had

535
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:08.080
personally gotten in the way of the local activists.

536
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.300
This was the perfect time to settle accounts with them of jealousy,
envy,

537
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:15.100
an insult.
These are the people you were just talking about.

538
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:20.590
A new word was needed for these new victims as a class.

539
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.020
And it was born by this time,

540
00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:26.050
it had no social or an economic content whatsoever,

541
00:34:26.051 --> 00:34:30.610
but it had a marvelous sound pop Kulak nick.

542
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.830
And that meant a person eating the cool acts.
In other words,

543
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.810
I consider you an accomplice of the enemy.
Hmm.
Yup.
And that's all it.

544
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.840
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,</v>

545
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.840
one of the things I tried to outline in my forward to the abridged version was I

546
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:52.711
was thinking about this idea of oddly enough about intersectionality,

547
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:55.660
which is,
uh,
like social justice idea.
You know,

548
00:34:55.661 --> 00:35:00.661
that the social justice ideas that were best defined by our collective identity

549
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.590
and that the proper narrative in relationship to our collective identity is one

550
00:35:05.591 --> 00:35:06.790
of victim victimizer,

551
00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:11.110
which is a replay of the old Marxist doctrine of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

552
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.640
It's just in its new guys.
Um,
I mean in that new guys developed,

553
00:35:15.641 --> 00:35:19.390
at least in part in response to the Gulag archipelago because the old

554
00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:22.930
proletariat bourgeoisie distinction became morally untenable.

555
00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:25.840
So it just went underground and underwent this transformation.

556
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.850
The intersectional theorists point out that your status as a victimizer or a

557
00:35:30.851 --> 00:35:35.020
victim is actually the intersection of your multiple identities.

558
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.183
And so,

559
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:40.740
and that's actually the Achilles heel of the collectivist notion and we can get

560
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:44.160
into why that is,
but there's a horror that goes along with that,

561
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:49.020
that people that's not obvious that I think contributed to exactly why the

562
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:52.320
Russian revolution went so horribly wrong.
And that is that.

563
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.570
So imagine that I could characterize you along five or six different dimensions

564
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:00.120
of group identity.
It's pretty easy.
And while you're male,

565
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:04.230
you're male of a certain age,
you're male of a certain age and economic class.

566
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.600
You're,
you have a certain sexual orientation,
you have a certain ethnicity,
um,

567
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.180
you have a certain race that's six groups right there.
And we could continue,

568
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.200
you know,

569
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.940
your parents had a certain socioeconomic class and so did your grandparents and,

570
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.390
and then your ethnic group had a certain privilege or lack thereof and you're

571
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:24.630
attractive or you're not attractive and you're intelligent or not intelligent.

572
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:26.800
And there's temple temperamental variability.

573
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.390
Like there's all sorts of ways of characterizing you according to your group.

574
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:30.961
Okay.

575
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:35.850
Now we might say that if we were compassionate people that we would take one of

576
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:37.530
those group identities are more.

577
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.760
And look at where your dispossessed and victimized.
Okay.

578
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:46.560
And we're gonna find some dimension along which you're less privileged than some

579
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:46.831
people.

580
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:50.070
Like maybe you come from a working class background despite the fact that you're

581
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.570
like a straight male.
And so you can be a victim on that dimension.
And so,

582
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.030
and that's kind of,

583
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.230
that's at least in part an element of intersectional theory,
right?

584
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.450
And that may be your,
your,
your oppression is the product of,

585
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.200
of your multiple victim,
like identities.

586
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:15.530
But that can easily be reversed because it's absolutely the case that I can take

587
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:20.340
any person and I can do add multidimensional analysis of their group identities

588
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.940
and I can find at least one dimension along which there the perpetrator,

589
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:27.030
not the victim,
they're the victimizer,
not the victim.

590
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.630
And as soon as I can identify a dimension along which there a victimizer,

591
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.700
then that justifies their persecution.

592
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.850
And so one of the things that you saw happening in the Russian revolution,

593
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:40.710
and it's very much akin to what you just described,
was that the,
the,
the,

594
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.950
the borders of who who was validly accused of being a victimizer essentially

595
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:53.340
expanded to include every once.
And,
and that's actually right.
It's in a,

596
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:55.200
in a perverse sense,
it's right.

597
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.440
Because if you position yourself properly in the historical flow,

598
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.710
then you should see yourself as a perpetrator and a victim equally.
Well,

599
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:06.270
it's not the right way to see yourself at all.

600
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.880
But if you're going to play that game,
you're going to be on both sides of it.

601
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.170
And then that issue is,
and this is related to your idea about,
you know,

602
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.280
in your platoon,
you've got one person who's sadistic.
It's like,
okay,

603
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:21.330
well let's even assume that at the beginning of the Russian revolution,

604
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:25.500
that the vast majority of the people who were motivated by communism were

605
00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:30.350
actually compassionate with regards to the dispossessed peasantry.
Now,

606
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.160
I don't believe that,
but we could say that that was even a significant minority.

607
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.630
Well,
the question is,
did you just say on it?
What was your,
what was your,
uh,

608
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.480
hypothetical percentage?
Well,
let's say,
well,
let's say it's 20%,

609
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:48.040
or let's even say it's 50% of people who are genuinely motivated by compassion

610
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:51.940
for the dispossessed,
but then there's another minority.

611
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.350
Maybe we could even say it was only 10% to begin with who weren't motivated by

612
00:38:56.351 --> 00:39:00.520
that at all.
They were motivated by the jealousy and the spite and the,
and the,

613
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:02.920
and the resentment that Solzhenitsyn describes.

614
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.310
And they were the ones who are after those to be persecuted.

615
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.850
And the thing is they got the upper hand really rapidly.

616
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.430
And it might be because the carnivorous types,

617
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:17.140
the predatory types are much more dangerous and powerful than the compassionate

618
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:19.600
types.
Like they'll take them out instantly.
We're,
we're,

619
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.980
we're willing to step up and smash someone,
post the people that are saying,
oh,

620
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:26.620
we just want to help.
Yes,
exactly.
Well,
and,
and there,

621
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:28.780
there's someone I actually cited a guy named,

622
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:32.270
I think his name was Walter lots in the forward who,
who wrote,
uh,

623
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.580
wrote in a journal called red terror that if you were interrogating an enemy of

624
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:41.260
the state,
you didn't bother with niceties like their individual guilt.

625
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.860
That was a bourgeois z a conceit.

626
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.140
And then so that's really important thing to keep in mind.

627
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.280
What you wanted to do is to do a class based analysis and find out,
well,

628
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.690
are they a member of let's say the Qu lack or the affiliates of the Kulaks,

629
00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:59.980
which is a lovely way of expanding your list of potential victims and then you,

630
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.610
you execute accordingly.
And that would mean,
well,

631
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:06.010
the person that you're interrogating,
right?

632
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:09.010
Or The class member that you're interrogating and then their children and

633
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:13.000
perhaps also their grandchildren and lots of himself was eventually executed by

634
00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:13.600
the Stellan.

635
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.990
Somebody wrote to me after I wrote the foreword and told me that that was his

636
00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:18.630
eventual fate.
And I thought,
well,

637
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.190
talk about standing on a chair and putting the new,

638
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:24.850
surround your own neck and kicking it out from underneath you.
It's like,

639
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.740
you know,
he basically,
he murdered himself fundamentally.
And,
and you know,

640
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:32.580
you could say in some sense,
that was the story of the Soviet Union to a,

641
00:40:32.581 --> 00:40:34.480
to a tremendous degree.
There's,

642
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.730
there's one part going back to the ever expanding,
um,

643
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.260
people that need to be destroyed.
There was a point in,

644
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.020
in the book where he starts,
he's saying,
hey,
look,
there's insects.
Describe,

645
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.330
or maybe it was Lennon was describing these certain people as insects that

646
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:55.840
needed to be destroyed.
And then he just,
that that just starts off with,
hey,

647
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:59.170
people that are rabble rousers,
they're insects.
And,

648
00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:01.300
and then it just expands and expands.

649
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.450
And then it's got priest and then it's got engineers and physicians.

650
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.950
Everyone [inaudible].
Yeah.
That's the,

651
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.730
that's the word that they use or that he uses in the book for a basically

652
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:17.280
saboteurs.
Yeah.
And that expands beyond comprehension.
Yeah.

653
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.560
Because at every single problem that there is,

654
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.230
is the fault of some person out there that sabotaging.
Yup.
And,
and they,

655
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.810
they do this show trial and he talks about it in the book for I th I think,

656
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.770
I think the phrase that he uses or that they use at the rush that the Soviets

657
00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:35.990
used organizers of the famine,

658
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.330
meaning like,
Oh yeah,
you're starving.
And these people over here,

659
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.420
they're the reason you're,
these are the people that organize the famine.

660
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:47.990
They're the,
they're the records of production of food.
And you bet,
you bet.
Well,

661
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:50.960
it was either that,
you know,
you imagine that you,
you,

662
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:56.020
you adopt a worldview and that worldview enables you to,

663
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.590
at least in principle,

664
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:01.220
organize yourself with other people and to provide you with a certain amount of

665
00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:05.150
psychological stability.
And then things go dreadfully wrong.

666
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.070
And then you have a choice which is to reevaluate your worldview,

667
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.300
which is of course what social needs and does in the gulag.

668
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:15.460
Archipelago in a very deep ways,
reorganized his entire worldview.
Um,

669
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:20.270
or you can look for reasons why you're right.
And,
and these things are happening.

670
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:23.240
And Solzhenitsyn talks a lot in the Gulag archipelago about,

671
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.960
see he had a moral condone drum when he was in prison.

672
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.570
And he started his moral awakening,
let's say.

673
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.080
And he was trying to figure out how to treat other people who were imprisoned.

674
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:38.150
He had a real moral conundrum when a committed communist was dragged into the

675
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:40.070
Gulag system,
which happened all the time.

676
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:45.290
He said those people were in particularly dire straits because not only had they

677
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:49.370
been subject to the entire tyrannical weight of the deceitful state,

678
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.220
but it was at the hands of their own comrades in France.
And then the,
the,

679
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:54.680
the,

680
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.120
the committed communists would enter the Gulag and they would still be in there

681
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:01.490
morally superior phase,
right.
That,

682
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.840
that their incarceration was a mistake and that things would be set right and

683
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:08.990
that there was nothing wrong with the system and they would attempt to justify

684
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:10.580
it.
And Solzhenitsyn was no,

685
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.900
never sure how to react to these people ethically because on the one hand,

686
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.970
while they were,
you know,
devastated,

687
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:20.390
because now they were political prisoners and maybe they got a 20 year sentence

688
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:24.230
and they were in terrible.
You know,
stripped of their family and just ruined.

689
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.490
But on other hand,

690
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.510
they were still avid supporters of the very fist that had crushed them.

691
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.870
And so his eventual conclusion was that until they broke and repented they,

692
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.960
they weren't to be allied with,

693
00:43:38.961 --> 00:43:42.950
they were still essentially on the side of the wall of the perpetrator.

694
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:47.180
And it seems to me that,
that,
that's right,
that's,
that's unrepentant sin,

695
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:52.040
let's say.
And it isn't till you,
what,

696
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.140
what would you say?

697
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.590
Until you take responsibility for your own complicitness in your,

698
00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:01.180
in your unfair interrogation that you get to join the ranks of,

699
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.350
of,
of valuable in suffering humanity again.

700
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.813
And so,

701
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.530
<v 1>yeah.</v>

702
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:08.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

703
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.920
It's the extension of the persecution is really something that's horrifying to

704
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:19.690
see how,
who constituted a victimizer,

705
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.470
the ranks of who constituted victimizer just grew and grew and grew and grew.

706
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.450
One of the most shocking groups of people that ended up in the gulags were the

707
00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:32.070
dam Soviet soldiers that had just got

708
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.300
<v 0>back fighting.
Just Nazis.
You just can't,
you can't make up.</v>

709
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.360
They can't make that up on getting soldier niche and who,
yeah.

710
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.380
Who was like in close combat with the enemy and he wrote a letter to one of his

711
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:49.860
buddies and said,
yeah,
this doesn't seem like to be a great decision by Stalin.

712
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:52.420
And next thing you know he's,
he's,
yeah,

713
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.990
<v 2>yeah.
Well the stolen,
stolen decided that,
yeah,
this is something that you,
you,</v>

714
00:44:56.991 --> 00:45:01.260
you can't,
you can't believe this while it is,
there is this,
like,
it's like,

715
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.620
you know,
if there's something,
say titanic at the bottom of this,
you know,

716
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.400
mythologically speaking,
there's also something that's like a cosmic,

717
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.650
it's like cosmic black humor.

718
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.980
It's like the sign on Auschwitz that said work will set you free.
You know,

719
00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.360
that's a joke,
right?
It's a whole,
it's a terrible,

720
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:22.820
terrible dark joke.
And so much of this has the element of,

721
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:27.750
of exactly that kind of surreal,
I hate to say humor,
but it's,

722
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:32.160
it's right.
I mean stolen decided that the,
okay,

723
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:36.750
so the Soviet prisoners of war were not covered by the Geneva Convention for the

724
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:40.680
treatment of prisoners of war.
Castelan re refused to sign that agreement.

725
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.520
So like if you were an allied prisoner of the Germans,

726
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.500
it wasn't like you were having a great time of it.

727
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.350
Like food was in short supply and you were treated pretty brutally.

728
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.850
But the Soviets were kept separately and they were doing so badly that the lis

729
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.940
used to throw food packets over the fence when that was an option.

730
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:02.300
So the Soviet prisoners of war were treated absolutely dreadfully and installing

731
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.690
didn't care about that.
Um,

732
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.420
and then when they were released and went back to the Soviet Union,

733
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:14.630
his dictum was that because they had been exposed to the capitalist West or even

734
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:18.030
the Nazi west for that matter,

735
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.300
that they had now been intolerably corrupted on ideological grounds and had to

736
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:28.290
be put in the prison camps.
So that was the,
that was your destiny,
as you know.

737
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:30.600
I mean,
first of all,
you were frontline Russian soldier,

738
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:32.670
which was just brutal beyond belief.

739
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.780
Their army was completely unprepared for Hitler's invasion because Stella and

740
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:40.950
trusted Hitler in his strange way.
And so they were completely unprepared.

741
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:44.730
And of course then fighting the Soviet Union with its winters.
I mean,
you just,

742
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.480
you just can't imagine what that must have been like.

743
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:53.481
And then to be thrown in a prisoner of war camp at the bottom of the rung and

744
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:58.260
then to be brought back to your country and then to be imprisoned as a trader

745
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:03.120
because as a class,
you'd been exposed to the wrong ideology.
It's like you just,

746
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.190
it's,
it's,

747
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.930
it's unimaginably vile and surreal at the same time.

748
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.590
And you shake your head for me,

749
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.790
while it's such a shock to read the Gulag archipelago,
it,
you just can't,

750
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:24.420
it's like a,
it is,
it's like Dante's inferno.
It's like a trip into hell.

751
00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.030
<v 0>Yeah.
And I guess your,
that's what I was trying to say when we,</v>

752
00:47:28.031 --> 00:47:32.030
when we started this,
does trying to say that it's like you're watching this,
uh,

753
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.740
like,
like you said,
it's like a bad comedy movie and you'd think,
well that's,

754
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:38.830
that'd be really that you'd think,
you know,
when you,
when you take a comedy,

755
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:39.581
well one of the things,

756
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:43.030
one of the ways you can make people laugh is to take something ordinary and

757
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.550
maybe make it much more extreme in the more extreme you make it,

758
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:49.660
the more funny it becomes.
That's what like happened here.

759
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:52.440
You're looking at this thing going,
hey,
oh yeah.

760
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.890
They seem to be trying to make this funny because who in could ever conceive

761
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:02.010
that you could take your front line soldiers who were captured and in misery and

762
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:05.260
when they return home instead of treating them like heroes,

763
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.750
instead you put them back into a prison.
Worst.
You can't even,
you can't even,

764
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.410
that's just,
that's it.
You can't make this stuff.
You can't make it up.
Nope.

765
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:19.000
Did you see,
I believe that movie was the death of Stalin did.
I did not see it.

766
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.410
But that's worth seeing

767
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.911
<v 2>because it's,</v>

768
00:48:20.911 --> 00:48:24.520
it's very interesting because one of the things about that movie is that it

769
00:48:24.521 --> 00:48:29.170
captures that surreal element because it's a black comedy,
you know,
and,

770
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.680
and there are comical things happening in the movie in that terrible dark way

771
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.500
constantly at the same time that in the background,

772
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:42.220
genuinely terrible things are happening.
So it's that horrible.

773
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:44.620
It's that it's,

774
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:49.420
it's got that horrible satirical flavor that runs through books like the Gulag

775
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:51.460
archipelago where you think,
well,
there's just no,

776
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.480
this is so absurd that there's no possible way it could have occurred.

777
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:58.960
And yet that's not only did it happen,

778
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.570
there was like a contest to talk to.
The absurdity,
you know,
to to,

779
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.250
to consider the engineers for example,
records is,

780
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.030
well these people were building the Soviet system to the degree that it was

781
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:14.350
built and then to turn around and accused exactly those people of being the ones

782
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:17.200
who destroy and undermine it.
It's,
it's part of,

783
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.330
I really think that what's what underlies this,
whatever this is,

784
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.410
and I think this is what manifests itself in the worst of the leftist.

785
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:31.411
Collectivism is a real hatred for anything that smacks of competence at all.

786
00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:32.241
Like I,

787
00:49:32.241 --> 00:49:36.430
I tried to imagine those Russian villages because I come from a small town,

788
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:39.340
a small northern town too.
So I kind of,
I tried to imagine,

789
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.700
so imagine that you're in an isolated village and um,

790
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:47.080
it's a peasant village and the peasants weren't fried that long ago,
right?

791
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:48.670
They were basically surfs until,

792
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.470
until about the middle of the second half of the 19th century.

793
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:57.700
And so they had been emancipated and in some of those people who are emancipated

794
00:49:57.701 --> 00:50:00.480
guard a little bit of land and started to have a life,
you know,

795
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:04.120
started to be successful peasants and they were also the people that grew the

796
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:05.530
bulk of the crops.

797
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:09.550
Because what you see happening in any productive domain is that a small

798
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:11.950
percentage of people do almost all the productive work.

799
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.370
So there's a small percentage of productive farmers who grow all the crops,

800
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:15.941
right?

801
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:19.480
And then there's all sorts of farmers who were only farmers by name and they

802
00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:21.280
weren't successful at all.
So you have,

803
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:25.960
and then there was a certain relationship between being productive as a farmer

804
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:27.770
and developing some wealth.

805
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.860
Maybe you had a house and maybe you could hire a person or two,
you know,

806
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.290
and which you'd think would be actually be a good thing,

807
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.510
especially if you are also growing food.
Okay?
So you imagine you,

808
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.910
you get a village and now there's a bit of a socioeconomic pyramid and there's

809
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:44.810
some people that are doing well and there are really and there and it isn't the

810
00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:49.490
crooked people that are really annoying.
Then people who like the genuine Kulaks,

811
00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:53.510
let's say that that small percentage of psychopathic types who were basically

812
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.980
profiting criminally off the efforts of others.
Those aren't so annoying.

813
00:50:57.981 --> 00:51:00.770
Those people,
because they're rich,
but they don't deserve it.

814
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.100
And so they don't stand towards you as a moral ideal that shames you.

815
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:10.190
But the really annoying people are the ones who are doing well and deserve it,

816
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.570
especially if you're someone who's doing nothing and is bitter.
Okay?
So now,

817
00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:17.600
so there's the village and you've got your people who are doing all right and

818
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:18.710
then you've got a huge Strout.

819
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:21.680
If people who aren't upset about the people who are doing well,

820
00:51:21.681 --> 00:51:24.710
they might even admire them and be happy that they're around because they're

821
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:28.130
making the community thrive and growing some food.
Then you have this little,

822
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.040
this little,
uh,

823
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.190
strata at the bottom of people who are ne'er do wells and on the more

824
00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:37.140
psychopathic end of things.
And they are bitter and resentful and,

825
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.560
and waiting for their bloody opportunity.

826
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:43.280
And then the communist intellectuals come into town and say,
you know,

827
00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:46.520
those people that are doing well,
they actually,

828
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.460
everything they've got is ill gotten and they,
they,

829
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.240
they stole it and they stole it from you,
from you.
Like,

830
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:54.470
and look at how badly you're doing.

831
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:56.750
And the reason you're doing badly is because these,

832
00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.560
these people who are lording it over you and who have all this creature comfort,

833
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.440
they took that from you.
It's yours by,
right?

834
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.280
And so then all that resentment and jealousy and hatred and rage,

835
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.890
alcohol fueled as you might well imagine,

836
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.900
has this moral reason to go with pitchforks and,

837
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.530
and in a mob and surround those houses and to strip them of everything they
have.

838
00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:22.580
And to rape the women and to kill the occupants or to ship them off to the

839
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:25.820
middle of Siberia when there,
where they froze to death because there were no,

840
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:30.290
or died of dysentery or,
or,
or whatever other plague managed to,
you know,

841
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.070
weave its way through these camps.
And so you have the,

842
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:39.280
you have the intellectuals providing the moral rationale for the worst ethical

843
00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:44.060
actors in these small villages doing the worst possible things under the guise

844
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:48.230
of compassion.
Right?
And that's part of that victim victimizer narrative.

845
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:52.250
It's just an Indian,
like you could imagine that you can imagine a dark night,

846
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.860
you can imagine the winter,
you can imagine the alcohol,

847
00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.150
you can imagine the rage that fuels these people who are drinking too much in

848
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:02.330
the pubs that have been sitting there for the last 20 years.
Like,

849
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.930
what would you say?
Eating up their own souls with resentment and bitterness.

850
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.260
And then someone comes in and says,
you're the true victim here,

851
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.050
and here's the people that you can go after.
And then like,

852
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:13.760
if you play that on your imagination,

853
00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:17.780
you get some real sense of exactly what sort of horror that would produce.

854
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:22.490
You know,
you think about the rape for example,
or,
or just the theft or,
but,

855
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.470
but it's the rape that you can really think about as,

856
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:29.880
as absolute revenge for all that bitter resentment.

857
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:32.100
All fueled by the fact that,
you know,

858
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:35.820
you'd sat there for the last 20 years being completely God damn useless and

859
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.710
bitter and,
and,
and,
and angry and,
and,
and,

860
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:45.690
and fantasizing about the day that would come where you'd have your opportunity,

861
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.600
God and then the whole country,
then that was the whole country.
Oh,

862
00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:51.240
it's just unbelievable.

863
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:56.200
<v 0>Yeah.
And I think,
uh,
he,
he spells that out very clearly,
and he says,</v>

864
00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:58.510
you know what he's saying?
You know,

865
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:03.410
I'm saying that you got a psychopath and your platoon,
he saying that psychopath,

866
00:54:03.411 --> 00:54:06.230
all that psychopath needs to flip is,

867
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.780
is the somewhat to tell them that that's the right thing to do.

868
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.300
And that's exactly what happened.
What'd you say?
That,
that's it?

869
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.740
But those guys that were slightly psychopathic,
yeah.
And then it becomes,
okay,

870
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:19.970
I'm the,
I'm the head psychopath and you're in my village and you're,

871
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.790
let's say you're one of those people that are in the middle.
Well,

872
00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:25.880
whose side are you gonna be on?
I'm a psychopath.
If you,
if you're not on my side,

873
00:54:25.881 --> 00:54:29.690
I'm going to kill you next.
So you go,
well,
no,
I'm on your side too.

874
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.150
And that's definitely

875
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:35.370
<v 2>doesn't take a look.
It's not like it takes much pressure</v>

876
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.590
on people to have them fold.
I mean,
one of the things you see,

877
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.310
you see happening right now in our cultures that's happening to people all the

878
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:47.370
time with these Twitter wars.
You know,
someone will say something,

879
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:52.170
they'll express an opinion and then they'll get mobbed by and,

880
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:53.700
but only abstractly.
Right?

881
00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:57.480
It's not like there's pitchfork wielding mobs at their house and then I'm not

882
00:54:57.481 --> 00:55:01.260
making light of it.
It's,
no,
it's no pleasant thing to be mobbed on Twitter,

883
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.120
but that's,

884
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.930
that's an obstruction compared to these people showing up at your house,

885
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:08.030
you know?
And,
yeah,

886
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.960
and what'll happen is that people will go through an abject apology,
you know,

887
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:14.580
and they'll say,
well,
I really didn't mean it.
And,

888
00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:18.480
and now I understand what my privilege is and I see how what I said could have

889
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.700
been very hurtful to people.
And you know,
they,

890
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.700
they wonder through that entire apology and fold almost instantly.
And,

891
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:29.730
and that's under almost,
almost no pressure compared to what real pressure is.

892
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:34.590
Real pressure is when the wolves are actually at your door rather than just

893
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:35.940
barking off in the distance.

894
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:39.480
But people will fold just when they're barking in the distance.
So

895
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:44.090
<v 0>there's one lawyer that he talks about in here is the same thing as the story</v>

896
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:45.210
that new scribing,
I forget the guy's name,

897
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:50.211
but this guy was like the premier prosecuting lawyer for the Soviet government

898
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.570
and he just rips people apart over and over again.

899
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.020
And as you read about what happened to him,
sure enough,
he's,

900
00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.640
one of the guys had been ended up on the,

901
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:03.920
on the defensive and Yam being executed.
Yeah.
Like they have all these things,

902
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:04.600
these,
well they

903
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.850
<v 2>built,
they built,
uh,
uh,
um,</v>

904
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:13.450
a place of butchery and then threw themselves into it.
You know,
that's,

905
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:17.830
and,
and you see Solzhenitsyn documents this very carefully.
I mean,

906
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.200
Stalin killed all the people who,

907
00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.880
who were foremost actors in the Russian revolution,
right?
So,
I mean,

908
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:28.950
everyone was fed into the great grinding machine.
So,
and,

909
00:56:28.951 --> 00:56:33.280
and Stalin himself,
I mean,
it looked to me like,

910
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.050
see,
he got himself into something approximating a positive feedback loop,

911
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:40.390
which is a very dangerous thing to have happen.

912
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:43.750
And I think Solzhenitsyn does a lovely job of detailing this as well.

913
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:44.710
So it's like,

914
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.250
imagine that I have a fair amount of contempt for people to begin with.

915
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:53.120
And then I find that people are,
I'm not trusting person.
And I find that I,

916
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.650
I'm very paranoid about the fact that people are lying to me and then I develop

917
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:58.510
a certain amount of power and a reputation.

918
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.520
Well then people really do start lying to me all the time in every gesture,

919
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:05.320
you know,
because every time they come near me,

920
00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:08.620
they're absolutely terrified and they're going to tell me anything that I want

921
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:13.180
to hear.
And of course then all that does is validate my view of how pathetic and

922
00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:16.870
contemptible everyone is and so on.
The more that view gets validated,

923
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:19.000
the more I think that it's okay to destroy people.

924
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:22.510
Because look at how pathetic and contemptible they are,
how they always lie.

925
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.970
And all that means is that they lie even more.

926
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.120
And so this whole thing just spirals out of control.
And you know,

927
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:30.310
Stellan basically started out as a,

928
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:35.560
as the brutal enforcement henchmen for henchmen,
for Lennon,

929
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.840
right?
The,
the,
the killer for hire.

930
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.690
And not like Lennon was above that sort of thing himself,

931
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:43.530
but he trained Stalin and,

932
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.500
and then Stalin's proclivity to be murderous,

933
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:50.560
just kept expanding without limit,
right?
First of all,

934
00:57:50.561 --> 00:57:53.950
it was individuals and then it was groups and then it was nations.
And then,
well,

935
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:56.830
by the end of his life,
well,
what was it,
the plot,

936
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.070
the plot to destroy the entire world.
Tu Tu,
Tu Tu,

937
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:05.200
Tu Tu Tu initiate the Third World War to wipe out Europe to maybe destroy

938
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:10.150
everything and like there's no limit.
There was no limit to that,
you know?

939
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:13.720
And there's some evidence that that's perhaps why he was killed,
you know,

940
00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:18.580
because Stalin himself even went too far for the horrible,
for the horrible,

941
00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:23.680
um,
what semi
the,

942
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:28.480
the corrupted compadres that he had,
he'd arranged around himself.

943
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:33.130
He went too far even for them.
And,
and thank God for that,
you know?

944
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.640
But yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's absolute,
I mean,

945
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.553
the thing that,

946
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:42.790
that the Gulag Archipelago Gulag archipelago did for me,

947
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:45.430
and this was also in keeping as a consequence,

948
00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:47.740
also have reading young at the same time,
but,

949
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:50.650
but it was certainly the go light in,
in large part that did it.

950
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.710
I would say that in some sense it's scared me straight.
I thought.
I see the,

951
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.650
the consequences of unethical behavior,
deceit,

952
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:03.100
the willingness to,
to turn a blind eye.

953
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:07.630
So even sins of omission rather than sins of commission just to turn a blind
eye.

954
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.840
The consequences of that are so absolutely dreadful that it's not acceptable.

955
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.430
And I think that's the right lesson from the 20th century.
It's that,
ew,
ew,
ew,

956
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.390
ew.

957
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:24.390
You have a much more moral role to play in keeping things straight.

958
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.890
Then you want to believe,
you know,
people think,
well,

959
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.190
my life is basically meaningless.
It's like,
well that's quite terrifying.

960
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:32.960
It's like,
yeah,
it's kind of terrifying,

961
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:35.750
but it means you don't have any responsibility.

962
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.600
So there's a big advantage to thinking that,
you know,

963
00:59:38.601 --> 00:59:41.360
not if nothing you do matters,
then nothing you do matters.

964
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.120
And so you can do whatever you want and,

965
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.680
and that's horrifying and annihilistic sort of way.

966
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.530
But there's another kind of horror that's more associated,

967
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:52.700
I think with the horror of hell fire that was characteristic of the Medieval

968
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:56.180
Christian view is,
which is something like if you strip it of its metaphysics,

969
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:58.370
it's something like,
no,
you don't get it.

970
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.000
The things you do actually do the things you do or don't do,

971
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:06.350
they actually do matter.
And they tilt the world towards,
you know,

972
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.630
something approximating good,
let's say,

973
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.720
or towards something that very closely approximates hell and that's actually on

974
01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:18.620
you.
It's literally your fault.
It's literally your responsibility.
It's like,

975
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.040
man,
that's a terrifying,
that's a terrifying idea.

976
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:27.041
But I can't see how you can read this literature without coming to that

977
01:00:27.171 --> 01:00:31.190
conclusion.
Like it wasn't one that I wanted to leap to.
You know,
it's like it's,

978
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.300
it's,
it's,
it's sort of the ultimate in horrifying conclusions that,

979
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.740
that everybody who participated in this system was at fault for all of it.

980
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.800
And on Dostoyevsky made the same sorts of claims in,
in,

981
01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:46.220
in the last part of the 19th century.
I mean,
he was a very weird,

982
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:48.080
mystical sort of person,
you know,
and he,

983
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.340
he made claims are some of his characters did,
but on his behalf that,
you know,

984
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:54.770
not only are you responsible for everything you do,

985
01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:58.400
but in some sense you're responsible for everything that everyone else does too.

986
01:00:58.401 --> 01:01:02.990
And you think,
well,
obviously there's a way in which that isn't true.
You know,

987
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:04.790
it's delusional in some sense.

988
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.320
But there's another way in which it actually is true.
You know?
And so

989
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:14.110
<v 0>I wrote a book called extreme ownership and it's,
it's very inner.
So all,</v>

990
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:18.870
so all this,
is this like a whole thought here.
So,
you know,

991
01:01:18.871 --> 01:01:22.140
when I read the book about face,
which is not about leadership,

992
01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:23.370
it's not a leadership book,
it's a,

993
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:26.100
it's a book about a guy that was in the leadership position,
but he doesn't say,

994
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.050
here's how you lead,
here's what you do here.

995
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.750
It's a book about his experience and what I took away from it,

996
01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:35.310
especially because I was in leadership positions in the military in combat

997
01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:38.820
situations that I started seeing all these leadership things that he did.

998
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:43.800
And there's all this crossover because for instance,

999
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.670
and so for me the crossover was while I started learning about tactics when I

1000
01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:48.241
was a young kid,

1001
01:01:48.241 --> 01:01:51.090
cause I was in the military and the seal teams and you had to learn about how to

1002
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:52.800
fire and maneuver.
Like that's what you do.

1003
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.590
And then so you start learning about leadership.

1004
01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:58.100
And then I started training a lot of Jujitsu and so,

1005
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.840
so those things kind of all fit together.

1006
01:02:00.841 --> 01:02:04.980
And it's very strange how those things started to weave together in my head
that,

1007
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:09.720
oh,
if
on the battlefield,
if you want to attack the enemy,

1008
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.840
you don't do it head on you,
you flank them,
you distract them in,

1009
01:02:12.841 --> 01:02:15.660
then you flank him,
you come in from the outside.
In Jujitsu,

1010
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.130
if you want to submit your opponent,
you,
you don't grab their arm.
No,

1011
01:02:20.131 --> 01:02:22.590
you start to choke them and while they're defending the choke,

1012
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.500
then you get their arm.
And as a leader,

1013
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:30.390
if you want somebody to do something,
you just don't bark that order at them.

1014
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:33.690
You flank them and you let them understand why it's happening.
And,

1015
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.680
and you know,
when I started this podcast that I do,

1016
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.500
I would say I started off by saying in the beginning,

1017
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:45.180
I'd say that's a podcast about leadership viewed through the Lens of war and

1018
01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:46.014
atrocity.

1019
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.350
And the more I did it and it didn't take me very long where I was saying,

1020
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:49.740
well it's,

1021
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.520
it's actually a podcast about human nature really is what it's actually about.

1022
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.440
Because the better you understand human beings,

1023
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:58.020
the better you'll be able to do as a leader because you'll understand what's

1024
01:02:58.021 --> 01:02:59.320
happening with those dynamics,

1025
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.340
which I guess is now leading me into some sort of psychology.

1026
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:04.160
You would just kind of where you ended up with them.

1027
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.530
Have you read this book and you said you were studying political science when

1028
01:03:07.531 --> 01:03:08.780
you read this book and then you said,
oh,

1029
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:12.900
you looked at the psychology of it and see an example that you just brought up.

1030
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:17.490
And this is just what you learn when you read and when you understand history

1031
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.410
and when you understand the way people think stolen,

1032
01:03:20.411 --> 01:03:25.411
surrounded himself with people that would say yes to him and anybody that didn't

1033
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:28.830
say yes to him,
he killed them.
And I'll say this again,

1034
01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:33.620
I'll talk to military identity also killed you if you said yes.
Yeah,

1035
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.040
the uh,
the,
I'll talk to military for sure,
but also any business leader.

1036
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:42.960
We talked to business leaders all the time,
and you don't want people,

1037
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.850
you don't want your subordinates or your superiors when you tell them what to
do,

1038
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:52.080
to just nod their head and said,
yes,
you don't want that.
Now the,
the,

1039
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:54.330
the immediate thought,
especially for a military guy,

1040
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:58.290
they think they're nothing would make my job easier then if I bark in order it,

1041
01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:01.590
you,
Jordan,
you work from Europe,
private and Naama captain and I barked an order.

1042
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:03.150
You,
you just shut up and go do it.

1043
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:04.830
And that seems like the best thing in the world.

1044
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.130
It's absolutely not true because there's things that,
you know,

1045
01:04:08.131 --> 01:04:12.030
on the front lines that I don't know.
And if I really want to be a good leader,

1046
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.110
I want you to push back on me and say,
Hey boss,
we don't want to do that.

1047
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:18.880
Here's what's going on.
Let me tell you the situation.
And instead of making,

1048
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.280
you want to be able to do that,

1049
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:22.920
you want to be able to teach your subordinates to do that without being

1050
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:26.190
insubordinate.
Right?
Cause then it's not a power play.
It's that your,

1051
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.700
your interests are aligned.
Our interests are aligned.
And I actually,

1052
01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:32.340
when I talked to the subordinates,
cause I talked to subordinates to yeah.

1053
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.430
And I say,
listen,
when you say something to your boss,
you don't say,

1054
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.640
why the hell are we doing that boss?
You actually have to be very tactful DSS.

1055
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.460
Exactly.
Hey,
hey,
hey boss,

1056
01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:45.330
I want to make sure I'm executing this exactly how you want it.

1057
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:47.670
Can you explain to me why we're doing this?
So I can really,

1058
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:52.290
really make it happen out there in the field.
And that's a key thing.
So,

1059
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:57.210
so these ideas of,
of,
you know,
psychology I guess now as,

1060
01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.260
I hate to use that word,
but because I was just calling me human nature,

1061
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:04.650
but these ideas,
they all kind of come together.
And so now you're talking about

1062
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.330
ownership,
right?
Extreme ownership and this idea that hey,

1063
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:12.990
I'm responsible for everything.
And so here's what I'll get from a leader.

1064
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.350
They'll say,
well,
whether it's a business leader or it's,

1065
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.110
it's very easy to use a military leader,
so I'll get a platoon commander,

1066
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.720
my machine gun,
or shot in the wrong direction.

1067
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:28.170
How can that be my fault because my machine got a shot in the regression?

1068
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.520
I'm not,
I'm not holding his weapon.
I'm not pulling his from from,

1069
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.840
how can that possibly be my fault?
That's not my fault.
[inaudible] wrong.

1070
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.750
Who's in charge of that machine gun?

1071
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.700
Who's in charge of making sure he understands what his fields of fire,

1072
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.760
who's in charge of making sure he understands when and where he's allowed to

1073
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:45.100
shoot you are.
You're the boss.
This is absolutely your fault.

1074
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.490
Had another interesting example of the weather.

1075
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.640
The weather's bad.
We couldn't execute our mission.

1076
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:54.070
That's why we failed because we couldn't launch our helicopters.

1077
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.323
It's not my fault.

1078
01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.220
That's a hard one to argue against except for the fact that if you're a good

1079
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:02.320
leader,
you'll say,
hey,
here's our plan.

1080
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.510
We're going to use these helicopters and here's our contingency plan.

1081
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:08.830
If there's bad weather,
if you don't take that ownership of what's going on,

1082
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:12.040
if you don't take responsibility for it,
you're not going to change it.

1083
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:15.640
You're not going to fix it.
And that means you're never getting any better.

1084
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:19.120
You're not going to win.
Right.
But the minute you as,
and this,

1085
01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:24.100
and obviously this applies to you know,
people to purple,
then you know,

1086
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:26.280
you tell people to take responsibility.
I've,
you know,
tell him,

1087
01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.680
take ownership of what's going on in your world.
It's this,
it's the same thing,

1088
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:30.320
but

1089
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.050
<v 2>well,
it's also,
it's also seems to me to be the case.</v>

1090
01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:37.600
And I think that this is part of the ethic that's embedded in,
in,

1091
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:41.120
it's deeply embedded in Christianity with the idea that

1092
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.160
the idea that the ultimate sacrifice that you can offer to the world is the

1093
01:06:46.161 --> 01:06:48.230
sacrifice of yourself.
It's like,
well,

1094
01:06:48.231 --> 01:06:51.950
imagine that you have to sacrifice something to set the world right while you
do,

1095
01:06:51.951 --> 01:06:52.551
obviously,

1096
01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:56.510
because you have to give up things now in order to make things better in the

1097
01:06:56.511 --> 01:07:01.040
future.
So the sacrificial ideas,
a very deep one,
then the question might be,
well,

1098
01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.380
well,
if you're going to sacrifice something,

1099
01:07:03.381 --> 01:07:05.450
is it going to be someone else or is it going to be you?

1100
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:09.770
And I really think that's the fundamental question and the right answer to that

1101
01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:13.340
is that it's going to be you.
It's your fault,
right?
You take that on,

1102
01:07:13.341 --> 01:07:17.420
or at least you take on that responsibility.
And it is,
it's a weird thing.

1103
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:21.020
Weird Lee,
difficult to distinguish fault and responsibility.

1104
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.930
I think responsibility is the better way of thinking about it,

1105
01:07:23.931 --> 01:07:27.560
but it's tied in with the idea of fault.
If it doesn't go right,

1106
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.830
if it isn't going right,
it's because you're not good enough.

1107
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:33.950
Now that can be crushing.
There is a problem with that.
Like,

1108
01:07:33.951 --> 01:07:38.820
and you see sometimes people who develop like psychotic depression and they,
um,

1109
01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:39.580
they,

1110
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:44.580
they suffer from a delusional condition in some sense that the entire moral

1111
01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:49.300
catastrophe of the world is literally their fault.
And that's not there.

1112
01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.070
There's an element of that that's,
that's not productive.

1113
01:07:52.071 --> 01:07:56.180
Although there's a truth in it as well,
you know?
And,
and it's hard to,

1114
01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:00.380
it's hard to find the balance so that you can take on that responsibility

1115
01:08:00.381 --> 01:08:03.950
without simultaneously being a crushing weight because there's a lot of things

1116
01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:06.410
in the world that are really not good.
And if they're your fault,

1117
01:08:06.411 --> 01:08:09.110
well that's rather hard on you.
I mean,

1118
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:13.730
one of the things that the Catholic church does to help people with that is that

1119
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.540
it gives them the opportunity to be sort of wash their sins off themselves,

1120
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.460
right?
You can go to church and you can say,
well,
look,

1121
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.120
here's a bunch of ways that I've been being not who I could be.

1122
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.240
And the Church authorities say,
well,
you know,

1123
01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:30.440
that's not good and you should straighten up and all of that and fly,
right?

1124
01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:35.040
But human beings are fallible and you're fallible and,
and,

1125
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:40.070
and we can't just crush you because of your insufficiency.

1126
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:43.540
So we'll wash the slate clean and you can go out there and try again.

1127
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.790
And it's very hard to get the balance between those things,
right?

1128
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.190
So that you can take the responsibility on without being crushed by it,
but,

1129
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.760
but it's still the case that it seems to me that it's either your fault or it's

1130
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:58.580
someone else's and as soon as it's someone else's,

1131
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:02.720
then you better be careful because that idea that it's someone else's is

1132
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.880
definitely going to appeal to the worst in you.

1133
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:07.520
That's definitely going to happen and if you don't see that,

1134
01:09:07.521 --> 01:09:11.190
then you're naive or willfully blind and,

1135
01:09:11.191 --> 01:09:13.250
and all that is going to do all that.

1136
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:16.490
All that that is going to do is make the situation worse.

1137
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1138
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:21.710
Especially because if it's not my fault and it's your fault and I can't control

1139
01:09:21.711 --> 01:09:22.700
you,
what do I do about it?

1140
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:28.030
I sit there and just suffer the consequences of the situation as opposed to,

1141
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.050
okay,
here's what's going on.

1142
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.630
I'm going to take responsibility and ownership for it.
I'm going to change it,

1143
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.793
make it happen.

1144
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:39.170
You talked about turning a blind died and earlier you talked about turning a

1145
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:43.510
blind eye to the truth to a situation.

1146
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.600
And I know there's a point in this book where he talks about,

1147
01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:53.720
he's got a buddy that says,
amnesty is coming,
right?
Amnesty is coming.

1148
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:58.750
Let's just keep our mouth shut.
Let's do what we're told to do and we'll get,

1149
01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:03.560
you know,
we'll get out.
Amazon's coming.
And you know,
Solzhenitsyn says,

1150
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:08.360
he saying,
okay,
yeah.
And then he says to himself,
wait a minute,
if I'm not,

1151
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.670
if I'm not living in order to live,

1152
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.710
then is it worth it?

1153
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:21.650
And this is a question that I get asked a lot because people get themselves into

1154
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.550
situations

1155
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.230
where they've lost some kind of control,

1156
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.820
whether it's they're in a crappy job or they've got a bad boss or whatever.

1157
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:36.710
Maybe they're in a bad relationship,
maybe their families met,
but they're,

1158
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.030
they're in a situation and they,
and they don't know what to do.

1159
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.730
And part of them,

1160
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:48.890
I think anticipates the answer from me to be,
listen,
Hey,

1161
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.210
listen,
if you're not,
if you're not living in order to live,

1162
01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:54.080
then that's wrong.

1163
01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:01.560
But what I actually tell them universally almost,

1164
01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:06.380
and there was a couple situations where it goes outside this,
but it's like that.

1165
01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:11.190
What I tell them is what you need to do right now is you need to play the game.

1166
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:16.670
You need to play the game to get this situation to a point where you can act,

1167
01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.640
right?
So if you're,
you've got a bad boss,
right?
Yep.
Oh,
you okay?

1168
01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:23.730
You got to buy Boston.
I want to tell this guy to go screw himself and he's,
hey,

1169
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:26.940
guess what I'm going to do when my boss tells me something to do that it doesn't

1170
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:27.990
make much sense.
You know what I'm gonna do?

1171
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:30.060
I'm gonna do it and I'm going to do it well,

1172
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:32.370
and what am I doing on building that relationship with him?

1173
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.680
He starting to trust me and he's gonna tell me to do something else.

1174
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:38.760
Now these things are massive cutoffs catastrophes.

1175
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.800
It's like he's telling me to do something.
Maybe there's a better way to do it.

1176
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.090
You don't even know how to do it that way.

1177
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.120
And I'm going to play that game and I'm going to build up that relationship.

1178
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:50.121
Now when eventually he tells me to do something that is totally stupid or it's

1179
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:54.000
going to cost,
you know,
lives or money.
Then when I say,
hey boss,

1180
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.810
that's not a great way to do it.
I think I know a better way.

1181
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.090
Can we try something else?
He actually will listen to me.

1182
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:04.590
So I'm going to play the game a little bit and I'll tell you my gut instinct.

1183
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:09.360
If now I guess it's,
it's easy to look from the outside and say,
hey,

1184
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:12.270
if I was in this prison camp,
my gut instinct is like,
okay,
Jack would,
you know,

1185
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.490
you've been through these kinds of things before,
play the game,

1186
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.563
you're going to play the game,

1187
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.120
which is horrifying because part of playing that game to the fullest extent here

1188
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.260
or in a Nazi prison camp would be coming to capitol.
Oh,
you're playing the game.

1189
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:29.310
You're playing the game.
Yeah.
So,
and that's really the outlying,

1190
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.750
the things that I said that our outlying,

1191
01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:34.200
I always make the caveat that if you're getting asked to do something that's

1192
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:38.070
immoral,
illegal or unethical,
then you actually have a duty to say,
no,

1193
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:40.710
I'm not going to do that.
No,
that's,
that's the line which you know,

1194
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:45.510
which you reach that line in the sand with a bill,
see 16 which is,
hey,

1195
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:47.160
I'm not going to do this.

1196
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:53.330
But the idea that sometimes you got to play the game and sometimes even from

1197
01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:57.030
you,
when you just said to me,
he said,
well,
you know,

1198
01:12:57.031 --> 01:13:01.020
sometimes it's not right to turn a blind eye on things.

1199
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.460
And it's like
sometimes you have to,

1200
01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:10.440
if you want to get yourself to a position like my s my,
it seems to me

1201
01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.190
<v 2>that you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy,
like and,
and,</v>

1202
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.640
and,
and like impulsive,
moral responding.
You know,

1203
01:13:18.641 --> 01:13:21.640
like let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's

1204
01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:25.050
intolerable and maybe what you'd like to do,
you know,

1205
01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:28.500
the resentment has built up over five years and you'd like to go in there and,

1206
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.960
and yell at him and tell him everything you think and you think,

1207
01:13:31.961 --> 01:13:34.720
well that's the truth.
It's like,
well,
it's actually,

1208
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.070
it's not a very sophisticated truth because you're doing as shallow and

1209
01:13:39.071 --> 01:13:41.590
impulsive analysis of the situation.

1210
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:47.130
Like it would have been the case that you've already compromised yourself in 500

1211
01:13:47.411 --> 01:13:51.040
ways.
And I'll get back to the playing the game issue because you do have to

1212
01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:55.100
discipline yourself to,
and you have to discipline yourself to,

1213
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:56.261
to some degree,

1214
01:13:56.261 --> 01:14:00.970
by allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the system,
right?

1215
01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.620
That's a necessary part of discipline.

1216
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:07.920
And discriminating that from a compliance with unethical activity is very

1217
01:14:09.371 --> 01:14:13.990
difficult.
So that's a hard situation.
But let's say you're,
you're,

1218
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.410
you're going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss and they come in and

1219
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.870
they're right at the end of their tether because maybe that's why they come for

1220
01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:21.940
counseling.
They say,
I really want to tell that son of a bitch.

1221
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:26.170
What I think of it,
man.
You think,
well,
wait a second here.
Okay,
first of all,

1222
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:31.980
you've already eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities.

1223
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:38.460
That decision by failing to say small things that you could have said all the

1224
01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:43.690
way along and it's not like you can just all of a sudden blurt all of that out

1225
01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:47.650
now and that wipes the slate clean in.
That constitutes truth.

1226
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:52.720
It's too unsophisticated.
So let's think,
okay,
so what is it that you want?

1227
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:55.950
Well,
I don't want this job anymore.
It's like,
okay,
now let,

1228
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.710
let's actually have a strategy about this.
Then you don't want this job anymore.

1229
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:04.180
Can you get another job?
While I don't think so.
Well,

1230
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:05.980
so you can't just quit.
Well,

1231
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:09.400
no I can't because then I don't have any money in my family.
Depends on the job.

1232
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:13.810
It's like,
okay,
so you can't just stop.
This does,
that's not a viable solution.

1233
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:16.570
You go out of the frying pan into the fire or you know,

1234
01:15:16.571 --> 01:15:21.571
you suck you s you substitute one set of unethical actions for another set of

1235
01:15:21.671 --> 01:15:25.120
unethical actions that are even worse.
That's not helpful.
All right,

1236
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:29.710
so let's start thinking about what exactly it is that you want.
It's like,

1237
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.780
well,
maybe I want a better job.

1238
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:35.710
I want to work for someone who is more reasonable.
Okay,
so what's stopping you?

1239
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.630
Well,
I don't have my CV in order.
My resume isn't up to date.
Well,

1240
01:15:40.631 --> 01:15:43.540
why is that?
Well,
I haven't done it for five years and I don't like doing it.

1241
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.620
Well,
why is that?
Well,

1242
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:48.040
because I'm kind of embarrassed about it because it has holes in it and it shows

1243
01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:51.670
where I'm lackadaisical and where I'm not prepared.
It's like,
okay,

1244
01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:53.590
how many things are there like that?
Well,

1245
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.790
there's a bunch of things and they're all associated with how I procrastinated

1246
01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.250
in the past.
It's like,
okay,
what are we going to do to rectify that?

1247
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:01.360
So I'll say to people,

1248
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:04.780
why don't you update your CV that that's what we'll do first.

1249
01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:06.520
Because if you're going to look for a different job,

1250
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.410
I'm not saying you're going to look for a different job,

1251
01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.130
but if you're going to look for a different job,
you're not going to,

1252
01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:13.480
unless your cvs updated,

1253
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.920
so don't you go unless you can get a good recommendation from this boss that's a

1254
01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.150
tyrant.
That's right.

1255
01:16:19.151 --> 01:16:23.950
There's you to play the care's tennis strategic actions that you're going to

1256
01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:28.420
have to take in order to make yourself able to move laterally or up and the

1257
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:32.980
truth is isn't going in and yelling at your boss and telling him everything you

1258
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:36.580
think about it.
The truth is trying to figure out the very,

1259
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:40.350
very difficult process of how you put yourself in a better position and that

1260
01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.110
that are like,

1261
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:45.130
one of the things that's quite fun about this lecture tour is the letters that I

1262
01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:49.690
receive or the stories that people tell me about switching jobs because they do

1263
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:50.710
realize that there,

1264
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:54.700
and I often talk to people about consulting their resentment.

1265
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:58.570
Resentments are really useful emotion,
like it's really dangerous.

1266
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.530
It's one of the most dangerous psychological states,
I believe.

1267
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.180
But it's unbelievably useful because resentment usually only means one of two

1268
01:17:07.181 --> 01:17:10.790
things.
It either means quit whining and,

1269
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:15.290
and take it on because you're immature or it means you're allowing yourself to

1270
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:18.260
be taken advantage of and you have something to say or do.

1271
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.580
And so you want to sort out the first part and find out if you're just being

1272
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:27.260
immature and you can think that through and you can talk to people.
Um,
but,

1273
01:17:27.261 --> 01:17:29.180
and then,
but if it's the second,
it's like,
no,

1274
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:32.270
you've compromised yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how

1275
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:34.370
to get out of that.
And if you're resentful,

1276
01:17:34.371 --> 01:17:38.360
that's evidence that you have in fact done that.
Okay.

1277
01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:39.860
So now that issue would be,
well,

1278
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:43.370
how can you set your life up so that you can be without that resentment?

1279
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:47.740
And so that's when you start to develop a strategy for,
you know,
and,
and it,

1280
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.090
there's actually an adventure in this too.
I mean,

1281
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.560
I've had a number of clients who have been in jobs that they didn't like it all.

1282
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.230
And you know,
they were tyrannized by someone for example,

1283
01:17:57.231 --> 01:18:01.430
and they were also working below their hypothetical level and we'd put together

1284
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.540
a plan.
It's like,
okay,

1285
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:06.770
you're going to make three times as much money in five years.
That's the plan.

1286
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:11.060
But like that's not going to be simple.
So there's education.

1287
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:14.000
You gotta educate yourself,
maybe formerly cause you've got holes,

1288
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:16.520
you got to fix up your resume,
you've got to,

1289
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.100
you've got to overcome your fear of being interviewed.

1290
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:24.290
You have to start sending out like 50 resumes a week on a regular basis and be

1291
01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:28.400
prepared for a 99% rejection rate.
You,
you're going to look for different job.

1292
01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:31.580
It's probably going to take six months to a year and almost all of that is going

1293
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:35.900
to be rejection.
And you got to steel yourself from for that and prepare.

1294
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:40.100
And maybe this is going to be a three year process.
It's no trivial thing.

1295
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:41.323
But you know,

1296
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:46.420
it's almost inevitably can't remember a single example where the consequence of

1297
01:18:47.751 --> 01:18:50.060
that very careful,
detailed,

1298
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:55.061
strategic thinking wasn't a massively substantive improvement in socioeconomic

1299
01:18:56.811 --> 01:18:59.740
positioning and a great movement towards,
uh,

1300
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.670
an improving trajectory.
And,
and,

1301
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.260
and there's advantages even along the way because even before that happens,

1302
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:10.790
the fact that you're taking genuine steps to put yourself in a better situation

1303
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:13.910
immediately starts to reduce your resentment,

1304
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:16.580
even if it isn't having positive consequences to begin with.

1305
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.920
But you have to be realistic about it.
It's like,
look,

1306
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.500
it's going to be hard to update your CV because you're embarrassed about it and

1307
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:25.280
you should be right.
It's no wonder you're embarrassed about it.
And then,
well,

1308
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.220
of course you don't want to go be interviewed because you're not very good at it

1309
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:31.280
and,
and there's holes in your story and,
and your,

1310
01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.550
and you can be made nervous easily and you're not a very good advocate for

1311
01:19:34.551 --> 01:19:38.370
yourself.
So there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done there.
And,
uh,

1312
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:42.410
and then you have to withstand the,
the,
the,

1313
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:46.430
the punishment of being constantly rejected when you apply for jobs.

1314
01:19:46.431 --> 01:19:50.600
Because the baseline rejection rate,
you know,
for the,
for the typical job,

1315
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:54.020
applicant is like 99%.
It's like the rejection rate for everything.

1316
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.730
Is this going to work?
No.
But if you do it a hundred times,
it might work once.

1317
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:02.960
That's all you need.
That's exactly it.
It,
you,
you,
you only need that once.

1318
01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.510
And so the truth there isn't to yell at your boss.

1319
01:20:05.511 --> 01:20:07.100
The truth there is to get your life together.

1320
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:10.350
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
play the game.</v>

1321
01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:15.660
You gotta play the game sometimes too to get a strategic win to me.
And that's,

1322
01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:19.080
and another interesting thing here is,
as I say,

1323
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.570
you don't want to surround yourself with yes men.

1324
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.860
When you're in a leadership position,

1325
01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.770
you also don't want to be your own personal yes ma'am.

1326
01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:29.310
That he just thinks you're great and agrees with everything that you're doing

1327
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:32.970
and,
and won't tell yourself the hard truth.
You know,
you can't lie to yourself.

1328
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.600
Everything.

1329
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.200
Every little one of those things that you've just listed off are the kinds of

1330
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:40.710
things that people just lie to themselves and say,
ah,
you know what?
Well,

1331
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.340
you don't really need that.
That person didn't learn anything in that,

1332
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.850
in that course.
Why should I go to it?
That you know,

1333
01:20:47.851 --> 01:20:50.760
it's like if you don't tell yourself the truth about what your,

1334
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:52.920
what your situation is,
it's going to be problematic.

1335
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:56.760
Just like if you don't have people on your team above you or below you in the

1336
01:20:56.761 --> 01:21:00.120
chain of command that tell you the truth,
that's going to be problematic as well,

1337
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.080
which is something which is something that's easier.

1338
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:06.250
<v 2>So the playing the game thing.</v>

1339
01:21:06.251 --> 01:21:10.150
So are you thinking about that as a consequence of necessary discipline?

1340
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.570
You know like cause cause there,
because it,

1341
01:21:14.571 --> 01:21:18.100
it seems to be you're making two cases at the same time,
right?

1342
01:21:18.101 --> 01:21:21.340
One is that you should obviously not undertake unethical actions,

1343
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:26.530
but then by the same token and you have to subordinate yourself to the realities

1344
01:21:26.531 --> 01:21:27.480
of the situation.
And,

1345
01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:30.700
and I think that that's psychologically true because you're always in a

1346
01:21:30.701 --> 01:21:33.460
situation where if you're in an organization,

1347
01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:37.120
there's kind of an arbitrary and tyrannical aspect to it because it's never

1348
01:21:37.121 --> 01:21:41.230
working perfectly.
And then,
and then there's the,
the positive aspect to it too.

1349
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:45.910
And so whenever you're doing a job,
it could be that you're,

1350
01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:49.530
you're called upon to do things that well,

1351
01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.350
what would you say that are unnecessary part of the operation of the machinery?

1352
01:21:53.351 --> 01:21:55.970
I guess that would be particularly true in military.
Every situations.

1353
01:21:55.970 --> 01:22:00.060
<v 0>And,
and let me give you these as well.
Just a broad example,
right?
Um,
you know,</v>

1354
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:05.061
my personality and my reputation is that,

1355
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.510
you know,
when I was in the military,
it's like,
oh,
it's Jocko.
He,
he's not gonna,

1356
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:12.240
you know,
he's,
if,
if someone tells him to do something he doesn't want to do,

1357
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:15.540
he's just going to say,
screw you.
We're not doing it.
We're doing it my way.

1358
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.370
You know?
Um,
I got the knock.

1359
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.610
But that was kind of the impression people would get from me.

1360
01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:22.410
If they didn't know me from the outside,
they think,
oh,

1361
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:25.490
this guy's a knuckle dragger he's just going to go forward.
He,

1362
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.350
he's going to make things happen and he's not going to listen to anyone else.

1363
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.480
That was the impression from the outside.

1364
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.320
The reality is you can't do that and,

1365
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:38.410
and be the reality is w w what my actions are,
I'd have,
you know,

1366
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.110
a young lieutenant would come to me and say,
Hey,
you know,

1367
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:42.000
my boss has to tell me to do this,
this and this.

1368
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.630
And what they think I was going to say is like,
Bro,
you don't do that.

1369
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:49.650
Stand up and you tell them,
screw you,
that doesn't make any sense.
And they'd be,

1370
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:53.430
they'd get this look in their eyes of,
of surprise when I'd say,
oh,

1371
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.900
your boss wants you to do that.
Do it,
do it.
Well,
play the game.

1372
01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:00.240
That's what I'm telling you to do is play the game because these things are

1373
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.290
meaningless.
It's some,
you know,
something is pathetic.
It's like,

1374
01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:05.830
oh you got to fill out a form a certain way.
It's like,
Hey,

1375
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:08.470
shut up and play the game.
You'll look even my,

1376
01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:11.560
so is that a matter matter of picking your battles?
It's,

1377
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.920
it certainly is a matter of picking your battles and you as cause that's part of

1378
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:18.250
strategy,
right?
It's everything can't be the war.
Exactly.

1379
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:22.420
And it's exactly what it is.
But you know,
a good example,

1380
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:26.680
and we wrote about it in,
in a dichotomy of leadership,
which is,
you know,

1381
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:29.980
my friend,
my guy that worked for me,
Leif Babin,

1382
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.540
we were getting told to do all this paperwork.
You gotta,

1383
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.110
you gotta fill out these forms.
You've got to,

1384
01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:37.480
you got to have a serialized inventory of everything.

1385
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:38.830
It's got to be signed off this many days.

1386
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:42.310
We need to know the qualifications of each and every person and when their

1387
01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:46.180
qualifications come up,
do and all these just ridiculous paperwork.

1388
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:50.920
And Lafe came to me and with,
with the other platoon commander guy named Seth,

1389
01:23:50.921 --> 01:23:52.900
he came to me and said,
Oh man,
this is bullshit.

1390
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.740
Why do we gotta do all this paperwork where we are here training for war,

1391
01:23:56.741 --> 01:24:00.210
we're getting ready for war.
Why we got to do this?
And you know,

1392
01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.210
life will tell you his expectation was that I was going to be like,
you're right,

1393
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:06.730
I'm going to go to the commanding officer and tell him,
screw this.

1394
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:08.500
We're not doing this stuff.
This is crap.

1395
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.030
We're trying to prepare because we were in training,

1396
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:13.390
getting ready to deploy to Iraq.
This is crap.
We're not doing this.

1397
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:15.730
And I looked at him and said,
oh,

1398
01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:19.480
we're doing all of this paperwork and not only are we going to do this
paperwork,

1399
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:22.180
we're going to do it better than anyone else and we're going to turn it in

1400
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:24.650
before it's even do.
And you know,

1401
01:24:24.651 --> 01:24:28.480
we both him and Seth were kind of taken a back then the fact that I wasn't

1402
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:33.710
standing up and saying,
we're not doing this,
our APP.
And then I explained to me,

1403
01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:34.690
here's what we're doing.

1404
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:37.480
We're building a relationship with my commanding officer,

1405
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:40.630
with a our commanding officer.
We're going to do these little things for him.

1406
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.530
We're going to play the game because at some 0.2 things are gonna happen.

1407
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.540
Number one,
we want to build trust with my boss.

1408
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.670
I want my boss to look at me and when he tells me to do it,

1409
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.350
to fill out paperwork,
he knows is going to be filled out.

1410
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.720
If he wants me to take down a building,
he knows it's going to get taken out.

1411
01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.930
If he wants me to execute a larger mission,
I'll go and get it done.

1412
01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.600
Where if I can't fill out paperwork correctly,

1413
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.520
how can he trust me to go on and on a real operation and have guys lives at
risk?

1414
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:07.240
So the idea is like,
hey,
we're gunna play the game.

1415
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:10.750
And I think sometimes people start to hear me,

1416
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:15.400
they start to listen to me and their first instinct is Jocko wouldn't put up

1417
01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:19.930
with them shit.
And that's why these,
you know,
they'll hit me up the same thing.

1418
01:25:19.931 --> 01:25:22.180
They'll write me an email,
they'll write me a letter and say,

1419
01:25:22.181 --> 01:25:26.250
here's the situation I'm in.
Um,
whether it's a boss,
whether it's a military,
it's,

1420
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:28.770
it's any of them,
whether it's their wife,
like,

1421
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.490
like my wife expects me not to train Jujitsu.
It's something as stupid as that.

1422
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:36.250
Like my wife won't let me train.
It's driving me crazy.

1423
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:40.840
It's really starting to bother me.
Why?
Why won't you?
Well,
what's the problem?
Hey,

1424
01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.940
have you taken her out for dinner?
You know what I mean?

1425
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:47.050
Like play the damn game a little bit so that you can win strategic.

1426
01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:50.860
And it's the same thing I think with your,
with the 12 rules where you're like,

1427
01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:54.580
hey,
tell the truth,
or at least don't lie.
It's like I get it.

1428
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:58.660
But there's a dichotomy in that statement and that is if you run around telling

1429
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:59.950
the absolute truth,
everyone,

1430
01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:03.230
it's going to be like that Jim Carey movie where he can't say anything that's

1431
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:05.100
not a hundred percent true.
And he's,
you know,

1432
01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.230
got a woman says good morning and he says,
you look fat.
You know what I mean?

1433
01:26:08.231 --> 01:26:10.100
It's like one of those like that marine not good.

1434
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.880
And so you got to learn to play the game.
And I guess again,

1435
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:14.721
going back to this book,

1436
01:26:14.721 --> 01:26:19.721
it's like that's a tough call to make in these situations.

1437
01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:20.960
How much do you play the game?

1438
01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:24.410
And there's an ethical line that you could cross at some point if I become a

1439
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:27.200
cappo,
hey,
you just,

1440
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:29.690
you played the game and you went too far with it.

1441
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:33.620
And just like in a leadership situation,
if I,

1442
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:36.120
if you're my boss and I'm just kissing your ass and do one under every t,

1443
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:38.470
my guys lose respect for me.
Yeah,

1444
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.720
my team will lose respect from me if you tell me to do something completely

1445
01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:44.090
stupid and I say,
hey guys,
that's what the boss says,
we're doing it.

1446
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:47.030
My guys will lose respect for me and I won't be,

1447
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.360
I won't be able to execute missions the way I should.

1448
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:54.530
If when the pushback is proper,
I say,
hey,
Hey Boston,

1449
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:57.980
that doesn't make any sense.
We shouldn't do that.
And I go to the guys and say,

1450
01:26:57.981 --> 01:27:01.670
listen,
I told,
I talked to him,
we're going to see what he says,
but trust me,

1451
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.090
if we have to do this,
we'll,
we'll figure out a way to make it work.

1452
01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.700
Because if you're just the guy that's totally on board.

1453
01:27:07.701 --> 01:27:10.420
If you're a brown noser right,
your P,

1454
01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.980
your guys will lose respect for you 100% they will.

1455
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:16.730
They will lose respect for you if you don't play the game at all and you'd push

1456
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.460
back on everything that your boss says you're going to,

1457
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:22.310
you're not going to get fire.
Yeah.
That's another ethical situation.
Like if my,

1458
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.210
if you're my boss and you told me to do something that's I don't believe in or

1459
01:27:26.211 --> 01:27:30.320
it's like a bad plan and I may I draw the line in the sand and say,

1460
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:33.290
screw you Jordan,
we're not doing it.
You can fire me.
You're like,
okay,
fine,

1461
01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:35.810
you fire me.
You get some yes man to come in.

1462
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.630
He takes my guys out on the mission and gets them all killed.

1463
01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:42.530
He didn't mitigate the risk properly.
It's better for me ethically to say,

1464
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.190
hey look Jordan,
I don't agree with this plan.

1465
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.280
I really wish we could do it another way.
Is there any way I could flex on it?

1466
01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:50.450
You say,
nope,
you're doing it this way.

1467
01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.380
It is better for me in many situations to say,
okay,
I got it.

1468
01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.510
I'll make it happen.
Indication of the complexity of the truth.
I mean,

1469
01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.240
one of the rules of thumb that I think is worth abiding by,

1470
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:06.500
and I guess this is something that makes me somewhat conservative in some ways,

1471
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:11.690
is that you should do what everyone else does unless there's a very good reason

1472
01:28:11.691 --> 01:28:14.060
not to.
And then I think that's,

1473
01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:18.860
I think that's the same idea that you're putting forward,
which is that if you,

1474
01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:20.900
if you do fight back against everything,

1475
01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:22.850
then you're just a rebel without a cause.
Right?

1476
01:28:22.851 --> 01:28:26.120
And you and you discredit yourself entirely.
And if you accept everything,

1477
01:28:26.121 --> 01:28:27.440
well then you're not even there.

1478
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:31.850
And so there's some judicious and analysis of the situation that helps you

1479
01:28:31.851 --> 01:28:34.280
understand when the time for action is right.

1480
01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:39.650
And most of the time what you're doing in life is you're doing what other people

1481
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:43.760
do and that's going along with the game.
That's part of being socialized.

1482
01:28:43.761 --> 01:28:47.210
But there's going to be times when the right thing to do is to break a rule and

1483
01:28:47.211 --> 01:28:51.230
to do it very carefully.
And so,
and if there's a,

1484
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:55.940
there's a,
there's a,
there's a scene,
I think this is a new testament scene,

1485
01:28:55.941 --> 01:28:59.360
but it might be in some of the Apocryphal,
right?
Apocryphal writings.

1486
01:28:59.361 --> 01:29:02.100
I don't remember.
So Christ is walking down the road on

1487
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.790
<v 2>the Sabbath and there's,
uh,</v>

1488
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.450
there's a ditch by the road and it's very hot.
And in the ditch there's a whole,

1489
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:12.660
and in the whole there's a sheep.
And so the sheep is stuck in the hole.

1490
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.020
And this Guy Shepherd is trying to get the sheep out of the hall.

1491
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:20.790
And Christ walks by and he says,
if you don't understand what you're doing,

1492
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:23.190
you're a transgressor of the law and your curse.

1493
01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:27.620
But if you do understand what you're doing,
then you're blessed.
So it's,
it's,

1494
01:29:27.621 --> 01:29:31.470
it's a perfect example of that.
A,
because it's,
it's like if you're okay,

1495
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:32.790
now here's your situation.

1496
01:29:32.791 --> 01:29:35.370
You're a shepherd and you're supposed to be taken care of that sheep,
right?

1497
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.790
But it's the Sabbath Day.
So you're not supposed to be work.
Now,

1498
01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:42.960
if you have decided you've thought this through,

1499
01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.280
you think it's the Sabbath Day.

1500
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:47.850
This is something that everybody needs because everybody needs to take a rest.

1501
01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:51.920
And this is a rule I shouldn't break because everybody needs to take a rest or

1502
01:29:51.921 --> 01:29:56.790
or things degenerate.
And I understand that and I have a lot of respect for it.

1503
01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.770
But I think that in this situation it's still morally appropriate for me to

1504
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:05.760
break that rule in this slight way and get this poor sheep out of this hole then

1505
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.960
well,
Christ's judgment was,
well then you're exactly on the right track.

1506
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:13.170
But if you're doing it carelessly and stupidly,
you're breaking that rule,

1507
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:16.110
then we are a transgressor of the law.
And you're cursed.

1508
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:18.990
And I think that's exactly at the essence of what you're describing.

1509
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:21.360
It's like you play by the rules,

1510
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.510
but then there's a Meta rule which is now,

1511
01:30:24.511 --> 01:30:26.730
and then you break the rules and you do that very,

1512
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:30.420
very carefully because when you break the rules,
you're breaking the rules.

1513
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:34.230
And the rules are what keep peace.
They,
they're what keep peace in order.

1514
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:38.310
And so you break them only in the service of a higher piece in order.

1515
01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:43.530
And so that seems to be,
and I think that's,
you see this in in well,

1516
01:30:43.531 --> 01:30:46.470
this sorts of stories that are influencing even the things that you're writing.

1517
01:30:46.471 --> 01:30:50.310
Like in the Harry Potter series,
for example,
Harry's,
um,

1518
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.960
friends and compatriots are quite disciplined.
Her Maya and he in particular,

1519
01:30:54.961 --> 01:30:57.300
cause she's an absolute master of her craft,

1520
01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:01.110
but they still break rules when it's necessary,
only when it's necessary.

1521
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:06.111
And that's what makes them more than the people who are just breaking rules all

1522
01:31:06.271 --> 01:31:08.190
the time.
The villains,
so to speak,

1523
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.140
and also makes them more than the people that are just being good by being

1524
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.790
conformist.
So you need that,
that touch of rebellious nus,

1525
01:31:17.791 --> 01:31:20.490
but it's gotta be a flavoring and not the whole diet.

1526
01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.710
<v 0>Absolutely.
I've actually talked about that on this podcast before.</v>

1527
01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:29.050
There's people in the military that they are like,

1528
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.120
men are rule followers.

1529
01:31:31.121 --> 01:31:34.450
These are people that have been following rules their whole lives and they've

1530
01:31:34.451 --> 01:31:36.930
got perfect grades and they were,
the team came,

1531
01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.130
they were all of these things and they're,

1532
01:31:39.131 --> 01:31:41.680
they're going to make really good solid leaders.

1533
01:31:41.681 --> 01:31:43.120
Like they're going to be great leaders.

1534
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:48.580
But then there's this like one group above them have that same thing,

1535
01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:52.210
but they also have that little bit of rebellion that they'll say,
you know what,

1536
01:31:52.211 --> 01:31:55.210
we're not doing that.
It doesn't make any sense.

1537
01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:00.150
And that is really a uh,
uh,
an important factor to have.
Yeah.

1538
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:00.681
<v 2>But you know,</v>

1539
01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.530
that's one of the reasons I would like this Guy Colonel David Hackworth,

1540
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.740
this guy was the ultimate rule follower for his whole career at the end in

1541
01:32:08.861 --> 01:32:12.340
Vietnam,
he did an interview and said,
if we keep fighting this way,

1542
01:32:12.341 --> 01:32:15.430
we're not going to win this war.
And they drove him out of the army.

1543
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:19.510
But that's,
that's the thing that,
cause all along the way,

1544
01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:21.220
there was other times where he do that,
you know,

1545
01:32:21.221 --> 01:32:22.330
his guys weren't getting taken care of.

1546
01:32:22.331 --> 01:32:24.060
He'd break a rule and bring them beer or he did you know,

1547
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:25.930
he didn't he do that along the way.
Not,

1548
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:29.530
not so far outside the bonds that it would jeopardize his career.

1549
01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:32.200
Because if he would do that,
then you're not in charge of these guys anymore.

1550
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:36.160
Now you're not going to have any impact in there.
So let's not get fired.
Right,

1551
01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:40.720
right.
Let's not get stupidly fired.
That's not an improvement.

1552
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.500
Exactly.
Well that's uh,
awesome.
Uh,

1553
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.350
I guess we,
I know you've got to go,

1554
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:52.650
so I can't think that we could get to a better little crust of the other or

1555
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.120
little capstone of the conversation then.
Right there.
Uh,

1556
01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.780
thanks for coming on again.
Hey,
my pleasure man.

1557
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.090
I'm glad we got a chance to talk about this book.

1558
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:06.040
This is a book that everybody should read and you,
I ordered the,

1559
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:09.580
well,
I ordered a copy of yours with the Ford from Europe.

1560
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.880
You can't buy it from Amazon here.
You have to buy it from Amazon.

1561
01:33:12.881 --> 01:33:14.830
So it will be here.
When will it be?
I don't know.

1562
01:33:14.831 --> 01:33:17.980
We're still negotiating the rights because the rights holders differ in North

1563
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:20.380
America and so that's the issue at the moment.
So,
okay.

1564
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:23.250
So I worked with an English publisher,
Penguin in,

1565
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.620
in the UK that that put out the,
I think it's vantage books,

1566
01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:27.670
if I remember correctly.

1567
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:30.310
I should just check and make sure that that's exactly right.

1568
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:34.630
Harper perennial modern classics.
That's not,

1569
01:33:34.631 --> 01:33:37.350
that's not the British won the British.

1570
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.920
The British one hasn't gotten to my house.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It has to be ordered.

1571
01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:43.770
It has to be ordered through Amazon UK.
And we're,

1572
01:33:43.771 --> 01:33:48.771
we're working on a couple of things maybe to also maybe get the audio rights to

1573
01:33:48.881 --> 01:33:51.550
the abridged version because I'd like to read it nice.

1574
01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.800
And that would be good so that people could listen to it.
And so because it's,

1575
01:33:54.801 --> 01:33:57.970
it's an absolutely necessary book.
Yeah.
And it's written actually.
What's,

1576
01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.760
I like it cause it's written very conversation.

1577
01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:03.550
I mean he's cracking jokes in there and he's making,

1578
01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.800
it's a brilliant piece of literature as well as,

1579
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:07.660
I mean it's a very readable book,

1580
01:34:07.661 --> 01:34:12.070
although it's unbelievably harsh and demanding and draining to read.

1581
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:14.020
But it's,
it's brilliantly written.

1582
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.790
It's an unbelievably engrossing read in,

1583
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:20.470
in the most horrible possible way.
But,

1584
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:24.280
and it is the case that it's written at this white hot pace.
You know,

1585
01:34:24.281 --> 01:34:28.930
it's like talking to someone who's righteously,
not self righteously angry,

1586
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:33.910
but righteously angry for,
for,
for,
for,
for dozens of hours.

1587
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:37.900
And he just can't believe the levels of outrage that are,
that are being,

1588
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.300
that are being so incredibly well expressed and so effectively expressed.

1589
01:34:45.521 --> 01:34:50.200
And,
and,
and again,
I,
I think it's also worth emphasizing the fact that,

1590
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:50.921
you know,

1591
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:55.921
Solzhenitsyn's real contribution in many ways was to lay the catastrophe at the

1592
01:34:56.141 --> 01:34:58.940
feet of the doctrine and not to say no,
this,

1593
01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.270
this wasn't an aberration because of Stella North in Oh,

1594
01:35:02.271 --> 01:35:05.330
Lennon being the great leader and then Stella and being the monster because

1595
01:35:05.331 --> 01:35:08.100
Lennon was plenty monster himself.
Um,

1596
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:12.110
and Stellan was the logical conclusion to lend and not,
not an aberration,

1597
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:16.340
but to say that no,
the horrors of what happened in the Soviet Union were,

1598
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:21.550
were implicit in the collectivists system utopian system that gave rise to the

1599
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:23.780
philosophy to begin with.

1600
01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:27.830
And that that's also an explanation why the same catastrophes occurred wherever

1601
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:31.730
the Soviet system was applied everywhere else in the world at something we

1602
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:34.490
really need to know.
I mean,
we fought a whole cold war over that.

1603
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.640
We put damn near put the world to the torch because of this.

1604
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:42.350
And the idea that these ideas are the fact that these ideas are creeping back.

1605
01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:45.440
It's really,
it's unbearable as far as I'm concerned.

1606
01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:50.090
So we'll hopefully people reading this book and the,

1607
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:54.080
the rerelease of this book with your forward will prevent that from happening.

1608
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:59.470
At least hopefully it will be a drop in a bucket that many other people can put

1609
01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:03.020
drops into as well.
And so I'm hoping,
I mean,

1610
01:36:03.021 --> 01:36:06.590
I think the book has sold 15,000 copies since the beginning of November,

1611
01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:10.660
which is pretty good for the reissue.
An old classic.
But like,
it,
it,

1612
01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:15.410
it's required reading for an informed citizen of the 21st century.

1613
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:19.460
It's not optional.
You need to know this material.
You're not,

1614
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.720
you're not,

1615
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.580
you don't understand your position in society as an individual or a citizen

1616
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:27.200
without knowing this material.

1617
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.350
So it's like not knowing about what happened in Nazi Germany.

1618
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:35.090
It's not acceptable to not know.
So read the book.

1619
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.430
Thanks for coming,
George.
Really good to see you again man.
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1620
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:39.740
you bet.
I appreciate it.

1621
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:46.400
<v 4>And with that Jordan Peterson has departed the recording studio.</v>

1622
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.600
And if you noticed that Echo Charles was not present during the recording with

1623
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:57.120
Jordan Peterson,

1624
01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:02.180
but through the miracle of technology and recording echo has now joined us for

1625
01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:08.280
the support portion of this podcast.

1626
01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.540
So good evening echo.
Good evening.
All right.
So,
uh,

1627
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.840
if people listen to this podcast,

1628
01:37:15.841 --> 01:37:20.841
which we appreciate and you want to support this podcast and support yourself,

1629
01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:25.590
there are ways to do that.
Echo can fill you in.
Sure.

1630
01:37:26.850 --> 01:37:31.410
So first way is when you're doing jujitsu cause we're all doing Jujitsu.
Yes,

1631
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.510
it might sound a little bit repetitive,
but to me when you do this,

1632
01:37:36.511 --> 01:37:40.410
you're going to be doing it every single day,
every single week at least.

1633
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.860
Even if you're doing the two times a week,
three to get it.
Either way,

1634
01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:45.270
you're gonna need a g and a rash guard.

1635
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.920
So there is no question which kind of Geeky you get.

1636
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:52.530
You get an origin gay,
straight up made in America.

1637
01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.480
I watched one of their videos yesterday and it's kind of an older one too,

1638
01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:05.070
but it made me like love origin even more because it's like you'll see,

1639
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:08.910
you know the people that make 'em and all the ladies there and then Pete like he

1640
01:38:08.911 --> 01:38:11.220
has like longer hair and stuff like that.
It's like,
Oh man,

1641
01:38:11.221 --> 01:38:14.940
this is kind of more the beginnings of origin,
you know.
Anyway,

1642
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:20.060
I thought it was good unless again made in America quality stuff for Jujitsu.

1643
01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:26.690
It's not like a blank geeky they get from over wherever some other place and

1644
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:30.750
then slap an embroidered patch on it.
And I say that no,

1645
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.840
this has made four digit two in America made in America from where where we

1646
01:38:36.271 --> 01:38:40.230
grow.
The material is grown in America,
woven in America,

1647
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:45.540
woven in Maine.
As a matter of fact costume woven by origin.
We,
we,

1648
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:48.330
we've it up there and make the best geese in the world.

1649
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.150
Also got some other stuff for,
you know,
you got t shirts,

1650
01:38:51.151 --> 01:38:56.151
you can get sweatshirts and also coming in 2019 jeans,

1651
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:04.140
denim origin denim.
I just call them jeans though.
Yeah,
yeah,
I dig it.

1652
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:07.650
That starts to like,
I dunno,
move towards a fashion thing.

1653
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.660
What if you see Denim Denim?
Well,
I feel,
yeah,

1654
01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:15.150
I didn't feel that material.
Yeah,
I feel like it's like origin denim,

1655
01:39:15.151 --> 01:39:18.690
they make it,
you know?
Yeah.
And then,
yeah,
they make origin jeans for sure.

1656
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.130
But what if they make like a Jean Jacket?
Like a denim jacket?
No,
that'd be true.

1657
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:27.870
But it's still be a Jean Jacket.
That's true.
Uh,
dig it.
Cool.
Either way.
Yeah,

1658
01:39:27.871 --> 01:39:32.400
that's,
and I don't get excited for jeans in general in life.

1659
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:36.990
Oh yeah.
Like you know,
you see it on TV.
I don't know.

1660
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:41.790
JC Penny has a sale,
you know,
black Friday or whatever and you know,

1661
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:45.020
some jeans I don't get excited.
Do you pride,
I'm assuming you don't need there.

1662
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:46.050
Maybe do,
I dunno,

1663
01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:50.940
but when Pete posts little like videos of the close,

1664
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:55.610
you know,
close up of the buttons,
the jeans come on Brown.
That's it.

1665
01:39:55.611 --> 01:39:59.220
That's kind of exciting.
I'm just saying either way.
Yeah.
Either way.

1666
01:39:59.221 --> 01:40:03.720
The also we have supplements to affirmative forigin labs,

1667
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:07.820
which is expanding.
Yes.
Yeah.
We bought another building up there,

1668
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:13.770
but yeah,
so they're making,
we are making supplements,
joint warfare,

1669
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.810
Krill oil supercrew oil,
by the way.

1670
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:21.090
Discipline that Tri Fecta.
Yeah.

1671
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.140
Yeah.
The My,
my wife went on a trip,

1672
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:30.690
didn't take joint warfare with her.
Yeah.
She's there for three,

1673
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:34.260
four days.
Her knee starts bothering her.
It bothers her the rest of the trip.

1674
01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.560
She comes home,
she goes back on joint warfare for three or four days.
Nice,
fine.

1675
01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:42.120
Again,
same.
Same.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
That's just a reality of it.

1676
01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:43.740
So join warfare,
good for your joints.

1677
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:45.870
Krill oil also good for your joints and good for your,

1678
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:50.850
if for your whole life system.
Is that a thing?
Life system life says yes.

1679
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:51.290
Okay,

1680
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:55.930
well that's good for that to discipline when you need that focus and also

1681
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.490
discipline go.
Yeah.

1682
01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.520
Which is my pre cognitive enhancement tool.

1683
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:08.890
Go to go to check.
Yeah.
It's funny,
the Krill,

1684
01:41:08.891 --> 01:41:10.540
I had the same situation too,
by the way.

1685
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:14.050
Krill oil and join Waterford didn't bring it by the way,
in Hawaii,

1686
01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:18.540
which is the reason why it didn't appear on this episode of the podcast.

1687
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.610
You know,
I saw my father in law came,

1688
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:25.120
I told them the story about how he'd always talk about Krill oil and he's just

1689
01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:29.650
sort of looking at me like whatever.
And um,
you know,
he used to tell me,
Oh yeah,

1690
01:41:29.651 --> 01:41:32.740
Krill oil is good,
good for you,
all this stuff.
And he said,

1691
01:41:32.741 --> 01:41:35.810
not listen because you know,
he's more of like a health dude.
He's nine.

1692
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.800
And then when you started talking about it,

1693
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:43.330
like literally the day you start talking,
right,
start taking it.
And he was like,

1694
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:46.180
he didn't care.
It kind of went right over his head and he was like,
oh,

1695
01:41:46.181 --> 01:41:50.560
so did you feel the difference?
You know,
like that's what he was concerned about.

1696
01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:54.670
What do you mean care respect?
Also on top of that,
he's got bulk,

1697
01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:00.100
which is,
which is milk basically.
That's what it is.

1698
01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:05.100
It's uh,
it has protein in it.
You mix it with milk.
I got her back.

1699
01:42:05.101 --> 01:42:07.150
I had to make that statement.
If you mix it with,
well,

1700
01:42:07.151 --> 01:42:09.700
you can mix it with almond milk.
You can mix it with coconut milk.

1701
01:42:09.701 --> 01:42:13.990
You can mix it with regular cow milk.
If you mix it with water,

1702
01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.520
it's not,

1703
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:19.060
I'm not jumping up and down about it and telling you it's the most delicious

1704
01:42:19.061 --> 01:42:22.180
thing in the world.
If you mix it with milk,
whole milk especially,

1705
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:25.240
I will tell you it's,
it's a,
it's a dessert straight up.

1706
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:29.500
It's a dessert that you will make you stronger if so,
you know,

1707
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:32.360
like hot cocoa.
You ever make hot?
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1708
01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:36.460
So I'm a fan that you can put in water,
right?
What do you put it in?

1709
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:39.420
Water and milk.
That is not hot cocoa to me.
Okay.

1710
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:41.170
I know what you're talking about.
You get the little,

1711
01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:43.270
the little packet that you're supposed to mix with water,

1712
01:42:43.271 --> 01:42:45.370
it's got the little crappy marshmallows in it.
Yeah.
That's not,

1713
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:47.970
that's a nonstarter for me.
Yeah.
So that's kind of the point there.

1714
01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.880
It's sort of the,
you know,
along the same lines where it's like,
cool,
do it.

1715
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:56.200
It's okay.
You can do it.
Yup.
And there's probably many,
many,

1716
01:42:56.590 --> 01:43:01.540
many people who do that and I'm not mad at them,
but you put the milk,

1717
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:04.390
that stuff and you know,
that's the good one.
That's my opinion.
And by the way,

1718
01:43:04.391 --> 01:43:08.080
you can't have,
you can't have hot chocolate milk.

1719
01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:13.780
It's good.
It's right up there.
She don't worry kid one.
Yeah,

1720
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:16.090
the surrogate mint chocolate peanut butter,
chocolate,

1721
01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:18.370
vanilla gorilla and the darkness.

1722
01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.160
And then there's the warrior kid mark,

1723
01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:24.970
which has a little bit less protein in it unless you double up on your scoops

1724
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:29.260
like I do for the strawberry,
cause it's a strawberry is ridiculously good.

1725
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.300
So give that a shot.
And by the way,

1726
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:36.280
all these things are available@originmain.com and that's,

1727
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:41.920
that's the state of Maine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not just main,
like the main spot.

1728
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:45.210
Even though it is a main spot check.
Cool.
Awesome.
Yeah.

1729
01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:47.390
Also if you want to represent,
you know,

1730
01:43:47.391 --> 01:43:51.870
get a discipline equals freedom shirt or a rash,
you know,

1731
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.180
get after it.
You know,
you want to represent the path,
go to Jocko,

1732
01:43:56.181 --> 01:44:00.350
store.com.
That's where you can get all this stuff.
Uh,
hoodies,
you know,
hey,

1733
01:44:00.351 --> 01:44:05.250
Christmas is coming up.
Let's face it.
There's no avoiding it.
It's coming up,

1734
01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:10.130
you know,
so you want to grab something that's a good place to grab something.

1735
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:15.350
Some new stuff on there too.
But yeah,
if you want to represent while on the path,

1736
01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:20.120
Jocko,
store.com good spot.
Also Jocko white tea.

1737
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:25.040
So these claims of dead lifting,

1738
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:27.680
8,000 pounds I haven't did lifted in awhile.
So it was like,

1739
01:44:27.681 --> 01:44:30.930
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to test it.
The cans,
right tea,

1740
01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.820
drink it straight up,
dead lifts,
dead lifts at 8,000 pounds.
Just like that.

1741
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:38.690
Just like that.
No warm up even know you don't need it.
It's real.

1742
01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:40.770
Or The warmup is drinking some Jocko white tea.

1743
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.670
That is the one you're warmed up and you're good.

1744
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:45.450
He thousand pound deadlifts or yeah,
that's the old,

1745
01:44:45.451 --> 01:44:50.451
this is the only product in the world in any capacity that guarantees 100% 8,000

1746
01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:57.770
pound deadlift.
Minimum.
100% but yeah.
So yeah,

1747
01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:02.220
you get them wet and the dry tea bags,
if that's your thing.
When you see Paul,

1748
01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.060
that's the word,
right?
Steep,
steep,
boom.
If you like that Gig,

1749
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:11.300
hot,
cold,
whatever.
And then the cans,

1750
01:45:11.301 --> 01:45:13.670
which I recommend I recommend they can actually,

1751
01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.220
I don't know if I'd recommend it,
but I prefer that I like them both.
Yeah.

1752
01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.180
Depending on the scenario of her boom,
there you go.

1753
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:23.800
Also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and stitcher and Google play.

1754
01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.450
Wherever you listen to podcasts is a lot of new ones out there.

1755
01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:31.760
There's little apps and there's a lot of podcasts out there and listen to a

1756
01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:35.660
bunch of them and one of them that you can also listen to in addition to this

1757
01:45:35.661 --> 01:45:37.550
one,
if you want,

1758
01:45:37.551 --> 01:45:42.551
you can turn up the warrior kid podcast that's basically directed at kids.

1759
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.210
But um,

1760
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:48.950
I'll tell you that uncle Jake has lessons for everyone in every podcast.

1761
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:51.260
And also we got the youtube channel,

1762
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.670
the youtube channel where you can watch this podcast in its full length and you

1763
01:45:55.671 --> 01:45:58.970
can see what people look like.
If you don't know what Jordan B.

1764
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:59.750
Peterson looks like,

1765
01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:02.510
if you don't know what Echo Charles look like or if you don't know what I look

1766
01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:06.650
like,
you can watch the,
the youtube channel and you can see all of us.

1767
01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:10.100
If you never heard,
if you've never seen echo before,
but you've only heard him,

1768
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:14.630
he probably doesn't look like what you'd think he looks like.

1769
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:18.530
Yeah,
allegedly.
And I don't know if that's good or bad enough.

1770
01:46:18.531 --> 01:46:23.060
That's a backhanded compliment or a backhanded like derogatory statement about

1771
01:46:23.061 --> 01:46:27.650
you,
about your voice?
Probably both.
Yeah,
a little bit of both but,
but we'll,

1772
01:46:27.651 --> 01:46:27.881
we'll uh,

1773
01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:32.540
suffice it to say that he's not what you expect when you see him in reality.

1774
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:37.900
And he also makes videos that are enhanced by imagery and music.

1775
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:44.840
Exactly.
And those are on there too,
so you can check those out.

1776
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:46.850
You can subscribe to the Youtube Channel.
Also,

1777
01:46:46.851 --> 01:46:51.720
we got the psychological warfare album and that has tracks on it of,

1778
01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:57.900
well there are of me telling you pragmatically why you should or should not do

1779
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:02.850
something like skip a workout.
You should not skip a workout.

1780
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:07.440
Eat donuts.
You should not eat donuts.
So just some little things like that.

1781
01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:08.071
You can check that out.

1782
01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:13.050
Psychological Warfare Echo claims that it has 100% effectiveness.
Yeah,
it does.

1783
01:47:13.690 --> 01:47:17.430
100% should you go to the gym?
Yes.
You should.
And if you listen to the track,

1784
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:20.370
you will go to the gym.
It's 100% effective.
And actually,

1785
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:24.090
I mean a lot of claims being made about effectiveness on this scenario,
right?

1786
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:26.100
Hey,
it's,
it's real.
It's real.
You know,

1787
01:47:26.150 --> 01:47:30.170
there's no double blind placebo tested it.
Well,
you know,

1788
01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:32.670
single blind maybe.
Okay.
Do you know what that means?

1789
01:47:32.671 --> 01:47:37.590
But that's not official and it is official when,
okay.
I,

1790
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:41.730
and I kind of,
I tried to psychologically analyze psychological warfare.

1791
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.390
Like why does it work every single time?
And here's part of it.
Even you,

1792
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:48.010
you know how like when you get hypnotized,
I'm not saying you should have,

1793
01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:51.050
I should have asked.
I should have asked Jordan this question.
Yes.

1794
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.680
And he did agree with this,
I think.
I think,
well maybe next let's,

1795
01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.320
here it goes bro.
Theory.

1796
01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.320
So you know,
like I'm being hypnotized.
For example,
you,

1797
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.420
I've never been hypnotized.
Yeah,
me neither.
So well,
but then again,

1798
01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:08.990
it's real and something happens to.
So have you ever said volunteer?

1799
01:48:08.991 --> 01:48:12.510
Did he admit okay,
me neither.
Same thing.
So hypnotism,

1800
01:48:12.511 --> 01:48:17.080
from what I understand is you have to like be,
what do you call like successful,

1801
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:19.350
open to it.
Open to it.
Yeah.

1802
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:24.240
So if you're a suggestible person that's like you have a certain kind of mind.

1803
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:26.700
And then on top of that,
even more consciously,

1804
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.970
you have to volunteer to be hypnotized.
A Guy,
I mean,

1805
01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:33.300
I'm sure there's methods that you can sort of hypnotize someone without them

1806
01:48:33.301 --> 01:48:35.160
knowing it or something.
But usually,

1807
01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:41.910
I shouldn't even say I'm sure,
but,
oh yeah,
that's right.
It,

1808
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.480
you can hit them dead zone and they are not.
Nonetheless,

1809
01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:49.290
usually the hypnotic sequence goes from,
hey,

1810
01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:51.660
you volunteer like conscious of,
yeah,
sure,

1811
01:48:51.661 --> 01:48:54.990
I'll be hypnotizing you sit there and your troop count to 10 and you're closing

1812
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:59.910
your eyes and breathing anyway.
So you consciously volunteer to be hypnotized.

1813
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:02.550
So you're open to being hypnotized and then blah,
blah,
blah.

1814
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.600
So psychologic warfare is like,
hey,
you recognize,
okay,
I have this weakness.

1815
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:09.600
I'm about to skip this workout right now.
You're basically saying,
hey,

1816
01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:11.020
I need help.
I need,
you know,

1817
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:14.850
I need a little spa volunteering for help volunteering yet it's not like I'm

1818
01:49:14.851 --> 01:49:18.510
like sitting in my room.
It's not completely against your will.
Exactly right.

1819
01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:23.160
You're not just busting in the door,
you know insane.
Hey,
don't skip the workout.

1820
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:25.530
Meanwhile in your mind,
you already committed to keeping,

1821
01:49:25.531 --> 01:49:26.850
the way it's different is you're like,

1822
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.740
you're not committed to skipping the workout.

1823
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:33.150
You just like are running the risk of skipping the work.

1824
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:36.060
You know that weakness just creeps in and you're like,
hey,

1825
01:49:36.061 --> 01:49:38.940
I see you weakness you're creeping in right now.
I'm going to get,
I'm basically,

1826
01:49:38.941 --> 01:49:42.870
I'm going to tell Jocko that you're in here and he's going to,
you know,

1827
01:49:42.871 --> 01:49:46.440
make you leave and you played that track or whatever.
You have it on your phone,

1828
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:50.620
right?
You had,
you have all your playlist on your phone anyway.

1829
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:54.190
You just play the psychological warfare one and boom,
you won't skip to work out.

1830
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:56.410
See what I'm saying?
Cause you don't want to skip the workout.

1831
01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.010
No one wants to skip the work on.
No one's thinking tomorrow.

1832
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:04.240
I cannot wait to skip this workout.
And that is not like that,
you know,
so it's,

1833
01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:08.260
you come in and you just give that little nudge.
That's why it works so good.

1834
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:13.090
It's true.
It's absolutely true.
I like it.
The less psychological warfare,

1835
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:14.590
it's very effective.
Hundred percent.

1836
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:20.100
Also while you're working out and if you're bored with your squats bench,

1837
01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.340
get some kettlebells from on it,

1838
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.080
in my opinion on it.com/jocko good stuff on their jump rope,

1839
01:50:32.081 --> 01:50:36.400
battle ropes,
kettlebells clubs may be careful of the clubs.

1840
01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:42.430
Costco,
I was watching a video of a guy doing this club routine.
I was like,

1841
01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:45.190
Dang it,
eat.
It took a lot of coordination.

1842
01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:49.030
Like I'm looking at it and he had like the 40 I think like a big one.
Yeah.

1843
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:53.500
I can't even imagine trying to do anything coordinated with the 40 yes,

1844
01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:56.960
because I only have the 20 yeah and yeah,

1845
01:50:57.130 --> 01:51:01.030
and they come off real a lot more heavy than they look like when you grab them.

1846
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:03.970
I mean,
at the end of the day,
if it's 20 pounds,
20 pounds,
no,

1847
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.500
there's no getting past that physically,
but when you pick it up,
it's like,

1848
01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:09.460
it's like,

1849
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.460
you know when you pick up your friend or your kid freaking and they weighed 70

1850
01:51:14.621 --> 01:51:17.860
pounds,
it's like I pick up 70 pounds with one hand.

1851
01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:21.880
It's no problem when it's a dumbbell should pick up your kid when they're 70

1852
01:51:21.881 --> 01:51:26.050
pieces of one hand can do it.
It's hard.
Unless that's how these clubs are.
Anyway,

1853
01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:27.190
so watch out for those.
Anyway,

1854
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:31.150
go to [inaudible] dot com slash jock we can get some really cool stuff on there.

1855
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:35.590
Really cool.
Awesome.
Hey,
we got some books as well.
First off,

1856
01:51:35.591 --> 01:51:36.424
Mike and the dragons.

1857
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:39.850
I know Jordan and I talked to about it a little bit today and it was actually

1858
01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:41.500
sold out for a little bit.

1859
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:45.580
It is now back in stock and have many,
many,

1860
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:50.410
many thousands and thousands of copies that are inbound that are being printed.

1861
01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:52.570
So if you want Mickey in the dragons,

1862
01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.810
go to Amazon and order it.

1863
01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:58.040
There's a little video on there if you want to know what it's about that echo,

1864
01:51:58.041 --> 01:52:01.870
but together and it's a,
it's,
it's a solid video from what I understand,

1865
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.840
the kids like to watch the video.
Oh,
you get like,
it's like a little mini show.

1866
01:52:06.841 --> 01:52:10.990
It's super fast.
It's two minutes.
And even even my kids,

1867
01:52:10.991 --> 01:52:15.820
so we're on,
I watched the video
send it to me.

1868
01:52:15.821 --> 01:52:20.440
I watched it like 14 times because there's a lot of elements in it.

1869
01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:23.620
There's a lot of things going on.
Yeah.
To my Saad,

1870
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:28.930
it's like a micro cartoon Kinda.
No,
it's like a micro movie.
Yeah.
Like,

1871
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:32.590
well it's a cartoon because there's illustrations.
Illustrations.
Yeah.
But yeah,

1872
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:34.690
it's fun.
We put it on the TV when I was in Hawaii,
you know,

1873
01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:37.430
you have smart TV and there you can put youtube on there.

1874
01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:40.030
I put on the TV and my kids are all jumping up and down,

1875
01:52:40.031 --> 01:52:44.490
like in the is if I have is,
you know,
it's two minutes long.
So,
no,
I,
you know,
uh,

1876
01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:45.920
Jordan and I were talking about it

1877
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.560
<v 0>and you know,</v>

1878
01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:52.220
obviously it's about facing your dragons and there's obviously a metaphor there

1879
01:52:52.221 --> 01:52:56.570
and it's a real true pragmatic,

1880
01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.460
simple to understand lessons of how to stand up and confront the world and

1881
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:06.461
confront your fears that little kids will clearly and easily understand and

1882
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:09.080
it'll leave an impact on anybody that reads it.
So Mike,

1883
01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:12.560
in the dragons that you can get that book on top of that,
if you've got kids,

1884
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:14.690
you can also get them to the way of the warrior kid,

1885
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:20.140
which is another book about a young kid who's going through the problems that

1886
01:53:20.751 --> 01:53:23.840
normal kids have.
And luckily his uncle Jake,

1887
01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:25.870
who was a seal in the seal teams,

1888
01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.640
it shows up for the summer and helps them overcome those problems.

1889
01:53:28.641 --> 01:53:32.510
And then that series carries on and another book called Mark's mission.

1890
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:36.860
You can pick those two books up and give them to whatever kids you those,

1891
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:38.480
those books.
When you read those books,

1892
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:41.660
you'll wish you had that book when you were a kid.
I know.

1893
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:45.440
I absolutely wish I had that book when I was a kid and I wish I had that book

1894
01:53:45.441 --> 01:53:47.390
when my kids were kids.
Yeah,

1895
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:53.220
because it teaches them what it is they need to know.
Period.
That's it.
Uh,

1896
01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.860
the discipline equals freedom field manual.
That book,
that's how you,

1897
01:53:57.930 --> 01:53:59.390
that's how you is.

1898
01:53:59.391 --> 01:54:01.790
It's just a field manual of how to be on the path of discipline.

1899
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:02.540
That's what it is.

1900
01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:06.440
Look at the path of discipline is not easy and there's no field manual for it.

1901
01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:10.700
Oh wait,
there is now there didn't used to be there.
Didn't used to be.
Look,

1902
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:12.710
I know discipline will help me.
How do I get disciplined?

1903
01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.550
Where does discipline come from this?

1904
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:19.610
None of that information was assembled anywhere.
I made a field manual for it.

1905
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.600
It's called the discipline equals freedom field manual.
It's not,

1906
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:28.190
it's not like any other book you've ever seen or read,
period.

1907
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:33.290
It's not,
but it's very popular.
It's great if you want it.
This is another thing.

1908
01:54:33.291 --> 01:54:37.430
Chris,
did you say Christmas is coming and this is a Christmas scenario,
right?

1909
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:38.900
This is a Christmas scenario.

1910
01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.910
Give this book to somebody that needs help or needs to stay on the path or get

1911
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:44.744
on the path.

1912
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:48.800
This book will be extremely beneficial to them or people that are on the path

1913
01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:52.970
getting after it.
This will keep them there.
So that's the field manual.

1914
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.250
If you want the audio version of that,
it is not an audible,

1915
01:54:55.251 --> 01:54:59.870
it's on iTunes and Amazon music and Google play as an MP3.
Also,

1916
01:54:59.871 --> 01:55:03.110
the first book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin,
it's called extreme ownership.

1917
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.880
That is a book taking the leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield

1918
01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:10.850
and translating them to your business and to your life.

1919
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.840
And then the followup to that book is the dichotomy of leadership,

1920
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:20.050
which takes those lessons that we learned in combat and goes granular in

1921
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:25.910
teaching you how to balance the various dichotomies that you experience as a

1922
01:55:25.911 --> 01:55:26.660
leader.

1923
01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:31.220
So both and all those books are available on Amazon and wherever else you might

1924
01:55:31.221 --> 01:55:36.020
do buy books.
Also,
we've got echelon front,
which is,
uh,
my leadership consultancy.

1925
01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.320
We solve problems through leadership.
That's what we do.

1926
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:43.620
And we work with companies all over the country and internationally.

1927
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:48.860
If you want us to come and align the leadership at your company for victory,

1928
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:54.980
then go to echelon front.com the we are do we have a leadership conference

1929
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:59.580
called the muster and we've done six monsters.

1930
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.320
We are doing three and 2019 we're doing one in Chicago in the spring.

1931
01:56:04.321 --> 01:56:08.700
We're doing one in Denver in the fall and we're doing Sydney,

1932
01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:10.980
Australia in December.

1933
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:14.340
So if you want to come to one of those events,

1934
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.490
all the events that we've done have sold out all of them.

1935
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:21.870
These are all absolutely going to salt sell out.
So if you want to come,

1936
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.610
go to extreme ownership.com and register and as quick as you can.

1937
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:29.190
And then lastly we have f Overwatch.

1938
01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:34.191
We are connecting special operations veterans and Combat Aviation veterans that

1939
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.060
are looking for work that are proven leaders that are experienced leaders and

1940
01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:45.210
we're connecting them with companies out there in the civilian sector that need

1941
01:56:45.211 --> 01:56:49.830
leaders.
So if you want to come at that from either side,

1942
01:56:49.831 --> 01:56:52.260
whether you're a vet or whether you're a company,

1943
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:57.500
go to e f overwatch.com to get in the game and if you have any more questions

1944
01:56:59.071 --> 01:57:03.960
for us or answers for us,
we are available on the interwebs,

1945
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:09.710
on Twitter and on Instagram and on the fee ease.

1946
01:57:10.610 --> 01:57:13.200
The bookie echo was adequate.

1947
01:57:13.201 --> 01:57:18.201
Charles and I am at jockowillink and I started out this podcast today pretty

1948
01:57:20.071 --> 01:57:20.640
heavy,

1949
01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.640
pretty rough and I think it's important to remember something that I always

1950
01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:31.590
refer back to and that is that evil does exist in the world.
It's out there.

1951
01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:37.520
And with that I'd like to thank all the military personnel throughout the globe

1952
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:43.280
that stand up to evil in the world and thanks to police and law enforcement and

1953
01:57:43.381 --> 01:57:45.450
firefighters and paramedics and EMT,

1954
01:57:45.451 --> 01:57:49.080
ies and correctional officers and border patrol and all the first responders

1955
01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:54.590
that stand up and face evil here at home and to everyone else out there,

1956
01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:02.560
if things are tough and I know they get tough,

1957
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:04.240
life is hard.

1958
01:58:05.890 --> 01:58:06.350
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1959
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:07.940
<v 0>But there's still reason to be thankful.</v>

1960
01:58:09.690 --> 01:58:11.700
Be Thankful you're not in the gulag.

1961
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.750
Be Thankful that you're not being tortured.

1962
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:19.920
Be Thankful that you have food to eat.
Be thankful you have a bed to sleep on,

1963
01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:26.810
and then do your best to watch out for those little seeds of evil that are

1964
01:58:27.871 --> 01:58:30.060
planted around you.

1965
01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:31.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:32.550
<v 0>Implanted in you</v>

1967
01:58:34.630 --> 01:58:39.630
and keep those seeds of evil in check by going out into the world and doing

1968
01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:44.344
good.

1969
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:45.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1970
01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.280
<v 0>And until next time,</v>

1971
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:51.000
this is echo and Jocko out.
