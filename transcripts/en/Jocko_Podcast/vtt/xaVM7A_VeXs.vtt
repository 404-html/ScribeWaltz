Lieutenant Air Corps,
James K Conkle,

6
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.470
United States Army Air Forces for extraordinary heroism in connection with

7
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:39.401
military operations against an armed enemy while serving as the pilot of a p 38

8
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.170
fighter airplane in a 401st fighter squadron 370th fighter group,

9
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.010
ninth air force in aerial combat against enemy forces on 16 September,

10
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.690
1944 during an air mission over Aiken,

11
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:04.691
Germany on this date while flying as rear man in a squadron on an armed

12
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:06.800
reconnaissance mission,

13
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.780
lieutenant Conkle noticed that his squadron was about to be surprised by a

14
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:16.781
vastly superior force of enemy aircraft on able to summon his leader on the

15
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.990
radio.
He alone on hesitatingly,

16
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
pulled away from his formation and vigorously attack the enemy immediately

17
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.300
destroying one of his aircraft.
In doing so,

18
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.110
lieutenant Conkle placed himself in a position to be attacked from rear and

19
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:33.944
above.

20
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.420
<v 0>When this attack materialized,
many hits were registered on his aircraft,</v>

22
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.620
which caught fire burning his face,
neck and hands.

23
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.760
<v 0>Despite his burning plane and the gunfire from enemy planes,</v>

25
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.800
Lieutenant Kunkel continued his attack against the vastly superior enemy force

26
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.950
and succeeded in destroying a second enemy aircraft breaking off combat only

27
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:04.150
when forced to parachute to safety.
When his left fuel tank exploded.

28
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.320
Second Lieutenant [inaudible] on questionable valor in aerial combat is in

29
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:15.550
keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflects great

30
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.260
credit upon himself.

31
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.310
The ninth air force and the United States army air forces.

32
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.413
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.723
<v 0>so</v>

34
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.900
that is a military citation for a distinguished service cross.

35
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:38.971
And this pilot also flew missions just after d day,

36
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.690
including armed reconnaissance flights and attacks on German trains and vehicles

37
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:48.364
and airfields.

38
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.430
And also this pilot flew close air support missions to help push Germany out of

39
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:59.710
France and drive allied troops towards victory.

40
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.140
And it is an absolute honor to have this pilot,

41
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.820
this hero on the podcast with us today.

42
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.750
Mr Jim Conkle,
sir,

43
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.660
thank you very much for joining us.

44
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.300
It is great to have you on more than book.
And you know,

45
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.860
if that wasn't good enough,

46
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.860
I am also honored to welcome back to the podcast.
Jim cankles friend,

47
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.240
fellow pilot,
another American hero,

48
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
Captain Charlie Plumb f four Phantom pilot shot down on his 75th mission in

49
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:50.251
Vietnam War and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

50
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.940
Captain Charlie Plumb,
sir,
welcome back to the show.

51
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.370
Thank you jack.
Oh,
nice to be back.

52
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.600
And for those of you that haven't listened to captain plumb the first time he

53
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:03.820
came on on the podcast,
just stop.

54
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.821
Now go to podcast number 76 a because that is a,

55
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.240
that is a whole incredible story of,

56
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.220
of his time in captivity.

57
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.020
It's detailed in the book that Captain Plumb wrote,
which is called,
I'm no hero,

58
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.000
but go back and listen to that and then you can return and you can listen to

59
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.020
this podcast.

60
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.910
But it was interesting because when we got done with that first podcast and I

61
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:35.110
was taking captain plumb to the,
to the train station,
which is,

62
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.140
which is odd in its own right,
to have the pilot to riding a train.
I don't,

63
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:41.890
I don't know if you'd approve of that to have the captain on a train,
but,

64
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.870
and he said,
hey,
you know,
I got this buddy,
you might want to talk to him.

65
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.120
And he said,
you know,
he's a World War II pilot fighter pilot and you know,

66
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:56.590
he's a B,
B,
a great guy to talk to.
And of course I said,
ah yeah,
absolutely.

67
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.010
So it took us a little bit of time but here we are and this is also the first

68
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:06.130
time we've had more than one guest at one time on the podcast and sitting

69
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:06.970
amongst you too.

70
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.230
My plan is to sit back and listen to you to talk about whatever you want to talk

71
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:16.190
about.
I've heard some of the stories and uh,

72
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.270
and actually interestingly the podcasts that just came out last week was about a

73
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:27.220
book called the men at Arnhem,
which detailed the,

74
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.000
the British participation in the in Operation Market Garden,

75
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.420
which started on September 17th,

76
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.010
1944 and as I was reading your say citation,

77
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.390
if you noticed that was September 16th,

78
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.880
1944 that you were,
that you were shot down.
And that's,

79
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.190
that's a right at the beginning or right,
right before that,

80
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:53.140
that operation took place.
Who afterwards the true.
Um,
uh,
of course.

81
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:58.010
So I missed it.
Um,
but I heard some very

82
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.780
<v 2>interesting stories later on.
Um,
uh,
I was picked up in a,</v>

83
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.490
uh,
uh,
evac hospital,
uh,
by the first,

84
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.220
well,
the first infantry division picked me up.

85
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.160
They saw my shoot and came out and got me and,
uh,

86
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.380
thank goodness it was never leave anyone behind,

87
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.540
so they didn't leave me behind and I thanked him profusely.
But,

88
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.310
um,
uh,

89
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.340
through the EVAC hospital to a general hospital and then a hospital train to

90
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.150
Paris and the train was completely full of,
uh,

91
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.420
casualties from the Arnheim operation.
So,
uh,

92
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.130
I wasn't too good a shape at that time to listen to the stories.

93
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.350
But later on in the hospital in Paris,

94
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:53.351
I heard some real horror stories about what went on up there and being a ninth

95
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.900
air force pilot,
uh,

96
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.270
we were working with the ground troops and we really appreciated what their

97
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.790
problems were and the difficulties that they had.

98
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.200
And we tried to help them in every way that we could.

99
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.560
So that was a,
uh,

100
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.770
there was a very trying time.

101
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.740
<v 3>So I guess before we get into all that at any greater depth,</v>

102
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.400
how did you end up as a pilot?
What,
you know,
how did,

103
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.510
how did you end up there in terms of where did you grow up?

104
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:35.310
And I know you grew up here and in California.
No,
I was

105
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.400
<v 2>born in Pennsylvania and new Kensington,
Pennsylvania.</v>

106
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:42.370
My father was a,
it was in the steel business.

107
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.060
And in 1932,
uh,

108
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.880
my dad passed away from injuries that he had received in the first world war.

109
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.790
And so we,
at that time,

110
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:59.791
he had retired from his business even though he was only 36 years old at that

111
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:01.264
time.

112
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.370
But we were coming to California and back.

113
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.270
We were pretty well packed and had closed the house and the whole works.

114
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:15.271
I'm nine years old and he went to the hospital in New York instead and passed

115
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:20.820
away.
And My mother,
um,
who,
uh,

116
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.250
didn't even drive an automobile at that time.
Uh,

117
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.080
I can remember her asking me,
do you want to go to California?

118
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.910
And I said yes.

119
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.750
And she took some driving lessons and bought a Chevy and we came to California

120
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:42.520
on route 66 when they were building it.

121
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.720
And so my mother prayed to her way.

122
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.630
<v 3>She tell a porn that I benefited.
She's a new driver.</v>

123
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:51.600
I bet she wasn't the only one that was framed,

124
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.230
<v 2>but even at nine,
I can still remember,
uh,</v>

125
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.640
she was driving and the,
an amount of taxes and I'm out portion.

126
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.400
So my mother was a very courageous woman,

127
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.400
no doubt.
So He,
um,

128
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.610
my dad had been very interested in aviation and I would pick that up and back.

129
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.180
Uh,
uh,
he used to do,
uh,
uh,

130
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.340
steel castings for,
uh,
Curtis Wright in,
um,

131
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.060
uh,
in Buffalo,
New York.
And we'd go up there and every,

132
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.650
every time we went on a trip,
and I'm six,
seven,
eight,
nine years old,

133
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.580
we'd go flying.
Wow.
We'd go for a ride someplace.

134
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.860
And so I picked it up at that time and,
and pursued it.

135
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.711
And then you,

136
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.810
you get out to California and that's where you go through high school and

137
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.800
whatnot.
Through high school,
I,
uh,

138
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.050
ended up in Beverly Hills High School and,
uh,

139
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.390
September,
uh,
1939,
as you know,

140
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.660
the war started well just prior to that,

141
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:08.340
I mean it was all the talk of Europe and the possible and the war.

142
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.090
And I decided that this is going to be my senior year and if there's going to be

143
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:18.090
a war,
we're going to be in one way or another.

144
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.980
And so I went out and joined the California National Guard.

145
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.980
Uh,
they,
uh,
they had a squadron,
there was based in Griffith Park,

146
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:32.240
California and it was,
um,

147
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.610
a bunch of a world war one pilots.

148
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:39.890
And we had some old biplanes Douglas Oh,
38,
uh,

149
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.280
observation aircraft,
uh,
open cockpit.

150
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.220
And some of the later ones had even had a canopy over.

151
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.110
And I,
um,
I really,
uh,

152
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.880
had been hanging around airports.
My mother was very helpful.

153
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:59.360
She,
this was before I had a driver's license.

154
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:03.960
He would take me out to the local airports,
grand central air terminal.

155
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.230
I'd spend the whole day Saturday out there and sometimes you'd even get a 10

156
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:12.690
minute ride if anybody had any money to buy gas with.

157
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.000
But I'm coming back to the guard a,

158
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.810
I spent a year with them and it was a very,
very interesting year.

159
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.470
The,
these fellows that were the pilots,

160
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:30.210
they were all mostly combat pilots from World War One.

161
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.110
And,
um,
I sat at their knee and,

162
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.240
and listened to all the stories from that.
Um,

163
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.770
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
of course,
if my idea was I was going to be a fighter pilot,

164
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.953
uh,

165
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I had friends at Lockheed and I knew about the p 38 and I decided that I wanted

166
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:56.740
to fly a Pete 38 wanting to go to England.
And um,

167
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.260
luckily it worked out that way.

168
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.290
<v 3>So what,
what year did you transfer from the,</v>

169
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.900
the air national guard into,
and how did you get a committee?

170
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.630
Did you get a commission?

171
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.010
Do you have to go to college and not have to go to college at that time to get a

172
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:09.970
commission to be a pilot?

173
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.830
<v 2>Uh,
actually,
uh,</v>

174
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.970
the guard was federalized and we went on maneuvers through to Halos,

175
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.413
Washington.

176
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.510
And we were attacking for Fort Lewis and

177
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.690
the guard.
We were the attackers and the,

178
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.000
we were up there for three weeks on the newers.
Well,
while we were up there,

179
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:39.001
we got notice that the air guard was going to be federalized and drawn into

180
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:44.350
active duty.
And it,
I wasn't 18 years old yet,

181
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.880
so I hadn't

182
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.920
<v 3>the have permission.</v>

183
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.210
Were you already a pilot at this to know I'm a gunner,

184
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.860
gunner
got airplane,

185
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.590
maybe go 150 miles an hour.
So,
uh,

186
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.770
but,
um,
no,
I was in the armament section

187
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.830
<v 2>and it was run by a sergeant white sergeant white kind of took me under his wing</v>

188
00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:15.570
and I got some pretty nice assignments out of it and I've learned a lot.

189
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.970
Um,
I got the flyer in the back seat and uh,

190
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.740
I'd go out on weekends.
You know,
we had duty once a month,

191
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.000
uh,
in the guard,

192
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.890
but you could go out on weekends and I'd worked at the airport and,
uh,

193
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.560
10 an extra flight in and the,

194
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.900
the pilots of the guard were,
if they knew you were interested,

195
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.060
they would take you under their wings.

196
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:45.860
So I got quite a bit of flying time and it's,
uh,

197
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.160
<v 3>for a,
you're 17 years old.
I was a 17.
In fact,</v>

198
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:56.161
I was 16 when I joined and I'm sure,

199
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.773
but

200
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.850
<v 2>you know,
this cut into my school,</v>

201
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.100
not the academics because I wanted to be,
uh,

202
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.120
uh,
air force pilot.
You had to be 21.

203
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.630
You had to have two years of college and I'm in 1940 and 41.

204
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.120
This is Devin,

205
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:21.870
pretty tight to do when we entered the war.

206
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.980
So I didn't really figure I was going to graduate from college,

207
00:14:25.981 --> 00:14:27.370
so I wanted to get in the,

208
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.610
the classes that would do me the most good if I could become a,

209
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.630
an aviation cadet.
And,
um,
it,
it all,

210
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.250
it all worked out.
Uh,
we,
um,

211
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:46.100
in the interesting thing was to me,
uh,
uh,

212
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.370
in April,

213
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.580
I took some time off on school and I went down and call it a job at North

214
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:52.700
American

215
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 4>aviation.
And I worked on the first 10 p 50 ones built.</v>

216
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.580
Uh,
I didn't,
Steven wants today on the line.
In fact,
one of the,

217
00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:06.350
of the original first 10 is in the museum at Oshkosh.

218
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.640
So some place within that airframe,
there's some of my work.

219
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.940
And,
um,
uh,
that was,
uh,
uh,

220
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.960
that would've been the summer of 1941,
uh,

221
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:22.761
September.

222
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:27.761
And I was going back to school and I become accustomed to all that money.

223
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:29.990
I've been making it North American,

224
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.810
we got 35 cents an hour when I started there,
but,
you know,

225
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.110
35 cents an hour.

226
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:41.111
It wasn't too bad because I worked alongside people that had two or three kids

227
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:45.530
and they're supporting the whole family on the 35 cents an hour.

228
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.200
Uh,
we had a little,

229
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:52.460
a labor dispute at North American and they raised it to 50 cents.

230
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.720
So we were really rolling in the cash.

231
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.230
But,
um,
in September,
um,

232
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.340
wanting to dip back to school,
but I enjoyed that didn't come.

233
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.660
So I went to Lockheed,

234
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.690
they had a graveyard shift and I worked at seventh in Santa Fe,

235
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:14.120
downtown Los Angeles.

236
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720
A Lockheed aircraft had taken over this big warehouse and they were building the

237
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:24.550
wings and the empanadas for the p 38.

238
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.190
And they're also building the wings for the Hudson bomber,

239
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:32.270
which they'd gotten this very large contract from,
from the British.

240
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.920
And um,
it,
uh,

241
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.850
I was there when the war started.
Actually I could,

242
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.970
I was there the night that they attacked Los Angeles and the whole place was

243
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.833
blacked out.

244
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.440
If you remember the famous story of the air raid on Los Angeles that I don't

245
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:55.850
remember that story.
Well,
he clearly,
actually,
I wasn't even close to being born,

246
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.740
neither was my dad.

247
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.100
But what happened when they attack Los Angeles?
When I miss out on us,

248
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.450
the probably the most logical story that I ever heard was it a,

249
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.820
a navy,
a PB.

250
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.840
Why flew over Los Angeles and somebody hit the panic button and all the search

251
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.730
lights came on.
And,
uh,
you could hear a,

252
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:24.230
an aircraft in the background probably from Fort Macarthur or someplace like

253
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:28.460
that.
And the whole Lockheed plant was blacked out.

254
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:33.490
So we sat there in the dark for about three hours while they fought this battle

255
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.350
with the,
with the unseen enemy.

256
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.620
And it of course made all of the newspapers.

257
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.650
It was a big story.
So,
uh,
uh,
anyway,
uh,

258
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.630
for World War Two started as far as the u s was concerned.

259
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.000
December 7th,

260
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.070
<v 2>uh,
right after that they,
um,
uh,</v>

261
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.710
they dropped the age limit from 21 to 18 for the aviation cadet program and they

262
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:05.750
dropped the,
the two year con a college,

263
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.860
a requirement to a high school.
And so,
uh,

264
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.840
I went down and signed up with about 300,000,
another guy

265
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:19.830
and

266
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.690
<v 3>offer,
I,
they,
there was that many people that wanted to be pilot.</v>

267
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.400
<v 2>Oh.
But they were thick.
Wow.
In fact,
um,</v>

268
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.590
uh,
I was quite concerned.
Um,
I,
um,
I signed up,
they,

269
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.880
uh,
have been in June.

270
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.970
I waited until September before they called me down to downtown.

271
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:46.740
Los Angeles swore me in as a private,
as a duration,

272
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.570
as a cadet,
and a thought,
well,
now I'm on my way.

273
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:56.571
Well then I went home and waited another four or five months before they called

274
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.010
us up.
They were,
they had so many people that,

275
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.430
and there was no place to put them and they were trying to build Santa Ana army

276
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.250
air base,
which was the induction,
uh,

277
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.680
area for a pork cadets on the west coast.

278
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.970
And they were just overwhelmed with it.

279
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:17.340
Didn't even have the barracks to put them in.

280
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So eventually I got called up and I went through in a little less than 10 months

281
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.420
through,
uh,
uh,
Santa Ana,
which is preflight,

282
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.320
uh,
went up to two,
Larry California,
uh,

283
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.790
for primary in Stearmans,
uh,

284
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.450
to Tex Rankin school in Texas had been a,
the aerobatic champion,

285
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.650
uh,
of the u s and so,
uh,
it was,

286
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.330
it was a fun school.

287
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.270
<v 3>So they,
so they,</v>

288
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.820
they hired the best civilian pilot and had him come out and train you guys?

289
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.860
That's correct.
In fact,
a texts actually owned that operation.
They,

290
00:19:57.861 --> 00:20:00.800
um,
they appointed most of the primary was,

291
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.850
<v 2>uh,
we're a private enterprise.</v>

292
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.970
There were set up by the air force for Cadet training in primary in the primary

293
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:15.290
basis.
And so,
uh,
you,
you went through,

294
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.330
but I got about 60 hours.

295
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.570
I flew the Stearman and we have behind us our competitor,

296
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:25.100
but this aircraft was used mainly on the east coast.

297
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.040
We didn't see many of them out to California.

298
00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:32.870
We had Stearmans and Ryan's and on the west coast,
um,

299
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.590
got through primary,
uh,
went to basic,

300
00:20:36.591 --> 00:20:39.770
now we're on a military base and the,
I went to Lemoore,

301
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:43.760
California and that was one of the largest,
um,

302
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.120
uh,
air force

303
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.980
<v 4>army air corps basis.
Uh,</v>

304
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.270
and it's just on final,

305
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.790
you can still see the hangers and everything.

306
00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:02.100
The final at Lemoore naval air station,
you can still see all the hangers,

307
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.560
uh,
from,
um,
from our old base.
Wow.
But,
um,

308
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.260
got through basic,
went down to Williamsfield,
Arizona.

309
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.580
And uh,
that brought me closer to the p 38.

310
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.820
Most of the [inaudible] came out of Williamsfield,
uh,

311
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.520
just south of Phoenix.
And from there,
uh,

312
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.400
we were on a fast track and we weren't quite sure why we were on this big fast

313
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.670
track,
but all of a sudden we get 90 days.

314
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.460
I got to fire the guns once in the [inaudible] uh,

315
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:40.930
one gun.

316
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:45.250
We had four 50s in the 20 millimeter in the nose and they let us flour.

317
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:50.251
One of the fifties a all of a sudden we're on a train going to the east coast

318
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:55.560
and we're heading for England.
Wow.
When you went,

319
00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.730
<v 0>you said you wanted to fly out a p 38 and yet you had worked on the [inaudible]</v>

320
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.720
ones.
What was the deciding factor that made you want to fly a p 38 instead of a

321
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:06.280
[inaudible]

322
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.960
<v 4>one?
The piece 38 was the high altitude fighter.
Yeah,
it was,</v>

323
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.030
uh,
it was probably,
it was our first,
uh,

324
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.510
real combat aircraft.

325
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.710
The [inaudible] was a stop gap airplane did very well.

326
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.920
He's 39,
didn't do well at all.
Um,

327
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.300
the 38 was the only high performance airplane.

328
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:32.850
We had to peep 51 at the time that I worked on,
it was a low altitude airplanes.

329
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.750
Got An Allison engine and anything above 11 to 12,000 feet,

330
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:42.700
you are,
you're out of power.
So,
um,
uh,

331
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:45.420
the 51 was going to be a,
um,
a,

332
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.480
a low altitude British used aircraft and that's what they wanted extremely fast

333
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.150
and they used it for,
uh,
a tactical work.

334
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.310
And,
um,
so that as far as I wanted to be an air aerial combat,

335
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.120
I wanted to be a fighter pilot and shoot down a bunch of airplanes.

336
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.843
So,

337
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.060
so I stuck with the 38 and of course I didn't realize the British were footing

338
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.370
the Merlin engine in the peak 51 about that time.

339
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:22.240
And we were going to get the greatest air to air combat airplane of the war.

340
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:23.720
But um,

341
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.000
<v 0>yeah,
the,
I guess that's what threw me off was cause you know,</v>

342
00:23:26.001 --> 00:23:29.420
I always thought of the p 51 as being,
as being,
you know,

343
00:23:29.421 --> 00:23:33.770
the best air to air combat aircraft of the war.

344
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.790
But I didn't realize that it had gun didn't get there immediately and it had to

345
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.850
get there in stages.
So that,
that,
that makes sense to me now.

346
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.351
<v 4>Yeah.
Well,</v>

347
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:45.920
they did come and stages and plus the fact that when they did get the Merlin

348
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:50.921
engine that went to the eighth air force and the airports had the greatest por

349
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.540
group and the whole world,
uh,
they,

350
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.490
they,
uh,
uh,
they had access to all the newspapers.

351
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.120
They got all the publicity,

352
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.420
the people 51 was the greatest airplane in the whole world.

353
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:11.050
The poor old p 38 had been more soldiering from early 1942 in the Pacific on to

354
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.150
North Africa.
And uh,

355
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.190
in doing well all the way and no matter what you ask it to do with it,

356
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.900
<v 2>to do it.
So,
um,</v>

357
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.100
I was still a [inaudible] the uh,
Fan,

358
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.330
I got to England and I had um,

359
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.820
great interest

360
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.210
<v 4>in aerial combat.
Uh,
there was a fellow by the name of Screw Ball Berlin,</v>

361
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.300
who was an raf pilot and he was one of the greatest deflection,

362
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.220
<v 2>uh,
shooting experts in the,</v>

363
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.680
in combat.
I've just

364
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.410
<v 4>was the hero of Malta.
They are.
So you said the greatest,
what?</v>

365
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:58.460
Deflection.
Deflection,
shooting w which is what does that,

366
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.570
that means that the,

367
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.990
<v 2>when you're coming in on an aircraft,
if you're on his tail,</v>

368
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:11.250
you've got zero deflection.
If he's in a turn,

369
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.320
now you've got to move the know that your,

370
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.440
your aim point out in front of that airplane.
Got It.

371
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.030
And you've got what they called a hundred mill site,
uh,
uh,

372
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.050
which was,
I've forgotten now I guess,

373
00:25:25.051 --> 00:25:29.190
but it was about so many inches per thousand feet.

374
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.760
And,
and radio you'd say is your,

375
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.330
if you're in a 30 degree turn,

376
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:41.420
you might put one radio or radio high on half in front of him and it's all

377
00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:45.930
eyeball a 90 degrees.

378
00:25:45.931 --> 00:25:50.790
You're out maybe seven or adi way out here.
And so,
uh,

379
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:51.860
uh,

380
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.860
that's the flection shooting and all this is before we got the Gyro site,

381
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.880
which we never gotten a p 38,
but the 51,
Scott,
the gyros site,

382
00:26:02.881 --> 00:26:06.110
the computed that for you.
So you'd put the,

383
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.460
the size of the airplane would be put into the site by a little slide,

384
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.590
uh,
uh,
clearing,
not adjusted your site,

385
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.500
uh,
on your reflector.

386
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.100
And so then you'd put the pepper right on the aircraft and the site with compute

387
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.070
got it.
The uh,
the lead necessary to hit it.

388
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.980
So,
uh,
anyway,
I had studied those angles off,

389
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.250
you know,
an hour before you go to sleep,
after you go to bed,
you,

390
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.980
you're doing computations on how many,
uh,
uh,
Ray,

391
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.840
I lead what position,

392
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.160
whether you're going up or going down or sideways or whichever way you want to

393
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:54.270
go.
But,
um,
I'll,
I'll set for a combat.

394
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:57.000
I get to England and

395
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:03.080
all of a sudden I'm in the ninth air force and now this is the,

396
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:08.220
the mud air force and the support of the ground troops and,

397
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:13.020
and uh,
all operations,
usually at fairly low altitude.

398
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.720
So you're calling them the mud air force,
is that what you're,

399
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:16.810
is that what you said?
Yup.

400
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.370
And that's just to debts delineating that these guys are working with the ground

401
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:24.640
troops and you're flying low and the dream of aerial combat is not so much their

402
00:27:24.641 --> 00:27:25.474
ranking.
That's right.

403
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
Eight Air Force is the glamour force has got the old guys must've been,

404
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.220
uh,
all ears though.
I mean you talked about screw ball,
but,

405
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.220
but the RAF pilots that had fought the battle of Britain,

406
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:42.870
I mean d will you guys getting lessons learned from them and and where you were

407
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:47.070
they actually directly teaching you guys at all?
Uh,
they talked to us.
Uh,

408
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.050
we didn't have any formal instruction from them,
uh,

409
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.440
conversations and usually at the bar,

410
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.870
at the old club or officer's club,
we called it.
Uh,
I got two,

411
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.220
two good points.

412
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.690
The old RF sergeant who had flown in the battle of Britain told me that if you

413
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:11.040
have a jury on your tail,
do something violent.
He said,

414
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:13.890
doesn't make any difference what it is.
Just make sure it's violent.

415
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.770
And the second thing was keep your eye on his,

416
00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:22.430
his exhaust because that's your first indication you're going to get of what,

417
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.760
what he's trying to do.
And um,

418
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.420
I thought those were two good points.
And I used them a couple times.
Yeah,
the,

419
00:28:31.421 --> 00:28:32.430
the violent piece.
I mean,

420
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:36.810
you could apply that to really many situations in life where,
you know,

421
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:39.900
we see people in there,
they're in a bad position in life.

422
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.750
They need to do something violent to move out of that situation,

423
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.080
sit there and wait for something to unfold.

424
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.920
That was not only air combat that went a,
yeah,

425
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.770
and that's interesting about watching the exhaust because you'd see a change in

426
00:28:54.771 --> 00:28:54.890
that,

427
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.440
like a plume come out of the exhaust or you'd see the exhaust cut off and you'd

428
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.420
know what type of maneuver and they were going to do.

429
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.510
He's trying to pull a fast one and yanked the power off new overrunning money

430
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:09.620
shoot you down.
So,

431
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.490
but the mother forest is a,
that came along,
um,

432
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:19.050
we began to realize just how much help we were to the ground forces and,

433
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.140
and it was pretty primitive

434
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.500
covering a lot of area here in the big then we'll roll really short time.

435
00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:31.920
But uh,
you know,
we,
we had,

436
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.110
we had no navigational radio.

437
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.850
We can have four channel VHF.
Uh,

438
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.090
that meant that usually could talk amongst the squadron,

439
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:46.950
but the word was don't be a near eight squadron.

440
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.930
Don't talk on the art Rt.
They off.

441
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:56.290
<v 0>We had that same philosophy and all my seal platoons and seal task and stay off</v>

442
00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:58.340
the radio.
Yup.

443
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.970
<v 2>And,
um,
now you're trying,
you know,
we're doing ground support.</v>

444
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.650
Uh,
they'd give us a coordinates on the chart.

445
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.610
Now you could go and go out and find it and it's all ball.

446
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.130
So when you're eyeballing the ground and you're looking for ground targets,

447
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.470
you're wide open and you're six,
six o'clock position.
So,

448
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.003
uh,

449
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.380
<v 0>would you fly with multiple people or multiple aircraft?</v>

450
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:31.630
So someone had the duty of watching the rear?

451
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.120
<v 2>Uh,
yes.
Uh,
we did.
And in fact,
that's a,</v>

452
00:30:35.121 --> 00:30:38.990
I got to duty several times.
Um,
what we,

453
00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.220
we did,
uh,
we usually Plu as a squadron.

454
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.030
Sometimes we'd fly as a group with three squadrons.

455
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.320
Usually we try to put up at least 12 aircraft as a squadron of Max would be

456
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.720
maybe four flights of course 16.
And so,
uh,

457
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.580
to,
to answer your question about,
um,
uh,

458
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.620
you know,
being attack from the rear and so forth.
And the six o'clock,

459
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:15.070
the Germans developed the tactic against the tactical aircraft,

460
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:20.390
which we were,
and they would,
they started vectoring,
uh,

461
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.980
they're fighters in,
uh,
with ground control radar.

462
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.990
And your first indication was all of a sudden you had a swarm mood,

463
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.900
uh,
enemy aircraft that you six o'clock.

464
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.840
And in early August of 44,
um,
one of our sister,

465
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:44.090
uh,
groups [inaudible] ninth air force,
uh,

466
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.010
lost a half a squadron,
just they got hit and they,

467
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:53.110
they were surprised.
And,
um,
so we thought,
well,

468
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.740
boy,
we better,
we better do something about that.
So we started putting,
uh,

469
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.690
a couple of experienced people instead of putting your,
your first

470
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.490
mission fellow in the rear end purple heart corner,

471
00:32:07.491 --> 00:32:11.930
we called it and let him drag along way.
We thought,
well,

472
00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:16.000
let's put somebody back there that's going to have a little experience in the

473
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:16.834
way.
And,

474
00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:22.270
and so we did that and I drew one of the first missions back there and,

475
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.510
and sure enough,
her,
they came and,
uh,

476
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.600
I spotted them and called the break and made the break who squatter and kept on

477
00:32:33.531 --> 00:32:34.510
going.
And the break

478
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.060
<v 0>is you're saying,
Hey,
I'm going to break off from the squadron right now,</v>

479
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:40.970
or someone needs to come with me or we to face this other issue over here.

480
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:43.400
We got a bunch of enemy aircraft coming.
That's what,

481
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:46.520
that's what calling the break is.
Call your break and know when you call them,

482
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.600
<v 2>break the whoever's spot of the are crap leads work because you don't want to</v>

483
00:32:52.211 --> 00:32:55.360
lose them.
You can't take it.
Do you see them?

484
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:58.450
You got to keep your eye ball on them or you're going to lose them.

485
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.860
And so you make the,
you call the break,

486
00:33:02.861 --> 00:33:07.270
you make your break into them from whatever position they're coming from the

487
00:33:07.271 --> 00:33:09.340
squadron,
then we'll break with you.

488
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.450
And so all aircraft are now turning into the enemy.

489
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:19.380
And probably I'm an experienced air to air combat group.

490
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.830
That was just the normal CGIAR,
our ninth air force guys.

491
00:33:26.831 --> 00:33:31.510
We didn't do much of this.
And so,
um,
uh,

492
00:33:31.511 --> 00:33:33.670
when I'm called,
I called the break,

493
00:33:33.671 --> 00:33:38.671
I made the break and all of a sudden I'm by myself and squadron kept on going.

494
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.110
And now,
whether they didn't hear me or whatever,
I,
I have no idea.

495
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.740
So all I had was a couple of [inaudible] w one nine these and the around circle

496
00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:55.481
sitting on a flat wing and all lit up 20 millimeters.

497
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.610
And we're doing,
we got into a pretty tight turn and,

498
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:04.230
and all of a sudden I lost him in the turn and I'm looking at my six o'clock and

499
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.830
you might've been facing backwards.

500
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.020
We've been a lot easier,

501
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.790
but I turned around front and in my gun gunsight here's the depth,

502
00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:19.800
w one 90.

503
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:24.340
I mean I'm on top of it and he

504
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.760
apparently spotted me about the same copy I think I fired a burst at,

505
00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:34.540
and I'm not even sure,
but he did a flick role so quick,

506
00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:37.870
but I literally,
he just flicked,

507
00:34:37.871 --> 00:34:41.920
rolled out of my peak 30.
It wouldn't do that.
The early ones,

508
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.211
uh,

509
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:48.211
the later ones had aileron boost and they would actually could perform that fast

510
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:51.940
rule,
right.
A role.
So he,
um,

511
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.810
he got away from me and I was in a perfectly wonderful shot physician to

512
00:34:58.361 --> 00:35:03.340
shooting down.
Um,
so that was our first encounter.

513
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.680
And the second encounter was the one where you would read the citation.

514
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.820
I made the break.
Nobody came with me and I have more than I could have him.

515
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.400
<v 0>What do you mean when you,
before we get to that one,</v>

516
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.930
when you were doing close air support for troops on the ground and you had four

517
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.520
radio nets that you could be on,
would you be talking to the guys on the ground?

518
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.800
<v 2>Uh,
yes,
in some,
some.
Sometimes you could,</v>

519
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:33.780
you'd be under with the controller.
Now the,
uh,

520
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.190
the ninth air force was a mainly 40 sevens.

521
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.560
We had one group of p 50 ones,

522
00:35:39.561 --> 00:35:44.350
three 54th than they had been the pioneer group with the Merlin power,
uh,

523
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.540
51,
but they ended up in the ninth air force.

524
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:52.890
But usually they were used with the eighth air force for the escorted the

525
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:57.660
bombers.
But,
um,
so the majority,

526
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.310
ninth air force was a big air force.
We had a lot of fighter groups.

527
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:05.550
I've forgotten now how many we actually have,
but most of them were,

528
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:09.370
p 47th and 47 was a great,
um,

529
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.750
aircraft for close support.
And,
um,

530
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.920
uh,
we had four groups of Pete 38 s in the thing.

531
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.200
So most of the close support work was done by the [inaudible] in a real max

532
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:30.650
effort.
We were used as close support,
but,
uh,

533
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:35.010
the p 47 was a very short range.
Uh,

534
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.220
38,
we had a lot of range.
We could carry a,

535
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:43.550
a larger bomb load than either the 47 and the 51 actually of the 38 could carry

536
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.940
two,
2000 pound bombs.

537
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:53.410
That's 4,000 pounds and that's Europe in be 17 country with that.

538
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.100
So,
um,
uh,
we couldn't always get them.

539
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.190
Usually we can find some thousand pound,

540
00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:05.960
but normally we'd carry it five hundreds.
Um,

541
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.960
I like that the thousand because the bigger the bangs,

542
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.600
the less chance you have to go back and do it again.

543
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.200
And when you went back to do it again,
they're waiting for him.

544
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.060
Up until that point.

545
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:23.900
That was kind of your primary mission then was going in and hitting railway

546
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:28.070
stations or fat munitions factories,
armed reconnaissance,

547
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.150
anything that moved.
And if you couldn't find anything,
you moved,

548
00:37:32.151 --> 00:37:36.140
you try to shoot the Angela insulators off the high tension lines.

549
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.410
So any,
anything you could get.
Um,

550
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.470
we,
uh,
there was,

551
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:48.210
there was no problem finding targets and different from the eighth air force.
Um,

552
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:54.120
uh,
we were over the target area,
uh,
in a relatively short time.

553
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:58.020
So,
uh,
uh,
they were shooting at you most of the time.

554
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.240
How long did you,

555
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.210
how long did you arrive in England before d day actually happens?
Uh,

556
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.820
just a short time before detail and I've forgotten the exact date that we did

557
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:09.930
arrive in England.

558
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.820
And had you flown missions before d day snorted?

559
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:19.850
No.
So your first missions were action right there and the 38,

560
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.780
because they were so easy to recognize in the air.
Uh,

561
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.370
we were assigned the channel.
Uh,
we,

562
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.300
we flew top cover for the channel,

563
00:38:31.301 --> 00:38:36.250
all the shipping and everything between England and the beach head.
And,

564
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.000
uh,
we,
at that time,

565
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:45.001
it became very apparent that the reason we had been rushed into two training

566
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:50.980
into England was the anticipated,
uh,
heavy losses.

567
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:52.420
Uh,

568
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.420
we expected the Luftwaffe to really show during the invasion.

569
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:02.640
They didn't,
I've been to bread that there were just the,

570
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.850
I think they had two sorties over the beachhead on d day,

571
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:12.420
and we anticipated that there would be a larger effort against the channel with

572
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:16.360
all the shipping.
I mean,

573
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:20.560
you could probably walk across the channel with a number of ships.

574
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.910
Uh,
there were,
there,
um,
this tremendous target.

575
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.240
The fourth didn't show up.
So,
uh,

576
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.430
most of the,
like my group,

577
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.080
the Uja missions were pretty boring.

578
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.960
W when you were,
when d day was about to go,
I mean,

579
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:45.970
it's every single person.

580
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.590
You guys must have absolutely known that what you were about to do was that was,

581
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:50.860
you know,

582
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.860
going to be that one of the most epic undertakings of the modern history all.

583
00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.700
Yes,
it was 100%.
You guys all knew that.

584
00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:05.020
And it was every little by road in England,

585
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:09.580
those jammed with equipment.
And you know,
it's funny,

586
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.760
uh,
coming back through,
uh,

587
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.920
some of the things we hear today about our country,
uh,
in,

588
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:23.530
in 1940,
41,
uh,
I,
well,

589
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:28.150
1940,
I was up in Chehalis,
Washington and we were flying.
Uh,

590
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:33.810
there was a whole,
Oh,
38,
we had two brand new airplanes from North American.

591
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:37.930
Oh,
47th had a thousand horsepower.
Great aircraft.

592
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.900
Not worth a damn and combat.
But,
uh,

593
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.800
we,
uh,
we knew that we were again,
working with the,
uh,

594
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.340
with the ground troops and we would fill a little paper sacks with white flour

595
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.550
and that was our bombing.

596
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:03.030
We'd attack them what to bridge head and throw toilet paper out and these little

597
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:09.031
sacks full of flour and a few drape toilet paper over a bridge on then the

598
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:13.360
squally river.
The infantry couldn't use it anymore,

599
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:16.240
so they had to get across the river some other way.

600
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.950
And mortars,

601
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.260
a cross two by fours served as a mortar,

602
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.910
um,
cavalry on horses.
They got lost.

603
00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:31.360
We had to go look for him.
Now,

604
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:36.361
that's the 1940 in June 44 as far as you could see as American made equipment,

605
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.840
everything.
Not only what we were carrying,

606
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:49.841
but we supplied the British and everyone else this magnificent effort by this

607
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:55.460
magnificent country.
And you just,
it's unbelievable.

608
00:41:55.461 --> 00:42:00.050
When you think back,
uh,
just before d day,
as I say,

609
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.003
every,

610
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:05.330
every little road was jammed with stored equipment.

611
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.750
Can't imagine that's the one of the island didn't sink,

612
00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.560
<v 3>but,
uh,
no,
I,
I've actually,
I out on a recent podcast,</v>

613
00:42:14.561 --> 00:42:19.070
I was talking about the fact that many of American,
or,

614
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.890
or at least as much of America's victories in many cases that have to be

615
00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:26.700
attributed to our ability to produce and make things and,

616
00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:29.500
and America's incredible ability to,
like you said,

617
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.400
build such incredible equipment in such a short amount of time.
It's,

618
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.960
it's epic.

619
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.390
<v 2>It's,
it really was.</v>

620
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.230
And we switched from a isolation.

621
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.270
Henry Ford was an isolation is as I understand,
and he turns around and go,

622
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.250
the bomber plans is turn it out.
Six,
seven,
eight,
10 B,
24 hours a day.

623
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

624
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.350
this fantastic effort,
but we all stood together in those days.

625
00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:03.760
<v 3>Yeah.
When,
when,
um,
I always read that for d day,</v>

626
00:43:03.761 --> 00:43:07.810
they,
they wanted troops,
not all,
but they were looking for,

627
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.570
they brought a lot of troops that didn't have any combat experience.

628
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.850
I don't think a 5% of the people that hit the beaches had experience.

629
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:20.440
You know,
it's funny,
I got in trouble in Paris a few years out of yard.

630
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.290
This is a good story.
My wife can hear it.
She was there and fine.

631
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.160
But we were at a dinner in Paris,
some

632
00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.540
<v 2>d day celebration and I made a mistake.</v>

633
00:43:36.551 --> 00:43:41.551
I stood up and said to the people in the room that the ground troops here,

634
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.560
the infantry,
um,

635
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.320
all you people that landed on d day,
I said,
d day is your day.

636
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.950
It's not the air force.
His Day,
the missions,

637
00:43:53.951 --> 00:43:58.951
we flew on DJ where what we've been doing for two years out of England and it

638
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:03.910
was,
there was no better,
no worse.

639
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.130
But when you stop and think that those kids that hit that beach,

640
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.150
no experience,
uh,
officers,

641
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.520
no experience in combat.

642
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.620
And so in my opinion and all stand by it.

643
00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:24.490
And I had a few people at the dinner who objected to what I said,

644
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:30.280
but d day was the guys that hit the beach.
We,

645
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:32.010
uh,
we supported them,

646
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.790
but we didn't do much more than what we have been doing day after day.

647
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.730
Um,
you know,

648
00:44:39.731 --> 00:44:44.730
you can talk about the eighth air force and the heavy bombers and the fact that

649
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.920
their,
their losses were,

650
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.410
you've been a total marine loss in world war two.

651
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.090
So we,
we've been hurt,
but,

652
00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.660
uh,
d day,
uh,
that belong to those youngsters.

653
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.270
<v 0>What was the,
because these,
these guys were so,
you know,</v>

654
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:11.271
we're inexperienced when you were out at a pub in England talking to these army

655
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:16.581
guys that were getting ready to go in where they just a hundred percent fired up

656
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:21.550
to go.
Uh,
that's the only thing.
Cause I,

657
00:45:21.551 --> 00:45:25.110
I can imagine myself when I was 18 or 19 years old,

658
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.640
I first was in the military.

659
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.590
If you would have told me I was going to do a giant amphibious landing,

660
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.910
an epic amphibious landing,
there would have been just nothing.
But,
um,

661
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.060
absolute motivation and an excitement from me because I was young and stupid and

662
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:48.920
didn't know any better were all young I guess.

663
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:52.430
I guess at some point.
Young and stupid goes a long way,
doesn't it?
Well,

664
00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:54.470
I can tell you a little story about that.

665
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.180
<v 2>I was at Camp Kilmer.
We were in fact,</v>

666
00:45:59.181 --> 00:46:03.580
we thought we were going to fly across to England out of,

667
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.350
we expected air transportation for,

668
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.250
they were a group of about 18 pilots and uh,

669
00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:16.260
I think we were set to fly and all of a sudden they gave us all this equipment

670
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.500
and um,
uh,

671
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.770
leggings and backpacks and helmet and all this stuff.

672
00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.960
<v 0>That kind of stuff makes pilots nervous,
doesn't it?</v>

673
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.890
<v 2>Good.
Not only made us nervous,
made damn fools out.</v>

674
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.320
Nobody knew how to use this stuff.

675
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.280
And I know I got the leggings on.

676
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:47.290
I know they were from World War One.
They gave me this backpack and,

677
00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:49.530
and all of this gas,

678
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:54.960
underwear and everything and they didn't tell us how her packet and I went out

679
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:59.490
behind the barracks and there was a clothes line back there and I got some

680
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:04.491
clothes line and I tied to stem pack up with clothes line and um,

681
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.150
they gave me a helmet and I never tried it on so that that evening get getting

682
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.930
ready and we start marching down some tour to the gates of the camp Kilmer that

683
00:47:21.411 --> 00:47:26.411
Lotus a on trucks and we're over getting on the Queen Elizabeth.

684
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.110
And you had to go down or

685
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.160
<v 4>pure and then up a whole bunch of stairs to get to the end of the entrance to</v>

686
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:40.660
the ship.
And I had a p four bag with all of my clothes there.

687
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:43.360
Everything on the had a bottle of Scotch in there.

688
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:49.580
And I packed very carefully and I had a portable radio and the portable radios

689
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:55.300
and those days were like 36 inches long and full of batteries.

690
00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:01.030
So I'm carrying this thing and they gave me this damn helmet,

691
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.940
but they didn't give me the interior of it.

692
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.800
And so this stem without the inside of it.

693
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.580
Every time I took a step that was coming down on the nose and then bouncing back

694
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:20.320
again,
we go up the stairs and someplace along the line,

695
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:25.321
I set that back down too long and now I got scotch out the bottom four back and

696
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.500
we,
we come to where they're checking your sin and there was a full colonel army

697
00:48:35.501 --> 00:48:39.600
colonels
and he says,
my God,
we're going to lose

698
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.670
<v 3>believeable.
Uh,
uh,
so there you go.</v>

699
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.830
We got people that don't know how to wear their helmets,

700
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:57.100
packing their bags filled with scotch and you know,
for the war.

701
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.040
Uh,
so,
but when you're,
when you're talking to guys,
they're there,

702
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:07.600
they're ready to go and be day commences.
Nate,
they just don't,
they don't know.

703
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.630
They don't understand what they're getting into yet.
And,
and again,

704
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.870
maybe to the credit of the planners,

705
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:18.430
they decided it's better to have a bunch of guys that aren't really a hundred

706
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.630
percent sure of what to expect.

707
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:22.420
And it is to have a bunch of people that know what they're getting into and know

708
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:26.700
how hard this is going to be.
Well,
in fact,

709
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.280
what I started to saved before I got off again,

710
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.570
you have to watch me very carefully
in your board.

711
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.080
<v 4>Well,
you go down to the officer's Club just before,
uh,</v>

712
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:44.150
we were going to take off for England and there's quite a party going and,

713
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:49.270
and there was a little spirits flowing and if you,

714
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:54.140
the World War Two barracks buildings where the club was there,

715
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:59.170
they had a mezzanine on the second floor and then it's open in the center and

716
00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:04.991
all of these damn fools from the airborne or up on the second floor yelling

717
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.800
Dranamo and jumping off.

718
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.370
<v 3>And this one kid broke his leg.</v>

719
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:15.910
And so I've heard about guys breaking their leg and then going on to combat.

720
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.810
But that's another story

721
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.450
from my friend Charlotte.
Plumped what's that?
What about,

722
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.070
oh brother,
we got so many

723
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.180
<v 5>stories to tell you.
I was on my way to combat on the aircraft carrier.</v>

724
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:37.100
Kittyhawk we stopped in Hawaii for our last Hoo Rah.
And,
uh,

725
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:42.080
so we went out and found some pubs and whatnot,
what I had rented a little,
um,

726
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.250
a motor scooter,
you know,
like a little vest spa.
Right.

727
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.720
And cause that's going to work out well.
That's good.
So I'm driving around,

728
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:55.280
I'm Honolulu and I looked back and when I look forward,

729
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:59.840
I'm a bore sided on an 18 wheeler.
And so I,
uh,
so,

730
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:04.841
so I laid that motor scooter on its side and slid underneath the axle of this

731
00:51:05.451 --> 00:51:10.451
truck and pin my right ankle between the frame and the motors,

732
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:14.190
get her in the truck.
Well,
and so I,
you know,
I,

733
00:51:14.191 --> 00:51:18.230
I came out and dusted myself off.
I'm thinking,
okay,
then I tried to walk,

734
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:19.610
you know,
I'm not walking very well.

735
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:24.710
And so I go up to the closest a house and knock on the door and say,
yeah,

736
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:28.820
you know,
I guess I need a ride to the hospital.
Whenever the Tripler hospital,

737
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:33.200
big hospital in Hawaii and um,
in the doc,
uh,

738
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:38.150
there looks at me and he takes an x ray and my leg.
And you know,

739
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.320
it was really funny when you,

740
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.940
when you see an x ray of a broken part of your body,
you know,
you,
you,
you,

741
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.030
you're in disbelief.
You know,
you're like,
wait,
how can this happen?
You know,

742
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:51.780
you're in denial.
And the guy said,
uh,
okay,
report to a,
uh,

743
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.610
wing,
uh,
bravo a floor three.
I said,

744
00:51:55.611 --> 00:51:57.380
what's on Bravo three?
He said,

745
00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:01.310
it's all the other idiots that broke their leg riding motor scooters in Hawaii.

746
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:05.840
And sure enough,
all these military guys in his military hospital,

747
00:52:05.841 --> 00:52:10.370
I had broken their leg on motor scooters.
And so I said,
I can't do that.

748
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.720
I'm a fighter pilot.
You know,
I just to help start the top gun school,
I gotta,

749
00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:18.860
I gotta get Outta here.
I got to go win the war.
You know,
and,

750
00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:23.240
and I'll never forget this doctor,
his name was Jensen.

751
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:26.420
Dr. Jensen said,
son,
take my advice.

752
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:31.070
You can get into war in six months or so after your leg heals.

753
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.900
And so I said,
I can't do that.
I got to go back to the ship.
He's a,

754
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.500
he said she can't ride around on a ship with a broken leg.
I said no,

755
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.490
an aircraft carrier,

756
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:43.280
we've got hospital as an x ray machines and all this good stone.

757
00:52:43.281 --> 00:52:47.390
We had doctors and surgeons and all this stuff.
Uh,
no,
I can't let you do that.

758
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:52.370
You know,
we report to all the other characters that broke their legs.
No,

759
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:53.930
no.
Can't do that.
And so I find,

760
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:58.380
I am arguing with this doctor who outranked me my about three ranks.
And,
uh,

761
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:02.010
uh,
I said,
tell you what,
let me call the ship.
I'll,

762
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:07.010
I'll let you talk to our flight surgeon and he can assure you that I'll be okay

763
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:11.340
by going back to the ship.
Cause I got to go to the war.
I,

764
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.770
so I,
so I called the ship.
Well of course a flight surgeon out getting drunk too.

765
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:22.940
So he wasn't there.
And in fact,
the only one in sick bay on that ship was,
uh,

766
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:27.360
was uh,
uh,
a corpsman,
uh,
like a third class.
Korman okay.

767
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:30.860
And he doesn't know what he's doing.
And I say,
okay,
I'm whispering to the guys.

768
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.060
Okay.
Now tell,

769
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.820
tell this doctor or that you're in charge of the hospital and that it's okay for

770
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:40.170
me to come back.
So sure enough,
you know,
he does what he does a doctor.

771
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:44.790
So I get a cab and I got this cast on now from my bed,

772
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:47.760
from my waist all the way up,
down on my toe,
get my big toes.

773
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:52.290
I mean how I broke my ankle,
you know,
not,
not the rest of my leg,

774
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:57.291
but I got this 20 pound cast on and so I got to use crutches and I crunch up the

775
00:53:57.361 --> 00:54:01.640
gangway,
you know,
and it's a request permission come on board and the,
the,

776
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.040
the Odi says permission granted and,

777
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.950
and I hobbled my way into a sick bay.
Okay,

778
00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:09.540
here's the same third class.

779
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:14.100
Korman sitting there and he didn't know what he's doing and he doesn't sign me

780
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:15.870
in or anything.
He says,
uh,
you know,

781
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:18.960
go to the officer's quiet room that we got one of those in sick bay.

782
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:23.820
And so I crushed my way back to the quiet room and I,
I am exhausted.

783
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:28.140
I'm totally in.
This leg is starting to swell inside the cast and I'm in pain.

784
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:32.660
And so I just flopped down in this,
in this rack.
And again,

785
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.750
the quiet room.
Well,

786
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:38.460
the next thing I hear is the engines of the ship starting up.
You know,

787
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:43.200
we're about to leave now.
Meanwhile,
my squadron buddies,

788
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.480
you know,
and wanting to leave,

789
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:48.420
no man behind says where's Charlie?

790
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:53.810
They went back on the beach searching for me for the last place they saw me was

791
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:56.480
disappearing towards diamond head on a vest buck.

792
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.240
And so they look all over for me and come back and report that I'm a wall.
Okay.

793
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.460
I miss ships movement.
All right.
Okay.
So,

794
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:09.690
so I wake up [inaudible] I know what's happening.
I,
you know,

795
00:55:09.691 --> 00:55:11.820
I gotta tell somebody I'm here,
nobody knows I'm here.

796
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.840
I mean the third class Corman,
he didn't sign me and he didn't know who I was.
So,

797
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.890
so,
you know,
the squeeze bottles,
you know,
in,

798
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.340
in a hospital room and it was supposed to,
uh,

799
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:28.120
some squeezed on his bottle trying to attract a nurse or something,
you know,

800
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.080
in there,
squeeze,
squeeze,
squeeze.

801
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:34.170
And I finally looked up and the hose from the bottle was cut.

802
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.300
I would just squeeze in air.
So I get my crutch out,

803
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.870
which is the only thing I can move.
I mean,

804
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:43.110
I'm paralyzed and I'm banging on the hatch,
you know?

805
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:47.400
And I finally attract attention to this sailor and to say,

806
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:52.140
you'd better go up to the ready room and squadron one 14 then you better tell

807
00:55:52.141 --> 00:55:56.550
him up there.
Then I'm down here.
Well it wasn't probably two minutes later.

808
00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.280
And the commanding officer standing in the doorway,
all right,

809
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:04.260
and he is not unhappy.
He said,
I've had 17 pilots.
He said,

810
00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:08.580
and now I got 16 he said,
he said,
first of all,
he said,

811
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.700
what are they telling you?
When are you going to be ready to fly again?
I said,

812
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.440
six weeks.

813
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.790
Well,
I,
you know,
weeks,
months.
I kind of got that confused.
And he said,

814
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.510
you're going home.
I'm going to get a pilot view.
Oh No,
please,
please,

815
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.681
please let me stay.

816
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:29.710
I'm gonna stay with the squadron and I got to be with the troops,
you know,

817
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:34.050
please.
And so now you're going home.
Ah,
please be.
I said,
okay,

818
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:37.210
a skipper,
what if I,
uh,
you need,

819
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.570
you need a pilot from the squadron to run the,

820
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:45.580
the maintenance on a
cubi point in Philippines,

821
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.810
you know,
a pilot stand behind it for battle damage and stuff.
You know,

822
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.980
I'll take care and I'll run those troops and for,
yeah,
I can do that on a crutch.

823
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.280
And so he said,
okay,
so he let me,

824
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.930
he let me off on at and the Philippines and where all the rest of the squadron,

825
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:04.720
you know,
when the door,
the first line period,
uh,

826
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.540
they went out there and I'm crunching my way around the Philippines,
uh,

827
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.600
with,
uh,
you know,
I had,

828
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.340
I had probably six or eight chiefs and a hundred,
uh,

829
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.820
mechanics,
you know,
working on these airplanes.
Well,

830
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.360
so they would send these airplanes back to me,

831
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:27.280
but I didn't have any way to test them.
Uh,
but the,
the army,

832
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:31.420
a trip or hospital had not taken my wing,
so they,
they,
they've not given me a,

833
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:35.650
a down shit.
So I told me I couldn't fly.
Why,
you know,

834
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.280
so I talked to doctor there at Subic Bay to put on a walking cast.

835
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.220
Okay.
So I've got a little cast.
And so,
uh,
I can,
you know,

836
00:57:45.221 --> 00:57:47.920
I'm qualified to test these airplanes.
I can do this.

837
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.770
And so the problem was,
first of all,

838
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:54.220
I couldn't get into the airplane because my cats was too big to go into,

839
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:57.780
to the toe hole.
And so I'd have my crew,
um,

840
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.250
fork lift me up and into the airplane.

841
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:05.530
My second problem was I couldn't use my right foot to push the right rudder.

842
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.820
And this is,
uh,

843
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.460
this is kind of a nose wheel steering the airplane in the Air Force where you

844
00:58:10.461 --> 00:58:13.330
gotta be able to push the rudder to steer.
So I would,

845
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.350
I'd go out and test these airplanes and I come back and land at a,

846
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:21.760
at cubi point and the Philippines,
and instead of making the,
they'd say,
okay,

847
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.820
you're cleared righthand turn,
couldn't make a right hand turn.

848
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.490
I made three lefthand turns to get off.

849
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.090
So the fuck the squadron finally came back and I got back with them,

850
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:36.730
got my little cast off,
and I started flying missions.

851
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.610
But until the day I was shot down,

852
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:44.320
I was still limping on that ankle and I was really afraid with a diet in the

853
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:48.940
prison camp,
but that was never going to heal.
But uh,
you know,
as,
as,

854
00:58:48.941 --> 00:58:53.150
as luck and fate would have it,
it healed up fine.
And so,
you know,

855
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.830
but yeah,
that,
that's my story of,
of,

856
00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:01.530
of getting breaking my leg on the way to combat,
you know.

857
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.800
Thanks for bringing that up Jim.

858
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.070
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
Let's,
let's do,
we're talking about,</v>

859
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:10.600
now we're talking about getting shot down.

860
00:59:10.601 --> 00:59:14.440
Do you know your ended up in a prison camp?
Let's,
you were about to get to the,

861
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.610
to the,
to the engagement where you actually did get shot down.

862
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:21.860
You want to talk through that one a little bit further,
Jim,
and just

863
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.820
<v 3>give us some details on that.
Well,
sure.
Um,
some of the</v>

864
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.420
<v 2>details,
um,
uh,
are not original,
but,
uh,</v>

865
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.940
uh,
back to the,
uh,
the Purple Heart Corner,
uh,

866
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:40.170
you spot them coming in again.

867
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:45.630
And this time there were two different gaggles that I could see in the gaggle is

868
00:59:45.631 --> 00:59:50.490
a word that we use for the Germans because they didn't fly a real tight

869
00:59:50.491 --> 00:59:51.870
formation.
They kind of,

870
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.280
<v 3>they were just there was that,
was that intentional?
Yes.</v>

871
00:59:56.281 --> 01:00:00.320
It must've been because they were,
you know,
the German pilots,
a sharp bottling.

872
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.290
Yeah.
But,
um,
I would guess,
you know,

873
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.420
especially in Germans are generally orderly people,

874
01:00:06.421 --> 01:00:08.730
so you'd think they'd want it fly tight formations.

875
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.860
But I guess if you think about it from a,

876
01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.880
from like even from a basic camouflage perspective,

877
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.860
when you see things in a pattern,
it stands out more.

878
01:00:16.861 --> 01:00:19.440
So maybe they did that to break up their pattern a little bit.
Well,

879
01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:20.210
I would assume,

880
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:25.040
<v 2>well,
because they were very effective.
And um,
you know,</v>

881
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:29.600
some of these boys you we'd run into where he'd been at it for a long time,

882
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.450
but as I saw them coming in and referred to them,

883
01:00:35.451 --> 01:00:37.970
as I said,
it's a gaggle.
Uh,

884
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I picked the one closest and broke into it and made the call that I was making

885
01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:47.750
the break and broke.
And just as I broke,

886
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:53.170
somebody's got a shot at me and I got hit back in the after part of the fuselage

887
01:00:54.411 --> 01:00:59.180
and I follow,
had a little fire going and I'm sure I did.

888
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.580
But,
um,
as I made my first pass through them,

889
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:09.581
I've lined up and if you could get the peak 38 no's on a target,

890
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:16.450
those four 50s and that 20 millimeter were devastating and so many rounds of 50

891
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:19.370
cow would you have?

892
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.260
We usually carry 400 rounds per gun and 130 rounds of,

893
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:27.110
uh,
uh,
uh,
20 millimeter.

894
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.680
And we arranged our,
um,
uh,

895
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.660
our triggers so that we,
we wanted to fire them all at the same time.

896
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:37.160
We didn't carry any tracer.

897
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.700
We put five tracers in at about 25 rounds remaining so that you knew you were,

898
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.860
you had to have something to go home on that right.

899
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.310
Start conserving your ammunition.

900
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:55.330
And so I got a line on a clear shot fired at him,

901
01:01:57.741 --> 01:01:58.490
but I don't,

902
01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:02.060
I didn't know what the results were because all of a sudden I'm in the middle of

903
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:05.210
us of a firestorm.
Uh,

904
01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.210
<v 3>a literal firestorm inside your cabinet,
inside your cockpit?
No.</v>

905
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:11.290
Or just still outside?

906
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.650
<v 2>It's outside the crowd.
There were,</v>

907
01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.610
there were a lots of targets and apparently I went through them,

908
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:21.030
uh,
really

909
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.260
<v 4>this late date,
uh,
my story,</v>

910
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:29.710
that's how much I really remember about this.
Uh,

911
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:34.440
I heard stories later,
which I'll get to,
but,
uh,

912
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.900
uh,
it seemed like it went on forever.
And,
uh,

913
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.400
finally,
uh,
I'm on the tail of a one night.
He,
I saw,

914
01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.580
I saw some,
I knew I was involved with one nineties,

915
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.480
but I saw a couple of one online,

916
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.430
someplace in my peripheral vision solar.

917
01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.520
There were other aircraft involved and they're all,

918
01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:01.450
apparently they're all with me.
I didn't know it at the time,
but,
um,

919
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.310
uh,
we made a number of passes.

920
01:03:07.311 --> 01:03:10.350
I was very concerned about the of ammunition.

921
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:13.410
If you hold it far buttoned down,

922
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.740
you're going to be out in about 20 seconds.

923
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.190
So I was very concerned about using all my ammunition,

924
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:24.650
so I was trying to fire very short bursts and,
um,

925
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.580
we go round and round and we're Jo,
uh,
Jojo hang up and down and,

926
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:34.380
and uh,
uh,
I've got on the tail of a one 90,

927
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.840
again,
I'm right up on top of them.
Uh,

928
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.530
and the p 38 through your gun site,

929
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.450
you could also see your two top 50s.
Uh,

930
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.320
and it looked like I had those two fifties right around the rudder post and this

931
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:53.220
one 90 and out of the corner of my eye,

932
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:58.310
I see these flashes out on my wing tip and they're coming up the wing tip and

933
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.850
getting closer and closer.
And this is the middle o seconds.

934
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.430
And he hit me right in,
in by the,

935
01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:12.450
the left engine.
And,
um,
we had an air,

936
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.373
uh,

937
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:18.450
air scoop that came in through the leading edge of the wing and the end of the

938
01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:20.790
cockpit by your left knee,

939
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:24.090
which is our only cold air into the p 38.

940
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:29.280
And again,
I see this peripheral vision.

941
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.370
I'm concentrating on the guy in front of me.
Uh,

942
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.810
I see this air vent making like a blowtorch.

943
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.600
And so this is not good.

944
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.270
And again,
uh,

945
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:48.630
my next memory is I'm out,
fallen through a cloud.

946
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.950
I don't remember.
Our emergency reliefs was above us.

947
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:58.130
P 38 had actually had windows and you crank them up on both sides and the only

948
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:05.670
way you could get them down is to hit the little release and then crank them

949
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:09.900
down.
And so we had a top hatch,

950
01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:14.250
which was our escape hatch,
which was about this wide,

951
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:19.570
and you have a backpack shoot and all your equipment.

952
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:25.150
And I,
um,
uh,
I don't know why,

953
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:30.120
I don't remember releasing any pay or pulling the,
uh,

954
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.110
the safety belt there,
the shoulder harnesses.
Uh,

955
01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:37.710
<v 0>but this is unlike,
you know,
Charlie,
you're,
you know,</v>

956
01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.310
the modern rigs where you pull the ejection handle and you,
this is all stuff,

957
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:43.230
I mean,
in a modern aircraft,

958
01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:47.610
you pull the objection handle and you're getting shot out of the aircraft all

959
01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:52.020
automatic.
That's all.
That's all you do.
We didn't have to think about anything.

960
01:05:52.021 --> 01:05:54.960
We weren't smart as these guys were yet.
And so,
so,

961
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:59.790
so this was all stuff you manually had to do.
Unbuckle yourself,

962
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.660
get an open up the hatch or the window and,

963
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:06.340
and get all that done while the plane is burning and,

964
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:07.950
and then you have to get out.

965
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.080
And that's kind of when you come back into consciousness.

966
01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:12.840
So you did that either instinctively or,

967
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:16.800
or at some point while all this mayhem was going on?

968
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.720
<v 4>I'll try.
I don't,
as I say,
I don't remember even reaching up above for the,</v>

969
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:26.570
to pull the top hatch.
Um,
all I was just,

970
01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:31.790
I'll float down through a client knew the clouds for around five pounds and feet

971
01:06:31.791 --> 01:06:35.150
because we'd been Jojo and up and down during this time.

972
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:40.400
<v 0>And also just one more point on a ejection sheet,
a modern ejection seat,</v>

973
01:06:40.401 --> 01:06:43.850
you come out,
your parachute opens automatically,
right?
So you're,

974
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.580
you're still in a rip cord scenario,
right,

975
01:06:46.581 --> 01:06:49.160
where you're going to have to make this parachute open.
So when you say,

976
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.990
when you say you're floating down,

977
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.770
you're actually falling down at 120 miles per hour towards the earth.

978
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.700
Somewhat like that.

979
01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.201
<v 4>Oh,
anyway,</v>

980
01:06:58.201 --> 01:07:03.201
I come out the bottom of a clown and I'm facing up and I thought,

981
01:07:03.241 --> 01:07:08.010
well,
I'd better turn over.
I turned over,

982
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:12.990
then I can remember distinctly watching the ground and I thought I was behind

983
01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:17.400
German lines because we were locked in Germany.
And,
uh,

984
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.880
uh,
he just knew that I was,

985
01:07:20.881 --> 01:07:25.881
and we were east of Walkin and I knew were approximately where this fight

986
01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:30.630
started.
And I didn't think it has gotten any better about going west.

987
01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:34.050
So I figured we were,
we were over territory.

988
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.380
And so,
uh,
we,
um,

989
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:43.080
we have been told to not pull your ripcord that altitude,

990
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.510
get down.
It was Europe.

991
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.350
You're a lot less of a target lower you can get.

992
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:55.040
So I rolled over and Phil actually just fell face down and watched the ground

993
01:07:55.261 --> 01:07:59.000
come up when it looks like it was pretty close.
I pulled the rip cord.

994
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.600
<v 0>This is your first time parachuting or did,
did,</v>

995
01:08:02.601 --> 01:08:06.340
did you guys do any parachuting in preparation for this?
No.

996
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.030
Okay.
Um,
yeah,
that's interesting having,

997
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.370
having jumped out at least a number of airplanes.

998
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.980
<v 3>This is not something you want to do for the first time</v>

999
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.380
<v 4>anywhere.
Rip Cord work.</v>

1000
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:37.510
I remember thinking,
well you know,
I gotta be ready to move when I get down.

1001
01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:42.511
So I unbuckled the two lower straps on the shoot and I got him on buckle and I

1002
01:08:44.201 --> 01:08:46.570
had a 45 in a shoulder holster.

1003
01:08:46.571 --> 01:08:50.060
I got the 45 out and I'm trying to cock it.

1004
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:53.670
You get around in the chamber and I dropped it.

1005
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.200
I didn't realize my hands were burned and so I'm not sure how I got the shoot

1006
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.913
particles off.

1007
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.680
And so I must've been pretty low when I pulled the rip cord because just

1008
01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:09.940
instantaneous.
There's,
I came down,
you know,

1009
01:09:09.941 --> 01:09:14.941
red brick building and it had a courtyard in a tree in the middle of the

1010
01:09:16.751 --> 01:09:20.410
courtyard.
And I could,
if I could find the building,

1011
01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:25.411
I'd recognize it today in my shoot caught in this little tree and I jerked to a

1012
01:09:26.501 --> 01:09:30.760
stop the non probably six inches off off the deck.

1013
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.280
And I remember doing that,
but then I don't remember,

1014
01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.360
uh,
were uh,
period.
Uh,
and I,

1015
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:44.510
I kept thinking it's getting dark now.
I thought [inaudible] I haven't,

1016
01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.600
you know,
where have I been?
And,
uh,
I'm going down what?

1017
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.640
I was like a little hedge row and I had my 45 and I saw these guys down in this

1018
01:09:57.251 --> 01:09:59.020
ditch.
Uh,
boy,

1019
01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:04.410
I thought there were German and I saw the head net on their helmet and our guys

1020
01:10:05.381 --> 01:10:07.000
have netting on the helmet now.

1021
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.370
I threw my hands up and through the 45 over my shoulder,
never saw it again.

1022
01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.773
But,
um,

1023
01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.020
it was the first infantry division and they had seen my shoot and I came down

1024
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:25.770
between the German positions and first infantry division.
Wow.

1025
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:30.730
And what had happened,
and I found this all later,
they,
uh,

1026
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:34.900
first infantry we were trying to take Ochin,
you know,
we started,

1027
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:39.990
this is mid September to try to take off and we didn't get a locked in until

1028
01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:46.890
early November where we actually took the town and the first infantry had pushed

1029
01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:53.320
up,
throw it on the night of the 15th.

1030
01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:58.750
It pushed up and taking this little area,
uh,
where I came down,

1031
01:10:58.751 --> 01:11:01.360
it was a little town called Ellen Dorr,

1032
01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:06.930
which was a suburb of Boston and they were having trouble holding it.

1033
01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.840
And so they were getting ready to pull back and they saw my shoot and they guys

1034
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:21.180
came out and picked me up,
took me to Oh,
oh,
back hospital.

1035
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.370
But before they did that,

1036
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:30.070
they took me in and I'm into an area and up here I was in the command post and I

1037
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:36.330
met a full colonel and I found out later who he was.

1038
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:41.331
He was the commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment and he,

1039
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:45.710
he said,
he asked me if you want to dinner.
And I said,
well,

1040
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.520
I don't know what I said.
Anyway,

1041
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.550
I apparently sat down and had dinner with him right with him.
And,
um,

1042
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.010
I do remember going outside this area and throwing up,

1043
01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.440
so I knew like I had eaten something,
but,
uh,

1044
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.490
they put me on,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1045
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.250
two and a half ton truck and where they put the,
uh,

1046
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.890
uh,
the stretchers,
they put them in between the,

1047
01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.940
what are the side gates and I,

1048
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:21.000
there was some Germans in there and some Americans and me,

1049
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.990
and they hauled us back.
Narco.
They took me to,
what I found out later,

1050
01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:29.991
it was the 45th evac hospital and they treated me there.

1051
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.030
But,
uh,
I right at that moment,

1052
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:39.240
I don't remember too much about all the scoring on,

1053
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.070
except I thought it was getting dark.

1054
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:44.040
So I thought I'd been on the ground for quite a while.

1055
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:47.850
And I found out later that my eyes were,

1056
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.950
had been pretty flash burns on my face and hands and everything.

1057
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:56.100
And I w I couldn't see for a couple of days.

1058
01:12:56.670 --> 01:13:01.200
So apparently I was having,
my eyes were swollen shut or something.
And,
um,

1059
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.190
I just think it's getting dark.
But,
um,

1060
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.340
they hauled the end of the,
the,
uh,

1061
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.400
the hospital and I was very fortunate they had a doctor there who,

1062
01:13:15.181 --> 01:13:16.014
um,

1063
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:21.470
either had developed or was using a new technique on burns and they took me in

1064
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:27.411
the operating room and it was colder than hell and I'm vibrating like blazes and

1065
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:33.621
they start picking like this and a kindness to the drive me crazy.

1066
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.760
And what once they developed this new technique where they picked all the burn

1067
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:45.950
areas out to get it off of there.
So you heal from,

1068
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.150
from the inside out.
And it's,
I went back through the,

1069
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.730
the hospital system.
Uh,

1070
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.760
they'd used me as a demonstration to these kids that have been caught in tanks

1071
01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:03.630
and badly burned,
much worse than I was.

1072
01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.770
And they were telling him that,
look what we did here,

1073
01:14:07.771 --> 01:14:12.240
look how quickly he's healing,
meeting me,
uh,

1074
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.200
<v 2>using this technique.</v>

1075
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.390
And so apparently I was one of the very first that they'd ever used a song.

1076
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:24.590
But when,
um,
we,
uh,
we,

1077
01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:26.260
we were putting on this train,

1078
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:31.410
the hospital train and taken to the American hospital in Paris and they haul me

1079
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.490
in there and this guy comes up to him and he says,
hell,

1080
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:39.970
I know you.
Um,
you said if we picked you up.

1081
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.240
And His name was Walter Leonard Scott.
He was a,

1082
01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.380
a a with the first infantry division company c and he was a second lieutenant

1083
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:55.120
and he became my friend.

1084
01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:59.650
He stayed with me for quite a while and he had witnessed almost all of us

1085
01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:03.160
operation as we yoyo around the area.

1086
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.680
Why he was seeing a good part.

1087
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:09.350
And then he told me a lot about what happened.
They,

1088
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:12.890
they told me that they estimated there were 20,

1089
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.190
28 enemy aircraft and that somehow or other,
that story has stuck

1090
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:24.190
with,
um,
with my store.
I don't,
I don't know what they were.
I mean,

1091
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.210
uh,
he,
um,
uh,
he actually

1092
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:35.410
was where I got most of my information about what had gone on.

1093
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.630
So we,
um,
we went through the hospital chain and,

1094
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.620
you know,
was he in the hospital for something?
He'd,
he been injured as well.

1095
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.593
He,

1096
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.250
we get the England and he's telling me a little bit about,
uh,

1097
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.810
infantry life.

1098
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:57.910
And he had landed with the first infantry division in North Africa.

1099
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:04.230
He went all through North Africa and went to Sicily and he had been very badly

1100
01:16:08.471 --> 01:16:12.460
wounded in Sicily.
And they,
um,

1101
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.420
he and another officer had a manned Anana tank gun

1102
01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:25.840
in some big operation in Sicily.
And the two of them,

1103
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:26.783
uh,

1104
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.750
stayed with this ama tank on when everybody else had departed.

1105
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:33.040
And anyway,

1106
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.040
he had received a distinguished service cross and that was the first time I ever

1107
01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:44.010
heard the term distinguished service cross.
And so now I'm starting,

1108
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:48.070
he started in 42 and he,
uh,

1109
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.930
went through north after he went to Sicily.
You went to England,
he made d day.

1110
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.010
And
I said,
well,

1111
01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.890
how come you're still a second lieutenant?

1112
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:08.340
We hadn't been in w we were sent to England.
They,

1113
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.550
they took us to the Nepali hospital,

1114
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:15.551
which was this gigantic hospital right outside of Southampton that had been

1115
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:20.840
built in the board.
Wharves something like that.
Big,

1116
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:23.600
looked like a castle.

1117
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:29.350
And so we hadn't been in there two hours in this cute little nurse shows up with

1118
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:35.390
a class,
a uniform for Leonard Scott.

1119
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:40.640
And Scott was gone.
I mean,
we didn't see him for 10 days.

1120
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:47.350
So I figured Leonard Scott was probably a person who tended four or five times.

1121
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.270
It sounds like from the cute nurse,
it might have been worth it.

1122
01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:01.220
But,
uh,
you know,
we,
we were quite close.

1123
01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:05.300
We're just a few weeks and for years and years and years,

1124
01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:09.770
I tried to find Leonard Scott.
I knew that he made it through the war.

1125
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:14.771
I knew that he'd gotten off separated from active duty and at Fort Lewis,

1126
01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:19.520
and he was from the Dalles,
Oregon.
And I tried to find him.

1127
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.680
And about a year ago,

1128
01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.580
my wife sit down at the computer and in a matter of a couple hours,

1129
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.520
she finds his to see his two daughters and he had passed.

1130
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:38.900
He had gone through Korea.
He went back on active duty,
went to Korea.

1131
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.170
He was,
yeah,

1132
01:18:43.171 --> 01:18:44.760
this distinguished service cross.

1133
01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:49.761
He had the purple heart was seven clusters and he had been hit.

1134
01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.940
He said he made the DD landing and in 20 minutes he was on,

1135
01:18:56.671 --> 01:18:57.504
um,

1136
01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:58.733
<v 4>uh,</v>

1137
01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:03.310
<v 2>landing craft on his way back to England.
He had gotten hit that quickly.</v>

1138
01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.760
And then he,
the day after I was shot down,

1139
01:19:06.761 --> 01:19:11.761
he got hit again and he went back after we separated,

1140
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:17.590
he went back to the First Infantry Division company C.

1141
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.590
And it's funny,

1142
01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.310
<v 4>hmm.
Uh,</v>

1143
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:29.290
<v 2>coming up to more recent times,
uh,
I built a number of,
I,
I,</v>

1144
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.290
I used to build,
we're still build airport facilities,

1145
01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:35.150
but I used to build air,

1146
01:19:35.151 --> 01:19:39.170
cargo buildings and so forth and Leeson to the airlines.

1147
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:41.930
And I did a lot of work with flying tigers.

1148
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.290
And I knew Bob Prescott pretty well.

1149
01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:50.240
Who was the president of Tigers and,
uh,
uh,

1150
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.280
Wayne Hoffman,
who was the chairman of the board of the tiger.

1151
01:19:53.281 --> 01:19:57.010
So tell us a little bit about the flying tigers.
If people don't know,
uh,

1152
01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:00.140
the flying tigers to the narrow line,
uh,

1153
01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.110
cargo airline that was sold to federal express,

1154
01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.070
who's now part of Federal Express and was

1155
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.400
<v 4>named,
uh,
because Bob Prescott,</v>

1156
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:13.200
he was president of Tigers,

1157
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:17.190
had flown with the Flying Tiger Organization in China,

1158
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:22.080
one of the original applying tigers.
And at right after the war,

1159
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:26.700
he started a little airline and called the flying tigers and it became a

1160
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:31.701
gigantic air cargo facility and they were flying all over the world.

1161
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:36.660
And so I started building facilities and leasing to them.

1162
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.100
And so the new Bob and knew Wayne Hoffman real well,

1163
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:45.790
and I knew that Wayne Hoffman had been,
uh,
in the army and been a,
uh,

1164
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.010
uh,
in the infantry,
but that's,
and we never talked about him.

1165
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:55.440
And Wayne's wife,
uh,

1166
01:20:55.441 --> 01:21:00.441
wrote a book and she took all of wanes letters that he had written home from

1167
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:07.920
Europe during the war and put them in this book.

1168
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:13.590
And so they gave me a book and I read it and I come to September 16th.

1169
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.340
Uh,
Wayne Hoffman is in Ellen Dorf,

1170
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:21.900
Germany in the first part of the Siegfried line,

1171
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:26.580
uh,
five o'clock in the evening in his letter to his wife,

1172
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:30.870
he said in very short letter,
he said,
um,
um,

1173
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.550
in Ellen door.

1174
01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:38.240
And there was an Arab while going on above us and we get talking.

1175
01:21:39.631 --> 01:21:42.900
And that was me in here.
We'd been friends for

1176
01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:47.460
a number of years and we never really talked about it.

1177
01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:52.970
And he was a company d or The 16th regiment and hundred.

1178
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:58.611
Scott was the sea of the 16th Regiment and we never put all this together.

1179
01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:05.130
That's so it's amazing what comes out.

1180
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:08.220
And I found out that,
um,
uh,

1181
01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:12.780
two of the people that are on the German side that I've been involved with the,

1182
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:18.360
uh,
occur,
uh,
Major Boris,
uh,

1183
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:21.600
they,
this is a long story.

1184
01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:25.140
I don't know how far you want to go with we go as long as you want to talk.

1185
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.600
They,
um,
uh,
Major Boris,

1186
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:35.790
uh,
uh,
a lot of go back and step.

1187
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:40.910
I heard from a gentleman in Holland and they had some information about my

1188
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:47.330
airplane.
And this gentleman,
uh,

1189
01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:52.370
had written several big historical books and he lived in,

1190
01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.300
um,

1191
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:59.300
in that little area where Belgium and Holland and Germany all come together and

1192
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:04.881
he had found like 500 rex aircraft wrecks in area

1193
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:11.300
<v 2>and pricing down and,
and history and,
and the,
um,
uh,</v>

1194
01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:16.420
recorded it and they came up with a piece 38 in a Elmendorf,

1195
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.113
Germany.

1196
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:24.990
And so they figured out and found it was my airplane and they found it in 1997.

1197
01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:29.081
And so anyway,

1198
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:34.081
in the series of steps I get and they get in contact with me and he had studied

1199
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:41.630
that,
but air,

1200
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.540
air warfare in that area and was writing another book about that.

1201
01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:48.860
And he saw you wanted to talk to me about it and we did.

1202
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:54.280
But unfortunately he passed away.
But,
uh,

1203
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.790
very early he was young man.
And so I,

1204
01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.770
I never got a sewer neuro from the record.

1205
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.900
My airplane is there someplace waiting for me to it and find it.

1206
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:09.820
But he told me that he had,
he came up with two names,

1207
01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:14.040
that he had read this book by Caldwell,

1208
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.480
who's a story called the the,
uh,

1209
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.370
war diary of Jg 26.

1210
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:26.780
The yellow knows Abby bull boys.
Yolande knows,
uh,

1211
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:31.360
aircraft and um,
they,

1212
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.300
uh,
he had written on September 16th,

1213
01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:39.301
he had this story about attacking the Three v three 70th group and the Germans

1214
01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:47.761
claimed four p 38 had been shot down and that wasn't true.

1215
01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:51.640
I was the only one that lost.

1216
01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:55.780
They actually attack the group after my engagement with them.

1217
01:24:55.781 --> 01:24:58.980
They finally got their act together,
I guess in the TAC,

1218
01:24:58.981 --> 01:25:03.070
the group and didn't do too well,
but like 20 minutes,

1219
01:25:03.071 --> 01:25:05.620
30 minutes later,
whatever the time of them.

1220
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.140
But he figured out that one of two people had shot me down.
One fellow was,
was,

1221
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:16.030
uh,
major,
uh,
Boris Major.
Boris had shot down.

1222
01:25:16.031 --> 01:25:19.390
His first victory was a,
in 1939,

1223
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:23.130
he shot down the Spitfire.
Uh,
he had,

1224
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:27.160
if he got me,
I was his 42nd victory.

1225
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:32.800
The other guy was a no follow by the name of Keith me a lot.
And,

1226
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.360
uh,
he,
if he got me,
I would have been his 82nd.

1227
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.740
So these guys were not beginners.

1228
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.640
And so all this information's dribbling in over the last 60 years.

1229
01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:56.460
So by the time I find out about Boris and in the loop Wapa,

1230
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:01.270
uh,
they're,
they've died.
So I've never got a chance to talk with them.

1231
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.430
But through,
we've found,
Scott's

1232
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.140
daughter is a very famous,

1233
01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:12.050
a interior decorator in San Francisco.

1234
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:15.350
And so we're going to get together with her.

1235
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:20.190
And she said that her father passed away at a very early age.

1236
01:26:20.191 --> 01:26:21.740
I think he was in these fifties.

1237
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.900
But so all of this keeps coming in.

1238
01:26:26.901 --> 01:26:31.730
We keep hearing more and more.
You find something old accidentally.
He,
uh,

1239
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:34.250
uh,
beyond earth to

1240
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:38.490
<v 3>interesting.
His story's there again,
but you haven't told us about the nurse,</v>

1241
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:43.560
<v 2>um,
helping you with your clothes.</v>

1242
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.193
<v 3>Oh,
the nurse,</v>

1243
01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:51.600
this is a g rated podcast most of the time,

1244
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:57.390
either a,
uh,
echo can bleep it,

1245
01:26:57.391 --> 01:27:02.391
some of it out there were some lovely nurses and I think we all know what to

1246
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:08.730
happen.
They were,
you know,
they were so wonderful.

1247
01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.713
I mean,

1248
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:13.400
<v 2>gels were just unbelievable how they took care of him.</v>

1249
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.170
<v 3>No,
it's actually,
I,
you know,</v>

1250
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:18.260
we've read some books on the podcast where there was nurses that were over in

1251
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:22.190
France and they were receiving guys right off the front lines.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1252
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.230
Well they,
they had me on

1253
01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:29.330
<v 2>this 45th and I wake up and I'm hearing all of this big bang and going on will</v>

1254
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.340
the boarded fifth hospitals here and there's a right behind it here.

1255
01:27:35.341 --> 01:27:40.341
There's a a hundred and fifth 105,

1256
01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.200
a artillery firing over the little.

1257
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:50.160
And they took me to,
and from there I went to,
um,
uh,

1258
01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:53.760
the hospital or the General Hospital in,
uh,

1259
01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:58.950
in brought in Brussels,
no,
not process where the old man mastery.

1260
01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:01.440
And uh,

1261
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.680
I left there one day and then the next day after I left a B,

1262
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:11.370
a,
B one,
a rocket docket,

1263
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:14.570
flew right into the side of the hospital.

1264
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:18.570
And I have pictures of it that I took.

1265
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.550
And this is later my second tour through the hospital,
which is another story.

1266
01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:29.040
But,
um,
uh,
so that,
that was a big tragedy,

1267
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.410
but he killed a number of the people and it's one of the wards.

1268
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:37.750
So in those,
those were the nurses that I knew,
but

1269
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.400
<v 3>how long did it take you to recover and he,
did you fly again or was that,</v>

1270
01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:46.060
was being shot down and wounded was at the end of the war for you?

1271
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:51.030
<v 2>No.
Well,
it was in combat really.
Um,
uh,</v>

1272
01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:54.820
I went through the hospital chain and,
uh,

1273
01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:00.660
it was released in England,
went back,

1274
01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.310
I going through Paris

1275
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:05.430
<v 4>and,
um,
uh,
you know,</v>

1276
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.140
when the hospitals would collect the uniform died,

1277
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:15.910
they took all my flying jacket and everything was burned from a wreck.
So it's,

1278
01:29:16.130 --> 01:29:18.090
they strip you down,
throw it all away.

1279
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:22.950
And so now I'm in a hospital and an England and they're gonna release me and I'm

1280
01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:27.790
going back to my squad renumbering to fly.
This is in November,
you know,

1281
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:32.640
and uh,
my burns,
it healed pretty well.

1282
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:37.650
So they give me a uniform due to wear.

1283
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:42.870
And I don't know how many guys were,
how many times is sky,

1284
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.140
whoever's uniform it was,
it had been hit,
but there was a whole,
sure,

1285
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:50.910
a bunch of holes in it.
And I found a hat.

1286
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:55.040
And so I had no money.
And so I'm,

1287
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.320
I'm freaking my way back.

1288
01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:02.850
I went to London and then I got a flight to Paris and I got to Paris.

1289
01:30:02.851 --> 01:30:06.960
And so I decided,
well,
I'm in Paris and I'm on my way back to the squadron.

1290
01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.930
Uh,
I'm going to see something.

1291
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:14.070
So I went down to the Lido club and,
um,

1292
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.770
I used to like,
oh,
I still like to dance,
but I like swimming.

1293
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:22.080
And so I'm in the Lido club and,

1294
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:27.060
and they have this pretty little gal singing,
uh,
uh,

1295
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.520
some French tunes.
And then they want to,

1296
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.300
they ask you a few people if they wanted to do a little Gera bug.

1297
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:39.840
So we,
uh,
we had quite a night.

1298
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.740
And so I left early in figuring out where I'm going to sleep and I'm walking

1299
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:51.790
down the avenue and here comes a gaggle again of,
of,

1300
01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.590
uh,
guys were pink pinks on.
And the,

1301
01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:00.060
the green jerseys and everything.
Damn,
here comes my battle jacket,

1302
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.950
my pants,
these are all friends of mine.
There were in my cohort

1303
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:14.610
there were staying at the Claridge hotel right next to the Lido Cologne.

1304
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.060
So all of a sudden I'm better dressed.

1305
01:31:21.170 --> 01:31:25.290
I borrowed some money in and we enjoyed Paris.

1306
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:26.850
And then did you get back to the squadron?

1307
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:30.690
Went back to the squadron with them and they have transportation.

1308
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:34.310
So I went back with them and I'm there for cal.

1309
01:31:34.311 --> 01:31:39.020
I've walked in and everybody's glad to see me.
And,
and um,

1310
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.170
let's say cow,

1311
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:44.430
we just got a brand new p 38 in fright from Ireland.

1312
01:31:44.431 --> 01:31:48.540
Just came through and it's yours and it,
boy,
it was a beauty.

1313
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.380
So I'm all ready to start flying again.
And Doc Berg,
who was our plight,

1314
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:58.110
comes to me and he says,
Jimmy says,
I don't like the way you're walking.

1315
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:00.130
And I said,
well,

1316
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.570
<v 2>I'm just a little bit sore,
but everything's fine.
And he said,
well,</v>

1317
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.620
we're going over.
We were at a 70 or a 78 at that time.

1318
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:10.810
I'm Florence Belgium.
He says,

1319
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:13.910
we'll go over to the [inaudible] and just check you out.

1320
01:32:13.911 --> 01:32:18.850
And so I go over to the hospital and shallow out with him and the next till you

1321
01:32:18.851 --> 01:32:23.851
knew I got a cast from here down to my rear end and they x rayed me and,

1322
01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:30.090
and I had a broken back that they hadn't treated so,

1323
01:32:31.181 --> 01:32:35.280
uh,
back to the hospital.
And so we do,

1324
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:39.410
I went through that,
went back to the third military,
uh,

1325
01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.480
uh,
well they had them.

1326
01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.020
What they did is they had a central medical section and they run all the pilots

1327
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:54.340
through there and then they would determine what happens to you.

1328
01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:57.750
And so I kept saying,
well,
I want to go back to the squadron.

1329
01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.500
And so they said,
well,
okay,
we're going to,
you got your cast.

1330
01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.550
And then they took the big cast off and put a small and on and said,

1331
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:10.930
we're going to send you to England for at least 30 days through a flat house.

1332
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:15.550
We'll flack houses where they run by the,
uh,

1333
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.163
uh,

1334
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:22.630
Red Cross and mainly were for bomber crews.

1335
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.050
The bomber crew had,

1336
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:29.140
we're getting a little nervous or something,

1337
01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:31.300
they'd send them down for a week or so.

1338
01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:36.301
And so they sent me to this black cows and the first thing I get in trouble with

1339
01:33:37.731 --> 01:33:42.731
with the Red Cross is just fighter pilots like to talk about combat and flying.

1340
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.400
The bomber guys didn't want to have anything to do with that kind of

1341
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:49.540
conversation.

1342
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:53.980
So the Red Cross gets upset with me and they told me I got to keep my mouth
shut.

1343
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:57.790
And I said,
well fine,
I'll keep my mouth shut but I'm going to do this.

1344
01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:02.950
Give me a set of borders and all go off to some base cause I'm,

1345
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:05.470
I can walk.
So I'd,

1346
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:10.270
I had a little plan used to be get your flying time,

1347
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.870
your pay.
He had to fly four hours a month.

1348
01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.030
So I would have,
I'd write a set of orders and said,
I,

1349
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.280
I'll just temporary duty and I want four hours flying time.

1350
01:34:27.071 --> 01:34:30.610
So I go off to some base and with,

1351
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.530
with a small cast on and uh,
uh,

1352
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:38.830
I'd say I'd walk in and say,
here's my orders.

1353
01:34:38.831 --> 01:34:40.620
I need four hours flying time.

1354
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:43.940
So they'd arranged and I fly for four hours and,

1355
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.110
and go back to the flack house.

1356
01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:51.490
And a couple of days later I had rights and more orders and go some place else.

1357
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:55.510
So I got deployed a number of aircraft while I was there.

1358
01:34:55.511 --> 01:34:58.040
And so pretty soon my 30 days are

1359
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.401
<v 4>over.</v>

1360
01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:03.401
I go back to third mental medical and they send me back to the squadron.

1361
01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.570
And [inaudible] was not happy to see me at all.

1362
01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.880
And at that time I got orders to report to general spotted corridors and in

1363
01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:18.770
Paris and he said,
um,

1364
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:21.470
they didn't tell me what I was going down there for.

1365
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.040
And some Colonel Kim,
uh,
came to the squadron.

1366
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:29.480
He's also assigned on this same deal,
same several orders.

1367
01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:33.730
And so we'd go down to Paris together and uh,

1368
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.320
his name was in Galito and he ended up,
uh,

1369
01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.870
two or three star general and he had declarations from his neck down to his

1370
01:35:41.871 --> 01:35:45.590
waist already.
And so,
uh,

1371
01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:49.760
I get down to Paris and I'm going to get the distinguished service cross.

1372
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:53.230
Well outside of,
um,
Leonard Scott,

1373
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.750
we never really told me what the distinguished service costs was.

1374
01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:01.630
I wasn't sure what we were about to get.
And,
um,

1375
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:02.803
anyway,
we,

1376
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.910
we got that and went back to the squadron are again thinking everything at least

1377
01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.800
is pretty close to right.

1378
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:13.040
And Berg says you're going home.

1379
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:16.130
And so that was the end of that.

1380
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:21.580
Except I'm grounded and that's why I'm going home.

1381
01:36:21.771 --> 01:36:26.510
I'm grounded and so I hadn't,
I had all these records with me and you know,

1382
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.250
we officers then I suppose they still do.
You carried your own records with you?

1383
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.160
So I'm going home grounded.
I got my records.

1384
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:38.481
Well,

1385
01:36:38.481 --> 01:36:42.980
I still have those records and they were in a foot locker down in my hang or

1386
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:47.210
nobody else ever caught him.
Yeah.
Um,

1387
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:51.620
I got home and took a medical and passed it.

1388
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:56.800
And so I'm back on flying duty.
The war's still on.
Uh,

1389
01:36:57.130 --> 01:37:00.770
it looks like we could,
might be,
uh,
uh,

1390
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.300
going out to the Pacific to make the invasions is van.

1391
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.740
I'm applying the latest peep,
51 51 h,

1392
01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.510
uh,
got married and,
uh,

1393
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:17.540
with my childhood sweetheart,
who I met when she was 15,

1394
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:21.620
and everything is right in the world.

1395
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:26.621
And in Harry Truman dropped the bomb and ruined a perfectly good one.

1396
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.900
<v 1>So
was
sister</v>

1397
01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:37.860
<v 4>Bobbie and I stayed until 1948.</v>

1398
01:37:37.861 --> 01:37:42.861
And I got to play our first jets and had a wonderful time.

1399
01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.990
We had a wonderful experience,
learned a heck of a lot,

1400
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.950
got to do things that would've never happened to me,

1401
01:37:49.951 --> 01:37:54.570
and if we hadn't had gotten involved in all of this,

1402
01:37:54.571 --> 01:37:56.040
so worked out

1403
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.810
<v 0>great.
And so how did you two end up a meeting?</v>

1404
01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:04.540
<v 5>Well,
I had this old antique airplane and,
uh,</v>

1405
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:07.360
I was looking for a hanger for this airplane and uh,

1406
01:38:07.361 --> 01:38:11.980
and Jim was building hangers at the time and this little little bitty airport up

1407
01:38:11.981 --> 01:38:14.620
in the valley above Santa Barbara called Santa Ynez.

1408
01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:19.550
And he helped me build a hangar.
And,
uh,
it,

1409
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.090
it was kind of interesting,
the attraction.

1410
01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:27.250
And in fact,
my wife brought this up.
He said,

1411
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.031
she said,
you know,

1412
01:38:28.031 --> 01:38:31.840
you're going to have three generations of warriors talking on these telephones.

1413
01:38:32.230 --> 01:38:34.990
I mean,
today on this podcast,
uh,

1414
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.400
you get Jim Konkol on 30 years later,
you've got Charlie pump,

1415
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:41.440
30 years later you got Jocko Jocko Willink.

1416
01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:46.810
He said on it,
there's,
there's there an attraction with warriors.

1417
01:38:46.811 --> 01:38:49.000
I don't know what it is with our brains,
you know,

1418
01:38:49.001 --> 01:38:53.520
but there's some kind of a kind of a magnetism or something and you just kinda

1419
01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:57.640
identify with other guys that have been in combat.
And so even though they're,

1420
01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:01.780
I don't know,
there are probably a hundred pilots on this airport in June.

1421
01:39:01.781 --> 01:39:06.760
And I kind of hit it off without even knowing our history.

1422
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:10.930
Uh,
and the more we get to know each other,
this is like 20 years ago,

1423
01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:14.020
the more we got to know each other,
the more,
uh,

1424
01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:18.700
similar philosophies of life,
you know,
we had.
And,
uh,

1425
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.990
and so it's not just our flying because Jim still flies.
Of course I still fly.

1426
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:27.260
And,
uh,
and of course I've got an old antique airplane that,
uh,

1427
01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.270
from his training days,
uh,
and,
uh,

1428
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:32.860
but more than that,

1429
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:37.390
the technology has changed that the enemy has changed,

1430
01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.160
uh,
from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq,
you know,

1431
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:47.660
that,
but the,
but the camaraderie of military guys,
you know,

1432
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:52.750
they're just something and,
and a lot of stuff that you talk about Jocko,
uh,

1433
01:39:52.930 --> 01:39:56.950
in your podcast and then your books,
just the,
you know,

1434
01:39:56.951 --> 01:40:00.100
the fact that we're all accountable.

1435
01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:03.700
We are responsible not just for our lives,
but for our buddies.

1436
01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:08.330
And there's something about that,
that community of warriors,
uh,

1437
01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.330
that,
that really connects.
So that's how Jim and I got started.
The,

1438
01:40:13.331 --> 01:40:17.620
built the hanger for me and I moved in,
my wife made a,

1439
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:22.700
a man cave out of it.
And so,
uh,
I mean that,
that's,
we are,

1440
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.220
we're,
we're sitting here doing this.

1441
01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.340
<v 0>Yeah,
that was,
we,
we,</v>

1442
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.910
we joked about that on the first time you were on the podcast that,

1443
01:40:28.130 --> 01:40:32.240
that you had the ultimate man cave.
And,
you know,
I kind of threw that out there,

1444
01:40:32.241 --> 01:40:33.200
but now that I've been here,

1445
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:37.910
it is actually factually true that you do have the ultimate man cave.
And,
uh,

1446
01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.640
I'm going to take a gulp and take a bunch of pictures.
Maybe we can do a video,

1447
01:40:40.641 --> 01:40:44.330
like a little tour of it and just show everyone kind of what this is all about.

1448
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.970
And,
and all the,
I mean the,

1449
01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:51.470
the history that you have here and the pictures and the photographs and,
and the,

1450
01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:55.250
you know,
pieces of aircraft and everything else is,
it's,
it's phenomenal.

1451
01:40:55.251 --> 01:40:58.870
The look at,
and you know,
it was interesting.
So when I got here,

1452
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:04.240
um,
you know,
you,
you were walking around and in gyms,
hangers,

1453
01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:08.500
a few hangers down and you know,
you said,
hey,
Jim wants to show you something.

1454
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.710
And I said,
oh,
well,
you know,
okay.
You know,

1455
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:14.660
I didn't really have any idea what it was.
So we,

1456
01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.970
we get out and we walked from your hanger and we're walking down towards Jim

1457
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:21.200
Jim's hangar and you know,

1458
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:25.390
we shake hands and meet and meet Jim for the first time.
And he says,
you know,

1459
01:41:25.391 --> 01:41:29.410
I want to show you something.
And I say,
Oh,
okay,
you know,
neat.
And he goes,

1460
01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.430
it's a picture.
And I said,
oh awesome.
And I've no idea what to expect.

1461
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.530
And he says,
it's someone you know.
And I said,
okay,

1462
01:41:38.531 --> 01:41:42.790
well that narrows it down.
But I don't know.
I don't know who I have in common,

1463
01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.270
you know,
with GM or I don't know.
I've been no idea.

1464
01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.910
And no idea who this was over this picture was going to be.

1465
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:52.680
So we go to gyms man-cave,

1466
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:57.820
which is an each equally impressive and awesome,
you know,
hangar with,

1467
01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.810
you know,
his personal effects and pictures and models and parts of aircraft and

1468
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:05.430
everything else.
And he walks into a corner and,

1469
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:09.660
and he picks up a picture and he hands me this picture and the picture,

1470
01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:12.910
I immediately,
I know who it is and it's,

1471
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:15.610
it's this second lieutenant from the Marine Corps.

1472
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:19.660
It's a picture of a young Chinese American second lieutenant from the Marine

1473
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.060
Corps.
And it,
it's,

1474
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:27.120
it's Kurt Lee who I talked about in podcast number 53 colder than hell.

1475
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.220
And I went kind of off about him a little bit.

1476
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:37.270
I talked about him a lot because if you remember from this particular podcast

1477
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:41.140
and from that particular book,
this was at the chosen reservoir and,

1478
01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:45.130
and this second lieutenant currently,

1479
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.070
he was,
while these guys are engaged in,

1480
01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:52.120
in just intense continuous combat,

1481
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:56.680
in order to lead his men,
he fashioned a,

1482
01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:02.150
a fluorescent orange vest out of some signaling material.

1483
01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:04.810
And,
or out of some parachute material or something,

1484
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:09.100
he made this vest for himself so that he would be completely visible to all of

1485
01:43:09.101 --> 01:43:09.760
his men.

1486
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.930
Now that also means he's obviously completely visible to the enemy as well.

1487
01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:17.620
But that was what kind of a leader that this guy was.
He,
look,

1488
01:43:17.630 --> 01:43:20.710
I'm going to take extra risk,
but,
um,
we're,
um,
we're gonna make this happen.

1489
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:22.020
I'm in charge of going to know where,

1490
01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.720
where I am and you can follow me through whatever.

1491
01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:29.650
And it's an incredible story of,
of heroism.

1492
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.120
So that's the picture that Jim puts in front of me is this picture of,

1493
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.890
of currently,
and I'm,
I kind of look at him and I,
you know,
and,

1494
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:41.920
and it turns out that you,
that you knew curtly

1495
01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.720
Kirk was a good friend,
a dear friend,

1496
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:51.980
quite a store,
and I have tremendous for

1497
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.170
<v 2>him,</v>

1498
01:43:52.170 --> 01:43:57.170
I have tremendous respect for his principles to the last day of the,

1499
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:02.930
before he died.
And,
uh,
uh,
fond memories.

1500
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:06.020
<v 0>Yeah,
it was,
it's an interesting story too,</v>

1501
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:07.610
because that's another thing that we talked about,

1502
01:44:07.611 --> 01:44:10.550
wasn't part of that what he did at one point in that book,

1503
01:44:10.551 --> 01:44:11.930
and I don't remember it specifically,

1504
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:16.931
but he basically dresses someone down in the middle of a firefight for not

1505
01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:20.540
giving him,
you're not calling him Sir or not calling them lieutenant.
And,

1506
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.070
you know,
I'm just kind of saying,
hey guys,
you know,

1507
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:25.190
you need to think about when the right time to do this is.
But as you said,

1508
01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:30.340
he was an extremely principled person and kept those principles at all times.

1509
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.030
<v 2>Well,
you know,
he,
um,</v>

1510
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.340
he led the group of Marines,
uh,

1511
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:40.460
through the night to relieve Fox company,

1512
01:44:40.461 --> 01:44:45.340
which is quite a well known story in the Marine Corps.
Uh,

1513
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:50.390
poker company was holding a hill that commanded the escape route for the whole,

1514
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:57.780
the chosen reservoir group,
army,
uh,
uh,

1515
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:01.330
marine corps,
and they,

1516
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.590
they were under heavy attack.

1517
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:09.430
The idea was to get down and support them and currently I could speak three or

1518
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:15.590
four different dialects of Chinese.
And so he's leading these,

1519
01:45:15.591 --> 01:45:20.390
he's of the scout who was actually leading the whole contingent of marines

1520
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:25.460
through the night through heavy snow,
uh,
terrible,

1521
01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:26.840
terrible conditions.

1522
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:32.410
And actually as a came across a Chinese centuries,

1523
01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.393
troops,

1524
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:39.620
he would talk to them in Chinese and they got the whole,

1525
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:44.600
the whole contingent got through.
And uh,
uh,

1526
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:49.370
they made it in time.
They relieve Fox company a tremendous story.

1527
01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:50.321
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1528
01:45:50.321 --> 01:45:55.150
it is unbelievable story and unbelievable that you handed that picture to me

1529
01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:58.960
and,
and that you knew him.
I mean,
that's just this phenomenal,

1530
01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.140
phenomenal situation.
Um,
was there anything,
Charlie,
that when,

1531
01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:07.660
when you were on last time,
was there anything that,
you know,
I know we,

1532
01:46:07.690 --> 01:46:10.770
we talked for a few hours,
I think.
Yeah.

1533
01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:14.440
Was there any major things that as you listen to it again,

1534
01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:15.880
that you said to yourself,
you know what,
I should,

1535
01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.380
I should talk about this as well.

1536
01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.330
<v 5>Not that nothing,
which,
uh,
specifically comes to mind.
Uh,</v>

1537
01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:27.010
but now that you know that the three,
uh,

1538
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:28.720
warriors are here together,

1539
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:32.220
and I think we should talk a little bit about philosophies of combat and,

1540
01:46:32.221 --> 01:46:36.490
and the fears that we faced.
A,
because I think,
you know,
to the general public,

1541
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:40.930
the vast majority of your listeners and viewers,
uh,

1542
01:46:40.931 --> 01:46:45.910
are not in the military.
Uh,
and so,
you know,
my,
my thought is,
well,

1543
01:46:46.090 --> 01:46:48.520
how do they relate?
Oh,
it's interesting.
History.
You know,

1544
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:52.080
I love history of the greater generation and,
uh,

1545
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:56.030
I love your history as well,
and the things that are going on.
Uh,
you know,

1546
01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:00.660
today that the guys at the point of the spear,
but what does that mean to the,

1547
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:05.880
you know,
to the average guy,
you know,
uh,
who,
who's never been in the military.

1548
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:10.950
There's some principles I believe that the three of us learned in combat that

1549
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:15.420
can,
that's transferable I think to,
to all challenges of life.

1550
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.070
You know,
that just,
you know,
the fact that you face your fears,
you know,

1551
01:47:20.071 --> 01:47:22.980
you step into the,
into the box and,

1552
01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:27.981
and Jim bid it and you've done it where you could have run the other way.

1553
01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:33.000
You know,
you,
you could have quit a,
you could have checked out,
but you know,

1554
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:37.530
I mean,
all,
all three of us felt like that we had a duty,
a duty to our country,

1555
01:47:37.810 --> 01:47:42.130
duty to our brotherhood.
Uh,
and so we,
you know,
picked up the,

1556
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:47.970
picked up the baton and,
and continued on.
Um,
and so,
uh,

1557
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.110
you know,
to me that's sort of the important part,
the part that you can,

1558
01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:56.710
you can transfer more than just the military history that we all have.
The,

1559
01:47:56.810 --> 01:48:01.710
the philosophy of meeting challenges because I'm convinced,

1560
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:05.530
you know,
you can,
you can be in just as much of a,

1561
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:08.940
have a challenge in your life.
You don't,
you don't have to be flying.

1562
01:48:08.941 --> 01:48:12.910
Jet Airplanes are running around his seal teams.
Uh,

1563
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.440
you can face challenges when a person is diagnosed with cancer or loses a child

1564
01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:22.470
or for that matter gets cut out of your lane on the freeway.
Uh,

1565
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.120
you have a choice and a,
and the choice that you make,

1566
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:30.480
it certainly depends on not only your character,

1567
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:35.481
but then it also transmit into the outcome of the character that you continue to

1568
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:41.070
be in life.
And so while we're,
you know,
30,

1569
01:48:41.071 --> 01:48:44.760
60 years apart in our,
in our generations here,

1570
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.510
our philosophies of life and the warrior,

1571
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:53.910
a psyche,
uh,
continues.
And so,
uh,

1572
01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:59.090
I'm just really,
really proud to be a part of this and proud to be,
uh,
uh,

1573
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.470
with you Jocko.
And of course with you,
Jim,

1574
01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:05.460
Jim and I see each other probably couple times a month.
We get together,

1575
01:49:05.461 --> 01:49:10.050
we have dinner or wives,
you know,
Cook good meals,

1576
01:49:10.051 --> 01:49:13.170
and we'd go fly sometimes.
And,
uh,

1577
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:17.370
and there's a certain silent language,
I think,

1578
01:49:17.371 --> 01:49:21.730
between us,
uh,
that we don't even have to talk to each other.
Uh,

1579
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.660
and yet we understand what,
what's going on.
You know,

1580
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:28.500
we're where we're coming from in the,
the accountability that,

1581
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:33.000
that we share.
Uh,
just because of the experiences that we've had.

1582
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:38.850
I got asked the question the other day,
I was working with a company.

1583
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:40.410
I was actually,
no,
it was in a cohort with a company.

1584
01:49:40.411 --> 01:49:44.520
I was doing a speech and I was doing some Q and a at the end.

1585
01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:48.460
And a guy asked me,
how do you define

1586
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.730
<v 0>character and how do you build it?</v>

1587
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.530
And I'd actually never been asked this question before.
And quite frankly,

1588
01:49:56.531 --> 01:49:58.740
I hadn't really thought about it very much.
And,

1589
01:49:58.741 --> 01:50:02.620
and this guy had thought about it and I talked to him afterwards and it was

1590
01:50:02.621 --> 01:50:06.550
something that he was,
why he really wanted to hear me talk,

1591
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:08.890
because he wanted to get my perspective on this.

1592
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.120
And I answered the question like this.

1593
01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.950
I said,
you know,
for me,

1594
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.760
character is not a very complex thing for me.

1595
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.020
Character is you do what's right.

1596
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:34.150
You do what's right,
you do the right thing.
That's what you do,

1597
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:38.650
and if you do the right thing,
regardless of what the consequences are,

1598
01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:43.000
that that represents character.
And so then how do you build character?

1599
01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:46.360
It's a beautiful thing because it's the same thing.

1600
01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:49.450
If you want to build character,
you do the right thing.

1601
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:52.240
You do the right thing for yourself.
You do the right thing for your family.

1602
01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:54.880
You do the right thing for your,
the people that you know.

1603
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.500
You do the right thing for your community.

1604
01:50:56.501 --> 01:50:59.020
You do the right thing for your country.
That's what you do.

1605
01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:04.240
And now on an individual level,
those things are hard things often,

1606
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:07.210
right?
If those are hard things,
you have to make the right decisions.

1607
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:11.230
You have to live a disciplined life.
Those build character,

1608
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:15.580
those little things that you do on a daily basis to make yourself better,

1609
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:18.880
to improve your health,
to improve your,

1610
01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:23.320
your situation in life.
You're doing those things.
They're hard to do.

1611
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:25.540
And when you do those things,

1612
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:30.040
they build your character and ultimately they lead to your,
your your character.

1613
01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:32.290
Being a good character as opposed to a bad one.

1614
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.330
But I'd never been asked that question before.

1615
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:39.510
And I thought that the simplicity of it is pretty clear when you think about it.

1616
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.630
You know,
when you think about the people that you know,
you don't know.

1617
01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.590
When I think about the,

1618
01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:46.690
the people that I worked for in the military or that work for me up or down the

1619
01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:50.230
chain of command,
what,
what is it that made them people that,

1620
01:51:50.231 --> 01:51:51.490
cause you know there's bad care,
you know,

1621
01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:54.460
we can't sit here and pretend like everybody of that just because you did in the

1622
01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:57.040
military,
you've got great character.
That's absolutely not true.

1623
01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:58.780
But what about those people?
And I,
you know,

1624
01:51:58.781 --> 01:52:03.010
I thought through this and in three seconds as this guy asked me this question,

1625
01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:04.421
you know,
I thought to myself,
well,

1626
01:52:04.421 --> 01:52:07.300
what about the guys that I know that have good character that I look to and say,

1627
01:52:07.301 --> 01:52:10.930
yeah,
this,
this person I trust,
you know,
without question,

1628
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:12.070
what kind of person is that?

1629
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.740
That's the person that you know is going to do the right thing all the time,

1630
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:16.150
regardless of the consequences.

1631
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:21.860
<v 5>Couple of things about that.
First of all,
it isn't easy.
In fact,</v>

1632
01:52:21.861 --> 01:52:25.670
usually the right thing is the toughest thing.
You know,
it,
it,
it's the,

1633
01:52:25.671 --> 01:52:26.540
it's the hard decision.

1634
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:30.620
The second thing is it doesn't always turn out for the best.

1635
01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:33.910
We need to do the right thing.
Lots of times we stumble,
you know,
and,

1636
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:38.500
and your listeners may think that the three of us,
you know,
have always,
uh,

1637
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:42.980
you know,
been on the top of the heap,
but all three of us have fallen short.

1638
01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:46.130
You know,
I mean,
uh,
I'll tell you this,
a

1639
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.510
<v 0>languishing in prison camp,
the first,
the first month in that prison camp,</v>

1640
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:55.130
I laid there in,
in,
in blood and sweat and tears and,
uh,

1641
01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:55.720
and,

1642
01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:00.720
and my mental state was just in the tank because I'd given up fighter pilots and

1643
01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.630
not supposed to give up.

1644
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:07.710
Jim and I weren't trained to surrender and,
and my,
my mental,

1645
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:10.640
the depression that I had just because of that.

1646
01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:13.760
And I think that largely in life,
you know,

1647
01:53:13.761 --> 01:53:17.630
when you do do the right thing and it doesn't turn out right,

1648
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:21.050
then you have to get up,
dust yourself off,

1649
01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.910
get back in the back in this,
in the fray.
And that's tough to do.

1650
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:29.530
You know,
the last thing you want to do when,
when,

1651
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:34.430
when you're getting beat up every from every side and you'd really want to quit,

1652
01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:39.380
the last thing you want to do is to,
is to stand up and be forceful again to,

1653
01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:42.770
to,
you know,
to,
to take control of the situation.

1654
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:47.540
And yet it's those kinds of challenges in life that build that character,

1655
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:52.690
you know,
that,
that really make the difference between,
you know,
the,
the,

1656
01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.890
the,
the positive life,

1657
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:59.970
the life lived well and those guys and gals that,
uh,

1658
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:01.820
that don't make those kinds of decisions.

1659
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:05.690
And you're talking about when you were,

1660
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.600
when you were depressed,
when you were laying there,

1661
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:12.920
it's because you felt like you had failed,
right?
You felt like you had broken,

1662
01:54:12.921 --> 01:54:17.921
you'd felt like you weren't the man that you thought you were and they'd found

1663
01:54:18.321 --> 01:54:23.120
your breaking point and you'd found your breaking point and you didn't like

1664
01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:27.680
that.
Yup.
And what if I remember correctly,
what,
what,

1665
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:31.100
what got you through that was,
you know,
you,

1666
01:54:31.101 --> 01:54:34.970
you went broke down into going to your,
one of your cellmates and said,
well,

1667
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:39.800
this is horrible.
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a disaster.
I'm a failure.
I broke.

1668
01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.100
And he kind of Said,
Oh yeah,
welcome to the club.
We all break.

1669
01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:46.130
It was like one of those things.
And I think to your point,

1670
01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.580
absolutely everyone,

1671
01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:54.170
everyone has a point where they go,
oh,
you know,
I failed to here.

1672
01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:56.180
I didn't do what I was supposed to do.

1673
01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:59.570
I lacked the character that I needed at that time too.

1674
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:04.100
To be a good leader or to even stand up and fight.
One more time.
I failed.

1675
01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.930
And the point is all us all sitting around at this table and every single person

1676
01:55:08.931 --> 01:55:10.430
that's listening to this right now,

1677
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:13.580
you can find a spot in your life where you said,
you know what?
I didn't do it.

1678
01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:15.590
I didn't hold the line item.

1679
01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.160
My character broke and I wasn't the person that I should have been at that

1680
01:55:19.161 --> 01:55:21.530
moment.
And that's,
that's absolutely true.

1681
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:26.650
But what's more important than the fact then that we all get to a point where we

1682
01:55:27.081 --> 01:55:30.860
break is number one,
that everybody breaks.
And number two,

1683
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:35.000
that doesn't mean it's over.
That just me that says it's a bump in the road.

1684
01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.310
It's a bump in the road and you've got to rebuild from it.

1685
01:55:37.311 --> 01:55:41.400
You got to come back and you can,
you can do that.
And not only that,

1686
01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:44.400
but largely that bump in the road builds your character

1687
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.270
<v 5>even further because you understand your limitations and you understand that you</v>

1688
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:51.880
can overcome these things.
And you know,

1689
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:54.270
back to the story of the prisoners of war,

1690
01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:58.680
591 of us came home and from that 591 men,

1691
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:01.410
we produce 17 generals and six admirals.

1692
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:03.870
And most of us retired as senior grade military officers.

1693
01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:06.680
We went back to flying planes and commanding fleets and,

1694
01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:10.590
and battalions all over the world.
We have a bunch of congressmen,

1695
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.700
two United States senators,
a vice presidential Kennedy President or candidate,

1696
01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.300
a all from 591 guys.
Uh,
and,
and so and,

1697
01:56:19.301 --> 01:56:23.280
and we all felt like we'd fail.
We all felt like we'd given up.

1698
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:26.880
But even because of that adversity,
you know,
we,

1699
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:29.400
we came out stronger than ever before.

1700
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:34.410
I think this really goes also to the fact that,
I mean,

1701
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.440
what you're saying is essentially the fact that you have to know,

1702
01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:45.000
you have to understand what your weaknesses are.
You really do.
And,

1703
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:50.540
and you have to understand human beings and what human beings weaknesses are.

1704
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:55.260
And for me,
you know what,
I've talked about this a ton on this podcast.

1705
01:56:55.261 --> 01:56:56.490
You have to understand that there's,

1706
01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:00.510
that human beings are capable of doing very dark and horrible things.

1707
01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.620
And if you can't,

1708
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:06.540
and if you can't recognize that you yourself are capable of the dark and

1709
01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:08.730
horrible things end of the week things,

1710
01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:14.180
well then you're not really being truthful with yourself and with your existence

1711
01:57:14.221 --> 01:57:17.160
really as a human being.
And you ignore those things.

1712
01:57:17.161 --> 01:57:18.300
And I think when you ignore those things,

1713
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:21.120
I think that's when they sneak up on you.
I think you're right.
You know,

1714
01:57:21.170 --> 01:57:26.170
I think that's the crux of our real serious challenge with suicide within the

1715
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:28.530
veteran population.
And,

1716
01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:33.180
and I worked on this and Jim's worked on SNL and you've worked on it as well.
Uh,

1717
01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.540
and what are the advantages we had as prisoners of war is that we,

1718
01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:43.150
that we exposed ourselves,
you know,
we recognize our weakness and,

1719
01:57:43.151 --> 01:57:47.520
and to a man,
we knew that we weren't as strong as we wanted to be.

1720
01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.430
And so,
um,
just,

1721
01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:53.850
just that community that we built within the prison camp,

1722
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:57.150
tapping on walls and tugging on wires and our secret codes,

1723
01:57:57.510 --> 01:58:00.000
very difficult to communicate with everybody else,

1724
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:03.630
but we had leadership there that turned that,
that,

1725
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.890
that turned that whole thing around.
And,
uh,
and the leadership head,

1726
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:11.890
wait a minute,
you're not a victim.
I'm a very junior officer there.
You,

1727
01:58:11.891 --> 01:58:15.870
and I'm a lieutenant JG.
Wait a minute.
I'm in a communist prison camp.

1728
01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:20.370
I am leading him for open wounds.
I have no medical care.
And,
um,

1729
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:23.940
I'm starving.
I've been tortured,
uh,

1730
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:28.560
I'm down to 115 pounds and I'm not on the defensive.
I'm not a victim.

1731
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:32.040
Now you pull up your big boy pants,
let's get on with this thing.

1732
01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:34.730
We had a war to fight and,
and,
and,

1733
01:58:34.731 --> 01:58:37.880
and so the leadership totally re the,

1734
01:58:37.881 --> 01:58:40.880
they refocus the whole purpose of,

1735
01:58:40.881 --> 01:58:44.680
of our being there and that and,
and gave us a mission.

1736
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:47.500
And I think that's one of the challenges we faced.

1737
01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:51.760
When a guy gets out of the military or a gal and takes off that uniform,

1738
01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:56.240
he loses the purpose,
he loses that mission.
Um,
and it,

1739
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:57.250
it he uses,

1740
01:58:57.251 --> 01:59:01.720
loses that community and he puts on a coat and tie or you know,

1741
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:06.721
puts into a golf shirt and goes out and tries to reconnect with people.

1742
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.960
Um,
and at gym is what you were talking about,
you know,

1743
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:14.740
at being in civilian clothes and Paris and you,

1744
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:19.600
you were looking for some way to reconnect it with,
with your unit.

1745
01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.430
And I run quickly here,
they come marching down the champs Ailey's a den,

1746
01:59:24.431 --> 01:59:29.210
Alito and,
and,
and,
and there you were back in uniform.
And,

1747
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:34.090
and,
and so you and,
and you had,
uh,
uh,
wrestling Dettra,
you know,

1748
01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:38.550
you had a purpose,
a reason to live just because of,

1749
01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:41.650
of the group that you were associated with.
And,

1750
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:44.500
and whenever I speak publicly,
I,
you know,

1751
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:49.030
I challenged an audience that if you've got,
if you know a veteran,
you know,
uh,

1752
01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.060
talk to him,
you know,
give them a purpose,
uh,

1753
01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:58.330
invite him to interfere into your house or your club or your church and,

1754
01:59:58.331 --> 02:00:00.400
uh,
it may make a difference.

1755
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:04.180
And that way you can serve your country by serving those who served their

1756
02:00:04.181 --> 02:00:05.014
country.

1757
02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:08.100
<v 0>Yeah.
It's,
uh,
it's interesting,
you know,
Jim,
you Kinda,</v>

1758
02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:12.360
you kind of made that a joking comment,
you know,
hey,

1759
02:00:12.361 --> 02:00:16.560
Truman dropped the bomb and ruined a perfectly good war and we all laughed at
it.

1760
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:21.450
But we all also kind of understand that there's some level of,

1761
02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:25.530
of reality to that.
And you think when you're in the military,
and I always,

1762
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:26.341
you know,
I was,

1763
02:00:26.341 --> 02:00:29.730
I was talking about the fact that when I joined the navy was 1990 and I just

1764
02:00:29.731 --> 02:00:32.430
missed the first Gulf War.
And like,

1765
02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:35.370
I was completely dismayed by that because you know,

1766
02:00:35.371 --> 02:00:40.170
there hadn't been a war since basically since Vietnam.
So it'd been 20 years.

1767
02:00:40.171 --> 02:00:41.070
And I'm thinking,
okay,
there was,

1768
02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.500
there was my shot to fight in a war and I just missed it.
And,

1769
02:00:45.630 --> 02:00:49.110
and so that,
that what you're talking about of hey,

1770
02:00:49.530 --> 02:00:51.920
you feel like this is your purpose and,

1771
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:55.980
and this is what I'm supposed to be doing with my life and it's a higher purpose

1772
02:00:55.981 --> 02:00:58.770
and it's a higher cause and it's something that is,

1773
02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:02.490
is bigger than you.
And so when you're a part of it,

1774
02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.310
it feels good and you don't want to participate and you want to help.

1775
02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.220
And then when it's over,
you look around and you go,
wait a second,

1776
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:11.460
what's my higher purpose now?
And,
and I think you're right.

1777
02:01:11.461 --> 02:01:15.720
That's where people get into trouble because they're so tied to their old higher

1778
02:01:15.721 --> 02:01:19.230
purpose and they can't transition to the new one.
And you know,

1779
02:01:19.231 --> 02:01:23.490
I get great feedback from,
from vets all the time that they do,
they open up,
they,

1780
02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.590
okay,
well what am I going to do now?
That's what,
that's what I'm looking at.

1781
02:01:25.591 --> 02:01:28.590
What's your next mission going to be and you know what your next mission might

1782
02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:30.270
be being a good dad,
right?

1783
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:32.550
That might be your next mission or you know what your next mission might be.

1784
02:01:32.690 --> 02:01:35.730
It might be building airplane hangers.
You know,

1785
02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.040
you don't know what your next mission is going to be,

1786
02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:42.260
but find what your next mission is going to be.
Make it something productive,

1787
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.390
make it something that's going to impact,
you know,

1788
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:47.240
at least you and your family and get good at it.

1789
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:50.990
Even if you pick something that's somewhat selfish and you say,
Hey,
I want to,

1790
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:55.490
I want to surf on every continent.
Okay,

1791
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:57.020
that sounds like a good mission to me actually.

1792
02:01:57.021 --> 02:02:00.140
That sounds like a really good issue.
I might have to participate in that one,

1793
02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.120
but you know,
you come up with something you can't,
you can't.

1794
02:02:02.121 --> 02:02:04.280
Here's my mission and this is what I'm going to do with it and this is how I'm

1795
02:02:04.281 --> 02:02:06.080
going to go forward.
But yeah,

1796
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:09.980
I think that the lack of purpose and the lack of mission that guys stumble into

1797
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:15.050
is problematic.
And it is problematic too because in the military it's,

1798
02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.530
I don't want to make the sound the wrong way because I always talk about the

1799
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:23.240
fact that for us we didn't get tasked missions.
Like when,
when,

1800
02:02:23.241 --> 02:02:25.520
when I was in Iraq,
we,
there was no higher up telling me,

1801
02:02:25.521 --> 02:02:27.560
you guys are going to take this target.
Are you guys going to take that?

1802
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:30.350
That happened occasionally,
probably less than 5% of the time.

1803
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:33.950
Most of the time we developed our own missions.
But overall,

1804
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:35.060
when you're in the military,

1805
02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:38.690
you have a broad mission that you're trying to accomplish,

1806
02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:41.450
which again is for societal good.

1807
02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:45.860
And so when that disappears,
guess what?
You have some autonomy now.

1808
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.860
Now what are you going to choose as your next mission?
What are you going to do?

1809
02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.080
How are you going to improve yourself?
How are you gonna Improve Your life,

1810
02:02:51.081 --> 02:02:55.340
your families,
your communities,
or your countries or the world?

1811
02:02:55.341 --> 02:02:56.450
What are you going to do to make it better?

1812
02:02:56.570 --> 02:03:00.060
And you'd see the vets that are out there that are doing that and they,
they,

1813
02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.903
they,
they,

1814
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:02.860
<v 5>big sale,
big sale.
You know,</v>

1815
02:03:02.861 --> 02:03:05.890
when I was in the hospital at Great Lakes after the war,

1816
02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:09.910
I was in a hospital up there.
I mean,
I didn't have any serious problems,

1817
02:03:09.911 --> 02:03:14.260
but I was in a debriefing thing and,
but I had figured out in that hospital,

1818
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:19.310
and even on the way home that my,
my next stage of life isn't going.
I'm,

1819
02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:23.380
I'm,
I'm going to,
uh,
to try to forget all of that six years of a,

1820
02:03:23.410 --> 02:03:27.940
in that prison camp,
that six years of pain.
Um,
and I even had it figured out.

1821
02:03:27.941 --> 02:03:30.910
I'm going to go to some little town in the middle of nowhere where they've never

1822
02:03:30.911 --> 02:03:31.870
heard of Charlie plumb.

1823
02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:35.530
And if they have all changed my name and because I don't want anybody knowing my

1824
02:03:35.531 --> 02:03:39.790
history,
I want,
you know,
I want to slide back into the shadows of life.

1825
02:03:40.190 --> 02:03:44.380
And,
and I,
I was serious about that.
You know,
my,
my high,

1826
02:03:44.410 --> 02:03:48.700
my high school sweetheart had just a file for divorce three months before I came

1827
02:03:48.701 --> 02:03:52.720
home.
And,
uh,
and so I was,
you know what I mean?

1828
02:03:52.721 --> 02:03:55.510
I felt free and I felt energized,

1829
02:03:55.511 --> 02:03:59.380
but I really didn't want to have anything to do with the Vietnam war or any of

1830
02:03:59.381 --> 02:04:03.610
the pain that I had faced there,
saw no value in it.
And I was,

1831
02:04:04.090 --> 02:04:08.920
so that was the first guy back from the war in,
in the Midwest and the,

1832
02:04:08.921 --> 02:04:12.370
so,
so the news media,
you know,
really wanted to talk to me.

1833
02:04:12.371 --> 02:04:17.371
And so I found myself surrounded by about 150 photographers and reporters in the

1834
02:04:17.381 --> 02:04:19.960
basement of that hospital.
And I told my story,

1835
02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:24.430
and on the way back up to my hospital room,
just as the elevator doors close,

1836
02:04:24.431 --> 02:04:26.620
this young reporter,
um,

1837
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:29.620
came up to me and I'm nose to nose with this young guy,

1838
02:04:29.621 --> 02:04:33.250
but he's got lines of anguish in his brow and tears in his eyes.
And he said,

1839
02:04:33.251 --> 02:04:35.240
Mister Plumber,
you really got to me in there.
He said,

1840
02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.680
I've had a miserable and my family's falling apart.
My job is terrible.
He said,

1841
02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.790
I even wondered if I wanted to go on living.
He said,

1842
02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:49.710
you've given me hope.
What?
Well,
I hadn't intended to give anybody any hope.

1843
02:04:49.711 --> 02:04:52.610
I'm just telling my story here.
You know,
and,
and,
and,

1844
02:04:52.611 --> 02:04:57.611
and it surprised me that there was some value in the experience.

1845
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.380
And so,
and so I said,
well,

1846
02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:04.190
if in fact that,
you know,
the,

1847
02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:08.410
the pain of that experience can help one person,
you know,
in,

1848
02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:12.390
in life,
then maybe there is a purpose to it.

1849
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:17.020
And so,
uh,
so I wrote a book,
my autobiography,
and I started to promote that book.

1850
02:05:17.021 --> 02:05:19.980
And,
uh,
and,
and I found that yes,
there,
there's,

1851
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.510
there's a lot of connection with people with challenges and you don't have to be

1852
02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:27.430
in the military to have a challenge.
And,
uh,
and,
and,

1853
02:05:27.431 --> 02:05:30.810
and while my experience might have been a little more dramatic,
you know,

1854
02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:32.580
than most,
and it's an interesting story.

1855
02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:38.380
Uh,
it's still,
you know,
the,
the,

1856
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:42.080
the challenges I faced were the challenges that,
you know,
that,

1857
02:05:42.081 --> 02:05:45.810
that a single mother trying to make ends meat makes,
you know,

1858
02:05:45.811 --> 02:05:48.810
the frustration and the loneliness and the,
and the,

1859
02:05:48.811 --> 02:05:53.670
and the lack of confidence and the feeling that you're not measuring up.

1860
02:05:53.671 --> 02:05:55.650
And you know,
all of these things,
there are,
these are,

1861
02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:59.220
these are common human feelings.
You don't have to be in a prison camp to,

1862
02:05:59.490 --> 02:06:00.340
to be in prison.

1863
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:03.490
<v 0>No,
that's it.
That's a great,
well actually I was,</v>

1864
02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:08.730
I was curse cause I'd never heard before about the flack houses and that the

1865
02:06:09.461 --> 02:06:13.600
bombers,
the bomber crews were being sent to when they'd,

1866
02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:16.990
but when they'd basically said,
all right,
where were done right now?
I mean,

1867
02:06:16.991 --> 02:06:20.680
what was the casualty rate of the bomber crews?

1868
02:06:20.770 --> 02:06:23.470
It was something completely insane,
wasn't it?

1869
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:27.700
Well it was 25 mission requirement,

1870
02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:30.340
the percentages,
so they couldn't make it.

1871
02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:36.360
Now we're talking early [inaudible] 43 it was the start of the heavy bombing

1872
02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:39.430
thing was [inaudible] 42 so let me just,

1873
02:06:39.431 --> 02:06:42.280
let me just focus it on that for one second just to explain to everyone what

1874
02:06:42.281 --> 02:06:46.270
that means.
Cause I,
I did know about the 25.
So if you were a bomber crew,

1875
02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.930
you were flying in a,
in a what,
a B,

1876
02:06:49.931 --> 02:06:54.931
1717 B 24 a be 17 or be 24 big giant flying fortresses and they would get

1877
02:06:58.061 --> 02:06:59.080
attacked,

1878
02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:03.610
ruthlessly attacked and they'd fly deep into France and on into Germany and they

1879
02:07:03.611 --> 02:07:07.120
would get swarmed and attacked by,
you know,

1880
02:07:07.121 --> 02:07:09.700
by German fighter pilots and,

1881
02:07:09.730 --> 02:07:13.750
and also antiaircraft guns from the ground.
And so it was,

1882
02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:18.780
it was hellish to get through and it was so bad that they said,

1883
02:07:19.481 --> 02:07:21.940
okay,
well all you have to do is this many missions.

1884
02:07:21.941 --> 02:07:24.520
And the number was 25 which I did know that number.

1885
02:07:25.150 --> 02:07:28.550
You got to make it through 25 of these bomb runs and you are done.

1886
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:30.550
[inaudible] that was it.
You didn't have to do anymore.

1887
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:35.850
But you're saying the chances of actually making it through those 20 was

1888
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.813
<v 3>minimal.</v>

1889
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:40.110
<v 2>What percentages were against,
you know,
sure.</v>

1890
02:07:40.111 --> 02:07:42.990
Some people are going to get through some people who are going to be shot down

1891
02:07:42.991 --> 02:07:47.770
on their first mission that don't get a second mission.
But,
uh,

1892
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:52.680
and this was the problem with the heavy bomber forces in it and we almost lost

1893
02:07:52.681 --> 02:07:53.670
that one.
I mean,

1894
02:07:53.671 --> 02:07:58.260
we came close while we were at the ragged edge and all,

1895
02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:01.260
and I'm repeating what I learned is,
uh,

1896
02:08:01.410 --> 02:08:05.670
as a youngster that time trying to be an aviation cadet,

1897
02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.810
that guys

1898
02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.110
<v 3>we're hanging on by our fingertips.
When you say we almost lost that one,</v>

1899
02:08:11.111 --> 02:08:14.320
you mean we almost had to stop the bombing campaign?
Well,

1900
02:08:14.321 --> 02:08:15.790
the British were after us.

1901
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:20.050
<v 2>They had switched to night bombing for this very same reason,</v>

1902
02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:24.580
stay away from the fighters.
And so,
uh,

1903
02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:29.850
our philosophy of heavy bombardment goes back to General Mitchell in the,

1904
02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:36.070
in the early and thirties and late twenties.
No,
in fact,

1905
02:08:36.071 --> 02:08:39.850
the early twenties that the bombers will fight their way through.

1906
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:44.910
And that was the theory of the be 17 and gosh knows they were heavily armed,

1907
02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:48.040
but they're all,

1908
02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:53.040
they were up against a determined enemy and there 500 miles from home and German

1909
02:08:55.931 --> 02:09:00.100
fighters,
all they gotta do step out and they don't like what's going on,

1910
02:09:00.101 --> 02:09:05.080
bail out.
You're going to come down and we'll go get another airplane.
But,

1911
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:06.800
uh,
uh,

1912
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:11.550
those were dark days and they were dark days until the first,
uh,

1913
02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:14.330
uh,
fighters,
the beat,
the,
uh,

1914
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:17.670
<v 3>Pete 47th could only go so deep.
Right.
Well,</v>

1915
02:09:17.671 --> 02:09:22.210
could they go like 200 miles deep at 200,
200 miles?
Yes.
And,

1916
02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:24.030
and having enough fuel to get home on.

1917
02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:28.830
And the rest of the Times that the other 300 mile round trip or 400 extra miles

1918
02:09:28.831 --> 02:09:33.180
where all the bombers by themselves by,
if it was 50 miles,
it was hell.

1919
02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:38.290
Once the fighters turned back,
uh,
so they sent for,

1920
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:39.790
uh,
they ended up with a,

1921
02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.780
with four groups of p 38 and 38 was not ready to go to war over well,

1922
02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.600
<v 2>Eh,
uh,
Germany at that time,
at the altitude,</v>

1923
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:52.840
we were having trouble with the airplane and we didn't have the latest

1924
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:57.020
modifications to the airplane.
So,
uh,

1925
02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:02.560
part of our problem was engine problems with the Allison engines,

1926
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:04.390
but they went anyway.

1927
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:09.780
And so then the 51 came along and 51 had a British engine who had,

1928
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:15.030
which had been developed in that very same uh,

1929
02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:21.370
uh,
area.
And they had,
you know,

1930
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:23.200
they weren't having the cove.

1931
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:27.760
Their engine had been designed and operate 60 degrees below zero.

1932
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:32.350
And so they match the two up in Sylvan Lake 43.

1933
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:36.710
They get the first group over there and now there's a little hope the airplane

1934
02:10:36.711 --> 02:10:40.010
could go the whole way.
The 38 had been going to go the whole way,

1935
02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:45.580
but 38 had been modified for the Pacific and there was no heat in the cockpit.

1936
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:49.490
And you're sitting up there,
it's 62 degrees below zero,

1937
02:10:49.491 --> 02:10:52.550
freezing your tail off with the oxygen,

1938
02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:56.530
the oxygen and masters actually frozen deer face.
Uh,

1939
02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.280
he came in,
you have one warm spot in the whole comp,
a cockpit,

1940
02:11:01.281 --> 02:11:04.160
and that was your right foot.
That's where the heat came in.

1941
02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:09.710
So everything else is freezing your fanny off and so,

1942
02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:12.170
and they hadn't,
so we had problems.

1943
02:11:13.130 --> 02:11:18.130
Luckily the British engine and the 51 and North Americans,

1944
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:24.470
tremendous design put together the airplane that could do the job.

1945
02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:30.440
Uh,
the,
um,
and then they could,
it could be 50 ones escort on the whole,

1946
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:34.220
the whole bank goes the whole way in and cruise around and go someplace else.

1947
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:38.750
Wow.
Uh,
the 38 could do that.
It had the fuel to do it.

1948
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:42.530
But again,
you know,

1949
02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:47.210
there's an old story about the 38th.
It kind of broke our heart.
Uh,

1950
02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:52.240
there was two great modifications to the p 38 38 at elder to lock with the

1951
02:11:53.091 --> 02:11:55.790
bombers and you're hit with fighters.

1952
02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:01.180
You can get into a scrap and the German rolls over and they had,

1953
02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:04.970
I explained the flick role that I encountered.

1954
02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:09.140
They'd do a flip role in split s make a dive to the deck.

1955
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:12.620
If a 38 did that and tried to follow them,

1956
02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:17.180
the airplane would accelerate into what we call a compressability.

1957
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:22.850
And compressability was nothing more than a shockwave off of the,
the,

1958
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:28.160
the wing that killed all the control in your emperor nod so you couldn't pull

1959
02:12:28.161 --> 02:12:28.994
out.

1960
02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.110
So all you could do is write it down until you got into what we called fit air.

1961
02:12:35.090 --> 02:12:39.350
Got Your,
uh,
then your trim tab,

1962
02:12:39.710 --> 02:12:41.060
if you set it properly,

1963
02:12:41.061 --> 02:12:45.170
would gradually bring you out of that time before he hit the ground.

1964
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:48.710
Some of them hit the ground.
So,
uh,

1965
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:53.780
and we didn't have,
we have a very slow rate of role in the 38,

1966
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:58.790
so they develop,
uh,
Iran boost.
Uh,

1967
02:12:58.850 --> 02:13:03.050
so we could actually,
we could roll with anybody.
Uh,

1968
02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:06.440
they had the dive flap,
so if you went in,

1969
02:13:06.441 --> 02:13:09.410
you could actually hit the dye flap button,

1970
02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:14.930
put that airplane straight down and dive with anybody in a German fighter.

1971
02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.790
So what a lock he did.
They got 400 sets,

1972
02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.380
shifts,
sets of dye flaps and aileron boost.

1973
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:27.220
They put it on an a,
an air force.

1974
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:30.440
It's a transport plane and they send it to England.

1975
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:34.810
You've got intercepted off the English coast.
Why?
They are?
Yeah.

1976
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:39.190
Who didn't know anything about it.
They thought it was a German con door.

1977
02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.590
400 nervous,
but they shot it down there.
There it goes.

1978
02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:48.240
All of our improvements.
And so what do you do now?

1979
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:53.220
It took quite a while to pull all those 400 units together and get them over

1980
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:56.390
there.
So for the next couple months,
uh,

1981
02:13:56.590 --> 02:14:00.450
the 38 s are doing the same old thing.
We don't have the improvement.

1982
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:05.700
P 51 comes along,
thank God,
and it can do the job.

1983
02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.230
So it's all history there.
51 said trouble.

1984
02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:14.370
I know of one that pulled out of a dive in the whole damn engine fell out of the

1985
02:14:14.371 --> 02:14:18.440
airplane and the guy got killed.
But um,

1986
02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:23.450
uh,
they had engines quit.
Every single engine fighter was,

1987
02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:27.510
that's a problem and somebody throws a rock that you and it hits the radiator,

1988
02:14:27.511 --> 02:14:30.220
you're all done.
So,
um,

1989
02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:33.330
but those were trying times.

1990
02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:38.570
<v 0>Yeah,
I guess I was with all that,
you know,
thinking about these,</v>

1991
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:44.090
these guys that were in those bomber crews that would need a break and they say,

1992
02:14:44.091 --> 02:14:47.660
okay,
you need to go over here and not think about this.
And it reminds me of,

1993
02:14:47.661 --> 02:14:50.810
you know,
talking about,
you know,
Dick winters from the first,

1994
02:14:50.811 --> 02:14:53.540
the five oh six band of brothers and what he would say when he would see guys

1995
02:14:53.541 --> 02:14:55.910
were getting stressed out,
you know,
he'd get them off the line,

1996
02:14:55.911 --> 02:15:00.590
get them out of it and,
and give them the rest that they need.
And,

1997
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:03.890
and then I think,
I think there's a certain party that goes,
okay,

1998
02:15:03.891 --> 02:15:08.480
like I need to not think about this right now.
And then I think you got to say,

1999
02:15:08.481 --> 02:15:12.220
okay,
now I'm going to talk about this.
And,
and the fact that you get around your,

2000
02:15:12.230 --> 02:15:14.660
your friends and that's what a lot of people that listen to podcasts,

2001
02:15:14.661 --> 02:15:18.200
a lot of veterans I listened to podcast,
they go,
you know,
now you know,
I've,

2002
02:15:18.201 --> 02:15:20.890
I've had my break but now you're talking about this stuff and I,

2003
02:15:20.891 --> 02:15:22.580
I appreciate it and I bring,

2004
02:15:22.810 --> 02:15:26.510
lets me know that I'm not the only guy that thinks this way or had those

2005
02:15:26.511 --> 02:15:30.170
thoughts or you know,
went through this.
And I think that's,
that's good.

2006
02:15:30.171 --> 02:15:32.060
So I think it's,
I think you do need a break.

2007
02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:36.730
And actually that now that I think about it,
when I was in Ramadi,
I had I,

2008
02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:39.950
the book that I read every night was about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

2009
02:15:39.951 --> 02:15:41.870
And I rented every single night,
every single night,
every single night.

2010
02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:46.160
And then about three months into deployment,
I wanted to,

2011
02:15:46.161 --> 02:15:49.070
I didn't want to think about,
you know,
I didn't want to go to bed,

2012
02:15:49.071 --> 02:15:53.720
sleep thinking about,
you know,
the war and war and,
and so I,

2013
02:15:53.721 --> 02:15:56.000
there was a random book sitting around and I picked up,

2014
02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:59.870
it was actually a book called the electric koolaid acid test,

2015
02:15:59.871 --> 02:16:01.670
which is about the hippies in,

2016
02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:06.350
it's written by Tom Wolfe who wrote the right stuff,
but it's a great book.

2017
02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:11.380
And it was so completely outside of what I was doing that it gave me,

2018
02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.720
you know,
like a mental break.
And I read that book and it was,
you know,

2019
02:16:14.721 --> 02:16:18.710
it took me four days to read that book and I got done and I put it away.

2020
02:16:18.711 --> 02:16:21.680
I put pulled about face back out and I continued on,

2021
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:24.410
but I just needed a little bit of a breather.
Right.

2022
02:16:24.411 --> 02:16:29.411
Just a little bit of a mental breather and I guess hippies and Lsd provided me

2023
02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:30.784
with that,

2024
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.440
reading about those hippies and LSD provided me with this little mental break

2025
02:16:35.890 --> 02:16:37.090
and it was actually,
it's a very,

2026
02:16:37.091 --> 02:16:42.091
it's a very interesting and bolt book and it shows the mentality that those

2027
02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:46.810
people had,
you know,
which was the way he summed it up was,

2028
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:50.980
was was mi,
Mi,
Mi,
mi,

2029
02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:54.820
everything's about me.
And that was what was good for me to read this book.

2030
02:16:54.821 --> 02:16:59.350
I'm like,
okay,
that's not how I want to be with my life is not about me.

2031
02:16:59.351 --> 02:17:02.770
It's about,
you know,
what we're trying to do here.
So yeah,

2032
02:17:02.771 --> 02:17:06.190
I think sometimes people need a mental break.
I can't even imagine what the,

2033
02:17:06.191 --> 02:17:09.220
you know,
what was going on in one of those flack houses with those guys.

2034
02:17:09.610 --> 02:17:12.050
That sounds like an rnr for ya.

2035
02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:13.713
<v 2>RNR.</v>

2036
02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:18.600
They were run by the Red Cross and I was multicolored manner,

2037
02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:23.600
which was right on the tims river.
Uh,
of course I was there,
uh,

2038
02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:28.220
when we had the ice storms.
And in fact,
when I left the,

2039
02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:32.700
the Black House,
uh,
uh,
to go back to Paris,

2040
02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.620
I couldn't get a ride across the channel and just what,
uh,

2041
02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:40.740
our friend Glenn Miller dollar ride and disappeared.

2042
02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:46.020
And so I'm trying to get across the channel,
uh,
to Paris.

2043
02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:47.550
And it's a,

2044
02:17:48.390 --> 02:17:52.030
between Christmas and new years and,
uh,

2045
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:56.300
uh,
I way I went out to,
uh,
uh,

2046
02:17:56.430 --> 02:17:59.100
several of the bases around run London together,

2047
02:17:59.210 --> 02:18:03.090
an ATC or craft to go to Paris and they're all grounded.

2048
02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:08.460
And so I,
uh,
I went down to South Hampton and,
uh,

2049
02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:09.923
uh,

2050
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:14.670
two ships had just commend to Southampton that were going on to law Harv.

2051
02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:19.260
And so I got on board and they were hospital ships,

2052
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:20.250
uh,

2053
02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:25.250
with a complete complement of the general hospitals,

2054
02:18:25.351 --> 02:18:30.030
like two or three different general hospitals and we're full of nurses.

2055
02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.020
And so new year's Eve,

2056
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:40.230
we were on this ship with all these nurses and we're on a,

2057
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:47.750
I guess you'd call it battle stations because the e boats from the Germany boats

2058
02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:51.150
were operating in the channel.

2059
02:18:51.510 --> 02:18:55.890
And we're going across from Southampton to uh,
uh,

2060
02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.920
[inaudible] and all these nervous nurses from the u s needed comfort.

2061
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:02.873
<v 0>Do</v>

2062
02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:10.450
you get a medal for that?
So,

2063
02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:11.750
um,

2064
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:16.700
<v 2>anyway,
that was,
that was the story.
Just how I got to the end of the story.
I've</v>

2065
02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:18.920
<v 0>for golf or I don't even care anymore,</v>

2066
02:19:20.210 --> 02:19:21.870
but I love you

2067
02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:28.020
<v 2>stop a couple of things.
When we were talking and um,</v>

2068
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:33.770
uh,
when I got shot down,
you read the citation?
Well,

2069
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:37.360
I didn't know anything about that citation.
Uh,

2070
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:41.780
I had gotten my fanny shot off.
I was not happy.

2071
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:43.363
I said,

2072
02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:48.550
I kept thinking what could I have done different that I could have stayed in

2073
02:19:48.591 --> 02:19:52.960
that fight longer.
Uh,
and I,

2074
02:19:52.961 --> 02:19:57.440
I never came up with an answer.
What could I have done?

2075
02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:02.980
So for about from September till I get this orders to go to Paris to spots is

2076
02:20:06.591 --> 02:20:09.410
headquarters.
I was not the highest,

2077
02:20:10.430 --> 02:20:14.270
I didn't think much of myself is why did it,

2078
02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:20.460
why couldn't I have done a better job?
But,
uh,

2079
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.920
reading that citation and then belonging to a group called the Legion of Valor,

2080
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:33.950
which there are not too many air force guys left in it.
Uh,

2081
02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:39.190
and I read what these people have done.
Uh,

2082
02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:43.260
<v 4>these ground crew who fact one of my very close friends and had the</v>

2083
02:20:43.261 --> 02:20:47.610
distinguished service cross and they just upgraded to congressional medal of

2084
02:20:47.611 --> 02:20:52.611
honor and he's gotten quite a bit of publicity and he was in Vietnam.

2085
02:20:52.651 --> 02:20:56.590
And,
and my comment when I,
uh,
uh,

2086
02:20:56.610 --> 02:21:01.050
saw that he had gotten the congressional medal longer at this late date,

2087
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:06.540
uh,
I thought it was God,
somebody finally read his citation.

2088
02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:08.610
<v 2>Hmm.
And when you,</v>

2089
02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:12.510
when you think that that,

2090
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:16.760
<v 4>what all of these guys did,
a lot of the fellows in the,
uh,</v>

2091
02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:22.220
in the legion of Valor are medics what they did and combat conditions and got to

2092
02:21:25.911 --> 02:21:30.770
just English curves across the Navy,
Cross in silver forth.
It's,

2093
02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:34.820
you know,
I,
I read my citation,
it took six minutes,

2094
02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:39.860
that's all.
And then I read a book called I'm no hero

2095
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:46.420
and I think Charlie porn six years a bat,

2096
02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:52.850
my six minutes for me.
Uh,
that's,
I mean,

2097
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:57.440
what he went through is just unbelievable to me and said,

2098
02:21:57.441 --> 02:21:59.990
don't give me the monk about,
I'm no hero,

2099
02:22:01.850 --> 02:22:06.840
but it's,
um,
it's,
it's,

2100
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.843
it's

2101
02:22:08.010 --> 02:22:11.690
<v 5>deep thought,
but thanks for that Jim.
I patient.
You're saying that,
uh,</v>

2102
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.390
well let me ask one more question that you Jocko,

2103
02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.200
because Jim and I both talked about getting shot down and feeling miserable

2104
02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:23.790
after your ear fight where you accidentally killed one of the Iraqi soldiers.
Uh,

2105
02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:25.080
but you felt pretty little about,

2106
02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:31.920
<v 0>yeah,
that's about as,
that's about as bad as it gets.
And,
um,</v>

2107
02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:35.790
you know,
it was,
it was a horrible situation.
It was the fog of war.

2108
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:40.860
It was multiple units out on the battlefield.
It was,
it was actually not,

2109
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:43.170
not me.
That was that,

2110
02:22:43.171 --> 02:22:48.171
that shop and Iraqi soldier who was one of my small teams that was in a position

2111
02:22:49.350 --> 02:22:52.230
where,
you know,
amongst the confusion,

2112
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:57.590
they were assaulted by a friendly group of Iraqi soldiers with one,

2113
02:22:58.890 --> 02:23:03.630
they had one marine with them.
And Yeah,
the,
you know,
it's,
it's,

2114
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:08.520
it's something that you can,
it's hard to make,
um,
you know,

2115
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:12.660
definite statements or,
or,
or say,
I know this for a fact,

2116
02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:17.661
but there's pretty much not anything worse in war then friendly forces,

2117
02:23:18.061 --> 02:23:22.500
killing friendly forces that just,
that's just as bad as it gets.

2118
02:23:22.501 --> 02:23:26.970
And it's a real taboo in,
in special operations for sure.

2119
02:23:26.970 --> 02:23:31.170
It's a taboo in any,
and I'll tell you during the,
during the,

2120
02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:35.970
I guess we'll say the dry years in between Vietnam and,

2121
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000
and the current wars were in there was we actually lost the understanding of how

2122
02:23:44.401 --> 02:23:46.190
these things could happen and,

2123
02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:50.130
and no one really understood the fog of war anymore and therefore we didn't

2124
02:23:50.131 --> 02:23:54.720
train to it properly.
And so when it happened,

2125
02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:59.280
it was,
it was like an unbelievable thing.

2126
02:23:59.310 --> 02:24:03.360
It was so bad.
It was the absolute worst thing that could happen.
Actually,

2127
02:24:03.370 --> 02:24:06.810
I would say there'd be one more thing.
You know,
the soul,
the,

2128
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:09.750
the person that was killed,
a soldier that was killed was an Iraqi soldier.

2129
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:11.460
You know,
if it had been a sealer and American,

2130
02:24:11.461 --> 02:24:15.030
I guess that would make it one level higher for me cause I would have known the

2131
02:24:15.031 --> 02:24:18.060
person,
you know,
in this case it was an Iraqi soldier.
Again,

2132
02:24:18.061 --> 02:24:22.860
a tragic loss nonetheless.
But you know,
how did I feel?

2133
02:24:22.861 --> 02:24:27.690
It felt,
it felt absolutely horrible.
And the thing that,
you know,

2134
02:24:27.691 --> 02:24:32.691
the thing that changed the mindset for me was when I realized that as I sat

2135
02:24:32.971 --> 02:24:34.740
there and reviewed because you know,

2136
02:24:34.850 --> 02:24:39.660
my commanding officer was coming to inspect and in review what had happened

2137
02:24:39.661 --> 02:24:43.110
along with the investigating officer.
And you know,

2138
02:24:43.111 --> 02:24:47.640
the thing that changed my mindset was as I sat there and said,
okay,

2139
02:24:47.641 --> 02:24:50.760
who's fault is this?
Whose fault is this?
Whose fault is this,
whose fault is this?

2140
02:24:50.761 --> 02:24:53.280
And I'm looking at all the different mistakes that were made by all the

2141
02:24:53.281 --> 02:24:55.020
different units and all the different people.

2142
02:24:55.350 --> 02:24:57.190
And as I'm looking to blame this on someone,

2143
02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:00.300
it would became very clear to me in like a bolt of lightening that there was

2144
02:25:00.301 --> 02:25:03.630
only one person in charge of this and therefore the only one person responsible

2145
02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:06.360
for what happens out there.
And that's me.
And

2146
02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:13.100
honestly the one I had that transition in fought and it was,

2147
02:25:14.430 --> 02:25:18.630
it was the first moment that I,
I felt actually,
okay.

2148
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:24.220
Uh,
there's a horrible sinking feeling that you get in,

2149
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:26.840
in,
in war time situations.
I guess you can get it.

2150
02:25:26.850 --> 02:25:30.430
Another time sue and I've talked about it with,
with some of my friends,

2151
02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.930
it's like when something is just really horrible is happening,

2152
02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:39.790
you get this knot in your stomach.
And this,
it's,

2153
02:25:39.850 --> 02:25:44.500
I've never felt that any other times.
But when I was overseas,
uh,
of,
of like,

2154
02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:48.610
this is,
I,
I have it,
it's the most horrible feeling.

2155
02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.700
And um,
that was,

2156
02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:55.780
that was the most severe I ever felt.

2157
02:25:55.781 --> 02:26:00.750
It was leading up to my own recognition that,
you know,
what,
and,

2158
02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:04.450
and where that was coming from was the unknown and I didn't know how to react to

2159
02:26:04.451 --> 02:26:08.620
it.
And here I was,
you know,
Mister experienced seal,
Mr you know,

2160
02:26:08.650 --> 02:26:10.870
in charge of the task unit,
whatever.

2161
02:26:11.470 --> 02:26:14.740
And yet here I was going,
how do I deal with this?

2162
02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:16.360
And I didn't understand how to deal with it.

2163
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:19.270
And what I had to do is go to what I actually did know,

2164
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:21.940
which is if you're in a leadership position,

2165
02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:26.080
you take responsibility for what happens.
That's what you do.
So,
hey,

2166
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:30.610
that's what you do.
And if,
if they're going to fire you,
you get fired.

2167
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:33.310
If they're going to reprimand you,
you get reprimanded.

2168
02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:36.550
If they're going to replace you with someone else,
you get replaced.
You salute,

2169
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:39.490
you do the best turnover you can.
You try and do the,
you know,

2170
02:26:39.491 --> 02:26:42.340
give all the information you can.
That's what you do.

2171
02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:46.060
And as soon as I accepted that and looked at it and said,
okay,

2172
02:26:46.210 --> 02:26:51.070
well then that not started to go away.
And I realized that,
okay,

2173
02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:56.050
the real problem here is,
is the way that you're looking at this.
But,
uh,

2174
02:26:56.110 --> 02:27:00.490
and then the other big thing is once you admit what those are,

2175
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:04.300
and you take ownership of those problems and you actually not just take

2176
02:27:04.301 --> 02:27:05.470
ownership of the problems,
but as you say,

2177
02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:07.600
here's the problems and here's how we're going to get them solved.

2178
02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:12.310
Here's the standard operating procedures that we're now going to follow to make

2179
02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:16.900
sure that this never happens again.
Well then people look at you and they go,

2180
02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:18.490
okay,
he's got a plan.

2181
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:21.970
He's not sitting here dodging the blame for this.

2182
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:25.570
He's actually taking ownership of the problems and he's going to get them
solved.

2183
02:27:25.571 --> 02:27:26.381
And I think,
you know,

2184
02:27:26.381 --> 02:27:31.120
I've never had this conversation with my commanding officer about his reaction,

2185
02:27:31.930 --> 02:27:35.680
but I could see it,
you know,
I could see it.
And the fact that I,

2186
02:27:36.130 --> 02:27:39.070
the fact that he said,
okay,
you know,
let's make sure it doesn't happen again.

2187
02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:43.780
I like the procedures that you're putting in place.
Use caution,
proceed.
You know,

2188
02:27:43.781 --> 02:27:47.050
where is I believe that if I would've said,
well,
it wasn't my fault,

2189
02:27:47.051 --> 02:27:49.750
it was his fault and their fault and the other guy's fault,
he would have said,

2190
02:27:49.751 --> 02:27:52.180
okay,
you need,
you're not going to have this job anymore.

2191
02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:55.250
And I think that's the same thing with life.
You know,
the minute that you're,

2192
02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:57.310
you're looking around you and you're saying,
hey,

2193
02:27:57.311 --> 02:28:01.450
it's someone else's fault that this,
that I'm in this bad situation.
And again,

2194
02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:04.690
you know what,
okay,
there's things that happen.

2195
02:28:04.691 --> 02:28:09.130
I get that there's things that happen to two people.
You mentioned one of them.

2196
02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:13.300
You can get a disease that you can't control you,
you know,
you can get a,

2197
02:28:13.301 --> 02:28:16.420
you can have,
you know,
a child get hit by a car.
I mean,

2198
02:28:16.421 --> 02:28:20.380
there's awful things that can happen that you can't have control over,

2199
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:24.890
but what you can have control over is how you proceed and how you go forward.

2200
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:27.770
And that's the part that you need to focus on because the,

2201
02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:32.720
the opportunity to fix what happened in the past,
it's gone.
I'm sorry.

2202
02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:37.430
There's no time machine.
There's no way of going back.
It's happened.
It's gone.

2203
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:40.250
Okay,
how are you going to move forward?
Where are you going to go now?

2204
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.880
That's what you need to focus on.
And I've said that about regret too.
People say,

2205
02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:46.280
Oh,
you know,
I live with no regrets.
I'm like,
oh,
I,
I,

2206
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:47.930
there's all kinds of things I'll tell you I regret,

2207
02:28:47.931 --> 02:28:51.350
but I don't walk around with them because I can't do anything about them.
Like,

2208
02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:55.490
you know,
maybe you would have maneuvered your aircraft a little bit different on

2209
02:28:55.491 --> 02:28:58.460
September 16th,
1940 Ford,
you've looked at it.
Maybe you couldn't,

2210
02:28:58.461 --> 02:28:59.420
but maybe you could have,

2211
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:03.470
but you don't walk around carrying that because it doesn't matter anymore.

2212
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:06.560
And it's the same thing with the things I've been through.
It's like,
okay,
look,

2213
02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:09.980
I made mistakes.
You've made mistakes,
we've all made mistakes.
Okay,

2214
02:29:09.981 --> 02:29:13.180
what are we gonna do?
Are we going to dwell on those?
I let them,
you know,

2215
02:29:13.250 --> 02:29:15.470
bear down on us and even things that we can't control.

2216
02:29:15.471 --> 02:29:18.350
Maybe the mistake wasn't ours and something that we couldn't control.

2217
02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:21.200
Not going to carry that.
I'm going to,

2218
02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:24.050
I'm going to not going to carry that regret.
I'm going to say,
well,

2219
02:29:24.051 --> 02:29:25.010
what can I do to move forward?

2220
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:27.860
And actually there's a great guy just had on the podcast named Rob Jones.

2221
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:32.300
He's a marine.
He fought in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

2222
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:34.880
And he ended up,
he was a,
he was a

2223
02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:40.460
bomb disposal digging for mines,
a combat engineer.

2224
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:44.450
And he ended up finding a mine and he found that mine,
well,
you know,

2225
02:29:44.451 --> 02:29:46.020
with his own feet.
And he,

2226
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.910
he lost both of his legs and he said something that was,
was awesome.

2227
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:54.230
He says,
you know,
you've got this weight that's bearing down on you.

2228
02:29:54.231 --> 02:29:56.930
And he was sitting in a hospital bed and then he had this weight that was

2229
02:29:56.931 --> 02:29:59.600
bearing down on him if he's going to live now the rest of his life with,

2230
02:29:59.630 --> 02:30:03.260
you know,
both legs amputated,
amputated above the knee.

2231
02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:09.140
And He,
you know,
he said,
what am I gonna do with this?
Wait,
am I going to let it,

2232
02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:14.030
am I going to let it push me down and bury me under the ground or am I going to

2233
02:30:14.031 --> 02:30:16.070
use that weight to make myself stronger?

2234
02:30:16.430 --> 02:30:21.000
And I think that's a incredible attitude to have.
And,

2235
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:25.100
and by the way,
he's about to run 31 marathons,
31 days.

2236
02:30:25.330 --> 02:30:29.570
I was going to run 31 marathon in 31 days.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2237
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:31.670
Unbelievable.
So,

2238
02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:36.280
<v 5>you know,
the toughest,
uh,
flying that I ever did,
uh,
was in combat,</v>

2239
02:30:36.281 --> 02:30:40.540
in support of the ground troops,
and they'd bring us in,
uh,

2240
02:30:40.570 --> 02:30:44.890
with a rocket or bonds or napalm.
We didn't have any guns on that airplane.

2241
02:30:45.610 --> 02:30:49.090
And,
uh,
but we knew that we had to get close but not too close to the,

2242
02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:53.860
to the friendlies,
uh,
to be effective,
you know,
and we couldn't put our weapons,

2243
02:30:53.861 --> 02:30:58.690
uh,
you know,
40 clicks away and,
and doing any good at all.

2244
02:30:58.740 --> 02:30:59.080
Uh,

2245
02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:04.080
but we get in too close to start Sinjun the mustaches are those soldiers or

2246
02:31:04.311 --> 02:31:06.930
marines down there and,
and,
and,

2247
02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:09.370
<v 0>oh,
by the way,
if you get too close,
actually,</v>

2248
02:31:09.371 --> 02:31:12.040
it goes way beyond singeing mustaches.
You have,
you go to close,

2249
02:31:12.041 --> 02:31:15.100
you can kill friendly troops.
And again,
we're back to what we just talked about.

2250
02:31:15.101 --> 02:31:15.934
So that's,
that's,

2251
02:31:16.390 --> 02:31:20.460
<v 5>and it was done,
you know what I mean?
W it again,
the fog of war.</v>

2252
02:31:20.461 --> 02:31:23.210
And that's what happens.
It's really,
really unfortunate to,

2253
02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:28.080
so I would get that knot in my stomach when Eero was called in to support the

2254
02:31:28.081 --> 02:31:32.940
ground troops in a fact,
would,
you know,
torch off the smoke signal.

2255
02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:36.600
And I'd look at the wind and trying to figure out exactly how I can get in their

2256
02:31:36.601 --> 02:31:37.260
clothes.

2257
02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:42.260
And lots of times I would go below the frag pattern of the bomb I was dropping

2258
02:31:43.411 --> 02:31:47.400
just so I could get more accuracy and,
and we all did that,
you know,

2259
02:31:47.470 --> 02:31:51.590
we weren't supposed to,
but uh,
you know,
an average bomb,
a,
you know,

2260
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:55.650
500 pound bomb would have a frag pattern of 2,400 feet above the ground.

2261
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:58.500
That's what you were flying through after you dropped the bomb.

2262
02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:02.880
And we'd go below that just to get more accuracy.
Uh,

2263
02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:06.570
because we knew that those guys were dependent on us and boy,
they were,

2264
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:10.870
there were some happy facts,
you know,
after we,
after we would,
uh,

2265
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:14.760
support those ground troops.
But it was,
um,
you know,

2266
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:18.150
it was pretty scary stuff.
Um,

2267
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:21.660
but back to your point about blaming other people.

2268
02:32:21.661 --> 02:32:26.540
I had a coach early on and that a very losing team,
sorry to say,
but,

2269
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:29.650
but he,
but he would,
he,
he,
he told us this,
Eh,

2270
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:33.360
because we'd start blaming other things where the problem,
you know,
yeah,

2271
02:32:33.361 --> 02:32:35.160
we were away and we didn't,
you know,

2272
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:39.560
th th th th th things weren't right and somebody's,

2273
02:32:39.810 --> 02:32:42.000
we blame somebody for this or somebody they added to the,
you know,

2274
02:32:42.001 --> 02:32:46.690
the refs were calling it a bad calls and all this stuff.
And he'd said,
you know,

2275
02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:49.610
um,
uh,

2276
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:53.080
the difference in success and failure in life is not the things around you.

2277
02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:56.010
And it's the choices you make about things around you.

2278
02:32:56.011 --> 02:33:00.180
And you can blame everybody else for your problems.
But in doing so,

2279
02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:03.920
you give away control of your life.
And I think that's the,

2280
02:33:04.020 --> 02:33:08.120
the accountability issue that you're talking about,
you know,
is that there's,

2281
02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:10.530
there's certainly freedom in discipline.

2282
02:33:10.531 --> 02:33:14.280
There's also a freedom in accountability,
I think.
Because when you,
like you say,

2283
02:33:14.281 --> 02:33:18.270
you know,
when you say,
okay,
yeah,
lots of people made a lot of mistakes,
but oh,

2284
02:33:18.271 --> 02:33:21.300
by the way,
I was in charge.
And so,
you know,

2285
02:33:21.301 --> 02:33:25.080
the onus is really on me and,
and I find that when I,

2286
02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:28.280
when I practiced taking,
um,

2287
02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:30.810
when it practiced,
uh,

2288
02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:35.370
taking responsibility for some of the bad things that really weren't my fault.

2289
02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:39.810
Uh,
and,
and I practice doing that.
It frees me up,

2290
02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:43.830
I think to let you know,
to live a,
um,
a freer life.

2291
02:33:44.290 --> 02:33:48.920
<v 0>Yeah,
that's actually an interesting point because sometimes people,
they,</v>

2292
02:33:48.921 --> 02:33:49.301
they,

2293
02:33:49.301 --> 02:33:52.600
they hear like they'll read the book extreme ownership that we wrote and they
go,

2294
02:33:52.601 --> 02:33:55.150
okay,
cool.
All I need to do is take ownership of the problems and then I'm,

2295
02:33:55.151 --> 02:33:59.360
then I'm a good guy.
Yeah.
Right.
They go,
oh,
you know,
hey,
these mistakes happen.

2296
02:33:59.361 --> 02:34:01.660
That's my fault.
You know,
so let's get them fixed.

2297
02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:06.460
And that actually doesn't work actually.
And,
and when I say,
Hey,

2298
02:34:06.461 --> 02:34:10.210
there was all these mistakes that were made on the battlefield and different

2299
02:34:10.211 --> 02:34:14.890
people made actual mistakes.
They made mistakes the day we had that blue on blue,

2300
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:18.880
there was other people that made mistakes.
What I'm saying isn't like,
oh,

2301
02:34:18.881 --> 02:34:22.690
those were my mistakes.
Hey,
it's my fault.
No,
no,
no.
What I'm saying is actually,

2302
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:27.010
truthfully,
those mistakes were things that I should have foreseen,

2303
02:34:27.130 --> 02:34:28.540
that I should have understood better,

2304
02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:32.950
that I should have planned better than I should have trained guys better for

2305
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:35.290
that.
They,
they are,
uh,
they,
they made the mistake.

2306
02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:39.760
But the root problem of that mistake is my fault.
It's not just saying,

2307
02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:43.570
Hey,
my boss states it's,
you know,
Oh yeah,
that was my fault.
No,
no,
no.

2308
02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:48.550
And actually is my fault.
And I have this conversation too where people say,
well,

2309
02:34:48.551 --> 02:34:52.630
what if I do,
what do I do if I tell my employees,
oh guys,
it was my fault.

2310
02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.090
And then my employees say,
yeah,
that's right.

2311
02:34:55.091 --> 02:34:59.560
It was your fault and that people don't know what to do.
And I said,
well,

2312
02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:04.570
it is your fault.
That's what I'm saying.

2313
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:08.080
I'm not saying this so that it makes people not look at you and blaming.
No,
no.

2314
02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:12.070
When someone says,
if I say,
Charlie,
we screwed up this mission.
It was my fault.

2315
02:35:12.071 --> 02:35:14.640
And you go,
that's right.
It was your fault.
I don't go,
no,
no,
no.
I said,
well,
no,
no,

2316
02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:17.950
it's your fault.
No,
no,
no.
That's not how it works.
I say,
Charlie,

2317
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:20.680
I was the commander of this mission.
I didn't give you enough information to,

2318
02:35:20.681 --> 02:35:23.050
I didn't,
I didn't review your plan well enough.

2319
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:24.250
I didn't give you the training that you needed.

2320
02:35:24.251 --> 02:35:26.830
I didn't give you the support that you needed.
That was my fault.

2321
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:29.230
That is w and here is what I'm going to do to fix it.

2322
02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:32.500
So when I look at you and say,
Hey,
this is my fault that this happened,

2323
02:35:32.501 --> 02:35:34.870
and you say,
you're right,
it was,
I go,
exactly.

2324
02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:36.730
These are the things I'm going to do to fix it.

2325
02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.830
Here's where the way we're going to do this from now on,

2326
02:35:38.831 --> 02:35:42.010
here's some procedures we're going to put in place so that this doesn't happen.

2327
02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:43.180
So yes,

2328
02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:47.800
extreme ownership is not by any stretch an escape patch.

2329
02:35:47.890 --> 02:35:51.170
It's not.
In fact,
when you take ownership,
you shut the hack.

2330
02:35:51.171 --> 02:35:53.560
Gang names are there and you're not getting out.

2331
02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:57.160
The only way to get out is to find solutions for the problems and move forward.

2332
02:35:57.310 --> 02:35:59.980
Yeah.
So it's an interesting,
it's interesting.

2333
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:03.230
<v 2>That brings me up to civilian life.</v>

2334
02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:08.240
Now you've talked about a mission and a having something out in front of you.

2335
02:36:09.330 --> 02:36:13.050
Well,
I got off active duty in 1948,
June,

2336
02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:17.960
exactly two years before Korea was started.
And um,

2337
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:23.510
my father in law who actually became almost like a father to me by that time,

2338
02:36:24.691 --> 02:36:29.290
we'd been married for three years and,
uh,
uh,

2339
02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:34.400
he was deeply involved in the paper industry.
He was president of Rackspace,

2340
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:39.830
Western wax paper here in Los Angeles as an he had sold the company to Crown

2341
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:40.913
Zeller back.

2342
02:36:41.490 --> 02:36:46.490
And his best friend was a Richard McDonald who was executive vice president of

2343
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:51.340
Crown Zeller back.
And uh,

2344
02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:54.030
between the two of them,
uh,

2345
02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:59.050
they found this little paper company and they're going to take care of their son

2346
02:37:00.301 --> 02:37:03.660
in laws and son.
And so,
uh,
uh,

2347
02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:08.670
Dick Mcdonald got off active duty as an engineer in the army,
uh,

2348
02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:11.220
before,
uh,
before I did.

2349
02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:16.220
So he arrived at the paper company maybe almost a year before

2350
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:20.830
<v 4>I did.
And
I had put my,</v>

2351
02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:26.260
all the money I had into this company before while I was still on active duty.

2352
02:37:27.350 --> 02:37:28.370
So,
um,

2353
02:37:28.430 --> 02:37:33.430
I come home in June 48 and it's 4th of July coming up.

2354
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:38.591
And my father in law takes me down and read by three civilian suits and all of a

2355
02:37:40.671 --> 02:37:45.380
sudden I'm a civilian and I'm going to go work for this little company.

2356
02:37:45.381 --> 02:37:50.381
And Dick Mcdonald was running the company because he was there a year before,

2357
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:53.930
but we had a partner in this company.

2358
02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:58.900
And so I go down and I go to work and boy,
um,
uh,

2359
02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:02.060
cause I'm going to technically aligned minded,

2360
02:38:02.061 --> 02:38:06.320
they put me in charge of the operation,
the planet operation.

2361
02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:12.160
So now I'm a civilian and I'm working hard and it goes for about three months.

2362
02:38:13.731 --> 02:38:18.350
And then I begin to notice that we'd get an order in.
And we,

2363
02:38:18.380 --> 02:38:23.380
by that time we had maybe 50 employees and we were making paper Napkins and

2364
02:38:23.901 --> 02:38:26.420
shelf paper and all these little items.

2365
02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:30.510
We were what was called a paper converter.
And so,
uh,

2366
02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.450
I noticed in running the plant that we get an order in and I'd look at the

2367
02:38:35.451 --> 02:38:38.930
inventory and we'd had so much paper back in the inventory,

2368
02:38:38.931 --> 02:38:41.630
and I go back and check it and we ain't got it.

2369
02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.090
And so now what's wrong?
And so we had a little meeting and he'd say,
well,

2370
02:38:47.091 --> 02:38:51.650
maybe we better take an inventory and see what's in the back of a plant there.

2371
02:38:52.430 --> 02:38:57.430
And it turns out that our partner who actually had control of the company,

2372
02:38:58.430 --> 02:38:59.263
uh,

2373
02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:03.620
was deathly afraid to admit that he had been losing money.

2374
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:09.560
And he wasn't dishonest or anything.
He just didn't want to admit it.

2375
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:12.470
And so to cover the losses,

2376
02:39:12.770 --> 02:39:14.780
he inflated the inventory.

2377
02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:18.350
So now we have this big meeting,

2378
02:39:18.351 --> 02:39:21.710
I'm 90 days into being a civilian,

2379
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:26.180
and we take the inventory and we add all this up.

2380
02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:29.960
And Dick Mcdonald and I,
oh,

2381
02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:34.670
Crown Zellerbach Corporation about $20,000.

2382
02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:38.840
It's 1948.
And let me tell you,

2383
02:39:38.841 --> 02:39:43.790
$20,000 is one hell of a lot.
A lot of money.

2384
02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.690
Wow.
And when a house would cost,
what,
500 to a thousand dollars?
Oh yeah,

2385
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:53.480
yeah.
Wow.
So,
so,
uh,
now what are we do?

2386
02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:58.280
Um,
well the first thing we do is,
well,

2387
02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:02.990
welcome to the business world.
We,

2388
02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:08.410
we decided that we'd better do something and our father and my father in law and

2389
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:13.980
Richard Mcdonald's father said,

2390
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:17.340
<v 2>well,
what are you going to do?
Well,</v>

2391
02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:21.630
the first thing we had to do is who had to go up and talk to crown Zillow back

2392
02:40:21.631 --> 02:40:25.200
in San Francisco and saw her.
In order to do that,

2393
02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:30.500
I had to buy a top coat and a hat because you didn't go to San Francisco on a

2394
02:40:30.631 --> 02:40:35.310
business,
a meeting without having a hat and a top coat.

2395
02:40:36.330 --> 02:40:37.980
And so we get on,

2396
02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:43.530
get on the train and we go to San Francisco and we're plotting the whole way up

2397
02:40:43.531 --> 02:40:47.310
there off.
What are we going to tell him?
I have no idea.

2398
02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:51.900
And got off the train at the station up there,

2399
02:40:51.901 --> 02:40:56.430
got a taxi and we get down to cents and street to this big beautiful buildings

2400
02:40:56.431 --> 02:40:57.800
is crown seller back then.

2401
02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:03.530
And I'm wearing my hat and my new top coat and I'm going to see Mister Zeller

2402
02:41:04.681 --> 02:41:08.110
back himself and justice.

2403
02:41:08.130 --> 02:41:12.360
I walked in the front door.
Some God them [inaudible] help above.

2404
02:41:12.361 --> 02:41:17.361
Let's go right down across my brain top.

2405
02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:22.470
Now the world,
the world can't be any worse.

2406
02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:26.640
No wonder why.
Well,

2407
02:41:26.730 --> 02:41:31.730
we had our meeting with Mr Seller backed and he was very,

2408
02:41:31.861 --> 02:41:35.850
very gracious.
He's all he said was,

2409
02:41:35.851 --> 02:41:40.851
when are you going to pay us the $20,000 so we said,

2410
02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:43.530
well,
we're going to work on it.
And we did.

2411
02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:48.540
We worked very hard for about two years when we finally began to make some money

2412
02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:55.100
and getting ahead and Korea started 25th of June.

2413
02:41:57.570 --> 02:42:02.570
And then about a week later this fellow walked into our office and he said,

2414
02:42:05.970 --> 02:42:09.330
we have a problem from the u s government.

2415
02:42:10.350 --> 02:42:13.650
And he said,
you know,
we have,

2416
02:42:14.310 --> 02:42:16.860
we have to build up our supplies.

2417
02:42:17.430 --> 02:42:22.430
And one thing that we just can't seem to solve is toilet tissue for k rations.

2418
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:31.030
A little pack of toilet tissue for the little piece of paper around it too.

2419
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.650
And so he said,

2420
02:42:34.651 --> 02:42:39.150
we got one machine belongs to one of the paper companies and he said,

2421
02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:44.160
we got that machine working,
uh,
24 hours a day,

2422
02:42:44.310 --> 02:42:48.000
seven days a week,
and we're not getting enough,
uh,
uh,

2423
02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:51.390
toilet tissue into these key Ras is what can you do?

2424
02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:56.280
I don't know how in the heck he found us,
but anyway,
he didn't.
So we thought,

2425
02:42:56.281 --> 02:42:56.461
well,

2426
02:42:56.461 --> 02:43:01.461
we took a look at it and we figured that we could go to crowns hour back and get

2427
02:43:01.831 --> 02:43:06.831
inner fold tissue paper and you could sit down and you could flip 20 sheets of

2428
02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:12.100
inner fold,
make two folds in

2429
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:14.620
<v 4>it.
And then we had to have a tube.</v>

2430
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:19.870
And so our superintendent live went out and we bought a nickel on a little

2431
02:43:19.871 --> 02:43:24.610
machine and made a nickel a pack for a dollar's worth of nickels,

2432
02:43:24.611 --> 02:43:29.611
a tube [inaudible] we made the two and we've cut it in half.

2433
02:43:30.521 --> 02:43:33.430
Now we got a tube to put the 20 sheets in.

2434
02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:39.120
And so I sit down for about an hour and I folded paper and they timed me and

2435
02:43:40.121 --> 02:43:43.510
they figured it was rough as I am.

2436
02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:47.440
Why if I can do it that much in,
in an hour,

2437
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:49.930
then a young lady could do it.

2438
02:43:50.470 --> 02:43:54.820
So we hired about 50 gals and we put,

2439
02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:59.950
put them to work and making these little toilet tissue wraps and putting the

2440
02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:03.370
tube on it and throw it in a little box.
And we put them on piece work.

2441
02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:08.830
And
they were doing very well.
In fact,

2442
02:44:08.831 --> 02:44:13.831
we were out producing Scott tissues machine almost immediately and these little

2443
02:44:14.531 --> 02:44:19.030
gals down in east Los Angeles for making more money than anybody else,

2444
02:44:19.031 --> 02:44:23.620
and he's lost him on piecework.
And so everything's going great.

2445
02:44:23.621 --> 02:44:24.580
We're making money,

2446
02:44:24.581 --> 02:44:29.581
we're paying off the balance of the $20,000 we owed two years later.

2447
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:35.350
And I'm a guy walks into the office,
he came into my office and he says,

2448
02:44:35.351 --> 02:44:39.430
you know,
he said,
did we got a situation here?
And he had some of my,

2449
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:45.010
which packs?
And he said,
um,
said,
I'd like to see your operation.

2450
02:44:45.970 --> 02:44:49.810
So we took him out and plant and she picked up some of these tubes and he looked

2451
02:44:49.811 --> 02:44:50.950
at it and took them apart,

2452
02:44:50.951 --> 02:44:55.630
counted the tissues in front of me and they were all perfect.
And he said,

2453
02:44:55.631 --> 02:44:59.970
um,
uh,
I got something to show you.
Uh,

2454
02:45:00.330 --> 02:45:05.020
and he pulls these little notes out and he said,
just read them.

2455
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:08.980
And here's this little note written at handwriting in this too.

2456
02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:15.060
And these young ladies had been writing these little notes and putting them

2457
02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:16.840
inside the,

2458
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:21.820
the two of the tissue and they left nothing to neuromag

2459
02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:31.220
and he says,
he said,
you,

2460
02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:36.380
can you imagine some Gi and a park toll in rain taken this apart in reading this

2461
02:45:37.801 --> 02:45:39.500
note,
how's he going to feel?

2462
02:45:42.450 --> 02:45:46.240
Well,
what are we going to do?

2463
02:45:48.370 --> 02:45:53.350
He says,
why don't we just leave it alone?
That's not talked to dialysis.

2464
02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:57.610
Let them keep on doing.
It has to be a morale builder.
Anyway,

2465
02:45:57.611 --> 02:45:59.630
that's how we paid off the 20 stops.

2466
02:46:02.830 --> 02:46:03.670
Believe me,

2467
02:46:04.570 --> 02:46:09.290
that two years of trying to pay that off the military training,

2468
02:46:09.291 --> 02:46:13.880
but I had really was very helpful.

2469
02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:19.840
I must be a museum somewhere that's looking for those too.
You know,

2470
02:46:19.850 --> 02:46:23.700
I have one,
I'm value.
It's not a,
it's not an original.
Uh,

2471
02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:29.300
somebody picked it up after,
it must've been for Vietnam.

2472
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:33.530
They were,
they've picked it up and we're producing on,
so I just,

2473
02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:36.500
I have one on my desk.
This is a reminder,

2474
02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:42.090
but it's um,
you know,
having a mission,
uh,

2475
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:44.120
I got a mission real quick.

2476
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:49.880
There was a very discouraging when to think of Boeing.

2477
02:46:50.030 --> 02:46:55.030
$20,000 from that was well over twice what I paid for my house.

2478
02:46:56.350 --> 02:46:59.180
Wow.
Uh,
I just looked at my watch.

2479
02:46:59.181 --> 02:47:02.510
We've been going for about two hours and 45 minutes.

2480
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:08.510
I say we wrap up this run,
um,
Echo.

2481
02:47:08.511 --> 02:47:11.840
You got anything else?
Have you said anything today?
No.
Okay.

2482
02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:16.310
Do you have anything to add?
Um,
when I lived in Honolulu,

2483
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:21.110
I had a motor scooter as well.
Really crashed.
It didn't break my leg,

2484
02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.110
but yeah,
they can get you,
you,
yeah.

2485
02:47:27.890 --> 02:47:30.710
You feel so like freeway there and you want to

2486
02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:37.520
be careful.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Cause in Honolulu and go everywhere.

2487
02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:41.990
Yeah,
that's it.
Thank you both.
Very,
very much.

2488
02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:46.430
Proud to be with you.
Right on Charlie pumps or anything else you want to,

2489
02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:47.440
you want to say?

2490
02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:50.680
<v 5>I think we've covered it all.
Really great being with you guys.
You know,</v>

2491
02:47:50.681 --> 02:47:53.530
I think that the,
the transfer,
uh,

2492
02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:58.000
are not necessarily our knowledge but are unaware stories by just the

2493
02:47:58.001 --> 02:48:02.790
philosophy,
you know,
that we're coming up with because it,
uh,
it,

2494
02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:05.620
it spans the test of time I think,

2495
02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:09.550
and we'll continue to span the test of time,

2496
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:11.920
the accountability issue,
uh,

2497
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:17.290
the face your fears issue,
then making choices,

2498
02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:21.700
issue the re,
you know,
refusal to,
to blame other people for your problems,

2499
02:48:21.701 --> 02:48:26.020
you know,
take,
take control of your life.
And it's not just a military thing.

2500
02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:28.180
I think it's true with,
uh,
with our kids.

2501
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:33.370
It's true with students and politicians and all,

2502
02:48:33.610 --> 02:48:35.670
all manners of our society just,

2503
02:48:36.190 --> 02:48:39.670
I think needs a little shot,
you know,
of a,

2504
02:48:39.700 --> 02:48:43.190
of accountability or [inaudible]

2505
02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:46.070
<v 4>I'd agree with the note things that,
you know,</v>

2506
02:48:46.071 --> 02:48:51.071
meeting Charlie and what a wonderful spokesperson he is.

2507
02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:52.370
Uh,

2508
02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:57.160
he's actually gotten me into a position,

2509
02:48:57.230 --> 02:49:02.230
I had to talk in front of the crowd a few times and always try to get in first

2510
02:49:02.391 --> 02:49:04.510
because I don't want to follow it.

2511
02:49:06.190 --> 02:49:07.470
People will be out

2512
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.130
<v 2>so well a welder captive I want to talk to,</v>

2513
02:49:12.810 --> 02:49:17.550
but I would love to be able to read some of the edge you are doing,

2514
02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:21.510
reach some of these young people who,

2515
02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.370
not that they're just because they're not thinking the way I think,

2516
02:49:26.610 --> 02:49:29.730
but I think they're losing something.

2517
02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:35.080
They're losing something that this great country has given to an awful lot of

2518
02:49:37.111 --> 02:49:41.790
people.
And,
uh,
I,
um,
I,

2519
02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:46.400
I feel that I'd like to read some and I can't.
And I think you're reaching,

2520
02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.850
I think Charlie's reaching are you're reaching them,

2521
02:49:51.690 --> 02:49:54.390
but there's so much we could say.

2522
02:49:54.570 --> 02:49:59.570
And my granddaughter just graduated from the University of Michigan for years

2523
02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.800
and it's pretty liberal school and we pay a lot of money and are send our kids

2524
02:50:08.521 --> 02:50:12.630
to school and sometimes they,
they get some wrong thoughts.

2525
02:50:12.631 --> 02:50:15.990
In least I think the wrong.
Maybe they're not.
Maybe they're right,

2526
02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:20.840
but I don't think so.
And so,
uh,

2527
02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:25.800
I think the work you're doing in Charlie's she's doing and the three of you are

2528
02:50:25.801 --> 02:50:29.370
doing,
uh,
is so,
so important

2529
02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:34.050
for the future.
Well

2530
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:39.980
<v 0>obviously thank you for coming,
for coming on the show,
both of you.
It's,</v>

2531
02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:43.280
it's such an honor to be sitting here with you guys.
And,

2532
02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:47.470
and also we wouldn't be sitting here if it wasn't,
you know,
for,

2533
02:50:47.490 --> 02:50:51.440
for men like you that stood up and fought.

2534
02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:54.290
And that's why we're here.

2535
02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:59.210
And that's why we have the freedom to be here to do this and the freedom to try

2536
02:50:59.270 --> 02:51:04.040
and pass that information on so people understand what kind of sacrifices were

2537
02:51:04.041 --> 02:51:09.041
made so that we can live in this amazing country with this incredible amount of

2538
02:51:09.591 --> 02:51:14.591
opportunity to do just about anything you want and whether that's take care of

2539
02:51:16.641 --> 02:51:20.510
your family or go out and,
and build some kind of a corporate empire.

2540
02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:24.560
You can do it here and you can be happy in any one of those categories.

2541
02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:30.110
And it's amazing.
So thank you for coming on.
And

2542
02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:32.653
again,

2543
02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:38.320
I think if it wasn't for generations of men like you answering the call to

2544
02:51:43.041 --> 02:51:43.490
fight,

2545
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:48.490
then our great nation would have perished long ago and it would have perished to

2546
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:52.220
tyranny and it would have perished to darkness.

2547
02:51:53.630 --> 02:51:57.740
But because of you and men like you,

2548
02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:02.920
we do live in freedom and we provide hope and light to world.

2549
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:09.040
So thank you both for giving that to us.

2550
02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:16.580
So we wrapped up with Charlie plumb and with Jim Kunkel in

2551
02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:28.950
in the hangers.
I got a little la off track at the end there.

2552
02:52:29.070 --> 02:52:34.070
I know that we were going to mention at least some social media and Charlie

2553
02:52:35.761 --> 02:52:38.430
plums information.
I failed to do that.

2554
02:52:38.700 --> 02:52:41.490
We're now back in the studio to do that right now.

2555
02:52:41.491 --> 02:52:46.491
So if anybody wants to link up with Captain Charlie Plumb,

2556

Echo,
how can we do that

2567
02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:36.440
<v 6>anyways?
I'll keep this brief.</v>

2568
02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:41.990
Try to origin or gin main.com Maine,

2569
02:53:41.991 --> 02:53:46.190
the state.
So origin main.com.
Good stuff.

2570
02:53:46.191 --> 02:53:48.560
Gear all made in America from the cotton,

2571
02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:55.720
the actual raw cotton to the material to make it all the way into what shirts?

2572
02:53:59.090 --> 02:54:03.940
Pants.
GIES is geezer flagship kind of fraction you think?

2573
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:09.190
Yeah.
That's the origin of origin is to make Jujitsu gies in America.
Yeah,

2574
02:54:09.260 --> 02:54:11.900
but now we're making all kinds of stuff.
Pentical stuff anyway.
Yeah,

2575
02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:15.890
go to the website.
Check those ones out.
Compression gear also.
Yeah.

2576
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:20.570
Not just rash guards.
Yeah.
Compare compression gear.

2577
02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:24.140
Are we calling the rash guards compression gear?
I don't know.

2578
02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:26.100
You were gonna have to figure that one out.
Yeah.

2579
02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:29.390
Compression gear sorta sounds all technical rash guards.

2580
02:54:29.410 --> 02:54:33.790
So one of the reality of the scenario in the surfing situation.
Yeah.

2581
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:36.740
So both,
whatever you like.
Know what we mean?
Yeah.

2582
02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:40.900
You know what we're coming from on that one.
Ultimately.
Yeah.
Uh,

2583
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:44.060
also super krill.

2584
02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:48.990
That's Jocko Super Krill Krill oil that's out.
Yup.

2585
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:53.450
Or Gin Maine.
And then you click on labs,
right?

2586
02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:58.130
The lab tab and they got a little bar.
You,
you'll see it.
Yeah.
Go there.

2587
02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:01.640
Go to origin main.com and then a bunch of people preordered it ordered it.

2588
02:55:01.641 --> 02:55:05.540
So they should start originated in the mail.
They're getting people have it now.

2589
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:10.250
Oh Dang.
Okay.
And Yeah,
if you want more you can get it there.

2590
02:55:10.310 --> 02:55:14.990
Yeah.
And joint warfare,
that's a good one too.

2591
02:55:15.470 --> 02:55:19.370
So if you've got this blend,
you've got the d by the double,
you know,

2592
02:55:19.610 --> 02:55:22.940
situation.
That's ultimately the kit,
right?

2593
02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:27.680
The joint maintenance excellence kit.
That's it.
Yeah.

2594
02:55:28.310 --> 02:55:32.150
Boom.
And then,
yeah,
like I said,
Geez,
rash guards,
all kinds of cool stuff.

2595
02:55:32.151 --> 02:55:36.080
Just go on there.
And that's a,
that's a good way to support also fitness gear,

2596
02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:39.730
kettle bells.
You know how like you mentioned this and I,

2597
02:55:39.770 --> 02:55:43.160
and I posted a little Instagram video of me of,
you know,

2598
02:55:43.161 --> 02:55:47.190
you said a random and I'm walking through the house Instagram,

2599
02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:52.940
I'll give you credit.
He has a very good Instagram video.
I liked it a lot.

2600
02:55:52.970 --> 02:55:54.110
That actually,

2601
02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:58.280
that is exactly what that was was when you said,
yeah,

2602
02:55:58.281 --> 02:56:02.720
I keep my honors.
Do a snatch.
Yeah.
I just do like clean and jerk yet.

2603
02:56:02.810 --> 02:56:06.050
So that's what it was.
You know,
you walk by it and he noticed it.
Boom.
Hit it.

2604
02:56:06.490 --> 02:56:09.950
I think was calling you out.
You know who's call about who now?

2605
02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:14.980
But I will admit now that I have like the whole set pretty much chimp,

2606
02:56:15.890 --> 02:56:19.940
Werewolf,
gorilla,
72 pounds,
big foot,
90 pounds,

2607
02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:23.180
they're all out there.
Right.
You know?
Right.
Where you,
where I made that video,

2608
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:26.510
I feel the same way as you when I walked by.
You just,

2609
02:56:26.540 --> 02:56:28.760
you kind of want to and that's good for you.
Yeah.

2610
02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:32.300
Unless you're all super cold and stiff and then you want to grab that,

2611
02:56:32.310 --> 02:56:37.160
the 90 pounds,
that's not good for a little lighter.
Your,
yes.
Anyway,

2612
02:56:37.650 --> 02:56:40.370
point there being,
I digress.
Anyway,

2613
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:46.700
I get my kettle bells from Onnit.
Saul kettlebells are cool.
Of course.

2614
02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:50.510
I'm not going to go into a whole kettle bell thing.
No,
I'm not going to,

2615
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:53.630
but if you want the cooler kettlebells,
kettlebells,

2616
02:56:53.631 --> 02:56:56.840
the artistic ones I liked on at once.

2617
02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:01.340
Approved Werewolf one I think is my favorite one.
It's dope.

2618
02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:04.340
You can get the regular ones too.
Anyway,
also a bunch of other stuff.

2619
02:57:04.341 --> 02:57:08.090
Maces battle ropes,
like any kind of kind of,

2620
02:57:08.091 --> 02:57:12.830
the functional train is we'd call this functional stuff functional.

2621
02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:15.920
It's functional and it's,
I guess the word is fitness.

2622
02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:17.120
Even though I don't like that word.
That's,

2623
02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:20.660
that's why I was kind of functional training,
I guess.

2624
02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:23.120
Hardcore functional training.
Yeah.

2625
02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:27.800
There is some cool stuff on there and all the info behind it too on it.com/jocko

2626
02:57:27.890 --> 02:57:32.890

There are some good shirts on there.
Literally,
literally

2654
02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:28.930
true.
This is good backwards anyway.
I'm not saying to buy something,

2655
02:59:28.931 --> 02:59:33.340
just go on their checkout stuff.
If you like the stuff on there,

This stuff for women,
shirts,

hoodies,

2657
02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:43.960
any day.
Now the hoodies are,
the more they're heavier.
Yes.

2658
02:59:44.410 --> 02:59:47.650
And I'm gonna put some new routes heaviest there.
Well,

2659
02:59:47.800 --> 02:59:50.080
here's the thing about the heaviest.

2660
02:59:51.640 --> 02:59:54.920
So I'm going through the options.
You know,
Holly,

2661
02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:59.470
there's one that's like too heavy and it's like super expensive or been to

2662
02:59:59.471 --> 03:00:02.980
Michigan.
They're like,
you've never been to Maine.
Yeah.

2663
03:00:02.981 --> 03:00:06.340
Well I guess you haven't been to many.
You're going to be,
wasn't it?

2664
03:00:06.341 --> 03:00:10.630
Wasn't that cool?
Yeah,
no,
I get it.
Um,
put it this way,

2665
03:00:10.810 --> 03:00:12.070
I'm convinced.

2666
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:13.210
<v 1>Okay</v>

2667
03:00:13.210 --> 03:00:16.720
<v 6>for whatever that's worth,
I'm convinced this is the appropriate one.
Okay.</v>

2668
03:00:17.170 --> 03:00:18.280
That's what I think.
Well,

2669
03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:23.110
we meaning everyone that listens to this and myself,

2670
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:25.030
we will be the judge of that,

2671
03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:28.360
especially people that are from the north of America

2672
03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:34.840
or Canada.
Sure.
The northern region.
I got,
I got you and I'm,
I'm confident.

2673
03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:37.420
Yeah,
just give me the feedback.
All good.

2674
03:00:37.450 --> 03:00:42.310
We will also psychological warfare on your journey

2675
03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:45.990
slash campaign against weakness.

2676
03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:50.610
If you run into those days where you're not feeling like it and that's affecting

2677
03:00:50.611 --> 03:00:55.611
you where you're led to make or potentially make the decision to slack,

2678
03:00:57.930 --> 03:01:00.010
hit the snooze,
skip the workout,

2679
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:01.360
<v 0>cheat on the Diet,</v>

2680
03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:06.630
procrastinate more or other forms of weakness.

2681
03:01:07.210 --> 03:01:11.860
You listened to this
album with tracks,

2682
03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:16.890
Jocko checks telling you pragmatically why you shouldn't give into those

2683
03:01:18.881 --> 03:01:19.714
weaknesses.

2684
03:01:21.490 --> 03:01:24.370
Results do not vary.

2685
03:01:24.490 --> 03:01:27.880
100% success rate on that one.
In my experience,

2686
03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:32.810
psychological warfare on iTunes,
Amazon music,
anywhere where they sell.

2687
03:01:32.830 --> 03:01:36.970
MP Three S it's a good one.
Very effective.
Good way to support as well.

2688
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:41.260
Also on Amazon Jocko White Tea,

2689
03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:43.630
you can get that through Amazon.

2690
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:47.320
You just searched Jocko white tea and then you order it and then you drink it

2691
03:01:47.560 --> 03:01:51.430
and you start throwing things around and smashing everything around you.

2692
03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:56.260
That's what it does.
No big deal.
Be prepared.
Do have some books there too.

2693
03:01:56.740 --> 03:02:00.400
You can get them weigh the warrior kid.
That's a kid's book.

2694
03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:02.620
Extreme ownership.

2695
03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:06.340
That's a book about leadership discipline equals freedom field manual.

2696
03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:11.230
That comes out October 17th it's,

2697
03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:16.770
it's a book about getting after it for lack of a better word.

2698
03:02:16.771 --> 03:02:20.880
Now what's interesting about this is the book is the book is not going to be

2699
03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:24.690
available through audible itself.

2700
03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:30.440
It's going to be available through MP3 platforms such as iTunes,

2701
03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:35.720
Google play.
What other platforms are there?

2702
03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:41.460
Amazon prime music,
music,
listening,
Amazon,

2703
03:02:41.490 --> 03:02:42.660
so that's what's going to be available.

2704
03:02:42.690 --> 03:02:46.440
The reason we did that is that the beats that we could instead of just make it a

2705
03:02:46.441 --> 03:02:51.441
big long multi hour drone of the talking,

2706
03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:56.130
it's caught up as an album with tracks,

2707
03:02:57.180 --> 03:03:02.180
which seems to be the way that way you can utilize it for just quick listening

2708
03:03:03.210 --> 03:03:07.650
for almost like you'd use psychological warfare album.
Yeah.
And if,

2709
03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.030
if a manual,
that's why I like this.
No,
it's not a story.
That's not a story.

2710
03:03:12.031 --> 03:03:12.241
You know,

2711
03:03:12.241 --> 03:03:15.480
it's not a story does when he goes warfare d I mean discipline equals freedom

2712
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:17.520
field manual is not a story.

2713
03:03:20.390 --> 03:03:23.630
It's a field manual.
Sure.
It's instructions.

2714
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:28.750
So you can get that there for your business echelon front leadership,

2715
03:03:29.930 --> 03:03:34.340
me,
Leif,
Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,
if you want to get tied into that,

2716
03:03:34.341 --> 03:03:38.390
if you want us to come out and work with your company info@echelonfront.com.

2717
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:43.610
So that is that those are all great ways to support this podcast.

2718
03:03:44.330 --> 03:03:49.330
We appreciate it and thanks to everyone for your support and mostly for

2719
03:03:49.911 --> 03:03:51.170
listening to the podcast,

2720
03:03:51.171 --> 03:03:56.171
especially those that are out there in uniform that provide the freedom and

2721
03:03:56.571 --> 03:04:01.571
protection that we will never take for granted.

2722
03:04:03.970 --> 03:04:08.970
Freedom that men like Charlie Plumb and Jim Kunkel fought and sacrificed to

2723
03:04:10.540 --> 03:04:12.580
uphold for us.

2724
03:04:14.670 --> 03:04:19.670
And I would simply ask everyone to make something out of the freedom that you

2725
03:04:19.891 --> 03:04:21.480
have.
Don't waste it.

2726
03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:27.390
And the way that you get the most out of your freedom.

2727
03:04:27.391 --> 03:04:28.890
I'll tell you that what way?
That is.

2728
03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:31.140
The way you get the most out of your freedom is discipline.

2729
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:36.720
That's how you get the most out of your freedom.
Push yourself hard,

2730
03:04:36.990 --> 03:04:38.400
get things done,

2731
03:04:38.730 --> 03:04:43.730
create and build and make yourself the best you that you can't.

2732
03:04:46.490 --> 03:04:47.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2733
03:04:47.230 --> 03:04:49.270
<v 0>In everything that you do.</v>

2734
03:04:51.700 --> 03:04:55.480
But getting out there,
the getting after it.

2735
03:04:58.090 --> 03:05:00.100
So until next time,

2736
03:05:02.050 --> 03:05:05.050
this was Mr Jim Conkle,

2737
03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:09.940
Captain Charlie Plumb and Echo,

2738
03:05:10.390 --> 03:05:13.330
and Jocko
out.
