This is Jocko podcast number one 34 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.950
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo and good evening.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.313
<v 0>Maybe</v>

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.520
I was always in the wrong place at the wrong time.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.390
I can see where someone could get that idea,

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.430
but I actually don't think that,

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.310
I don't think that at all.
It's in fact quite the opposite.

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.930
Now
looking back,

10
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.020
of course there were some,

11
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.140
some tough times.

12
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.450
There were some awful times

13
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.650
I'd even go so far as to say there were some wretched times.

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.200
There were nights filled with discomfort and stress and fear and there was

15
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:14.564
pressure

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.710
and sometimes that pressure was

17
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.300
so great that I thought my mind just might fracture

18
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.053
and break apart.

19
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.990
<v 0>But fortunately I could tell you that I didn't break.</v>

21
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.200
There were times,
there were times when I saw the cracks.

22
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.900
<v 0>I saw the cracks starting to split open and I had to work hard to keep it</v>

24
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:52.734
together,

25
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.020
but that's the way it was in my old line of work.

26
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.400
My old line of work had some definite downsides

27
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
cause it on top of all that pressure and stress and fear and discomfort.

28
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.770
<v 0>There was death</v>

30
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.670
even during peacetime,

31
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.290
even during peace time,
I lost friends and I lost teammates.

32
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.350
<v 0>It goes with the personality profile.</v>

34
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.840
They would say risk takers.

35
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.780
So even piece provided little piece.

36
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.950
And then once the war started,
it just escalated.

37
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.870
Not just for me,
not by any stretch whatsoever.

38
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.871
Every military member has dealt with death in some way over the past 17 years of

39
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.054
war,

40
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.530
some more than others.

41
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.660
They've also been life changing wounds

42
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.780
of which I was spared.

43
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v 1>I was lucky,</v>

44
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
<v 0>but many others,
we're not so lucky</v>

45
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.080
because the bombs and the bullets and the Iud is,

46
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.720
and the mortars and the rockets,

47
00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:51.650
they do not care who you are at all.

48
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.610
<v 1>But
for whatever reason,</v>

49
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.030
I made it through,
I was lucky

50
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.350
<v 0>and now
my life goes on.</v>

51
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.533
They may be,

52
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.290
I'm a little more paranoid than the next person and maybe I don't always sleep

53
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:24.861
that well.

54
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:29.861
And maybe there's times when some fought or some memory catches me off guard and

55
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:32.720
I end up reliving a moment from the past,

56
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.530
a moment from the past that I wish I could change.

57
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.763
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.660
<v 0>And you might think,</v>

59
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.590
wouldn't I just want to change it all?

60
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.790
<v 0>When I want to go back and erase all that pain and replace it with relief,</v>

62
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.570
then replace it with ease and with comfort

63
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.790
and the answer to that question is no

64
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.900
practice.
Not just no,
it's hell no.

65
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.450
<v 0>Because wrapped up in that pain and wrapped up in that discomfort and wrapped up</v>

67
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:31.791
in that stress and anxiety wrapped up in all that is the polar opposites of all

68
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:34.020
those feelings.

69
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.410
Inside all that turmoil,

70
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.000
there was relief.
There was certainty,

71
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.120
there was happiness,

72
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.830
there was a focus and security and there was peace,

73
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>peace</v>

74
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 0>of mind in knowing that
no matter what,</v>

75
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.850
no matter what horrors be fell me,

76
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.760
things would be okay

77
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.990
and that is because I knew that my brothers would take care of me no matter

78
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.913
what.

79
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.103
<v 1>Okay?</v>

80
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.580
<v 0>You see my old job allowed me to work with some of the best guys in the world.</v>

81
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.830
Not all of them.
You've heard me talk about that before.

82
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.600
There's substandard people in every organization in the world.

83
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:41.770
There's a bell curve

84
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.090
in the bottom of the bell curve is filled with the same

85
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.130
deficient people you'll find anywhere.

86
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.560
<v 0>Lazy scamming,
irresponsible,
self centered,</v>

88
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.043
whatever.

89
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.670
But at the high end of that bell curve,

90
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.160
the guys I worked with were righteous and no bull and hardworking and it was

91
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:18.880
humbling to be around them.

92
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.980
Now,
where are they?
Perfect.
No,
none of us are.

93
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.960
Did they have flaws?
Yes,
absolutely.
All of us fall short,

94
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.600
but could I count on them?

95
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.970
Could I count on them without question and without hesitation

96
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.710
100%

97
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.160
through all the horror and the fear and the pressure,

98
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.200
there were always some guys that I knew without a shred of doubt,

99
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.190
which stand beside me and hold the line no matter what.

100
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.560
<v 0>They would never let me down</v>

102
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.233
ever.

103
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.310
And
as fate would have it,

104
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.820
I'm lucky enough to have one of those few men that I knew I could always count

105
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.390
on no matter what.
Here with me tonight.

106
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.070
<v 0>He's done more for me and for the teams and for our great nation and the world</v>

108
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.660
is ever going to know.

109
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.130
His name is Mike Cirelli.

110
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.210
He's a former recon marine,

111
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.690
but very recently retired seal officer

112
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.010
and he's someone that's let me down.

113
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.593
<v 2>So Mike,</v>

114
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.600
welcome to the podcast and thanks for coming on brother.
Hey Jocko.

115
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.400
Happy to be here in Echo.
Thank you for having me.

116
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.260
So you retired how long ago?

117
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.980
March 1st March 1st and so no one knows anything about you,

118
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.810
which is the way it is.
And um,

119
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.930
so let's get to know a little bit about you starting with the beginning.

120
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.230
Let's start nor cow or a cow.
That's where you were born.

121
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.630
Right in nor cal Palo Alto,
California.

122
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.210
Just about 30 minutes south of San Francisco.

123
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.690
Entire family born and raised in San Francisco.

124
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.130
They're all still back there except for my brother or white fish,
Montana.
But uh,

125
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.880
you know what?
Nothing,
nothing to really lack in terms of growing up at,

126
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.260
I had a great family.
Um,
you know,
sometimes I describe growing up in this house,

127
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.910
the Sorelli household is a being in 1960s,
1950s,

128
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.930
Germany.
Berlin,
except I was on the,
yeah,
the wrong side of the wall.
No,

129
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.690
I grew up in a very Catholic family,
loving parents,
very,
uh,
very strict,

130
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.850
stern parents.
But I got the,
uh,
the benefit of being the last child.

131
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.890
And by that,
you know,
that point they older brother and sister,
they'd worn down.

132
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.800
They down your parents a little bit,
you,

133
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.340
they'd worn down my parents a little bit.

134
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.350
And so I got away with bloody murder to a point.
Um,
but you know,

135
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.370
standard,
uh,
you know,
upbringing of a seal.
Uh,
I had my share of,
uh,

136
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.260
of trouble,
uh,
that a cost and a,

137
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.590
that's probably why I went the path that I went.
At what point did you,

138
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.160
at what point did you realize that you are going to go in the military?

139
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.350
So,
you know,

140
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.850
I can't pinpoint a specific moment,

141
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.060
but everything was driving that,
driving me that way.

142
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.220
I did have a grandfather that was a first of the five oh first.
Oh Wow.

143
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.230
In World War II.
I actually,

144
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:03.030
he trained with a patent out in,
um,
oh,
it,
uh,

145
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.190
it uh,
yeah,
the are trading center.
Yes.

146
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.430
I assume they actually trained at the eye.
The lake.
Oh,
okay.
Near,
uh,
near Niland.

147
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.070
Oh,
okay.
Salton Sea.
And so read,

148
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:20.090
actually hit the very early part of Africa and then came back to the states,

149
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.080
uh,

150
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.600
when airborne and he was a quartermaster for the first of the five Oh six fifth,

151
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.500
I'm sorry,
first of the five o first.
And then the last,

152
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.140
he still went through airborne training.
He would jump in with them.

153
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:36.470
And so he was actually a third day of Normandy drop day and then,

154
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:40.830
uh,
fought in the battle of the bulge in the black forest.

155
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.780
It's so that humble confidence that he never spoke about.

156
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.370
And so my mom would naturally tell me stories and,
um,

157
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.070
it wasn't until I became a marine that he actually,
you know,
really

158
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.520
<v 0>revealed a lot of the stories from,
uh,
from World War Two.
And then,
you know,</v>

159
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.560
as he got older and it was,
it was the same stories,

160
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.720
but I would sit there and listen for the 15th time as if it was the first time I

161
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:08.500
was,
you know,
airing it out of respect.
You know,
it's interesting.

162
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:12.080
I was talking to Dave Burke once again today.
Good deal.
Good deal.
Dave,

163
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.310
we were talking about reading about face and uh,

164
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.240
I was saying,
hey,
you know,

165
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:24.070
when you were reading about w w the older I got,
the more it meant to me.

166
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:27.850
And there's a quote from Musashi that I talked about in the podcast,
which is,

167
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.910
it's something like this and I'm not going to get it perfectly right,

168
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:33.850
but it's something like this when you know the way,

169
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.220
then you see the way in all things.
So about faces,

170
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.600
not a leadership book at all.

171
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.900
But when you read it and you are thinking about leadership,

172
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.720
it's just all about leadership.
It's 100% about leadership.

173
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.460
But it reminds me of what you're saying,
like when you're little,

174
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.550
when you're a kid and you don't know the way yet,

175
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.750
and your grandfather could be telling you these stories and it sounds kind of

176
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:56.890
cool or whatever,

177
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.720
but compared to when you actually know and understand Warren and you,

178
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.820
it's just a totally different story.
And as a matter of fact,
speaking to that,

179
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.570
when you were running the Johnson course,
I was,

180
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.330
I came in and I was going to do like the brief that I would do to the Johnson

181
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.210
course and you know,
you were there.

182
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.580
It was like the 10th time you were going to watch it.
And I was like,
Hey,

183
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.540
are you going to hang out and watch this?

184
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.400
Are you just going to leave and go do like work out or something?

185
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.480
And you're like,
no,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm gonna stick around.
And I was like,
well,

186
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:26.530
why are you for what?
And you're like,
I learned something new every time.

187
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.040
I was like,
Dang.
So that's pretty,
uh,

188
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.600
definitely when you get older you can appreciate some of these things from,
um,

189
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.590
when you know the way,
let's look at extreme ownership.
I mean,

190
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:40.360
this is why you hear people that are like,
Hey,

191
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.410
I'm reading it for the seventh time.
Yeah.

192
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.270
Because they will get 10 new things or their perspective has changed.

193
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.680
That's the Bin and learn.
That's the part that I didn't account for.

194
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:51.310
And I don't know who told me this is,
somebody told me this,

195
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:55.300
like it was someone that had come to multiple masters and I said,
well you know,

196
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.240
how'd you like this one?
And all the monsters are a little bit different.

197
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:01.690
But the first three were not that different.
The first three were the same,

198
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.130
almost the same.
And someone said,
well it's only been a year,

199
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:09.040
but my perspective is totally different now cause I've been promoted one time

200
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.890
and I've got different situations going on.
So it's,
I'm seeing it differently.

201
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.150
So that's,
that's another thing that happens as you get older.

202
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.310
So back to you,
how did you pick the Marine Corps?

203
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.440
Or did the Marine Corps Cook you
a little bit of both?

204
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.120
Uh,
out of options?
No.
Hey,
so your standard again,
high school sports,

205
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.920
um,
loved running,
loved wrestling,
uh,

206
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.270
the grades not so much.

207
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.630
It wasn't for a lack of aptitude.

208
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.620
There was a lack of complete effort.
And so,
you know,

209
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.710
loved to party if it didn't have to do with parties or girls.

210
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.040
Uh,
I wasn't involved.
Yeah.

211
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.290
<v 2>And so I actually was the only one in my high school class and not to graduate.</v>

212
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.250
Yes,
we got that going for you.
My mom is a,

213
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.310
is a little [inaudible] a woman and uh,
she,
you know,

214
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.630
she really is the rock of the family and you have to know how to play her.

215
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.700
My Dad is just the disciplinary and you feared him?
Uh,
yeah.
You just feared them.

216
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.840
Bottom line.
But you're,
you know,
my mom was a nurturer and the disciplinarian,

217
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.990
you just had to play both sides because once you put her on the,

218
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:28.130
onto the disciplinary side,
you just had no safe a safe house whatsoever,

219
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.250
anywhere in the Israeli household.
Um,
so they did,
you know,

220
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.270
my dad had served in Vietnam,
in the reserves.

221
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.450
He did not have to go to Vietnam because he had a very unique skill.

222
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.320
He was very good at football.
And back in the day he was stationed at Fort Polk,

223
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:43.430
Louisiana,
Louisiana.

224
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.150
He got assigned to the football team and that's what he did in the,
uh,
the army.

225
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.670
But very different army wasn't a fan of the military.
It just,
you know,

226
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.490
we were different in those regards,
but we're,
we're very much alike.
Um,

227
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.190
so I went off to the University of Colorado,
Colorado,
boulder,

228
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.720
the how did you do this median can graduate high school and you get,
you know,

229
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.350
so I went,
went back for the summer school,

230
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.700
summer session and finished the requirement.
Uh,

231
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.190
I'd already been accepted into the University of Colorado Boulder.
This,

232
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:18.250
the early stage of my life is not just parents can't say there's a whole lot of

233
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:22.370
pride there from the end of high school until about the first year in college.

234
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.653
So,
uh,

235
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.930
I did not pick up a ROTC and naval ROTC scholarship at Boulder,

236
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.250
but you can enroll as a,
uh,
uh,
a volunteer.
It helps to pick it up a scholarship.

237
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.470
So I joined the naval ROTC at University Colorado Boulder and,

238
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.550
uh,
shortly got kicked out,
um,
just for getting in trouble.

239
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.781
And I remember the,

240
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:49.781
the Battalion Mitch Shipping Commander pulled me in for my counseling and said,

241
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:55.550
you will never become a navy seal.
And also at that time,

242
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:57.090
you want to be in the seal teams.
You shoe.
I would,

243
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.220
I was going between the seals and force recon and you know,
Lo and behold,

244
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:04.760
we had this guy,
Ben,
I won't use his last name.
He was a force recon marine,

245
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.820
fifth force at the University of Colorado Boulder as a marine,

246
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.980
Misa marine enlisted commissioning education program,
uh,

247
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.830
a marine and was just impressive.

248
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.630
Built like a little tank.
Uh,
everything about him,
articulate,
smart,
confident,

249
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.500
not the loudest guy in the room.
Uh,
and so he sort of took me under his wings.

250
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.480
I hit,
don't worry about it.
Um,

251
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.350
college is not going to work out for you is go around.

252
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.600
Why don't you do what you want to do.
And uh,
you know,
walked me down to the,
uh,

253
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:40.550
the recruiting office in Boulder,
Colorado,
signed up.
And when I signed up,

254
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.780
I came back to northern California for a few months while I was waiting for my,

255
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:49.710
uh,
my bootcamp date,
uh,
enjoyed myself.
And then when it was time to go,

256
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.840
uh,
you know,
I sort of dropped the last minute and information on my parents.
Mom,

257
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.060
having a father that was in the military,
she accepted it pretty well.
And,
uh,

258
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.600
for my father,
he was a,
he was not happy given his,
you know,

259
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.540
everything is about our perceptions in life,
in his perception.

260
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.450
His experience with the army was not favorable one.

261
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.070
And so he was livid and um,
you know,

262
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.240
we had a few words and he did not see me off to the airport,
my brother and uh,

263
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.500
my mother did.
Um,

264
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.940
and then fast forward to a to boot camp.
Um,

265
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.600
Ben again had a,
had given me some good advice like,
hey,

266
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.350
you can turn this around in the marine corps will give you every,

267
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.250
every opportunity to do that until I crushed it in bootcamp,

268
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.550
graduated honor man out of like 300 kids and on graduation day or the day prior,

269
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.000
you know,
the parents can come out and see ya in the lineup,
the entire,
uh,

270
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.600
recruit battalion and Lo and behold,

271
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:52.950
who's in front carrying the guide on me.
And that's the one time,
you know what,

272
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:55.830
me and my father did not get along in high school.
Cause again,
not his fault,

273
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.180
you just see them doing this and shaking his head.

274
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.910
And you ever since that time,

275
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.770
my father and I see each other in a different light.

276
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.280
We still clash because we were so alike.

277
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.900
But,
uh,
we,
you know,
we've got a common understanding and uh,
he's just a good man.

278
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.830
My parents are good folks.
I couldn't,
you know,

279
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.600
I was never want for love for discipline.
Um,

280
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.790
in this really household.
It was a great house.

281
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.160
It's weird too because as a parent you're always thinking

282
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.770
if you try and impose too much on your kids,
you're just gonna,

283
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.700
you're just gonna push them in the other direction.
You know what I'm saying?
So,

284
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.190
<v 0>you know,
like for instance,
your dad could have been like,
no,</v>

285
00:19:39.191 --> 00:19:41.650
you're not joining it and you would have been so rebellious,

286
00:19:41.651 --> 00:19:43.460
probably would have joined anyways and done,
you know,

287
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:46.780
you then you would just not got along even more.
But he had to just be like,
okay,

288
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.080
I'm not going to see you off,
but I'll be there at graduation.
Dude,

289
00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:53.980
I'll put to you this way.
I love the Marine Corps

290
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.500
<v 2>best run service,
albeit they're the small service,</v>

291
00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.330
best run service in the u s military.
You just can't debate that.

292
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.923
Um,

293
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:09.130
and I think what he saw was he sent a boy off in like within three months he saw

294
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.590
the beginning of a man and I mean,
he loved it.
He took it on wholesale.

295
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.360
He loved it so much that he would pass by a recruiting office.
He'd stopped,

296
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:24.370
get some donuts
and bring them into the office and shake your hands.
I mean he,

297
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.770
he loved the military at this point.
He sought from a different,

298
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:32.010
I mean we literally changed his experience in Vietnam to a favorable one.
Yeah.

299
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

300
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.020
The Marine Corps has really just mastered that whole thing of taking a recruit

301
00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:41.000
and turning them into a marine.
They,
they really good at that.

302
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.540
They are really good.
It's awesome.
The thing I said about the,

303
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.820
the Marine Corps has theirs,

304
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.221
<v 2>you know,
in the seal teams,</v>

305
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:52.780
you'll get the totally great guys at the high end of the spectrum and you'll get

306
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:55.990
real bad,
much worse.
Guys at the lower end,
the spectrum,
the Marine Corps,

307
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.180
it just keeps it all in.
It's much tighter group.

308
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.250
Like you know what you're getting.
It's going to be,

309
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.680
it's going to be a marine and he's going to be good to go.

310
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.600
You were talking about like their minute a bangle.
Yeah,
they're admitted.

311
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.060
It's a tight shot group.
The seal teams,
you know,
we get some,

312
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.520
we get some awesome guys for sure.

313
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.680
But then you get a couple scattered around this out there.

314
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.680
A couple of stray rounds that are off paper.
Don't,

315
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.040
don't worry about that little check.
So,
so then what,

316
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.990
what year was this now?
Cause this is like 1998 and 99 was,
it was 98,

317
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.670
98.
So,

318
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:32.671
so glad I came in before nine 11 cause I got to see the pre war military,

319
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.370
uh,
and then became what I call the,

320
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.470
the g watt babies that were absolutely spoiled in this.

321
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.580
Sounds contradictory is fueled by war.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

322
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.590
So what would you do?
Would you,
what was your mls?

323
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.730
So went in as a uh,
Jesus,
I'm even forgetting it.
Uh,

324
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.300
oh,
three 11 rifleman.
Check.
But,
so when I was at the school of imagery,

325
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.930
these recon marines show up and you could always tell the recon marines,

326
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:04.190
they have the dual cool,
the,
the job,

327
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.530
you have to double trouble and the hair's a little longer and they stand a

328
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:11.990
little taller.
And uh,
so unbeknownst to me,
they,

329
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.160
they literally had to try out that,
uh,
that day.

330
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.350
And so that was my opportunity to get into recon early.
And,
uh,

331
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:24.100
I did extremely well,
uh,
finished first within that class and they're like,
okay,

332
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.680
did you want to go round?
I said,
yes,
absolutely.

333
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.560
And so out of the school of Infantry,
when I graduated from there,

334
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.150
it was straight to the base constant scores right next to buds.
Wow.

335
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.490
In Core Natto uh,
for three months.

336
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:38.830
And you guys get to go straight through that pipeline like that.

337
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.050
So you knew what it ebbed and flowed.

338
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.830
Usually you had to do some infantry time before you try it out.
But I think,
uh,

339
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.420
you know,
similar to,
to,
to the demands of a post nine 11 when we started out,

340
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.770
we were the green Brae community started opening up the 18 x program for guys

341
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:55.660
straight off the street into the special forces.

342
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.930
Recon would occasionally do the same thing.
And so very few.

343
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:02.290
And I just happened to hit a at an opportune time,
uh,

344
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.050
pass the screening and I'll tell you what,

345
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:09.760
BRC was tough and I have nothing but respect for those guys.
It's,

346
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.940
you know,
it's not,
they don't have a hell week,
but it is,
uh,

347
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.880
it is man town,
uh,
in every respect.
Yeah,
no,
I used to see those guys.

348
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:22.350
Obviously we'd see him all the time going through classes and then so,

349
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.700
and then you show up.
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go after that?

350
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.760
So first recon battalion at Camp Pendleton.
Sure.
It was,

351
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.810
it was quickly thrown into schools.
It was awesome.
So,
uh,

352
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.600
got dive school right off the bat,

353
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.680
which is the marine combatant dive course in Panama City,
Florida,
which was a,

354
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.560
I'll tell you what,
and uh,
most seals don't like to hear this.

355
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.820
It was as tough as second phase,
if not tougher.
And even academically,

356
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.200
uh,
they,
they dove in a lot deeper to the dive physics,
the guy of medicine.

357
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.980
So you had guys getting dropped for,
uh,
for academics.
Um,

358
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.030
and then after that it was shortly off to sniper school,

359
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.170
which I was ill prepared for.
Uh,
loved.

360
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.040
I remember my mom,
I went back to San Francisco,
uh,

361
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.710
cause I had a weekend off and you got to build your own Ghillie suits and I

362
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:13.190
built the worst Ghillie suit that you probably have ever seen.

363
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.630
I still have the thing in storage.
It looks like Chewbacca lying on the ground.

364
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.083
Um,

365
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.160
but past that school by the skin of my teeth and I think we started with 40,

366
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:28.670
and we graduated 12 and it literally came down to the last stock.
And,
uh,

367
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:34.030
a guy named Brian from Idaho who had been with a stale platoon in the marine

368
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:38.480
corps,
which is more or less a sniper platoon.
And uh,

369
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.320
literally helped me get into my last position and sacrificed himself cause he

370
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:45.930
didn't need to score a perfect score on that run.
And a in past,

371
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.040
but I made up for it and that,
you know,
the shooting who've,
yeah,
shoot,

372
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.600
the shooting was not a problem.
It was just stocking,
uh,

373
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.950
since I had no real preparatory work going in and those guys had it,

374
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.730
it was tough.
How was your patient's level during Stockton was a good,

375
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.670
it was a,
you know,
it,
it was decent.
Uh,
the problem was we,

376
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.680
we went to sniper school in January in California,
which is cold.

377
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.000
And so we were out there all the time,
sometimes rain.
And so it,
you know,

378
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.950
the patients was,
it was fine.
It was just the pain of sitting there,
um,

379
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:24.110
which,
which he had to contend with.
And then,
and then do you go on deployment?
No.

380
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.220
So did a,
a entire workup and actually shifted over to,

381
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.810
to another platoon because I was at first recon battalion and it was a company

382
00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:36.290
at the time and we turned into a battalion when I was there.

383
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.400
So I transferred from seven platoon to a new platoon and continued to a workup

384
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.800
and,
uh,
had a great officer,
um,
pulled me aside and he's like,
Hey man,
uh,

385
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.390
I want to put you in for the reset program,

386
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.310
which again is the marine enlisted commissioning education program for the

387
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:53.960
listeners.
That's where they send an active duty marine,

388
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:58.961
usually a corporal sergeant or staff sergeant to go back and get their college

389
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:02.600
degree on the Marine Corps dime and then come back as an officer.

390
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.910
It's because you've shown some promise.

391
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.170
What I say is I'd only been to alcohol related incidents in the Marine Corps.

392
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.210
And so I said,
hey your,
your honor,
I'm joking.

393
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.410
But uh,
so the,
the officer put me in,

394
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.470
I filled out the package and got selected as a corporal very early in my career.

395
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.220
And so,
uh,
when they asked me what I wanted to go,

396
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:29.170
I wanted to go to the university.

397
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.290
University of Texas did not get in because what's the track back?

398
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.270
They look at high school.
And so,

399
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:40.700
uh,
believe it or not,
I'd been to a wedding in Austin,

400
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.690
one of my recon buddies and love the town.
And,
uh,
the same guy looked at me,

401
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:49.350
he's like,
hey man,
Wah Wah,
why don't you try a Texas a and m?
He's like,

402
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.800
it's like the next best thing.
It's only about an hour and a half outside of,
uh,

403
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:57.000
Austin.
I'm like,
okay,
all right.
And of course,
I'm a corporal at the time,

404
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.180
I don't have the money to go visit Texas a and m internet was not exactly

405
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:06.120
booming at that time.
And,
uh,
so I just submitted an application,

406
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:09.210
actually some marines that were there called me and they made it sound like a

407
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.570
great place.
And so when I went out there,
uh,

408
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.600
drove out there with my three boxes of household goods and it is just a country

409
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:24.380
down with 50,000 college students.
And,
uh,

410
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.220
it was a great opportunity,

411
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:31.110
but college station was not for me and the war had kicked off.

412
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.340
And so I finished school in three years and,
uh,
got out of there.

413
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.500
And then how did you go from,

414
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.730
at what point did you tell him you wanted to join the navy?
So I,
you know,

415
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.730
going out there,
I had had about a 75%,
uh,

416
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.300
had already made my decision that I wanted to switch over to the seals.

417
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.970
Even if you looked at it from a time perspective,

418
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.650
had I gone to TBS and then,
you know,
officer of tree course,

419
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.880
it would've taken me the same amount of time to get to a seal team.

420
00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.650
And so it just made common sense.

421
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.590
I'd worked with a few seals during the workups workups,
uh,

422
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.300
at first three comp time.
Uh,
you know,
they were older,

423
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.890
statistically more highly educated,
more physically fit,

424
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.760
and the biggest part,
they were part of Socom and they had the money.

425
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.760
I was still carrying an m 1682 as a recon marine.
Mrs Neiber.

426
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.120
Um,
we just didn't have the money.
We didn't have the gear.
And so,
uh,

427
00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.630
you never see seal switch from the seal teams to Regan,

428
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.110
but you see a lot of recon marines switchover to SOCOM units.

429
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:37.710
They needed to go seal green.
Baret have a lot of them went PGA,

430
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.240
which for the listeners is a air force para rescue jumper.
Um,

431
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.310
so I did go to Marino cs and I got to tell you again,

432
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.660
that was a challenge.
Uh,
lost,

433
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:56.250
I think I went in and browned probably one 85 and lost about 20 pounds that he

434
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:57.750
didn't need to uh,
to lose.

435
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.980
And so that was a summer in Quantico and I was impressed.

436
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:03.990
And you talk about maintaining that standard,

437
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:06.270
that that quality spread that the Marine Corps does so well,

438
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.620
especially within their officer ranks.
That's the reason.
Yeah.
Yeah.

439
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.650
How long has it,
how long has marine corps,
ocs?
Three months.
And how did,
if you,

440
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.930
if you knew you wanted to go in the navy,

441
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.170
how can they send you to a Marine Corps?
Ocs?
So the me set program,

442
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:26.760
you actually go to ocs after the or during the first summer of your freshman

443
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:29.790
year and got it.
You still come back as a sergeant?
I was a sergeant at that time.

444
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.840
Uh,
continue towards your degree in what you finish your degree.
Then you get,

445
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.890
you get commission one year prior.
And here's,
here's the funny thing.

446
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:41.440
So one year prior to graduating and said,
hey,
uh,

447
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:44.050
went to my marine officer,
instructor,
who's a major,

448
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.610
who's a prior enlisted guy himself,
great guy.
Uh,
I'm like,

449
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.080
I think I want to go seals.
He's was like,
okay,
let's put it back at you.

450
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:50.830
It was like,
Hey,

451
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.810
the military is going to get their pound of flesh from either way,

452
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.970
do what you want to do.
Uh,

453
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.270
the commanding officer was marine colonel did not see it that way.

454
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.553
I was dislocated.

455
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.950
So during the process of the trade to believe the court pretty much,
and,

456
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:06.760
and I literally hate you,

457
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.070
the major prep me yet.
He's like,
Hey,
just listen to what he has to say.

458
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.930
Nod your head and just step out of the room.
I got Ya.

459
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.690
And so the inner service transfer was almost immediate.

460
00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:23.050
That approved.
It was,
that was that easy of a process.

461
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.940
But then they told me I needed to attend something called out many buts that

462
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:32.680
summer of my junior year.
Um,
and,
and so when I show up,

463
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.600
you have about 35 midshipmen from naval ROTC units,

464
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.523
the Naval Academy,

465
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.880
and then one sergeant in his marine Charlies.

466
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.200
And it is,
you know,
Khakis,
Khaki top with a,
uh,

467
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.670
blue bottoms with the red stripe and,
uh,
um,

468
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.140
amongst 34 guys in white.
And I just stuck out and it was God.

469
00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.600
So God,
he always in our course and um,
you know,

470
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.150
I was still very much a sergeant,

471
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.520
so they did love me towards the end because like they said,
hey,

472
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:11.500
we need this done.
I would step up y'all,
hey fellas,
let's get this done.

473
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.060
And,
um,
the guy sort of rallied around me and,
uh,
you know,
low and behold,

474
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:16.950
at the end of that,
I had a,

475
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.430
a spot waiting for me when I graduated and it didn't hurt that,
uh,

476
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.310
the,
the CEO of buds was a former marine himself.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
That's,

477
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.810
that's awesome.
That's a good way to get that in there.

478
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.950
The prior marines that come into teams are always got a little extra squared

479
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:37.750
away inside them in their brain.
And Bud's any factor of buds.

480
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.050
Does anyone goes through buzzes and say it's an a,

481
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.280
it's a non factor in a non factor.
What was the biggest factor you had?
Patients,

482
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.370
it was patients.
I asked you about patients and snipers going,

483
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:52.030
what were you in face or with you in sniper school?
I was still new guy.

484
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.400
Uh Oh yeah,
that's right.

485
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:59.401
So you stepping into a community that I highly admired that I want to be a part

486
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:04.830
of was the easy part.
It was some of the instructors had a very,
they were,

487
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.390
they were very artistic and getting under your skin.

488
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.400
What year is it now?
Subset now when is it?
Oh yeah.
Oh it's,

489
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.000
it's game time.
And in fact I think you,
you,

490
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.670
you were deployed right around that time.
Yeah.
Well I was deployed in 2003,

491
00:32:21.671 --> 00:32:26.040
2004 my first deployment to Iraq.
Yeah.
Cause your counterpart,
your,

492
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:29.040
your sister platoon commander visited me in buds calling.

493
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.020
It was right before you guys went.
Oh,
right on.
And um,

494
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.190
which I have a funny story about a Johnsy when you came to speak to us.

495
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.280
Um,
so do you know it just

496
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.000
<v 0>the,
the patients are going through the process you went through Josie.
You did.</v>

497
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.350
Okay.
I did not remember that.
That's weird.

498
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.350
Um,
so you,
you had,

499
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:54.170
you were a little bit impatient of going through buds.

500
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.690
Like basically you're saying,
aw man,
I'm ready to get in the game.

501
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.980
And they're like,
okay,
take this,

502
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.730
sweep this grinder and do all this dumb stuff that you have to do.
Yeah.
Oh,

503
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.250
100%.
When people ask me,
cause people ask me all the time,
Hey,

504
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:10.100
I'm 33 years old,
I want to go in the military.
Do you think it's a good idea?

505
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:13.700
I'm always like,
here's the problem.
The problem is you're 34 years old.

506
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:18.080
There's some real benefits to that in that you're mature and you are smart and

507
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:22.310
you have knowledge about the world.
Here's the bad part.
You're mature,

508
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:25.040
you're smart,
you have no one's about the world.
Because when they're like,
hey,

509
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:29.720
we want you to do this completely ridiculous task that makes no sense

510
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:30.350
whatsoever.

511
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.900
You're not going to feel like doing it and you're going to have to do it.

512
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.370
And that's going to grate on you even more.

513
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.370
When I was 18 years old and I joined the navy,

514
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.190
it literally didn't matter what they made me do.
I would like,
well,

515
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.760
when you just said,
when you,
when you joined the Marine Corps and when,

516
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:45.260
when Ben said to you,
hey look,

517
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.090
you can just do what they tell you to do and life's going to be good and you

518
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.730
like,
I f I didn't,
no one told me that.
But when I got to boot Camp I was like,
oh,

519
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.500
I do what they tell me to do in life is going to be good.

520
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:57.080
That's what's going to happen.
So I was like,
Oh,
you fold my underwear,
whatever.

521
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.800
Clean the toilets.
Hey,
let's do this.
And that's a lot easier when you're 18.

522
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:04.730
The news when we were 34 a lot easier.
It is.
And you know,

523
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:07.190
it's not so much what they tell you to do.
They tell you what to do,

524
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:08.150
but they want to see if you perform.

525
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.260
It's not that we're trying to create robots and you know,
a lot of people,

526
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.210
you have to demystify that.
Uh,

527
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.360
about the military but buds is just a long process and then while we're going

528
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:17.990
through it,

529
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.560
they're telling us stories about what you guys are doing overseas and or you

530
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:24.320
know,
we had one seal pass away in Afghanistan at the time.

531
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:29.660
Someone received a navy cross in front of us and the whole time you want to be

532
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:31.340
those guys,
not the metals or any of that,

533
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:36.341
but you want to be the gladiator in the arena and you know you have 12 more

534
00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:41.420
months of training before you can even show up to a CLT.
The other,

535
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.470
the other big thing,
and you knew this because you'd been in the Marine Corps,

536
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:49.310
the other big thing that people don't understand is the fear that we all had,

537
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.950
that this thing was going to end and we weren't going to do anything.

538
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.390
That was the biggest fear I had was this war is going to happen.

539
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.920
It's going to be over in three months and I won't have deployed and off to do

540
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:03.980
the rest of my navy career.
Never have go,
never,
never go into combat.

541
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.520
Which was the neck,
the biggest nightmare I could imagine and total nightmare

542
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.780
that would have been,
it's the same for the guys that were in the Gulf War,

543
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.600
you know that certain platoons got to go over there and they sat behind thinking

544
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.730
they were going to backfill them in the war was going to be a long war and then

545
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:20.840
it's over and what six days,

546
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:26.300
I had a master sheet friend that was on the last plane to v the last platoon

547
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:30.170
going to Vietnam and the and the plane got shot down and they didn't go.

548
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.450
So I can be a total nightmare for them,

549
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.470
but it's hard for people to understand that mentality of how you want to go and

550
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.320
it's just the way it is.
Man.

551
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.860
I wish there was some nice thing to say about it or some psychological way to

552
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.200
explain it away.
Like,
Hey,
it's just a no.
It's like,

553
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.180
I'm just going to say the way it is.

554
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.880
When you're young and you're in the military,
you want to go to war.

555
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:53.580
That's all there is to it.
I'm sorry I am.
That's the way it is.

556
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.500
You believe you believe in what you were doing?
There's a sense of purpose.

557
00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.030
And again,
it is counterintuitive that anyone would want to go to combat.

558
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.730
I'm super stoked that you feel that way.

559
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.880
I'm going to here to tell you and Mitt to you that like,

560
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.680
I just wanted to go to war.
I just wanted to go to war.

561
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:18.510
I actually,
another old Vietnam Guy,
he,
when he left seal team one,
he goes,

562
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.960
he goes,
I joined the navy in 1970 so I could kill people from my country.

563
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.520
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
I know what he's talking about.
You know,

564
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.080
the funny thing is you start to love it.
You start to love.
Oh yeah,

565
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.120
that's not a bad thing.
You know,
funny enough,

566
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:37.860
I took a job right when I retired at Texas a and m system was the director of a

567
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.800
veteran services for all 12 campuses.
But,
uh,

568
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.930
there was this sort of old hen that a mother hen,

569
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.570
that dude that just didn't really like me,
you know,
she,
she leans in,
she's like,

570
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.350
what is the worst part about war?
And,
uh,

571
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.280
I look at her and say that it has to end and just walked right up and you could

572
00:36:59.221 --> 00:37:03.390
hear the,
it's,
it's the classic line that they got right.

573
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:08.010
And apocalypse now is when Colonel Kilgore is like,
he just,

574
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.360
he's distraught.
He's talking about napalm in the morning and that smell,

575
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:17.160
that gasoline smell,
the whole hill smelled bike victory

576
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.250
and someday this war is going to end.

577
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.700
And that's the worst thing he can think of because hey man,

578
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.330
he's a battalion commander of the Cavalry Unit,
Vietnam.
He's God,

579
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.310
he's still on top of the world.
He's on top of the world.

580
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.860
There's nothing more important in the world to him ever.

581
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.560
He can't even imagine it.
And he's depressed that someday the war's going to end

582
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.190
fired up.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So,
so where were we?

583
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.960
So you get done with buds buds.

584
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.800
The biggest thing that people always ask about the physical part of buds,

585
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:50.310
you're in good shape.
No factor.
Yes.

586
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.690
Is it physically exhausting?
Of course you get tired.
You know what it is.

587
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:56.400
I'll also is a,
it's an,

588
00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.600
it's an opportunity to actually start segmenting your reputation.
And again,

589
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:05.580
I was very much still a sergeant in the instructors love me because I would

590
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:07.680
rally the boys even,

591
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.090
you know what I like to call a healthy appetite or healthy disrespect for

592
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:15.680
authority is to get the guys fired up against them a little bit.
Yeah,

593
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.330
for get and pay a little bit.
You,

594
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.510
you'd see what's working and what's around the board so and again,
you know,

595
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.730
got the fire in the gut.
The boys love me.
They rallied around me.
Officer,

596
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:28.800
you've got the fire of the gut.
Yeah,
I haven't heard that too much.

597
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.960
Have you heard that too much?
You don't?
I don't know.

598
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.350
I haven't heard that too much.
I a caveat or what is it called out of,

599
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:38.760
forget what it's called,
but I had one of my buddies texted me.
The day you,

600
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.690
you're making it sound like buds is super easy.
It's not easy.
And I was like,
no,

601
00:38:42.691 --> 00:38:45.880
no,
no,
no.
Let me let me correct myself.
I'm not saying buds.
It's easy.

602
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:50.500
Like you said,
buds is hard.
It's physically hard.
The hardest thing to me,

603
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.350
I think physically is that it goes on day after day after day,

604
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:56.020
after day after day.
And so when you're doing a four mile time Braun,

605
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:58.840
which should be pretty easy because in first phase you've got 32 minutes to do

606
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:02.770
that.
That's a long,
that's a slow pace.
Even for a grown man,

607
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:05.110
that's a slow pace.
Even for a big guy,
that's a slow pace.

608
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.640
But when you've done whatever,
8,008 count bodybuilders the day before,

609
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.030
and then you got up at three in the morning and you did 8 million flutter kicks,

610
00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:15.610
and then you go out and get on the beach and you do a timed run in soft sand

611
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:20.020
with boots on,
it's not easy.
And that's what,
that's what trips people up.

612
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.150
I think the grind,
the one thing too,
for me that was that it was a driver is,

613
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:25.810
uh,

614
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.810
there was no way that I was going to disrespect the marine reconnaissance

615
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:35.710
community.
No Way.
There are some warriors.
I mean,

616
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.870
there was a lot of warriors within that community.

617
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:41.110
And so that was always over my head.
No way was I going to ring that bell.

618
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.940
That would just be a complete,
a complete,

619
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.800
utter lack of respect for the community I came from.

620
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.420
They're quitting and buds is really hard to understand.
And I,
I had like a,

621
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.470
I had like a midlife crisis several months ago about,

622
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:02.070
because some people that I knew about and that I've talked to had quit and,

623
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.460
and like I didn't get it.
And,

624
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.760
and there's been guys from the Marine Corps that have gone through that.

625
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:12.550
I've been like,
oh,
that's awesome.
And then they quit and you're,

626
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.400
you're thinking yourself,
how does this even happen?

627
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.820
So I'm 100% on board with the thought that no one knows who's gonna make it

628
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:26.380
through.
No one knows.
Like you can't say,
this guy's gonna make it,

629
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:29.230
he's a stud or this person's not gonna make it because they're weak.
You,

630
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.220
you literally don't know.

631
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:35.290
Now could I bat 60% maybe 70% maybe,

632
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.300
but there's no way you could make a sure thing.

633
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.700
There's not one person in the world that you could say,

634
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.690
this guy is going to make it through buds 100% there's no person in the world

635
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.760
you can say that about that.
I've,
that I know of.

636
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.630
The most humbling lesson I learned in bugs and,

637
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.050
and you're going to find this funny,

638
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:55.540
was I went through bugs with a guy named Ryan job.
Sound familiar?

639
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.520
And again,
remember I'm a,

640
00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:02.521
I'm still really fired up a marine sergeant that's just pinned on bars and,

641
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:06.730
uh,
from judging a book by its cover,

642
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:08.860
you look around and you're like,
you're not going to make it.

643
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:13.510
Everything was sloppy about them.
And I even told him no one point,
I'm like,

644
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:16.120
hey man,
you're not going to make it.
You should quit now.

645
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.330
And just to watch him in,

646
00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:23.950
the instructor's zeroed in on him and the kid had no quit.

647
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.200
And even at the end of hell week,

648
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.970
having been beat more than anyone in that class,

649
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.680
the instructor is actually pulled him aside and they said,
hey,

650
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.930
<v 2>you're good to go.
Like,</v>

651
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.730
we've thrown everything at you in the kitchen sink and you stood shrong you're

652
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:43.400
going to be a great seal.
And I've watched that and I'm like,

653
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.450
Oh man,
I,

654
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.580
who am I to judge who's going to make it and who's not?
And that was a,

655
00:41:51.581 --> 00:41:55.780
that was a life lesson.
I still remember now.
It wasn't until Ramadi that I,

656
00:41:55.781 --> 00:41:59.930
I apologize to Ryan who sort of giggle and he's like,
yeah,
I know.
He was like,

657
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:04.550
you all thought it wasn't gonna make it.
Yeah.
Like you said though,
no,
zero quit,

658
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.810
zero quit.
And doesn't matter what you do to me,
I'm going to be right here.

659
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.120
So then you get done.
You get done with buds.

660
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.580
So I came and talked to your Jaci class.
What'd I talk to you guys about?

661
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.290
You said you,
uh,
you and,
um,
your task and commander.
Okay.

662
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.930
Came and talked about the deployment is,
okay,
awesome.
But there's a,
a narrow,

663
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:26.780
it's on the second deck,
the classroom for junior officer training course,

664
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.200
which I eventually took over from,
for life.
Uh,
later on.
Uh,

665
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.780
there's a narrow passageway and,
uh,
this task unit commander,
uh,

666
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.260
for Jocko Jocko coming off as a platoon commander tour had this,
uh,
we're,

667
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:41.120
we're standing like this and they created a little lane.

668
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:46.630
And as each of us walk through Jocko with lean in and basically make you shimmy

669
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:51.840
through,
not with these guys and that right off the bat,
like,

670
00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.800
this guy isn't a hole.
I'm like,

671
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:58.580
screw this guy now you want us to listen to you and what I mean naturally,
hey,

672
00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:00.820
he's a physically intimidating dude,
but like you,

673
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.060
you really like screw that guy,
man.
I don't remember that at all.

674
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.940
I'm sorry bro.
I was really fun with new guys though.
It didn't,

675
00:43:09.941 --> 00:43:13.130
it didn't stop there and we'll get to the next and counter

676
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.130
and then he showed up and you went right to the tee.

677
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:21.150
You when you go right to team three after that I did showed up in November of

678
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:25.500
2004.
And um,

679
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.710
there was three slots open for jails immediately.
And uh,

680
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:35.120
they went to a all naval academy guys,
cause I got stuck in ops,
uh,

681
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.860
working with a great guy.
Um,

682
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.540
right on that we both know and I absolutely looked out for me and so sent me to

683
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:44.210
a free fall right away.
And then when I finished that up,
he's like,
Hey,

684
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.520
do you want to go join the boys overseas?

685
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:51.530
Cause team through was deployed at the time.
I'm like,
yeah.
So it was,
you know,

686
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.753
shortly after,
uh,

687
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.760
December found myself on a plane and arrived in Baghdad and balling.

688
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.350
I was finally in the game.
I was there.
That's half the battle and I loved it.

689
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.910
Yeah.
And then what were you doing?
Just tagging along with the boys.
So yes,

690
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.670
they give you some strange,
the job description,

691
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.030
but it just meant hang out and wait to go on all this.
So working in the,
uh,

692
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.230
the jock a naturally as an assistant operations officer,
but,
uh,

693
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.000
there was another seal team that was there.
I remember they were,
do,

694
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.350
do deployed alongside seal team three and um,
fell in with the,

695
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.770
the platoon commander,
uh,
quickly and he's like,
hey,
jump on the,

696
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.130
you're a 50

697
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.210
<v 0>cal gunner,
uh,
when we go out,
just watch us do our thing.
Uh,
you know,</v>

698
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:40.260
set up a court on,
uh,
w with the vehicles and slowly learn.

699
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.050
And so every time they would go out and I would jump in the,
the uh,

700
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:47.940
the Humvee as a 50 cal gunner and,
uh,
I was in heaven.
I was an absolute,

701
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.400
that is freaking stoked.

702
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.270
And then you came back so he could come home from that deployment and then you

703
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:56.110
get put into it.
Is that,
is it,

704
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.900
did you get a platoon the next time where you like did you get stuck being ops

705
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.340
again in that task unit?
So I get,
yeah,
I got stuck there.

706
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.480
This is like good deals for good seals.
Yeah,

707
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.650
it got stuck as to you.
Charlie,
uh,

708
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.900
opposite,
uh,
gets some.
And so again,
the other slots were full.
Uh,

709
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.510
I'd have to wait for an Ayc.
It would mean I still get to deploy.
I actually,

710
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.160
it's a double benefit when you look at it.

711
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.740
The end of the day I actually get to deployments.
Those guys,

712
00:45:22.741 --> 00:45:25.380
after they're done with their assistant platoon commander door step,

713
00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:29.520
I have to go elsewhere.
And so it actually was a blessing in disguise.

714
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:35.100
And then,
okay,
so you're in that task unit.
And interestingly,

715
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:39.000
that task unit is in the book,
extreme ownership in a very short passage.

716
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:42.600
And I was looking at it to think about what,
what we said about it,

717
00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:45.270
but there was a task unit at seal team three at the time,

718
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.130
and the task unit commander and one of the platoon commanders,

719
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.690
they didn't get along.
They had issues with each other and they couldn't,

720
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.290
they couldn't get,
they couldn't put it aside,
they just couldn't put it aside.

721
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.740
And even the commanding officer,
again,
this is in the book,

722
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.320
and the commanding officer said,
hey look,
I'll tell you what,

723
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.760
I know you two have issues because they had both come to him separately and I'm

724
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:10.410
probably screwing up the story.
But it was something like this.

725
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:12.540
They both came to him and said,
hey,
look,
I can't work with this guy.

726
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.130
And the other guy says,
I can't work with this guy.

727
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.420
And he brings them together and says,
look,
it's Friday by Monday.

728
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.690
Come in here and tell me how you two are gonna work together.
Understand?

729
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.110
And they're like,
yeah,
I got it sir.
They come in Monday and what do they say?

730
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.510
I can't work with him.
I can't work with him.
And he goes,
okay,

731
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:30.360
you guys can't work together.
Guess what?
You're fired.
And he fired both of them,

732
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.730
which was a,
which was a great move actually I,
but I think it was a good move.

733
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.031
You know,

734
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:40.500
if you've got two people that can't figure out how to work together under the

735
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:44.130
threat of being fired from your job,
that's a real problem.

736
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.920
Especially if you can't substantiate it.
I mean if you can't go in there and say,

737
00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:49.230
listen,
here's the reasons why I can't work with this guy.
It's this,

738
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:51.600
this and this.
Cause obviously they had the opportunity to do that.

739
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.880
And there are situations where you can say,
look,
I can't work with this guy.

740
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:58.860
He has a moral or he's unethical or he treats everyone horribly and I can't sit

741
00:46:58.861 --> 00:46:59.760
there and watch this happen.

742
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.450
Like there's reasonable arguments that you could make where you literally can't

743
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:04.200
work with someone.

744
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.410
But when you can't even substantiate on argument as to why you can't work with

745
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:11.550
someone and then you get told,
okay I get it and I don't hear any real reasons.

746
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.300
So Youtube go figure it out and you come back and say,
no,
it's not happening.

747
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.550
It seems to me like a good movies.
Okay.

748
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:20.970
Neither one of these guys I trust to go overseas and form relationships with

749
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:25.480
other military units in foreign military units and do their job properly.

750
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:30.480
And he fired them both you somehow they said,

751
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:31.630
okay,

752
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.210
you know what collateral damage we're going to take Sorelli and we're gonna move

753
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:36.970
them into tasking at bruiser.
That's what they did.

754
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.200
And I was stoked because I wanted more people always,
you know,

755
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:43.870
cause you get another 50 cal gunner,
you get another officer,

756
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.480
you get another shooter,
you get it,
it's another person that's a,
it's awesome.

757
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.270
And I was stoked to have you coming on board and there was,

758
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.000
there was like a little bit of,
I mean there was,

759
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:56.560
there was drama because you know,
inside,
inside bruiser was like no drama.
Like,

760
00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:59.950
we don't,
we don't play a drama.
Like we solve problems.
We keep our mouth shut.

761
00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:02.920
We do what we're supposed to do.
We,
if we got problems,
we figured them out,

762
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.750
we straighten them out and we move on and we could see all this drama unfolding

763
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.730
in that other task and it,
which is not cool.

764
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.170
I mean you don't like seeing that at a seal team.

765
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:13.000
You want the wholesale team to be kick ass.

766
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.050
And so you see a task unit that's in turmoil looks like not fun to watch.

767
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.690
Especially cause I knew,
I basically knew every player in there.

768
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:20.770
I knew every one of those guys.

769
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.960
And you watch him just fallen apart and eagles are flaring up and it's just a

770
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.060
nightmare,
man.
It was a nightmare.
Anyways,

771
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:31.720
you get basically out of that whole catastrophe outcomes.

772
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:36.721
Mike Cirelli unitasking a bruiser and best worst deal I've ever been dealt.

773
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.860
Best.
Worst deal I've ever been dealt.

774
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.600
So you check in and I remember I was thinking to myself,
okay,

775
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.470
I didn't know you.
Uh,
I've looked at your record.

776
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:48.760
I knew you were in the Marine Corps.
I like,

777
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.030
I knew that you were going to be squared away.
That was my,
that was my,

778
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.520
as much as you can predict,
you know,
I was thinking,
okay,

779
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:56.500
this guy was in the marine corps,
this guy is going to be awesome.

780
00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:00.580
You seem like you were serious and you want to do good job.
And,
and so I was,

781
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.810
my assumption was you're gonna kick ass.
However,
I had to be a little bit,

782
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.220
you know,
I had to do a little precautionary,
precautionary,

783
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.960
take some precautionary measures to make sure that you understood where I was

784
00:49:10.961 --> 00:49:12.430
coming from.
You know,

785
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.210
I wanted to make sure you knew where I was coming from while La having a little

786
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:20.650
fun with it.
Just a little,
just a smidge.
Yeah.

787
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:25.180
So that's why,
that's why we so introducing you into the task of bringing you in.

788
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:27.550
I wanted to let you know like,
Hey,
this is where I'm at.
You know,

789
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.900
we don't have any drama here.
That's why.
So that's why we did the whole,
uh,

790
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.960
the whole briefing.
So in the mechanical,
so in the mechanical room.

791
00:49:35.961 --> 00:49:40.000
So at seal team three at the time there was no ceilings in any,

792
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:43.900
they were doing this big remodel and there was no ceilings in any of the

793
00:49:43.901 --> 00:49:46.150
platoons.
Spaces are tasking and spaces.
There was all just,

794
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.700
there was a wall with no ceilings so you could hear everything that was being

795
00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:52.690
said.
And so whenever I had something legitimate,

796
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.850
like an issue to bring up with someone,
and it was almost,
it was at,
in fact,

797
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.770
it wasn't even almost always,
it was always my,

798
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.210
my jailers who was either life or Seth or one of the other gos.

799
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.610
And I'd bring them in there and I'd be like,
Hey,
here's what's going on.

800
00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:10.180
Because in the mechanical room there's a loud noise and no one can hear you.

801
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:13.180
And that's the only room that's still had a ceiling for privacy,
for privacy.

802
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:15.850
It was like the cone of silence is the cone of silence.

803
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.150
So whenever someone was doing something that I really need to tighten up,

804
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.440
someone was getting out aligned and I really needed to talk to him on,

805
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.190
on the secret level.
And by secret,
I mean I didn't want anyone gossiping

806
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.300
<v 3>about when I was about to say,</v>

807
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.050
so I'd bring him in the mechanical room and tell him what was up.

808
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:36.170
And so that's what I,
that's how I welcome to Mike into the task unit.
Go ahead.

809
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.080
Now you can get out of your perspective.

810
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.790
Have you come out of an incident where I was wrapped up in a lot of little bit

811
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:48.680
of drama and being shifted that incident though you were just sort of like in

812
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:53.300
that group or,
or were you,
you know,
show since I was close to operations officer,

813
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:56.940
which is basically the,
the,
the guy that handles the a,
the day to day affairs,

814
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.150
the troop commander,
I was naturally close to him.

815
00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.350
And if you want to step back to that task unit because it was one of the,
uh,

816
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:07.730
again,
many great leadership lessons across the course of my career,
uh,

817
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:12.830
for a new guy watching that in the seal teams,
it was,
eh,
you know,

818
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.630
I was questioning maybe this is not for me,
if this is the norm,

819
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.790
cause that this is my first experience.
So this means this is normal to me.
Um,

820
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.420
it just seemed like backstabbing Egos.
Uh,

821
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:29.870
one of the platoons they performed and they stayed out of the drama for the most

822
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:32.420
part.
But between this,
between commander and the,
and the task unit commander,

823
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:37.070
it was from day one,
it was just like watching a train derail.

824
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.280
You just sought coming in the fact that the boss laid down the rule and they

825
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:46.640
come back on Monday morning and paint him into a corner.

826
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:49.210
I don't know what they expected.
Yeah.
Yeah.

827
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.060
And they both got fired and it both affected their career.
But it was a great,

828
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.690
I actually,
I can say as a,
as a new guy,

829
00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.890
it was a great thing to see in retrospect because you learn what not to do.
Yeah.

830
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.480
Um,
but when I was told to report into,
to Jocko,
you know,

831
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.910
I'm not in the best of,
uh,
uh,

832
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.180
of spirits tour and a knock on the door to,

833
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:15.770
to task unit bruiser and say,
Hey,
Mike's Raleigh Jocko,
oh,
I'm here to report in.

834
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.950
And he said,
Roger,
come with me.
And he had a sheet of paper in his hand,

835
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.070
principal's office.
I'm like,
Whoa,
what's going on here?

836
00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.400
And so I follow him into everyone knows what the mechanical room is,

837
00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:27.360
but nobody goes in and uh,

838
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:33.350
I mean do you just want to picture like cogs turning and it's loud.

839
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:35.870
There's steam coming out and nightmare on elm street.

840
00:52:35.871 --> 00:52:38.870
That's our Fridley or did is eight word.

841
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.310
You actually told me to pop too.
And um,

842
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.310
so I popped two and you basically lay down the law of,
Hey,

843
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.510
I heard what ha what happens,

844
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:51.770
you have clean site here but do not bring drama into my task unit.

845
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.290
Here's your counseling sheet.
You've been formally counseled and uh,

846
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.360
pretty much left the room.

847
00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:01.230
And I think I sat in the room for 30 seconds to a minute and I'm just staring at

848
00:53:01.231 --> 00:53:05.160
the wall.
Like what?
Uh,
like my,

849
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.240
my career in the seal teams is going to be extremely short.

850
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.490
I'm getting it from all directions.

851
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.450
And what he did was you laid down the law and I understood there was just one

852
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:18.260
thing to do at that point and that was just performed.
It was performed.
Yeah.

853
00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:21.830
The other backstory here is,
is that the platoon that you're talking about,

854
00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:25.800
that performer,
well inside that task unit,
the platoon chief,
and because

855
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.491
<v 0>he was,</v>

856
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:30.630
he was one of my good friends from way back and because there's all this stray

857
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:32.880
voltage going around about whose fault this was.

858
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:37.120
And he came up to me and he goes,
hey,
you're getting Sorelli.
And I was like,
yeah.

859
00:53:37.121 --> 00:53:39.540
And he goes,
he's fucking good to go.
And I was like,
check.

860
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:42.120
And that's like literally all I needed to hear because when he told me that I

861
00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:46.710
knew like he's like I respect his opinion and so I actually knew you were going

862
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:51.711
to be good to go a little bit stronger than I than I gave note to now.

863
00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:57.471
He was in terms of first people you meet in the seal teams was absolutely

864
00:53:57.511 --> 00:54:02.370
welcoming to every new guy.
No hazing whatsoever.
You can perform as a new guy,

865
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.720
you're a part of this platoon,
you have a voice.
And once he found out,

866
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:10.590
cause he's a sniper found out,
uh,
I was a sniper in the Marine Corps.
He was like,

867
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.370
go,
go,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm making a call,
the army right now,
go check out a suite of guns.

868
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.140
And I was shocked and I trained up as a sniper,

869
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.870
as an officer for the entire workup.

870
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:26.430
And it was because of that one guy who welcomed me with open arms.
And you know,

871
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:31.140
despite his,
his long history in the teams,
I mean,
no ego whatsoever.

872
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.160
These humble.
Awesome.
So you've given him that paper,

873
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:37.530
the formal counseling,
that's like a,

874
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.320
isn't that something you normally do if you get in trouble,

875
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:42.620
if I'm officially scolding you or represents,

876
00:54:42.621 --> 00:54:46.890
so you just feed it to make a straight up impression like,
hey,
by the way,

877
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:51.980
I probably wrote in my entire naval career less than five.

878
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.570
I might have written three maybe.
So he didn't even do anything.
Yeah,
I know.

879
00:54:57.571 --> 00:55:02.130
I know.
I had to give one to lay off one time,
like my,
my,
uh,

880
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:07.280
I Lafe Lafe Lafe did something and the Xo was like,

881
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:12.480
you need to write him up.
And I was like,
definitely sir.

882
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.120
And so I wrote him up in the,
and I shredded it later or whatever.
You know,

883
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:19.260
it's like not,
but there's a very few times that I actually did that.

884
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.080
But again,
we're getting you late.
It was pretty late.

885
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:25.950
We were going on deployment soon and so it was like,
okay,
let's,
let's get some,

886
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.680
you've got to set the,
set the expectations out there in the front,
you know,

887
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.880
we're not playing around.
And then we go on deployment,
we're going to Ramadi.
We,

888
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.970
well,
because before we did that,

889
00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:39.840
we did assert x and all that kind of the last little bit of training.

890
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.750
And then we went on deployment to Ramadi.
No,
I did not.

891
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.660
I joined you after Ceredex.

892
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.180
I literally joined yet three weeks before we deploy hood.
God.

893
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:52.330
So I was that fresh tasking at bruiser,
no relationships,
uh,

894
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.010
with a few guys that a young new,
uh,
to buds with actually.

895
00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:59.820
So remember Mark Lee and I transferred over the same time.
Yeah,
yeah.

896
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.790
That was after SIRTEX.
Wow.

897
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.660
Are you sure mark might had been before I was asking.
Okay.
Yeah,

898
00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:09.320
I think mark was before.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause oh that's right.

899
00:56:09.321 --> 00:56:11.580
Cause the everything fell apart and sort of next for you guys.

900
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.370
But you're Ceredex was before ours.
That's right.
It was.

901
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.960
We'd come back from Panama.

902
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:19.700
That's when the proverbial shit hit the fan within that.
Tasking.

903
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:25.500
So then Jay,
we're getting ready to go to Ramadi and what?
What'd you you,

904
00:56:25.501 --> 00:56:30.100
you came,
you became,
what did you become like,
like,

905
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.610
cause I had a guy that was the,
the task unit ops.
Did I make you tasks?

906
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:37.820
You did assist in the office
constantly.
The motive.

907
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:42.490
That was the beginning.
I was who I was,
the ops,

908
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.570
but quickly became me.
Let me,
let me tell you something.
This is a,

909
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:50.140
this is a great,
a great point.
Because all that,
like basically,

910
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:53.320
you know what that is really,
it's like a test.
Like Hey,
I'm gonna write you up.

911
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:54.830
Let's see what your attitude is.
You got to use it.

912
00:56:54.831 --> 00:56:58.180
You know what his attitude was like,
Roger,
I'm no drama.
Don't worry about it.

913
00:56:58.450 --> 00:56:58.961
Then it's like,
okay,

914
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:01.930
you're going to work for this other guy that's probably lower in rank than you

915
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:04.870
that has been in the military for a year and you're going to work for him.

916
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:05.980
How do you,
how do you take that?

917
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.140
And you know what Mike's attitude was like Roger,
that I'm here to work.

918
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.680
Those things.
Like when you,
when those things happen you,

919
00:57:10.681 --> 00:57:12.850
cause people ask me this kind of question all the time,
well you know,

920
00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.040
someone else got promoted or someone that's got this and said,
what do you do?

921
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.120
Oh you work hard.
That's what,
and that's exactly what you did.
And you know,

922
00:57:19.121 --> 00:57:21.790
it took a matter of days before I was thinking,
okay,

923
00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.950
I'll give him a little bit more.
I'll give him a little bit more.

924
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:27.460
I come a little bit more.
And then very shortly thereafter it's like,
okay,

925
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:31.930
guess what?
You are ops now,
which is not like this huge,
great job,
but it's,

926
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.900
it's,
it's pretty significant.
Once we're on the ground in Ramadi,

927
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:36.070
there's a lot of responsibility there.

928
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.280
I had to count on you for a lot of stuff and because you were freaking squared

929
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:44.680
away and we're like,
okay Roger that no attitude,
nope,

930
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.710
never did you like I gave you.
And then we got overseas,

931
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:52.030
I remember I gave you the worst job,
which was I sent you to the TG,
right?

932
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:56.500
So the TG,
for those of you that don't know too much about the military,

933
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:59.560
there's a,
there's a headquarters above the task unit,
which is called,

934
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:00.521
it's the seal team,

935
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:05.500
but when you're on deployment it's called a task group and they have all kinds

936
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:08.650
of administrative stuff that they've got to handle.
And we,
we,

937
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:12.790
we had a great team with great support from our head shed,

938
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:14.590
but they needed people to work.

939
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:17.260
They need people to drive paperwork is basically what they needed.

940
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:22.650
And so they needed on officer to go over there for 30 days for 30 days and get,

941
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:30.910
you know,
work,
do all this paperwork.
And I had to submit an officer and I,

942
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.630
I sent you and there's two reasons why I did it.
Well,
number one,

943
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.720
the number one reason why I did it was because I knew that you'd get there and

944
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:40.570
figure things out and help us greased the skids for everything that we were

945
00:58:40.571 --> 00:58:42.310
doing.
Whereas if I send someone else,

946
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:44.710
they might to be able to pull that off as well and to,

947
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:46.840
cause I knew when I get you back I could do something awesome with you,

948
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:50.080
like get you in the field,
which is what I did.

949
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.450
So yeah,

950
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:56.320
if you're in those situations where you feel like your,

951
00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.120
you deserve better,
just be quiet,
suck it up,

952
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:04.060
do a good job.
And if you're,

953
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.700
the other part that people get paranoid about is they think,

954
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:11.260
well they won't notice me.
They think I should tell Jocko how awesome I am.

955
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.590
I should tell Jocko that I was in the Marine Corps.
I should tell Jocko that I,

956
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.800
I'm a sniper.
I should tell like,
hey,
I got a better idea.

957
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:22.100
How about you just be humble and just work.
And if you do that,

958
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.950
<v 2>then Jocko says,
oh hey man,
this guy is squared away.</v>

959
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:27.200
I wonder why Swiss sword away.
I look at his record,
oh,
he's in the Marine Corps.

960
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.770
Oh,
let me look at his record.
Oh,
he uses it.
He's a sniper.
Oh,
he was in recon.

961
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:34.040
Okay,
I've got a pipe fitter here.
Cool.
I can use them.

962
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:36.740
And he's humble on top of all that as opposed to,
hey,

963
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:38.000
look at me because believe me,

964
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:40.370
there's plenty of people that come in and they want to bow up and act like

965
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:44.000
they're the baddest guy on the planet.
And it's like,
yeah,
that's a real problem.

966
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.520
That's a real problem because they have a big ego.

967
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:52.270
It was to the point where I knew I burn my personal capital until it was time to

968
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:56.090
rebuild.
And even before he sent money that he's asked group,
uh,
you know,

969
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:59.960
running ops quickly came apparent that the other guy that was ahead of me just

970
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.160
wasn't gonna cut the bill.

971
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.840
But a leaf had asked me if I wanted to go out and I'm like,
yeah,
man.

972
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.070
And everything in me wanted to go out on a mission with them because these guys

973
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:12.860
are already starting to kill.
Uh,
you know,
a lot of a combatants.

974
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.860
But I had work to do in terms of ops.

975
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:18.050
That jacket would pass down and I knew if I had went out,

976
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.960
it wouldn't have gotten done and you would elect me,
made that call.

977
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.830
You would have let me go.
But I,
you know,
I passed and Lafe,
you know,

978
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:28.250
we were talking about that yesterday.
I was with [inaudible],
Texas and he's like,

979
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.400
I remember that one thing and we knew that was a sign that you were going to get

980
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:36.190
your stuff done.
And he actually made the right call and uh,

981
01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:38.390
you know,
he still brings that up.
Do they know what you were doing?

982
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.630
You were looking out for the task unit instead of looking out for yourself.

983
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.860
That's what that is.

984
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.410
You were looking out for the task and instead of looking at your,
for yourself,

985
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.470
you were taking care of what your actual job was instead of taking care of

986
01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:52.910
yourself.
And that's again,
for,
for everyone.
That's a wondering like how to act.

987
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.910
That's how you act.
You take care of the team before you take care of yourself.

988
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.240
You stay humble.
You don't think that you deserve more than you're going to get.

989
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:02.090
When you get handed a shit sandwich,
take a bite,

990
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.320
chew it and put a smile on your face and to ask for another one and make that

991
01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:07.570
one squared away too.
And that's how,

992
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.770
that's how you're going to get where you want to go,

993
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:12.980
which for you eventually met going to join Delta platoon.

994
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:18.380
Awesome.
Best experience I've ever had.
And again,
with a a,

995
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:22.880
a platoon that is humble and if there is a personification of that,

996
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.980
that is JP [inaudible] and those guys welcome me with open arms and I was taken

997
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:32.400
back by the,
uh,
by the humility.
They're,
they're just,
they're sort of,
you know,

998
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.210
the way I described all the opportunities,
they were like the little guy,

999
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.360
they were the little guy in task unit bruiser um,

1000
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.140
in the sense that they were just quiet with what they did.

1001
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:45.620
It just different personalities between Charlie and Delta and you love both

1002
01:01:45.621 --> 01:01:50.570
platoons,
but they had a very different style of leadership.
Um,

1003
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.740
and you know,

1004
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.320
I can't name any of their names cause most of them are still in active duty,

1005
01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:55.360
but um,

1006
01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:00.460
it felt like home and then being with Seth was educational given the experience

1007
01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:04.760
that they had gotten within those like two months that wasn't there two and a

1008
01:02:04.761 --> 01:02:07.610
half,
three months.
And um,
you know,

1009
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:12.500
there was a steep learning curve,
uh,
after three months combat for them.

1010
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:15.560
And I'm stepping in because I had to like speed up to the,

1011
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.340
basically the speed of war because they were already there.
They had a ton

1012
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.150
<v 0>of experience at that point.
I mean he was,
it was an insane amount of experience.</v>

1013
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.260
The,
the,
the first,

1014
01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:33.420
at one point they did 24 straight patrols into the [inaudible] and get contacted

1015
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:36.390
every single time.
And then one,
they didn't get contacted,

1016
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:39.840
they were like way up in the northeast section and they didn't get contacted.

1017
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:42.090
And then the next time they went out,
which was a day later,

1018
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.950
they were right back in it again.

1019
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:48.750
So the amount of experience that they had was just,
was,
was ridiculous.

1020
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.490
It was ridiculous.
I remember.

1021
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:54.480
So I was briefing the CG Soda and I've made that quote right there.

1022
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.710
And I was like,
these guys have been in contact on their last 23,
um,

1023
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.850
their last 23 operations.
And the,
the talk watch officer comes walking in,

1024
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:06.280
he needs,
he's like,
sir.
I was like,
yes.
And he goes,
I just want to let you know,

1025
01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:10.710
uh,
uh,
decorate doors in a,
in a tech right now.
And I was like,
Roger,
that,

1026
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:12.300
and I looked at the chronicity,
make that 24

1027
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.720
and that was a,
that was,
that was pretty awesome.
We used to,

1028
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:23.100
when those big,
big wigs would come to visit us in Ramadi,
we would,
we would,

1029
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:28.200
we would attempt to make it all nice.

1030
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:32.760
But what that looked like was so obviously

1031
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.820
wretched that like we would,
we would say,
hey,
you know,
we've,
we've got,
we'd,

1032
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:42.390
we'd lay out the,
uh,
the Mre coffee for them,
so like,
hey,

1033
01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:44.100
if you want a cup of coffee,
here's the Mre coffee.

1034
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:47.700
And we'd make it like we were doing our best to give them the best treatment,

1035
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.650
but like the treatment that you're gonna get,
just socks.

1036
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.990
Cause we're out here in the middle of the and their supply chains,

1037
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:54.400
not as good as it could be.
And Hey,
if you want,
hey,

1038
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.090
we really want you to have coffee if you have it.
So here's an Mre coffee.

1039
01:03:57.091 --> 01:04:01.320
You can mix it up here and get some.
And then when they left,

1040
01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:02.550
we cleared out the ass black closet

1041
01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.400
<v 3>via coffee machines back up.
The funny thing is,
um,</v>

1042
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.260
you talking about the task group and during my time there is a for those big

1043
01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:17.250
waves that come in and he said it was such a deviation from what soft was doing

1044
01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:20.610
in Iraq prior to that.
And you know,
I like to,
you know,

1045
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.870
use Colonel Mcfarland who you need to have on the show was going to Boswell.

1046
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.870
He's retired now,
attend general,
uh,

1047
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:32.990
former commander of the a one one a brigade combat team is that he realized we

1048
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:37.450
weren't winning.
We are not winning a to teen,

1049
01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.550
continue operations as we have been doing is the wrong call and things need to

1050
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:46.200
change.
And even at the task group,
uh,
loved the commander over us,

1051
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.980
uh,
because it was a deviation from what every other seal team had done.

1052
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.920
You could see him struggling with whether it was the right call.

1053
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:55.600
And I remember a few times he called me in,
um,

1054
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.750
to ask my opinion about what was going on,

1055
01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:59.430
but he wasn't really looking for an answer.

1056
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
He was using me just as a springboard for his own thought process until I would

1057
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.240
talk very little and he would just sorta keep on talking and it,
I mean,

1058
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.800
he had a very solid,
uh,

1059
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:16.230
sort of thought process along the lines of how he justified it and ultimately,

1060
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:21.580
you know,
looked out for you and the rest of the task units.

1061
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:25.740
<v 0>Yeah.
And they allowed us to look out for all the conventional forces that were</v>

1062
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:26.531
working with Zach,

1063
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:29.440
the the one one eight d in the first of five or six and the one,
three,

1064
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:30.071
seven and three,

1065
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:33.940
eight marines and all those guys that were on the ground with us there who we

1066
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:36.310
were able to help out as much as,
as much as possible,

1067
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.520
only because we got clearance to do those operations,
which as you said was,
uh,

1068
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:43.960
was outside the norm,
outside the norm,
day time operation,

1069
01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:45.340
staying out in the city,

1070
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.180
supporting conventional forces of which freaks some people out.

1071
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:51.250
Like why would you be supporting them?
They should be supporting you.
It's like,

1072
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.660
well now they've got whatever,

1073
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:55.690
a thousand soldiers and they're taking down a giant part of the city and we can

1074
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:59.110
help protect them.
So we are a supporting element,
but it's going to be,

1075
01:05:59.111 --> 01:06:03.550
it's going to have big impact.
So it was,
uh,
it was awesome.

1076
01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:04.384
So when you got,

1077
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:09.630
when you got out to Corregidor where the first of the five oh six,

1078
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:14.220
how awesome is first of the five.
Oh,
how awesome is first.

1079
01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.060
The Bible is the first of them,

1080
01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.210
<v 3>five oh six from the top down.</v>

1081
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:23.370
We're hardcore warriors.
Some of the strongest leadership.

1082
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:27.960
So now a major general,
a raw material.
I'm sorry,

1083
01:06:27.961 --> 01:06:32.961
Ron Clark was the battalion commander at the time to Lieutenant Colonel Dave

1084
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:37.950
Womack.
I mean,
I've never seen in my 20 years a stronger,

1085
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.250
uh,
soft conventional force relationship other than Ramani.
I mean,

1086
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:48.290
it was a textbook case of unity of effort.

1087
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.520
Nobody worked for the other,

1088
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:55.710
but they all worked in unity towards the same,
uh,
and,

1089
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:59.400
and state and it was beautiful.
And Ron Clark,
of course,
you know,

1090
01:06:59.401 --> 01:07:01.650
Seth and all the boys,
it's set that relationship up.

1091
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.950
They'd done a wonderful job and,
um,
the fact that,
you know,

1092
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:09.951
I got out there before he bestowed the first of the five oh six spade on them

1093
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.400
and he,
you know,
like I was there when he got bestowed upon us,
uh,
a just,
I mean,

1094
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.370
I need to qualify this,
you know,
getting the tried,

1095
01:07:19.371 --> 01:07:22.710
it was one of the biggest things,
one of the biggest accomplishments of my life,

1096
01:07:22.711 --> 01:07:25.170
but the,
it was just like a different sense of pride.

1097
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.180
Then almost rates up there that this badass lieutenant colonel that that had

1098
01:07:30.841 --> 01:07:34.410
been,
uh,
you know,
in the soc for so long,
uh,

1099
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:37.740
bestowed a infamous,
you know,

1100
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.600
a symbol on our shoulders and said,
hey,
you wear this and combat.
And that was,

1101
01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:45.900
I mean,
there's very few words to describe how that felt.

1102
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:51.090
<v 0>I was,
um,
like you said,
there were the relationship between the,</v>

1103
01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.870
between everyone,
between us,
between everyone at the one one.

1104
01:07:53.871 --> 01:07:55.640
And it was just freaking awesome.

1105
01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:00.930
And I don't know if we'll ever be able to capture that and describe it.
Um,

1106
01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.320
but man,
it was,

1107
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:07.970
it was awesome and what they did for us and when we did whatever we could for

1108
01:08:07.971 --> 01:08:09.440
them and what they did for us,
man,

1109
01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:12.560
was just the sacrifices that they made and the,

1110
01:08:12.561 --> 01:08:15.500
and the effort that they put forth to support what we doing.

1111
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.660
<v 3>It was,
it was,
it was awesome.
It was just awesome.</v>

1112
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.070
Talk about,
um,
just give like,
hey,

1113
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.030
this is what we were doing so people can hear from your perspective.
Like,

1114
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.890
again,
you know,
you don't need to get into tactics that,
but just,
hey,

1115
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.380
just a general,
this is what we were doing.

1116
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:40.700
We were covering and moving with the first of five or six.
That's how I put it.

1117
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:45.260
We were recovering and moving again all in the sit in pursuit of the same goal

1118
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:49.940
is when Ramadi and um,
we could have stuck with the status quo with the nightly,

1119
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:53.210
a direct action rates,
but it just had little impact compared to what the,
uh,

1120
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:55.010
the conventionals were doing and they were going to go out.

1121
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.510
So we really utilize the skill set that was unique to the seal teams and that

1122
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:03.170
was the sniper Overwatch and uh,
you know,
those positions,

1123
01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.210
their sniper positions cause we would,
again,

1124
01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:09.260
we defied sort of traditional tactics of those two to four guys that went out,

1125
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:13.330
maybe six guys in a sniper hide and we went out in force.
Yeah.

1126
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.110
Fighting positions,
fighting positions.
Because shortly after,

1127
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:21.510
the first few kills from our,
uh,
our snipers,
um,

1128
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:24.410
it quickly turned into a battle position because then they can sort of

1129
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:28.730
triangulate where you're at based off the bodies lying on the ground and they

1130
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.760
had become very good at it.
But we would move out,
uh,

1131
01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:35.750
ahead of the frontline trace of the five oh six set up a sniper,

1132
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.580
Overwatch mutually supporting sniper,
Overwatch,
uh,
to really,
uh,

1133
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:43.670
protect me.
A conventional is doing major clearances throughout them,

1134
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:47.360
the lob district,
and it was highly successful.
Yes.
Did it meet?

1135
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:50.870
We operated during the,
uh,
the days?
Sometimes it did.
Uh,

1136
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.470
most often we would infiltrate at night prior to,
uh,
you know,

1137
01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.520
use the advantage of [inaudible] to your unit set up prior to the,

1138
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:02.090
uh,
the confessionals coming in in the early morning and starting the I the

1139
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:06.890
clearance operations and then we pull out during the day or stay until night.
Um,

1140
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.150
just to,
uh,
give herself a,
you know,
mitigate risk as best possible.

1141
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.320
But you know,
you cannot argue the numbers don't lie.

1142
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.560
You cannot argue with the numbers that the [inaudible] acts.
We're going down,

1143
01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.640
enemy combatants were killed,
were,
were,

1144
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.710
were stacking up and slowly,
you know,

1145
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.230
taking one bite at a time of that elephant.
We,

1146
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:32.120
we moved further and further into central Ramadi,
which was enemy held territory,

1147
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:36.260
uh,
up until 2006 and then from the other side,

1148
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:39.770
Charlie platoon was coming in from the,
from the western side of Ramadi.

1149
01:10:39.771 --> 01:10:43.790
And it was like,
eventually we just all met men in the middle and called it good.

1150
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.223
So,

1151
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

1152
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.400
<v 3>When you got over Corregidor,</v>

1153
01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.820
I mean obviously you're working for stoner when you first show up there,

1154
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:58.140
how's that
stoners?
Great.

1155
01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:00.600
I,
stoner is a very,
uh,

1156
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:04.740
I don't know if the word eclectic is a good way to describe him.

1157
01:11:04.741 --> 01:11:08.070
So for the audience,
I mean,
Seth stone is a,
is a naval academy graduate,

1158
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.910
highly intelligent.
And you knew the guy almost had a photographic memory.

1159
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:15.360
I ended up getting his,
um,
his master's from Princeton.

1160
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.390
So clearly three of the guys intelligent.
Um,
what,

1161
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.540
what do you stand about?
Six,
two,
six,
three.
He was a,
he was a big dude.

1162
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.780
He was overly aggressive.
Um,

1163
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.590
sort of had some extra tissue above his,
uh,
his eyebrows.

1164
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.130
It sort of made him look like a,
uh,
a caveman.

1165
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:41.070
But stoner had a reputation of,
of being,

1166
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:41.730
you know,

1167
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.420
just that aggressive [inaudible] that's what was needed in that position.

1168
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.810
But he wasn't reckless.
And let me say that he was,

1169
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.760
he was very methodical and diligent.
Most of the decisions he made.
And,
um,

1170
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:58.650
you know,
for any leader that the burden of command is,
is a lonely place.

1171
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:00.740
You're tasking commander,
you know,

1172
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:05.180
even though you're close with Leif and Jocko and Seth,
you're,

1173
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.870
you're also alone and for sat out there all by himself because,
you know,

1174
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.210
um,
Andrew taken off,

1175
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:16.020
he was by himself and he really had nobody want to commence a rate.

1176
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.440
And so I think when I get out there,
you know,
he was relieved to have a,
uh,

1177
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:24.540
an officer that was a,
you know,
a little more aggressive,
um,

1178
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.270
and confided in me.

1179
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:30.480
And so I went everywhere with Seth every meeting for the first of the five oh

1180
01:12:30.481 --> 01:12:35.160
six.
Um,
I think he was in a sense,
relieved,
you know,

1181
01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:37.980
one of my strengths.
And,
and it sucks to say this was,

1182
01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:41.430
I was actually a very good planner,
very good planner.
You know,

1183
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:44.820
I took a lot of pride in the fact that it was a sniper and so I could do a lot

1184
01:12:44.821 --> 01:12:47.250
of analysis,
mission analysis,
donate,
mitigate risk.

1185
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:50.360
And then I was very good at knocking out the products,
uh,

1186
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:53.940
almost in my own demise and the,
and we'll get to that the funny story,
but,
uh,

1187
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:57.930
Seth knew he could rely on me for the little things to get that done,

1188
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.670
to clear the way for him to focus on the more strategic picture,

1189
01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:06.030
what an IA at the battle of money.
And so,
um,
you know,

1190
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:08.670
because I respected him for what he had done up to that point,

1191
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:11.850
like very much in a sense as a young seal,

1192
01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:14.520
I was trying to earn his respect as well.

1193
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.440
And I think I did that towards the end cause he knew he could rely on me.
Um,

1194
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.630
and I think quickly out in the field and I proved my worth.
Um,
well to remember,

1195
01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:28.920
I'm an officer with a sniper rifle now finally in the game as well.
Um,

1196
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.620
but we grew extremely,

1197
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.100
extremely close to the point where he started to bounce off,
you know,

1198
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:39.180
bounce a maters off me for my opinion before he weighed,

1199
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:42.990
weighed in some final decisions.
Um,

1200
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.920
and he became a brother quite frankly.
And um,
you know,

1201
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.350
when the deployment was over,
you know,

1202
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:52.520
lead the way and making sure that he was sent off out of Delta platoon and in

1203
01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:57.060
fine fashion,
you know,
we got them,
uh,
uh,
um,
forgetting the pistol.
But it was a,

1204
01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:00.110
it was a nice pistol.
It was like a $2,000 pistol.
Uh,

1205
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.500
the boys were happy to it shit,
man.

1206
01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:06.060
So we made sure that we sent Seth off with as much love as he showed the,
uh,

1207
01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:10.050
the boys in limit.
Let me finish with Seth in that regard.

1208
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.060
He loved,
loved

1209
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:16.060
<v 0>the guys.
He would hold them accountable by all means.
You know,</v>

1210
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:19.870
he was close with guys,
but he did not get in the way of him making a decision,

1211
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:25.810
a right decision,
not what was best for the gas,
but what was right for the gas.

1212
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:27.670
And he would make those hard decisions.

1213
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.730
And he didn't mind being unpopular if he did.
Yeah,
I,
oh.
Um,

1214
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.020
at some point I'll be talking a lot about him,

1215
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:44.550
not now.
So

1216
01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:51.890
now we're almost done with deployment and,

1217
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:56.480
uh,
you guys had a matter of,

1218
01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.520
I don't know what to call it in terms of number of missions left.

1219
01:15:01.521 --> 01:15:05.390
Might be zero,
might be one.
Might be too,

1220
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.720
but it was almost time for everyone to start packing up and heading home.

1221
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:19.770
And that didn't mean that the first of five or six was going home cause they

1222
01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:23.790
weren't,
didn't mean the one,
one eight d was going home because they weren't,

1223
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.200
didn't mean that they weren't gonna stop doing it operations because they

1224
01:15:26.201 --> 01:15:26.480
weren't,

1225
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.670
it didn't mean that the enemy wasn't going to stop trying to kill Americans.

1226
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.780
And so that meant that we couldn't stop doing what we had to do until the next

1227
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.750
seal team came in to relieve us and take our place.
So there was no,

1228
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.110
there was no stopping.
There was no stopping until it was time to go home.

1229
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:55.910
Um,
closest we were.
And,
and I remember consciously,
I said to myself,

1230
01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.670
I'm not gonna say,
hey this day we'll do our last mission.

1231
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.910
Cause I think that's like a call me superstitious.

1232
01:16:04.911 --> 01:16:09.260
But that to me is like a bad luck thing.
Like Hey,

1233
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:11.060
okay guys,
this is the last mission.

1234
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.020
And even in my own mind I said okay well we'll see how this one goes and if

1235
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.080
another mission comes up.
And so I never said to myself,

1236
01:16:18.081 --> 01:16:20.450
okay this day or this something we're going to stop.

1237
01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.570
And I just knew that at some point we'd have enough of the,

1238
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:27.440
of the new group over,
the new team would be here and we could say,
I could say,

1239
01:16:27.441 --> 01:16:29.600
okay,
you know what,
we're good now and we're going home.

1240
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.070
And I didn't want to make that a con.
I didn't want to make that like a set date,

1241
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.180
you know,
or set time or a set number of missions.
I just said when,

1242
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.170
when we're ready to be relieved,
we'll stop and we'll just stop and we'll,
we'll,

1243
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.650
we'll pack up.
Cause I don't want guys out in the field thinking,
Hey,

1244
01:16:45.651 --> 01:16:48.740
if I can just make it through this cause that's bad or I don't want guys in the

1245
01:16:48.741 --> 01:16:51.010
field thinking this is the last one I got to do.
And I,

1246
01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.660
I don't want that on anyone's mind,
not even mine.

1247
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:55.730
And so I even tricked myself and just said,
okay,

1248
01:16:55.731 --> 01:16:58.370
we're going to keep going until we've got enough strength from the other team,

1249
01:16:58.371 --> 01:17:01.460
then we'll just stop that when that day comes.

1250
01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:07.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:11.810
<v 3>So you kept operating in and everyone did kept operate,</v>

1252
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.360
kept going and

1253
01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:24.570
it was still,
despite the significant impact there had been on the enemy,

1254
01:17:24.571 --> 01:17:27.870
the enemy was still bringing it and they were starting to get a little bit more

1255
01:17:27.871 --> 01:17:28.704
desperate

1256
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.170
and because we had really shut down a lot of their movement.

1257
01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:39.171
So they were starting to really try and strike back significantly when they

1258
01:17:39.601 --> 01:17:40.434
could.

1259
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:41.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1260
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.310
<v 3>Uh,
so basically,
almost every time that</v>

1261
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:51.320
we went out into,
into Ramadi,
it was on at this point.

1262
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.843
So

1263
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.040
September 29th,
2006.

1264
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:00.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1265
01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.070
<v 3>You guys were doing another,</v>

1266
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:08.550
another operation in support of the first of five Oh six operation now Kentucky

1267
01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:13.810
jumper in the heart of the melodic district right by the,
uh,

1268
01:18:13.811 --> 01:18:18.300
the stadium.
Um,
we had inserted the,
uh,

1269
01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:22.570
the night before,
again in an area we had operated multiple times before.

1270
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.090
We knew it like the back of her hand.

1271
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:29.260
We had taken multiple positions in that area.
It on this specific one,

1272
01:18:29.261 --> 01:18:33.160
we had taken a very dominant building and when I say dominate in terms of high

1273
01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:33.994
device,
we,

1274
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:39.010
we had the height over any other building and we were,

1275
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.810
has diligent and methodical as we were with any other mission.

1276
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.780
Um,
and uh,

1277
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:52.830
shortly after sunrise we were engaged with the enemy first and the five oh six

1278
01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:58.390
had come into clear,
uh,
several sectors of them,
lob district and uh,

1279
01:18:58.391 --> 01:19:00.900
I think,
uh,
by noon,
um,

1280
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:05.910
myself and another seal sniper had the need for gas and um,

1281
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.550
you to add a sort of laid down and get some rest.

1282
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:17.340
Cause we'd been up for close to 24 hours and Mikey and I,
uh,

1283
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:19.210
were holding security and Mike,

1284
01:19:19.211 --> 01:19:24.211
he actually jumped on my sniper rifle to get some gun time and there was a seal

1285
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.440
to his left three feet and that was three feet to his right.

1286
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:32.170
And of course one of the things as a young guy,

1287
01:19:32.171 --> 01:19:36.490
and I realize now as I just always pushed to the edge,

1288
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:39.460
it's sometimes to take care of the guys,
you have to take care of yourself.

1289
01:19:39.461 --> 01:19:41.440
And I just didn't learn that early on.
So what,

1290
01:19:41.441 --> 01:19:45.160
I'd always try to stay awake and I try to sleep as little as possible because I

1291
01:19:45.161 --> 01:19:46.530
thought it had to be there,
you know,

1292
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:49.870
in case they needed me to make a decision when in reality they didn't need me

1293
01:19:49.871 --> 01:19:53.650
there to make a decision.
They had it and I was very replaceable.

1294
01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.491
But when you're young,

1295
01:19:54.491 --> 01:19:59.290
you don't always realize that until I was in and out of sleep,

1296
01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.630
you know,
Bobby sitting on the ground,

1297
01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:06.631
like he was sitting in a chair and Mikey and I were in conversation basically

1298
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:09.900
going home cause we knew that was more the last missions.

1299
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.710
And Mikey was excited because he was going to sniper school.

1300
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.710
I don't know if you remember that you guys had lined that up.
Um,

1301
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:20.460
he had been a machine gunner.
Um,
most of the,
uh,

1302
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:25.490
well all the deployment located right next to JP who was the appointment.

1303
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:30.330
And so that was Mikey's job was to Overwatch.

1304
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:33.720
Like Saint Michael,
Overwatch,

1305
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.900
JP in case they ran into enemy contact and they would be the first ones in.

1306
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:40.320
Mikey would lay it down in my,
he had laid it down on multiple,

1307
01:20:40.321 --> 01:20:43.200
multiple occasions before.
Um,

1308
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.200
and then the other thing we were talking about,
uh,

1309
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.540
cause he was dating a girl and we were tying,
now that me,

1310
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:53.940
he knew I was excited because my daughter at the time was two years old.
And,
uh,

1311
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.181
you know,

1312
01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:56.670
I don't think I had talked to my family much on that deployment because we were

1313
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:58.180
just so busy.
And that,

1314
01:20:58.181 --> 01:21:03.181
that's sort of my style too is once I'm deployed is it was easier for me not to

1315
01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:06.540
talk to my family cause it was actually a distraction because it,
it would,

1316
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.560
it would mess with my mind.

1317
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:12.240
So you knew the mission was to get home to your family as quickly as possible.

1318
01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:16.300
And the best way for me to do that,
I'm not saying it was the right way,
um,

1319
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.610
was to focus on what I needed to do and it had 100% of my attention cause I

1320
01:21:20.611 --> 01:21:22.350
would not,
you know,
for the life of me,

1321
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.030
I would not allow one of my guys to get killed him.

1322
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.910
But unfortunately that's out of our control.
It's born in wars,
not clean,

1323
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.690
but a mid day,
um,
you know,
contacted,
died down.

1324
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.250
There was still movement,
not there.
But,
uh,
during the conversation,

1325
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.320
um,
a,
a,

1326
01:21:44.321 --> 01:21:49.110
a grenade had come over the roof and,
um,
again,

1327
01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:49.950
I was in and out of sleep,

1328
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:54.720
but what really sort of snap me too and heart was racing right away was Mikey

1329
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:57.060
snapped up.
I remember he was in a seat.

1330
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.400
The grenade had come over the roof and he hit him in the chest

1331
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.960
and bounced on the ground right in front of them.
And now there's a,

1332
01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:07.190
there's a lot of accounts out there that are wrong.
Saw some,
uh,

1333
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:11.850
other seal speaking to a crowd about this.
You know,
that there was a,

1334
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:17.150
uh,
entrance to the rooftop,
that stairwell that would go down in the main,
uh,

1335
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.910
uh,
main,
uh,
building.
And that wasn't true.

1336
01:22:20.911 --> 01:22:25.911
We were actually like 15 meters from that stairwell at the very edge of the roof

1337
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.590
closest to the street.
When Mikey,
I say Mike,

1338
01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:34.050
you had the greatest chance of getting it away is that all he had to do was dive

1339
01:22:34.051 --> 01:22:36.590
in the other direction and he'd most likely to take a little shot.

1340
01:22:36.591 --> 01:22:38.220
And I looked at the bottom of the feet into the calves,

1341
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.180
but he would have gone home.
And,
um,

1342
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.450
the thing that amazes me is,
uh,
you know,

1343
01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:49.170
I'm not the dullest tool in the shed neuroma in the sharpest,

1344
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:54.570
but the cognitive ability to assess what just had happened and the potential

1345
01:22:54.571 --> 01:22:57.810
outcomes that if he chose self preservation,

1346
01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:01.000
which is not a wrong call,
um,

1347
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:05.530
that the seal to his left and myself would he just ate.

1348
01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:07.870
And the grenade in the face completely just done

1349
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:14.360
and the other seal to his left head,
kids as wall.
And,
um,

1350
01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:20.900
you know,
you,
you play this over in your head and trust me,
I play it every day.

1351
01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:24.440
And the first thing I think about when I wake up is this Mikey and my kids.

1352
01:23:24.441 --> 01:23:27.560
And the last thing I think about when I go to sleep,
it's Mikey and my kids.

1353
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:31.020
And the reason I say that is there's a picture of,

1354
01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.500
of Mikey on my wall and you know,

1355
01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:37.730
it's the iconic picture of Mikey with Seth and another seal in the background

1356
01:23:37.731 --> 01:23:42.170
with the yellow smoke.
And He's carrying the,
uh,
uh,
the machine gun.

1357
01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:43.530
You had,
um,

1358
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:47.900
yelled grenade.

1359
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1360
01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:55.050
<v 3>And then,
um,
yeah,
he did,
he dove down on it.</v>

1361
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:59.790
And I'm not to add humor to the situation,

1362
01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:04.290
but it's almost like that scene from a snatch where,

1363
01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.080
you know,
the guys are frozen.
It has a,

1364
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.560
as the shotgun going off and they say you sit there with a stupid look on her

1365
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:14.890
face.
I probably sat there with this stupid look on my face because one,
we,

1366
01:24:14.891 --> 01:24:16.650
you know,
we're in the heat mid day,

1367
01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.490
we'd been up 24 hours or exhausted and um,

1368
01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.340
it just happens so fast.

1369
01:24:23.341 --> 01:24:28.260
And Mikey just took action in a matter of milliseconds.

1370
01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:31.200
I mean,
he assessed the situation,

1371
01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.680
he knew the outcomes and he made the most selfless decision that anyone can ever

1372
01:24:38.551 --> 01:24:41.260
make.
There's no walking away from that.
And I know that there's,

1373
01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.370
there's some people that have walked away from jumping on a grenade,

1374
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:48.860
but those are,
those are statistical anomalies.
And,
um,

1375
01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.010
it went off and,
uh,
by him smothering it,

1376
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:57.980
it finalized the grenade blast to the sides towards,
uh,

1377
01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.390
the sealed to his left to myself.

1378
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:05.430
And we almost had mere wounds like through and through,
in,
in both legs.

1379
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:10.950
And you know,
I'd never been that close to an explosive.
We,
we,

1380
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:14.610
we are,
we work with explosives all,
all the time within the seal teams,

1381
01:25:14.611 --> 01:25:19.140
but we are very diligent about mitigating risk and the parameters that you have

1382
01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:20.970
to be so far from the,
uh,
the explosives.

1383
01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.250
The thing actually picked me up and flip me over

1384
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:30.420
and,
um,
I just,

1385
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.710
I could feel the pain you people talk about,
uh,

1386
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:38.790
if your shot or you're wounded,
like you don't feel it,
the adrenaline takes over.

1387
01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:40.680
That ain't the case.

1388
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:46.310
It was immediate hot metal burning inside my legs or through through wounds,

1389
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:52.140
just bleeding.
So at the time I didn't know if I had legs,
I couldn't even,

1390
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.370
I didn't even want to look.
So I'd put my head sort of forehead on the,
uh,

1391
01:25:57.390 --> 01:26:02.390
the dusty a rooftop and just took that big sort of bite eight the pain and I'm a

1392
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:09.200
third or fourth seal was already moving towards that direction.

1393
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:13.520
Um,
he'd been affected by the blast as well.
Didn't take any SRAP metal,

1394
01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:17.750
but it rattled all of us.
And,
uh,

1395
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:21.860
looked at Mikey,
whose head was turned towards me and I yelled,
Mikey,
Mikey.

1396
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.720
And it was just lifeless.
And,
um,

1397
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:29.721
so the,
the,

1398
01:26:29.721 --> 01:26:33.840
the next decision was the next thing that happened is we start to get lit up by

1399
01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:35.180
any enemy machine,
gun fire,

1400
01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:41.300
all chaos breaking out.
It's pure chaos,
pure,
a pure hell.

1401
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.040
The Iraqi soldiers on the roof with us,
except for one who's close to us,

1402
01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.230
but he was actually stricken and fair in the fetal position.

1403
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:50.210
They all ran off the roof and left us.

1404
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:53.270
So you've got one critically,

1405
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.590
mortally wounded to somewhat out of the fight that can't stand up.

1406
01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.470
And then the third is dealing with,
uh,
with Mikey.

1407
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:05.390
And so we were left pretty much,
you can say,
left to die by the Iraqi soldiers.

1408
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:10.910
And so I immediately went to my,
in better to,
uh,

1409
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.180
to Golfer Seth,
who was in a mutually supporting Overwatch position,

1410
01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:17.410
about 500 meters away.
And,
um,

1411
01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:22.570
the blast had knocked out my bitter until I'm calling finally.
You know,

1412
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:26.660
I pulled it in bitter route and it's just clear screen and not turn it back on,

1413
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:31.280
reset it.
But the better has to go through a loads the program.

1414
01:27:31.281 --> 01:27:33.950
And it takes a a minute,
let's say tops.

1415
01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:37.760
I didn't have a minute and so still haven't looked at my legs.

1416
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:42.110
I'm looking around and I see the Iraqi soldier,
he remember his name is Mohammed,

1417
01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:46.940
actually spoke English and uh,
he's in the field position.
I mean,

1418
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:48.290
he's just stricken by fair.

1419
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.150
And so I get up to run over to him and as I stand up to run,

1420
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:58.040
I just go right down.
We'll literally on my face,
the legs just wouldn't work.

1421
01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.180
And,
uh,
again,
sort of eat the pain,
um,

1422
01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.520
which glad to do,

1423
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:06.530
give them what my he's going through right now and what are you doing?

1424
01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.393
Did for us.

1425
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:12.700
And I crawl over there and the Iraqi soldiers used Motorolas and Seth add Iraqis

1426
01:28:14.421 --> 01:28:18.110
with him as well.
And so,
uh,
I actually,
uh,

1427
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:22.730
called out to Seth.
Seth eventually got on that Motorola.
Um,

1428
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.140
and then I said,
hey,
were were to hit bad.
Mikey's down hard.
We need you now.

1429
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:30.710
And they knew something was going on because of the,
the fires just,
you know,

1430
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:37.090
hitting our building.
Um,
but you as a commander,
you have to wait.
You know,

1431
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.790
you let,
let,
let the situation find out what your,
let your,
uh,

1432
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:43.820
your assistant platoon commander call back and give you a sit rep at what's

1433
01:28:43.821 --> 01:28:47.330
going on.
He's probably hear on the radio trying to find out.
Um,

1434
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.380
but I got back to him and probably within a minute after the whole,

1435
01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:55.250
a grenade blast had gone off and set,
set,
hold on,
we're coming.

1436
01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:01.010
And um,
so I crawled back to where Mike is at,
the four seals,

1437
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:05.660
dragged him away from the wall.
Um,
and then,
um,

1438
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:09.420
he's trying to work on and I told that guy,
I'm like,
Hey,
get on the machine gun.

1439
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.770
Cause remember Mikey carries the machine,

1440
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:15.310
got no's right there and he starts to lay down return fire.
And um,

1441
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.520
it seemed like ages before Seth got there.

1442
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.460
But finally some Iraqi soldiers would come up and they're starting to return

1443
01:29:23.461 --> 01:29:27.450
fire.
But you know,
it probably only took Seth five minutes,

1444
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:28.171
but you've got to remember,

1445
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:30.380
Seth and all those guys were set up within their position.

1446
01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.350
They weren't ready to move,
so they had to leave a lot of stuff behind the,
they,

1447
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:35.530
you know,
sometimes you're not wearing your,

1448
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:38.340
your kit because it's so hot and you're there for,

1449
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:42.330
it was what a 48 hour operation.
You just,
you're not always wearing your kid.

1450
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:44.640
So they have to throw in their kit,
probably an eight and get to us.

1451
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.710
And then when they move into the street,
what happens?

1452
01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:51.330
The enemy shifts father under fire.
And,
um,

1453
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:54.660
you know,
um,

1454
01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.970
we didn't have our morphine kits and this was a problem with sort of the process

1455
01:29:59.971 --> 01:30:01.290
of how that works.
If you remember,

1456
01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:04.650
we'd sent home the guy who was signed for him about a week earlier.

1457
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:08.190
And so I remember,
uh,
I finally had the courage to look in my legs.

1458
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:12.450
I didn't expect to see anything there.
And there was two,
two legs,

1459
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:17.970
very bloody,
uh,
ACU pants,
but they were there and that was sort of a,
uh,

1460
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:21.570
a relief in a sense.
Okay.
My legs are there,
they're just not working right now.

1461
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.390
And I went to grab from my morphine and it was gone.

1462
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.830
And so the other seal and I are are,
you know,
we're in pain but okay,

1463
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.070
no more moving on.
Um,

1464
01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:36.120
Seth eventually gets there and uh,
they start working on Mikey.

1465
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.680
They didn't know the building where in,
in,
uh,
and apparently again,

1466
01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.500
got to love the,
I think you actually activated the,
uh,

1467
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.840
the Bradleys in medicine on the backside of the building,

1468
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:48.660
a completely different street.
I don't know.
Again,
there was,

1469
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:53.490
there was some confusion about where to go and I did my best to clear that up

1470
01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.670
from what I remember,
which I don't remember very well.

1471
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.750
Well,
the two of the guys from [inaudible],
uh,

1472
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.300
element grabbed me and I led them through the stairwell down there was an

1473
01:31:06.301 --> 01:31:10.770
adjacent door to a building behind them in the backyard.

1474
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:14.210
So we went through that building to the road that was on the other side of

1475
01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:18.190
parallel road from the road we were operating on.
And it was a,

1476
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:23.290
it was a main road and they throw the other wounds,

1477
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:28.080
healing myself in there.
And then the guy who was carrying Mikey,
uh,

1478
01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:32.660
brings Mikey into the,
uh,
the Bradley fighting vehicle.
And,
um,

1479
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:37.170
we take off and that guy,
the look on his face was pure exhaustion.

1480
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:40.470
Now,
within the military,
we always,
you know,
we,
we,

1481
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:43.800
we trained at the buddy carry and we do it as part of like physical training,

1482
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:49.020
but you're also rigid when you're carrying your buddy and he's got his hand in

1483
01:31:49.021 --> 01:31:53.880
your back.
And Mikey was not a small boy,
you know,
easily,
probably to 10.

1484
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.470
He's about six,
two,
six,
three.
And this guy,
uh,

1485
01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:02.950
who carried was,
I mean he's a fiscal stud and he was exhausted.

1486
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.090
And uh,

1487
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:07.530
we talked about it years later cause he sorta put Mikey down in the Bradley v

1488
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:11.740
Vehicle and he sat down and just sorta was exhausted and sat there and I yelled

1489
01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:15.400
at him,
I'm like,
Hey,
what are you doing,
you know,
start CPR.

1490
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:19.720
And he sorts snap to and,
uh,
started CPR.
You know,
he actually came to me,

1491
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:22.840
here's the late.
Um,
and he's like,
man,
I'm really sorry about that.
I'm like,

1492
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:27.820
brother,
you don't have to apologize.
You had just carried him,
you know,

1493
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:32.340
probably a hundred meters with combat equipment on and you just,
you know,

1494
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:36.220
you weren't with,
you took a second to recover to that.
It's not your fault,

1495
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:39.430
but everyone finds fault and that day and everyone feels bad.

1496
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:43.960
Jp who should have been there,
uh,
but had cut his finger if you remember,

1497
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:49.270
wasn't there.
And um,
yeah,

1498
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.410
it was a,
you know,
you talked about the relationship with the 506.
Again,

1499
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.640
it seemed like ages from the,

1500
01:32:55.641 --> 01:33:00.641
the Bradley to get from our position in central Ramadi Mylab to uh,

1501
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:05.650
the,
uh,
curricular aid station.
And I do remember,
uh,
when I got there,

1502
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:09.490
the,
uh,
the medic gave me a little shot of morphine and uh,

1503
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.990
like three minutes go by and talk about losing your composure gave in,

1504
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:18.310
I'm in freaking pain and I,
I regret saying this,

1505
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.750
it was just like stupid things you say when things are going wrong and I grabbed

1506
01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:27.730
him by the collar.
I'm like,
I'm a navy seal and you've got to ramp that shit up.

1507
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.270
And you know,
I can tell the look of sort of frustration as I,

1508
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:35.830
he comes back and sticks me and finally like the morphine heads and the pain

1509
01:33:35.831 --> 01:33:36.664
subsided.

1510
01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.110
But what I remember vividly is one,

1511
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:44.440
they had very little capability for surgery,
in fact not at all.

1512
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.560
And they had a purpose and a two 40,

1513
01:33:47.561 --> 01:33:52.150
a 46 is we're inbound and get us and who shows up?
Dave Womack,

1514
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:55.090
Criminal Mcfarland,
I'm sorry,
Colonel Law,

1515
01:33:55.091 --> 01:33:59.920
Ron Clark and the senior leadership from the first of the Volvo six.
In fact,

1516
01:33:59.921 --> 01:34:04.120
there was probably a hundred soldiers out there and so they bring us out in the

1517
01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:07.390
stretchers were re strapped down and um,

1518
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:12.460
Dave Womack has some leaves cause remember it's still mid day and he puts them

1519
01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:15.340
on me,
Wayne on the stretcher.
And uh,

1520
01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:19.420
I flew off with those Oakleys and if you know,
the army,
they don't get good gear,

1521
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:20.710
especially in the infantry.

1522
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.280
That guy just gave me his like eye protection that if flew off with,

1523
01:34:24.281 --> 01:34:28.180
but they saw us off.
And,
um,
next thing I know,

1524
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:32.980
I am ended up in a Al out to get him a Tq Tq,
uh,

1525
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.460
for surgery.
And again,
who's waiting for me?
Um,

1526
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:41.020
rob your counterpart and,
uh,
all the boys.

1527
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.140
And so the,
uh,
you know,

1528
01:34:44.141 --> 01:34:49.141
before they rush into surgery and put us under rob was there,

1529
01:34:49.331 --> 01:34:53.470
but they thought,
and in retrospect to,
you know,

1530
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:57.980
I still struggle with this because I was almost upset it at a time and it was

1531
01:34:57.981 --> 01:35:02.981
almost like rubbing a dog's face in his own feces for taking a crap on the

1532
01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:07.790
carpet is they thought we would want to see Mikey.
And,
um,

1533
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:12.770
so they laid both of us right by Mikey,
who was declared deceased by this point.

1534
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.720
It was just almost like a point of shame,
a point of utter shame.
And,

1535
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:21.530
uh,
I just couldn't even look,
you know,
the other seals and tears.
I'm in tears,

1536
01:35:21.531 --> 01:35:23.210
but I just couldn't look.

1537
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:26.960
And I know they had nothing but the best intent,

1538
01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:32.360
but at the time it was just,
it was like,
I don't want to see this.

1539
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.600
I know what I did.
I know what happened.
Um,

1540
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:40.940
so they did that,
that give us about five minutes and then a Russ in a surgery.

1541
01:35:40.941 --> 01:35:44.150
And,
uh,
next thing I know,
I wake up and,
uh,

1542
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:48.170
Baghdad and uh,

1543
01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:53.650
go through a another procedure and then prep to get the medivac to Germany,

1544
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:58.440
um,
to,
to go through another,
a procedure.
And,
um,

1545
01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.960
the great thing is,
you know,
bout other seal and I were together the entire time.

1546
01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:07.460
They gave us to,
uh,
seals to escort us.
And um,

1547
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.840
you know,

1548
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.010
Germany were there for I think three days and just people kept visiting and

1549
01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:15.770
visiting it.
And at the time it's just,
I didn't want to talk to anyone.

1550
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:20.510
I did want to talk to you and Seth and that's what I talked to you for the first

1551
01:36:20.511 --> 01:36:24.130
time was when he got to Germany.
And um,

1552
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:31.280
it's,
cause I had,
I had my sit rep to pass and I don't know how,

1553
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:35.030
I'm sure because the other seal,
the fort seal on that rooftop state was Seth.

1554
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:37.580
He set was aware of what had happened,

1555
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:42.320
but I needed to talk to you guys to be like,
Hey,
he jumped on that thing.

1556
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.280
And in the military when somebody jumps on the grenade,
you know what that means.

1557
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:51.370
It is the most selfless act of valor that there is and it needs to be reported

1558
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:58.240
because usually if the medical records check out the,
the,

1559
01:36:58.241 --> 01:37:02.750
the due diligence is done and it shows that it is truth.
It is a metal of honor.

1560
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:08.020
And um,
I think that is where I started this citation,
uh,
to,

1561
01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:12.590
to get to you.
Um,
and then,
um,
you,

1562
01:37:12.591 --> 01:37:15.770
after the three days there,
uh,
we uh,

1563
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.010
we up back in San Diego,

1564
01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.020
<v 0>just Fyi.
The only thing you told me,
which I asked you,</v>

1565
01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.470
I was trying to ask you questions about,
hey,
men are doing okay.

1566
01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:28.620
How's the other seal that's wounded?
And you just were like,

1567
01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.300
that's all you were telling me.
It was about Mikey.

1568
01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.630
That's all you were telling me.
Morphine is a hell of a drug.
They know,

1569
01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.620
man.
It's cause you,
you wanted to make sure I knew what was going on.

1570
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:40.620
You wanted to make sure that what happened.

1571
01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:44.220
You want to make sure that I knew that you,
you didn't care about anything else,

1572
01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:47.700
that you were just like,
hey,
this is what he did.
This is what he did.

1573
01:37:47.701 --> 01:37:51.690
I'm telling you,
this is what he did.
I'm like,
I know,
man.
I got it.
I'm like,

1574
01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:55.980
are you okay?
He's like,
you're like,
don't care.
This is what he did.

1575
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.520
<v 2>He saved me.
He saved this guy.
He saved all three of us up there.</v>

1576
01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:02.100
That was the only thing you cared about.

1577
01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:07.350
And so,

1578
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.183
<v 1>okay.</v>

1579
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.350
<v 2>Then you got home and uh,</v>

1580
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:19.583
<v 1>and</v>

1581
01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:28.990
<v 2>yeah,
I remember,
you know,
people ask me about
like,</v>

1582
01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:34.110
you know,
the,
the funerals of my guys,
but I wasn't never there.
Uh,

1583
01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.780
cause I was,
you know,
we were still deployed,
but I know that this point you were,

1584
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:41.223
<v 1>mmm.</v>

1585
01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.080
<v 2>And I know that's a,</v>

1586
01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:53.500
I can't even imagine for you what that process was like.
It was shame.

1587
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.420
[inaudible] the,

1588
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:02.020
the way Mikey passed,
it's one of the most intimate ways,

1589
01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:08.080
like brothers can pass
with one another.
It's,

1590
01:39:08.081 --> 01:39:12.040
you know,
we're,
we're,
we're out there in the conduct of a fight.
A guy get shot,

1591
01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:14.110
laid down fire.
It's selfless,

1592
01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:18.460
but when somebody makes a sacrifice but jumping on a grenade that that is,

1593
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.690
that is a message of,
Hey,
this is my gift to you,

1594
01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:25.630
keep my memory alive and live well.

1595
01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:31.250
But to the guy that is saved,
all you feel is shame.
And I,

1596
01:39:31.251 --> 01:39:35.560
and I know you,
you felt the same sort of feelings is,
you know,

1597
01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:38.410
ultimately you are responsible for these guys.
Um,

1598
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:42.880
[inaudible] I think we all conducted in our career with God help me if there

1599
01:39:42.881 --> 01:39:45.610
isn't anything I could have done in the planning,

1600
01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.160
it risk mitigation and preparation for this mission or during the conduct of the

1601
01:39:51.461 --> 01:39:56.461
mission that brings my guy's home than I am wrong and that is on me.

1602
01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.420
And so to come home,
even though everyone was,

1603
01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:05.770
it was so welcoming and gracious and,
and,
and,
and caring.
It's just,

1604
01:40:05.771 --> 01:40:10.630
you feel this,
this like just blanket of shame in,

1605
01:40:10.631 --> 01:40:13.020
funny enough,
um,
when uh,

1606
01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:16.120
they had these buses waiting for us at Ah,

1607
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:19.630
some San Diego airport cause I remember they was able to some private jet that

1608
01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.600
took us from Bethesda to,
to San Diego.

1609
01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.580
And so they loaded us up on a bus and then straight to Balboa and my ex wife and

1610
01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:31.370
my daughter were,
were waiting there and um,
you know,

1611
01:40:31.371 --> 01:40:34.780
my daughters two at the time,
but she would not come to me.

1612
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Maybe they had a little sign welcome home daddy.
And uh,
you know,

1613
01:40:38.321 --> 01:40:42.580
my ex wife tried,
kept trying now because I'm still on a stretcher,
uh,
try,

1614
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.190
try to keep giving my daughter to me and she just wouldn't,

1615
01:40:45.191 --> 01:40:49.450
she was queen on in my ex would not come to me.
And it was just even that,

1616
01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:54.040
like I remember that so vividly and I think in a,
in a way,
like I held that

1617
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.940
<v 3>against my daughter for a short while.
Um,</v>

1618
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:02.170
he's like,
it was just like,
it was almost like a shunning.

1619
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:06.910
Like she knew what happened.
She was like shunning me a bottom line.

1620
01:41:06.911 --> 01:41:10.000
She was scared.
She was a two year old

1621
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.090
needs to be in with mom.
But,
uh,
just,

1622
01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.450
just being at the funeral and everything and just looking at it all,
you know,

1623
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:22.810
watching all the seals there to,
you know,
uh,

1624
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:27.840
to celebrate my life.
It just,
it felt like the eyes were on me too.
And that's a,

1625
01:41:27.841 --> 01:41:30.160
that's a selfish feeling.
Hey,
this isn't about you whatsoever.

1626
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:34.030
But it was just this like,
how can I,
how can I,
how can I let that happen?

1627
01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:35.920
And why didn't you jump on there?
Your name?

1628
01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:37.960
Like how could you not get there in time?
Very slow.

1629
01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:40.120
Could you not assess what are you stupid?

1630
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:45.340
And I still don't have a good answer for that,
you know?
Um,

1631
01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.960
but what really just,
you know,
we talked about this,

1632
01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:53.980
it's like somebody needs to hold me accountable.
That's how I found.
I'm like,

1633
01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:58.980
somebody needs to hold me accountable.
And uh,
you know,

1634
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:02.710
the boys picked me up for the funeral and of course me and the other guy pack up

1635
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:06.520
the wheelchairs,
throw him in the back of the suburban and a,
when we get to the,

1636
01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:10.770
um,
the mass prior to the,
uh,
the funeral,
uh,

1637
01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.740
ms [inaudible] swore is waiting and you know,
I'm ready to,

1638
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:20.320
to own what had happened.
And before,
you know,

1639
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:21.460
I can even get the words out.

1640
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.780
She wrapped her arms around the other seal and I and says,

1641
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:30.550
I'm so happy you are home.
Thank you for being with my son.

1642
01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:34.630
And at that point you're like,
okay,

1643
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:40.060
I have no idea what to say.
You just totally threw me off my game.

1644
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.040
Like you should be upset.

1645
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:47.280
You just lost your son and you are the banking me for being with your son and

1646
01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:51.040
you're telling me you are so happy that I'm home.

1647
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:53.550
I can talk about like,

1648
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:57.190
it felt like the ultimate mind find camp.

1649
01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:01.600
But that is just a testament of the family that Mikey came from.

1650
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:05.980
And for the audience.
Um,
Mikey was a southern California kid.
Again,

1651
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.053
pretty big kid,

1652
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:12.390
about six to probably about two 10 dry sense of humor and was a devout Catholic

1653
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.140
and the family still want,

1654
01:43:16.150 --> 01:43:18.340
I don't want you to think of this like strict religious family.

1655
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:23.341
They are family but they are resolute in their beliefs and their from southern

1656
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:25.420
California.
And um,

1657
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.740
they're the most selfless family I've ever met.

1658
01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:31.810
And when you meet them and you spend time with them,

1659
01:43:31.811 --> 01:43:33.700
you quickly realize where Mikey got it.

1660
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:38.410
And he went to every mass at Corregidor.
And when I say mass,

1661
01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:42.740
it's in a bombed out building with some military priest,
uh,

1662
01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:46.600
in about five people and one of which is Mikey,
uh,
passing out communion.

1663
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:50.910
And he had faith and uh,

1664
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:55.400
getting to know the family was actually very easy after that.

1665
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:59.390
But with time,
as time went on,
you know,
uh,

1666
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:04.450
you being to feel like you were a reminder of their son and not the best light.

1667
01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.210
And so I think over time I,
you know,

1668
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:10.840
I pulled away from the family to give them their,

1669
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:13.700
their rest cause at some point they have to put it down and move on with their

1670
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:16.220
lives.
And I don't know if that's the right call him.
Man.

1671
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.560
I still struggle with that today.
But I mean I love the family.
Uh,

1672
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:24.950
even there was a sense of guilt from my parents when they met their parents.

1673
01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:29.980
Just how good people and you feel like why their son and not ours are my,

1674
01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:34.040
my parents are thankful.
Don't get me wrong and they're extremely grateful.

1675
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.430
But there was a sense of guilt throughout our entire family that we get to move

1676
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:42.431
on in their family lives with this burden much like we do for the rest of their

1677
01:44:42.891 --> 01:44:45.480
lives.
Well,
I can tell you that,
uh,

1678
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.730
uh,
when you said

1679
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:51.630
<v 0>it's a reminder of not in a good way,</v>

1680
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:55.910
I would actually dispute that with you and I promise you that it's,

1681
01:44:56.070 --> 01:45:00.120
it's a men that they love,
they love hearing from you and talking to you and,

1682
01:45:00.190 --> 01:45:03.120
and anyone,
same,
same with mark,
same with Ryan,

1683
01:45:03.121 --> 01:45:06.240
same with same with all of our friends at a fall.
And if you can go,

1684
01:45:06.450 --> 01:45:09.960
go and tell a story that they haven't heard before or tell a story that they've

1685
01:45:09.961 --> 01:45:14.100
heard a hundred days before,
it's,
it's,
it's worth it.
It's worth it.

1686
01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:20.040
At what point did you realize that you are going to heal quick enough to go back

1687
01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:21.450
in to another platoon?

1688
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:23.161
<v 3>They actually,</v>

1689
01:45:23.161 --> 01:45:28.161
they told me to take a take a knee and they wanted to give me orders out of the

1690
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:33.150
team three and to take a easy tour and relax.

1691
01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:34.673
Um,

1692
01:45:34.770 --> 01:45:39.770
which is the strangest thing I would ever think to hear from a bunch of seals,

1693
01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.140
seal leaders.
It was actually okay.
And then you need to heal,

1694
01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.110
need to get back in the game as quickly as possible because that's what's best

1695
01:45:46.111 --> 01:45:46.944
for you.

1696
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:50.100
So talk them out of the fact that you're not sending me away from seal team

1697
01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:53.100
three.
So what did they do?
Uh,
in response to that,

1698
01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:58.360
they aligned me into another platoon that is heading to pick up for the

1699
01:45:58.361 --> 01:46:00.850
listeners.
Paycom means specific man.

1700
01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:03.600
That means we're going over to the Philippines to work with the uh,
the,

1701
01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:06.960
the Philippine seals.
And you will not be in combat.

1702
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:12.210
You are doing a host nation building.
And funny enough,

1703
01:46:12.211 --> 01:46:14.100
when they align the platoons,

1704
01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:18.750
there's these little placards with your face and I'm,
and your name.

1705
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.330
And in the master chiefs,

1706
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:24.360
that's a big magnet magnet called the weegee board.

1707
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:27.120
Cause that's how they stack up.
Who's going where.

1708
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:30.060
And so the master chief's office,

1709
01:46:30.061 --> 01:46:35.061
this is a no kidding story was open and they've got the three tasks units with

1710
01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:37.470
each of the platoons underneath them,
the two platoons.

1711
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:42.510
And all the pictures of who's in what platoon,
and I'm in this,
but two,

1712
01:46:42.511 --> 01:46:46.860
I'm going to pick them.
So what I do is take my magnet,

1713
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.170
take some junior officer that's an in a scent combo tune,
going back to Iraq,

1714
01:46:52.930 --> 01:46:57.150
put my picture there,
put his picture in the Paycom platoon,

1715
01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:01.560
literally go up to the tune space and getting most of the guys name say,
Hey,

1716
01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:05.190
so and so you've just been a resigned to this platoon.
Go recording.

1717
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:09.600
And I'm not kidding you.
That is how that happened.
And no one ever said a thing,

1718
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:13.860
either one,
they didn't,
uh,
they didn't recognize that it had happened or two,

1719
01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:16.540
they're just like,
okay,
we're not talking about at this point.

1720
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.750
And I screwed over a kid,
uh,
by sending him to pick on first.
But first platoon,

1721
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.510
I don't feel all that bad about it.
Yeah.

1722
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.210
So you knew how long it take you to heal up.

1723
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:32.620
So it was about a four months of debris.
So you know,

1724
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:36.060
I had some holes that were as deep as half a golf ball.

1725
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:40.800
And if you don't pick the scab off,
then it'll heal.

1726
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:44.850
In a concave manner.
So this little doctor,
a female doctor,

1727
01:47:44.851 --> 01:47:48.150
I had to go in every day and she would pick at the scab to keep the wound fresh

1728
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:51.900
so that it heals out,
called her doctor pain.
But did that for about four months.

1729
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:56.760
Um,
then I had to get the legs working and actually start to walk and then run.

1730
01:47:57.210 --> 01:47:58.620
Uh,
but overall four months,

1731
01:47:58.621 --> 01:48:02.700
cause remember when the team comes back from a deployment that go into a six

1732
01:48:02.701 --> 01:48:06.840
month individual training cycle so guys can go to sniper school.

1733
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:11.070
And so I had time to heal,
but,
uh,
there's still a lot of SRAP metal in my,
uh,

1734
01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:15.190
in my legs.
Uh,
we formed up with a platoon,
um,

1735
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:20.070
I'd put on some bad weight.
Um,
and then,
uh,
you know,

1736
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.560
throughout that entire two,
uh,
to your trading and trading cycle.
In fact,

1737
01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:28.380
a guy named Derrick Benson and we both know and Derek was killed on extortion.

1738
01:48:28.381 --> 01:48:32.540
17 would,
uh,
cut into my legs.
The,

1739
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:35.040
the trap mental that was pushing towards the skin,
he would remove it.

1740
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:38.260
So I had a little jar of,
of SRAP metal,
uh,

1741
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:41.040
throughout that two year period that he would even take out.
And He loved it.

1742
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:42.180
He loved the medicine side.

1743
01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:48.620
And then you roll back back to Iraq.
Yeah.

1744
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:54.500
Do you remember anything in workup and he spectacular or you're giving me that

1745
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:58.770
look,
most people that I put through work of giving that look,

1746
01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:03.990
so Aa haven't workin for Jocko.
You,
you know,
eyes we're going to be on me.

1747
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:07.490
You know,
naturally I put it on myself.
One of those,
uh,

1748
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:11.430
self inflicted pressures that he's going to expect expect me to,
uh,

1749
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:15.060
to perform at a higher level given the amount of combat experience I had had.

1750
01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.890
And you had by that point drastically changed how the west coast seal teams

1751
01:49:19.891 --> 01:49:24.630
prepare for war.
And it was,
um,
you know,
it,

1752
01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:29.460
it was good pressure.
I like pressure.
I like when somebody holds me accountable.

1753
01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:31.830
And I think echo and I were talking about this,

1754
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:36.831
you have a very uncanny way of having a conversation without saying a word and

1755
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:38.480
you sorta,
you know,

1756
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.790
the eyebrows come down lower and if you just stare and,

1757
01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:44.700
and what I've said is like,
you would,

1758
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:46.800
you would do that and look at me during the training and be like,
Hey,

1759
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:48.280
here's the standard

1760
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.980
<v 2>for everyone else.
Here's your standard.
Get it done.
Good Talk.</v>

1761
01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:58.690
And so you,
there were probably runs browse harder on myself than you were,
but,

1762
01:49:58.691 --> 01:50:01.940
um,
I do remember a mountain.
Yeah.

1763
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:06.120
Military operations are from terrain specifically in Kentucky.
Um,

1764
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:10.690
and that was some of the best training.
Uh,
we'd,
uh,
we'd gone through and again,

1765
01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:15.640
that was drastically different than the prior workup and to Romani and a for the

1766
01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:18.310
guys that had not seen combat,
um,

1767
01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:23.670
given what happened on the next deployment that that absolutely prepared us for,

1768
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:25.960
uh,
for what happened.
Yeah.

1769
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:30.820
<v 0>I mean,
coming back,
that was so ideal for me to go back and run trading.
I mean,</v>

1770
01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:33.410
there's no better job.
I could and that's,
you know,

1771
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:34.820
I was a little really lucky that I had good,

1772
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:37.660
good relationship with the admiral and he said,
look,
where do you want to go?

1773
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:38.310
And I said,

1774
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:40.660
oh I want to go run and trade out because I need to get these guys ready.

1775
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:43.840
That cause when we got back,
Ramadi wasn't done yet.

1776
01:50:44.230 --> 01:50:47.830
It ended up finishing up pretty quickly thereafter.
But I was just thinking,

1777
01:50:47.831 --> 01:50:49.870
hey everyone's going to going back and doing the same thing for another.

1778
01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.200
The average counterinsurgency lasts seven years.
This started six months ago.

1779
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:56.890
We got like many years' worth of fighting and these guys need to be ready for

1780
01:50:56.891 --> 01:51:01.891
that specific thing that I know how to do and so I need to go run that training

1781
01:51:02.471 --> 01:51:05.290
and that and that's what I did and I was definitely,

1782
01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:08.580
it's funny cause like when you're talking about like,
like I would,

1783
01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.970
there was a lot of buddy caring going on and when I was running training and the

1784
01:51:12.971 --> 01:51:17.140
reason is because I,
I,
I got the debrief,
you know,
like it's,

1785
01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:20.590
I knew it's like this is going to be,
if you get in this situation,
it's not,

1786
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:24.520
it's not what you think it is.
It's going to be hell and you,

1787
01:51:24.521 --> 01:51:26.760
how do you prepare for it?
You prepare for it,
you do as close.

1788
01:51:26.850 --> 01:51:29.680
You make this as close to combat as you can possibly make it.

1789
01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:34.060
Then that was my goal and it was freaking hard training and I,
you know,

1790
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:37.780
I had so many guys come back over the years after that when I was running

1791
01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:42.490
training that were like,
Hey,
you know,
I just got back from Afghanistan.
Thank you.

1792
01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:44.340
And the firefights,

1793
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:48.070
we're literally easier than going through a block of land warfare.

1794
01:51:48.071 --> 01:51:50.320
They would be so stoked.
And it was awesome.

1795
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:53.350
That's like the best compliments I've ever gotten in my life was having those

1796
01:51:53.351 --> 01:51:56.170
guys come back.
And,
and also I was just talking to,
as a matter of fact,

1797
01:51:56.171 --> 01:51:59.770
I was talking to the guy that told me that you are good to go the other day.

1798
01:51:59.770 --> 01:52:01.030
And he's,
he's like,
oh,

1799
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:03.570
we would have had so many blue on blues if we didn't go through that workup.

1800
01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:06.790
We were so much better.
We were so prepared.
And they had,

1801
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.900
they had a freaking hardcore,

1802
01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.110
a deployment to Afghanistan and they kicked ass and he's like,
yeah,

1803
01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:15.580
we were totally good to go because that training set us up.
And so that was,
uh,

1804
01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:18.520
that was a real honor for me to be able to get to do that.
But yeah,

1805
01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:22.720
I was a little bit,
I was also a little bit still,
like I,
I remember,

1806
01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.530
I remember,
and I've talked about this before on the podcast,

1807
01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:27.670
but like I be in mount,

1808
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.420
like it watching urban training going on and I'd see like a,

1809
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:32.920
a new guy or something like standing in the middle of the street and I would

1810
01:52:32.921 --> 01:52:35.770
literally feel like a sickness in my stomach,
like a pit.

1811
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:38.590
Like just like when I was in Ramadi,
if you'd see someone in the street,

1812
01:52:38.591 --> 01:52:41.230
you'd be like,
dude,
get off the street.
I would have that feeling.

1813
01:52:41.231 --> 01:52:43.960
And so when I'd go over and talk to them,
it would generally be like,

1814
01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:48.630
like pretty hostile.
Like,
Bro,
what the hell are you doing?
You're,

1815
01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:50.600
you're in the middle of the street.
Get out of here.

1816
01:52:50.601 --> 01:52:54.700
You're going to get freaking killed.
And so yeah.
Um,

1817
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:58.160
it was good and it was good that we put you guys through that cause you guys

1818
01:52:58.161 --> 01:53:02.110
went right back into the fire,
right back into the fire on,

1819
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:03.410
on that next appointment.

1820
01:53:03.850 --> 01:53:05.840
<v 3>And you know,
leading into that for the last month,</v>

1821
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:09.710
I had my son who I named after Mikey,

1822
01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:15.020
so his name is Michael Anthony Cirelli.

1823
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.050
It was Michael Anthony [inaudible].
He knows he's not named after me.

1824
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:21.470
So I get to see him born less than two weeks after that.

1825
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:27.400
We all end up in DC to see Mikey posthumously recognize with the metal of honor.

1826
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:34.420
And then from Washington d C I fly directly to uh,

1827
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:36.070
to the Middle East.
And then in direct,

1828
01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:41.030
I mean it literally butted up when we were deploying again.

1829
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:45.200
And so we ended up back in Al Anbar province,
Iraq.

1830
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:49.940
I ended up specifically in Ramadi,
which is completely different,

1831
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:54.530
completely pacified.
And part of you just can't even believe it.

1832
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:58.460
He's just like,
no,
no,
it's,
wait,
just wait.
It's coming.
They're going to attack.

1833
01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:03.380
And No,
it's not that way.
While at the same time we were arriving in Iraq,

1834
01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.190
the solder militia backed by Iran,
Iranian special groups,

1835
01:54:07.191 --> 01:54:08.910
they're what we call the cuts forces there.

1836
01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:12.620
Their special forces had kicked off a major or a spring offensive,

1837
01:54:12.621 --> 01:54:13.940
and this is spring of 2008.

1838
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:19.010
And so the army is getting hammered inside of a solder city.

1839
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:24.310
Soldiers are dying and they request sniper support from the US Special

1840
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.760
Operations Command specifically see just soda of uh,
AP and

1841
01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.270
that seed soda if knowing that seal team three had run that similar mission in

1842
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:42.070
support of the one one ready combat brigade,
uh,

1843
01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:46.070
the deployment Pryor said,
hey,
can you guys run this mission?

1844
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.080
So our commander at the time and master chief,
we're faced with a decision.

1845
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:53.240
We had commitments in Al Anbar province.

1846
01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:58.241
You just couldn't shut down a location and send that entire unit to solder city

1847
01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.920
that,
that wasn't going to work.

1848
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:06.290
So he had to make a decision of taking seals from all the particular outstations

1849
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:09.040
and Al Anbar and thrown them into sort of this hodgepodge unit.

1850
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:13.460
So you had seals from two different seal teams thrown together.

1851
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:17.630
And uh,
we loaded up a bunch of rgs,
I think eight,

1852
01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.840
eight and hall and a 40 bus drove out to the Baghdad international airport and

1853
01:55:24.021 --> 01:55:28.670
set up a new unit called debt defender,
a detachment,

1854
01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.340
naval special warfare to detachment of Baghdad.

1855
01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.790
And we named it defender Saint Michael,

1856
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:37.580
the archangel the defender after Mikey.

1857
01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:42.050
And we created this bad ass up patch that had the archangel on there and we all

1858
01:55:42.051 --> 01:55:43.350
knew,
um,

1859
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:48.510
in some of Mikey's boys that have gone through buds,
we're in this new unit.

1860
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:52.620
Good,
good friends of mine.
I that weren't in Iraq at that time.

1861
01:55:52.621 --> 01:55:56.570
They had deployed to,
to the Philippines.
And so,
uh,

1862
01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:58.170
we are located in Baghdad,

1863
01:55:58.171 --> 01:56:02.820
but solder cities like an hour and 15 minutes away from Baghdad international

1864
01:56:02.821 --> 01:56:07.110
airport.
And so,
you know,
they are screaming for us to get in.
And again,

1865
01:56:07.111 --> 01:56:09.540
this unit has never worked together.
Some of them have,

1866
01:56:09.541 --> 01:56:11.610
like these three guys came from this platoon.
They'd worked together,

1867
01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:15.280
but they hadn't worked with these guys in the seal teams and the,
uh,

1868
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:18.510
both the conventionals and a CG soda for screaming for us to get in there.

1869
01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.740
And so we did the best we could,
rehearsals,
uh,
the planning.

1870
01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:25.920
We had never operated in the area,
maybe some people had,

1871
01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:29.160
but there was where the very senior seals.
Um,

1872
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:33.800
and we get thrust into solder city primarily around this,

1873
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.120
this rout called rout gold.
And they were trying to,
at that point,
the,

1874
01:56:37.130 --> 01:56:42.130
the strategy was to cordon off or enclosed solder city with these large t

1875
01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:47.811
barriers so that we can control the entry points into the city and hence cut off

1876
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:52.290
supplies or enemy troops,
uh,
coming into the city.

1877
01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.080
And ultimately the strategy worked.

1878
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:59.790
But the first night in all 40 of us go in and,
um,
again,

1879
01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:04.740
remember we had this like young Intel officer who had just come from first time

1880
01:57:04.741 --> 01:57:05.200
in Iraq,

1881
01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.720
had come from Allie and bar where you're dealing with now the remnants of a,

1882
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:11.100
of a Sunni enemy.

1883
01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:16.940
And we're now operating in Shia territory and in Shia enemy completely two

1884
01:57:17.611 --> 01:57:20.890
different styles of fighting two different purposes.
Um,

1885
01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.320
one will get their Jihad on to the point where they die.

1886
01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:27.350
Others are not necessarily going to give their lives.

1887
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.560
They're going to fight and then pull back and then find another day.
And,
uh,

1888
01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.460
he didn't understand really the difference.

1889
01:57:32.461 --> 01:57:36.180
And so the Intel wasn't exactly aligning.
Again,
we hadn't been in the area.

1890
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:39.990
We go in the first night and all hell breaks loose.

1891
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:41.310
I remember Chris Kyle's with us.

1892
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:45.020
These are lead sniper and we're trying to get into a position and um,

1893
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.470
I mean we had fps,
uh,

1894
01:57:48.930 --> 01:57:52.110
detonated on our patrol for the listeners.

1895
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:55.980
An EFP is an explosive forming projectile.
Again,

1896
01:57:56.010 --> 01:58:00.810
if you remember these were Iranian made and what it is is a concave plate of

1897
01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:04.050
copper with a lot of explosive behind it.
When you detonate it,

1898
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:05.880
it turns it into a molten,

1899
01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:10.140
a projectile Bolton ricocheting bullet.
Yes.

1900
01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:14.760
And this thing could cut through Bradley,

1901
01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:19.860
an Rg and Abrams tank come right through like a hot knife through butter.

1902
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:21.820
These things were nasty and they were killing troops.

1903
01:58:22.890 --> 01:58:27.890
We had that detonated on us and then they own the rooftops and they had what we

1904
01:58:29.190 --> 01:58:30.990
were trying to do to them.

1905
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.710
And so we are just like fish in a fish bowl and they are shooting.

1906
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:39.690
Chris took one round in the helmet mount off.
Um,
and,
uh,

1907
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.990
you know,
Seth had now taking your position as the,

1908
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:48.070
and it really is the band got back together a task you to bruiser.

1909
01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:53.940
And so Seth is back with the Stryker company that insert in us doing his job at

1910
01:58:54.671 --> 01:58:56.710
deconfliction and making sure we had the support we needed.

1911
01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.970
And shortly after a week called for hot extract.
I mean,
guys,

1912
01:59:00.971 --> 01:59:03.130
we're getting low on ammo.
Uh,
the,

1913
01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:07.670
the enemy's maneuver in Rpgs p can fire,
uh,
on the rooftops,
uh,

1914
01:59:07.671 --> 01:59:12.190
down into us.
How we did not lose a guy.
I will never know.

1915
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:16.450
And what I like to say is that Mark Ryan and Mikey were looking after us or hey,

1916
01:59:16.451 --> 01:59:19.630
you got this one,
we're going to give this one idea and reset.
But,
um,

1917
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:22.440
we called Seth in and Lo and behold,

1918
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:26.550
I do remember this about sat does as the Strykers come in.
And strikers are a,

1919
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.790
it's like an armored version of a Humvee,
uh,
with,
uh,

1920
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:34.180
wheels that can carry more trips than Humvee,

1921
01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:39.910
larger and,
um,
and they have some pretty good armament and weapons systems.

1922
01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.820
And the ramp lowers,

1923
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:46.630
it's Seth runs off and starts firing into a building.

1924
01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:51.970
And of course it says down,
he's like,
let's go get on the strikers.

1925
01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:56.330
And uh,
the guy start loading up and the strikers are,

1926
01:59:56.331 --> 01:59:59.650
and getting after it to the point where they went Winchester to getting us out

1927
01:59:59.651 --> 02:00:02.870
of there in one of the striker operator says,
Hey,
give me your gun.

1928
02:00:02.871 --> 02:00:07.540
And I hand him my Sr 25 and he just starts going at it at my aunt and my last

1929
02:00:07.541 --> 02:00:11.230
naggy reloads and he's just getting after it.
Well,
tell you what,
um,

1930
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.820
humbling experience,
put us back into the same position.
Like a new guy in Ramadi.

1931
02:00:15.850 --> 02:00:20.350
Okay.
Hey,
we've got some great experience.
We got to reset.
And we said,
hey,

1932
02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:23.770
give us like 36 hours.
We need you to some serious planning.

1933
02:00:23.771 --> 02:00:26.630
We needed to do some series of rehearsals.
We did that.
Um,

1934
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:29.710
and then we inserted shortly after that.
But you know,
the funny thing,

1935
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:34.600
he was the only time,
like I really felt,
um,

1936
02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:37.023
vulnerable.

1937
02:00:37.150 --> 02:00:40.050
And I remember I called my brother before we inserted that the next time and I

1938
02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:44.740
said,
hey,
I don't think things are going to work out here.
Um,

1939
02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:48.700
let my kids know alone a and make sure,
you know,

1940
02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:51.850
my daughter grows up to be a person of character and make sure my grandma and my

1941
02:00:51.851 --> 02:00:55.900
son grows up to be a man.
And me and my brother don't talk all that much.

1942
02:00:55.901 --> 02:00:59.170
But for me to make that call was probably a bad choice.

1943
02:00:59.171 --> 02:01:02.800
And for him to hear that probably put a lot more concern on his plate.

1944
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:08.770
But we inserted and we got into position and the guy started and knock it out of

1945
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:09.604
the park.

1946
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.780
And then mission after mission they just kept eliminating got combatants,

1947
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:16.330
sig acts started to a dive.

1948
02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:21.780
We had one 72 hour operation where the guys eliminated 50 fighters and within

1949
02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.460
three weeks,
uh,

1950
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:27.880
I think I want to eliminate it and I don't want to hyperbole here or plus up

1951
02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:29.920
numbers.
I think it was like one 25 to one 50.

1952
02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:34.980
Within three weeks the guys eliminated and Sig gas went to almost zero.

1953
02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:40.100
And then there was not much to do for the rest of the deployment.
The Greeks were

1954
02:01:40.170 --> 02:01:42.890
<v 0>significant activities as enemy attacks basically.</v>

1955
02:01:42.891 --> 02:01:45.770
But what's also interesting is that at the tail end of that,

1956
02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:49.100
the shakes inside solder city came out and said,
hey look,
we're good.

1957
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:51.830
We're here to make friends now.
We're done with this.

1958
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.360
And what was really awesome was it solder city had been a complete nightmare for

1959
02:01:56.361 --> 02:02:00.710
five straight years.
I mean,
solder city was completely uncontrollable.

1960
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:05.510
And then in a six week period,
give or take that the,

1961
02:02:05.511 --> 02:02:09.840
that those operations took place.
It was like done.
It was like they,
the,

1962
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:12.470
the shakes came out and said,
Yep,
we'll,
we'll keep this under control.

1963
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:16.610
We want to make peace.
And,
and that's what happened.
That was,
that was a,

1964
02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.090
that was an unbelievable set of circumstances.

1965
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.950
<v 3>Dude,
I,
you know,
the one thing that I had to pull him out,
I remember in,
in,</v>

1966
02:02:23.850 --> 02:02:24.683
you know,

1967
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:29.150
it showed I'd earn SAS trust because of the distance between the Baghdad

1968
02:02:29.151 --> 02:02:31.460
international airport and solder city.

1969
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:35.810
The conventional unit that was supporting us when we go into solder was in

1970
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:37.850
outside of solder city.
So he's like,
Hey,

1971
02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:41.730
Mike and I th I think I spent all three weeks out.
He's like,
Hey,
um,

1972
02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:45.800
stay there planned missions.
Uh,
if you need to do a recky of the site,

1973
02:02:45.801 --> 02:02:47.780
go out with the conventionals.
And so for three weeks,

1974
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.250
like I wasn't with the boys,

1975
02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:52.130
they would move to me and then we would execute the mission.
But,
uh,
you know,

1976
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.580
learning what we had about unity of effort and putting your ego aside and

1977
02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:01.010
building a personal capital through relationships,

1978
02:03:01.011 --> 02:03:02.930
we built a great relationship with the,
uh,

1979
02:03:02.931 --> 02:03:06.370
the 10th mountain and they gave us anything we needed.
And we,

1980
02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.510
there was a lot of lessons learned from Ramadi that we,
you know,

1981
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.750
we took in that we actually stepped up in terms of the mission planning and

1982
02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:14.210
preparation with some of the assets of the Dia 10th Mountain head.

1983
02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:17.030
But I was going out with the conventionals by myself.
Uh,

1984
02:03:17.031 --> 02:03:20.000
if I needed to get to another,
a outstation or a cop,

1985
02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:23.720
they would have a convoy of Bradley's waiting for me.
Just from me,

1986
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.370
and I loved it,

1987
02:03:25.371 --> 02:03:27.800
but Seth realized I was probably getting a little off the reservation.

1988
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:32.720
At one point we conducted an admission,
uh,
we got back to that,
that larger base,

1989
02:03:32.721 --> 02:03:34.760
and he said,
hey,
go get your stuff.
And coming back.
And I'm like,

1990
02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:37.160
I actually think I barked a little with them and he's like,

1991
02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.500
go get yourself out of a bag.

1992
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.950
That was pissed because I was loving it was criminal Kurtz in it,

1993
02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:47.140
loving it.
He,
you know,
he made the right call.
So yeah,

1994
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:51.170
<v 0>yeah,
no,
you guys did an outstanding job there.
And again,
it wasn't,
obviously,</v>

1995
02:03:51.171 --> 02:03:54.650
it wasn't just you guys.
The 10th Mountain did freaking unbelievable job.
The,

1996
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.220
some of the images that were coming back at that time of those guys putting that

1997
02:03:58.221 --> 02:04:00.770
t barrier up right in the middle or right at the,

1998
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.560
what side of solder city was at the eastern side of solder city.

1999
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.380
Then you could see those guys out there putting that barrier,

2000
02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:09.440
putting those berries up.
The conventional army guys was freaking awesome,
man.

2001
02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.320
What,
what,
what awesome awesome guys.

2002
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.460
Then you come back from that deployment.
You'd think you,

2003
02:04:16.461 --> 02:04:19.100
maybe you had enough yet?
Not really.

2004
02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:24.540
<v 3>You know,
on that,
uh,
in that vein,</v>

2005
02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:28.800
I sat down with that commanding officer of team three at the time and uh,

2006
02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:33.300
you know,
I had gotten orders to an east coast team and uh,
you know,

2007
02:04:33.301 --> 02:04:37.020
he was doing my final fit rep and sending me off and read a pretty,
pretty good.

2008
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.940
And he said,
Mike,
uh,

2009
02:04:38.941 --> 02:04:42.810
the last thing I want to leave you with is at some point it becomes about
family.

2010
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:47.730
And uh,
I'm looking at them and I pause for about 10 seconds.
And I said,
Roger,

2011
02:04:47.731 --> 02:04:52.080
that sir,
but within the hamster wheel,
turning in my head was,

2012
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:54.360
are you freaking kidding me?

2013
02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:59.960
I'm going to deploy as much and as often as I can because this thing is not

2014
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:03.380
going to last forever.
And I'm going to,
to,

2015
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:05.610
to another command w w with a bunch of warriors.

2016
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:08.760
And I knew I want to get right in stride and deploy as much as possible.

2017
02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:12.570
But in retrospect,
towards the end I realized what he was trying to tell me.

2018
02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:17.100
At some point you got to pull back.
Yeah.
So it only took you another,
what,

2019
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:19.770
seven years,
years,
years.
The figure that out.

2020
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:23.910
So you get out to the east coast and now you're doing just more deployments.

2021
02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:27.860
Yeah.
Um,
first one was to,
uh,

2022
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:32.010
to Afghanistan with a great group of guys,
man,
uh,
you know,
I loved,

2023
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:35.540
love these guys,
a different feel to them.
Uh,

2024
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:39.810
but my first mission out was a probably one of the toughest missions I've ever

2025
02:05:39.811 --> 02:05:44.550
been on in terms of just like terrain because we're in cone,
our province now.

2026
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:49.400
How I would describe cone,
our province is man town,
uh,
take,
you know,

2027
02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.610
some of the worst areas of,

2028
02:05:50.611 --> 02:05:55.260
of the Colorado Rockies and then maybe multiply it by two and a,
the enemy,

2029
02:05:55.261 --> 02:05:59.610
I mean,
they were,
this was their territory.
They had prepared positions.

2030
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:03.780
It was a dangerous area and put it into perspective a little more for a,

2031
02:06:03.781 --> 02:06:05.430
for the listeners,
you know,

2032
02:06:05.490 --> 02:06:09.030
of all the metals of honor within Afghanistan,

2033
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:13.950
I think the majority,
all of them were in that cone,
our stand,

2034
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.760
uh,
area to,
to glued Dakota Myers.
Um,

2035
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:23.930
and,
uh,
on the first mission,
the eye,
he just was like a,
an eight hour hour,
um,

2036
02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:29.880
suck fest.
And,
uh,
uh,
actually you,

2037
02:06:29.881 --> 02:06:33.540
so Adam Brown was,
was killed on that operation and that was my,
uh,

2038
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:38.910
sort of a baptism to fire to that new unit.
Um,

2039
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:40.300
and I remember I looked at it,

2040
02:06:40.301 --> 02:06:44.180
good friend Jonas who's going storage and 17 and said,

2041
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:48.900
April,
are all the missions like that?
He was like,
no,
that was,

2042
02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.410
that was the toughest one I've ever been on.
I'm like,
Oh God,

2043
02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:55.820
I just want to make sure I need to get my head right.
If little sanity,

2044
02:06:56.150 --> 02:07:00.690
you're like,
oh no,
what did I get myself into?
But,
um,
it,
it was good to,
to,

2045
02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:04.800
to work with that team,
um,
and,
and get that experience.

2046
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:09.130
And then I got a lot of time with,
with the maritime side as well,
the boats.
Um,

2047
02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.400
but did a in all with them.
What was that?

2048
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:19.820
Seven more deployments,
um,
with great guys and,
you know,

2049
02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.300
lost some more brothers.
Uh,
namely,
uh,
extortion 17,

2050
02:07:24.301 --> 02:07:28.410
which was the largest loss of life in Afghanistan.
Um,
just,

2051
02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:33.540
you know,
it,
it's a travesty when we lose one soldier,

2052
02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:35.980
marine,
sailor,
airman,
but when you

2053
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.910
<v 0>lose 31,
um,
that is just,
you know,</v>

2054
02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:43.660
that that hits the military to,
to the listeners,
they may say,
well,

2055
02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:48.220
31 soldiers,
you guys can easily recover from that.

2056
02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:49.203
You can't,

2057
02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.650
it all the man hours that go into training,

2058
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:58.020
those guys,
the level proficiency they had crude over years like that is like,

2059
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:03.060
that is a catastrophic failure or a detriment to the military.

2060
02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:09.040
That is a loss of a lot of capability,
uh,
yet alone.

2061
02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.200
The pain for those 31 families,
uh,
the children,
the,

2062
02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:16.480
or not the orphans,
but the kids that are left behind,

2063
02:08:16.481 --> 02:08:21.370
the wines that are left behind and that we'll never have any solace.
Um,

2064
02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.400
other than that their loved ones were doing what they believed in for them,

2065
02:08:26.441 --> 02:08:31.330
defending them.
Um,
but overall,
I mean,
great seven years,

2066
02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:36.760
um,
and just nothing but lessons learned and leadership lessons,
uh,

2067
02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:40.990
in terms of being a troop commander.
And quite frankly,
you know,

2068
02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:45.860
my last experience,
I learned a lot,
which was not my best,
uh,

2069
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:49.240
leadership experience.
Um,
you know,

2070
02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:55.060
you look at extreme ownership and there's ways I could have handled certain

2071
02:08:55.121 --> 02:08:59.280
situations better or not.
I think I reflect on my entire military career,
uh,

2072
02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:03.490
just on man,
I could have done that better.
That's what we all do.

2073
02:09:03.491 --> 02:09:05.800
Sit back and think,
man,
we could've done that better.

2074
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:08.800
It's goes back to what I was saying earlier about like,
if,

2075
02:09:08.801 --> 02:09:12.940
you know the way than the way appears everywhere,
but when you don't know it,

2076
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:14.680
you're seeing like little,

2077
02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:19.090
like even I remember when I was young man young and I do something that was like

2078
02:09:19.091 --> 02:09:22.990
partially right,
but then I do something that wasn't,
and I think of myself,

2079
02:09:23.050 --> 02:09:26.260
if I would've known if I would have gotten some reinforcement,

2080
02:09:26.261 --> 02:09:28.390
if I would've figured it out better,
you know,

2081
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.760
like figured it out better and you just don't.

2082
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.080
And that's one of the hardest things about,

2083
02:09:32.490 --> 02:09:35.770
one of the hardest things about is not just the seal teams.
It's the military.

2084
02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:40.000
When you complete a job,
you don't get to do it anymore.
Uh,
you,
you,

2085
02:09:40.001 --> 02:09:42.940
you get done with your assistant platoon commander and you're like,
okay,

2086
02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:45.130
I got this figured out,
I'm ready to do it again.
They were like,
no,

2087
02:09:45.131 --> 02:09:47.260
now you're going to be platoon commander and then you get done with your platoon

2088
02:09:47.261 --> 02:09:49.540
commander.
You Go,
okay,
I got this figured out,
I'm ready to do it again.

2089
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:50.920
They don't know you're going to be attached to the commander.

2090
02:09:50.921 --> 02:09:53.020
And then as soon as you get,
you figure something out,

2091
02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:55.120
you're done with that job and you can't go back and do it.

2092
02:09:55.121 --> 02:09:57.060
Very seldom do you get to go back and do it.
Yes.

2093
02:09:57.070 --> 02:10:01.070
And so we all sit around and look back and,
and,

2094
02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.610
and there's another weird thing about this whole deal,

2095
02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.240
this whole deal is that it's so hard to,

2096
02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:14.860
someone's got to have a real open mind to be able to teach it to people.

2097
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:17.320
You know someone's gotta be,
wait,

2098
02:10:17.321 --> 02:10:20.160
when is someone's Gus got to have an open mind to,

2099
02:10:20.161 --> 02:10:24.070
like I would say when I was running trade at,

2100
02:10:24.430 --> 02:10:29.430
I would say like 30 or 40% of the people would be like listening and absorbing

2101
02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:34.310
and which is print,
which is pretty good.
It's actually pretty good,

2102
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:37.570
but there was like 30% of the people that you know,

2103
02:10:37.610 --> 02:10:40.340
I would try and explain something to them and it just wouldn't,

2104
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:43.610
they just wouldn't like you're putting the way in front of them,
but what?

2105
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:45.590
They don't recognize it.
They can't,
they can't see it.

2106
02:10:46.130 --> 02:10:49.820
And so it's easy now that you know the way,

2107
02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:51.460
when you look back at your own experiences,

2108
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:54.440
you go the the way appears everywhere,
but you didn't see it back.

2109
02:10:54.510 --> 02:10:57.110
I didn't see it back then.
I'm just looking at it going,
burn,

2110
02:10:57.111 --> 02:10:59.000
why didn't I one that figured that out?

2111
02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:05.240
It's one of those things and I think that's one of the things that that makes

2112
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:07.610
what I'm doing now,
what you're doing,

2113
02:11:07.611 --> 02:11:11.470
what we're doing now as a team is to be able to,

2114
02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:16.180
to try and pass these lessons on to leaders everywhere and you know,

2115
02:11:16.190 --> 02:11:19.190
leaders in the military leaders and police leaders and fire leader in business,

2116
02:11:19.191 --> 02:11:23.600
egg,
everyone to be able to say,
look,
hey,
this is it over here.

2117
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.580
I know this is hard to see,
but look at this and,

2118
02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:29.660
and it's awesome to be doing what we're doing now and say,
oh,

2119
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:34.250
and have people again,
a certain percentage of people that go,
I got it,

2120
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:35.690
I got it.
I can take that.

2121
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:39.320
And what's interesting about our business now is when people are raising their

2122
02:11:39.321 --> 02:11:42.530
hand and they're asking for it,
that means their mind is open to,

2123
02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:46.340
they're open to it,
they want it.
Whereas with,

2124
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:50.480
and this does happen occasionally when we work with companies that were getting

2125
02:11:50.481 --> 02:11:54.000
imposed on,
you know,
like the board of directors and saying,
Hey,
go fix this comp,

2126
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:55.550
this company screwed up.
You've got to go fix them.

2127
02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:58.100
Most people don't have open minds.
So they're,
they're looking,

2128
02:11:58.101 --> 02:11:58.851
when you were talking to them,

2129
02:11:58.851 --> 02:12:01.490
they were looking for reasons that what you're saying is wrong.

2130
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:04.400
If that's their goal is to say,
no,
that doesn't apply to me.

2131
02:12:04.610 --> 02:12:06.620
It doesn't apply to this market.
It doesn't.
But it's like,
no,

2132
02:12:06.621 --> 02:12:10.610
we actually worked with eight companies in your exact industry,
your competitors,

2133
02:12:10.730 --> 02:12:12.750
and they have the same problem.
This is how they fix it.
But no,

2134
02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.400
this is different for us.
Okay.
It's different for you.
It's different for you.

2135
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:19.250
Leadership is different in your specific company.

2136
02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:23.570
Leadership is different than it is everywhere else.
No,
that's actually not true.

2137
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:28.350
Not True at all.
So it's an unfortunate,
you know,

2138
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:32.840
I've been thinking about this too because you know,
I gotta,
I gotta I got a son,

2139
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.540
you know,
I've got three daughters and a son and,
and,

2140
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.830
and the fact of the matter is you don't see yourself as much in your daughters

2141
02:12:40.130 --> 02:12:44.570
as you do and your son,
right?
Your son is,
uh,
he's,
he's,
he's a boy,
a small man.

2142
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:50.720
And Man,
what I wouldn't give to be able to just like put the knowledge in there,

2143
02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:53.570
you know,
cause you see them doing stuff and you go and you could,
you know,

2144
02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:57.260
this is my own flesh and blood by the way that I say,
hey,

2145
02:12:57.710 --> 02:13:00.830
that's not a good way to handle that.
Here's a good way to handle it.

2146
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:04.070
And he looks at me like I'm an 88 right?

2147
02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:08.690
Like how would you ever know what it's like to deal with the school teacher?

2148
02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:11.180
You know what to deal with a coach,

2149
02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.310
how would you know what that's like to deal with another person?

2150
02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:17.630
You know what you're right.
I'm sure you have this year 15 now,

2151
02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:20.120
so I'm sure you've got it all figured out.

2152
02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:24.720
This is the one thing I leave kids with and I gotta tell you my,

2153
02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:29.630
my old man was probably right 95% of the time.
But did I listen though?
No,
no.

2154
02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:31.893
He's

2155
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.510
<v 3>your father to come up to me and be like,
Hey,
can you talk to my son?
He loves,</v>

2156
02:13:36.511 --> 02:13:40.980
he wants to be a seal.
What can you leave them with?
Listened to your old man.

2157
02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:45.420
He may not know what the right decision is

2158
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:49.440
<v 0>or right path is on certain things,
but he will tell you what the wrong path.</v>

2159
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:53.940
Sometimes knowing what not to do is as valuable as knowing what to do.

2160
02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:57.060
You know what else I tell when?
When fathers asked me to talk to their sons,

2161
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.580
I tell the sons,
I say,
listen,

2162
02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.600
your dad actually cares about you more than you do.

2163
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.190
He,
he wants an outcome for you,
a good outcome for you more than you do.

2164
02:14:11.191 --> 02:14:12.420
I know that doesn't seem possible,

2165
02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:16.710
but for him to come and ask me to like talk to you means that what he wants more

2166
02:14:16.711 --> 02:14:19.830
than anything in the world is for you to be in a good place in the future.

2167
02:14:20.490 --> 02:14:22.980
That's what he wants.
He doesn't want to screw you over.

2168
02:14:23.070 --> 02:14:25.380
This isn't a plot to get you to fail in life.

2169
02:14:25.530 --> 02:14:27.690
He actually wants you to win more than anything.

2170
02:14:28.050 --> 02:14:29.250
So you may want to listen to them.

2171
02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:31.230
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2172
02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:36.170
<v 0>check.
So it's at this point,
you do.
You do.</v>

2173
02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:40.890
So what are you at?
You did nine deployments overseas total.
Ten nine,
10,

2174
02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:45.870
10 deployments overseas.
And add finally,
the little voice in your head says,

2175
02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:50.490
you know what,
I need to a
look at something else.

2176
02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:54.370
<v 3>Probably.
Yeah,
probably the toughest decision.
Uh,
I had to make,
I mean,</v>

2177
02:14:54.371 --> 02:14:59.200
a lot of guys,
like a lot of guys thought you were a 30 year vet.
Easy.
He's good.

2178
02:14:59.201 --> 02:15:00.520
He's going to do 30,
probably more.

2179
02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:03.460
[inaudible] they usually say the same about me.
Um,

2180
02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:06.800
in Akron and I were talking about this age just came over me like a,
uh,

2181
02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:11.570
like a wave just crushed me.
It was just like,
Yup,
it's,
it,
it's like I'm,
I'm,

2182
02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.070
I'm tapping out in a sense.
At the end of the day,

2183
02:15:15.370 --> 02:15:18.580
you always ring the belt to the community.
They're like,
oh,

2184
02:15:18.581 --> 02:15:22.040
you're quitting quitter.
Um,
and uh,
you know,
I,

2185
02:15:22.041 --> 02:15:25.000
I'd had one last few deployment with a different group and it was awesome to

2186
02:15:25.001 --> 02:15:28.570
work with these guys.
And,
um,
you know,
there was a lot of things going on.

2187
02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.560
One I finally felt the,
uh,
the fatigue,
um,

2188
02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:35.440
and the hardest thing to do for any seals to tap out,

2189
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.920
but it's because you know that you're no longer like the best guy to push that

2190
02:15:43.331 --> 02:15:48.010
unit forward.
And I also was going through a divorce at the time and,

2191
02:15:48.011 --> 02:15:52.970
um,
things were just,
you know,
things were out of balance.
And,
uh,

2192
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:56.430
even though I wanted to take the Xo of a squadron,
um,

2193
02:15:56.590 --> 02:16:00.010
I knew I was not the best option for the guys.
And,
uh,

2194
02:16:00.070 --> 02:16:03.070
even though I could probably maintain the job,
that's not the right answer.

2195
02:16:03.490 --> 02:16:07.900
If I can not keep them uncomfortable and moving forward then,

2196
02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:10.730
then I wasn't the right guy.
And so,
you know,

2197
02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:12.610
we talk about brutal self assessments.

2198
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.600
That was the most brutal self assessment cause he,
I had to admit that

2199
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:22.990
all,
all,
you know,
however good I thought I was at what we did,
what we did,
eight,

2200
02:16:22.991 --> 02:16:27.960
just I come to a point where things were to grading it.
So,
uh,
you know,

2201
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:32.530
over overseas I called back to,
uh,
you know,
my,
my CEO at the time and I said,

2202
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:37.510
I'm done.
I'm done.
And,
uh,
they said,
okay,

2203
02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.590
we understand that that's a mature decision.
Uh,
you know,
he wanted me to stay.

2204
02:16:41.591 --> 02:16:43.270
He's like,
I want you to be my ex.
Oh Man.

2205
02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:46.570
He actually referred or referred me to the,
uh,

2206
02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:51.520
the captain from the,
uh,
the raid and the Philippines.
The ranger,

2207
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:54.340
the one that did all the planning.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm forgetting the name now,

2208
02:16:54.341 --> 02:16:59.290
but he used to call him that
and he said,
I understand what he want to do.

2209
02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:02.430
It's like,
do you want to go to,
uh,
uh,
uh,

2210
02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:06.910
Memphis in like working on a detail shop?
I said,
no.
Hey,
get me orders to,

2211
02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:11.020
to Texas.
My ex is probably moving back to Texas.
That's where she's from.

2212
02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:16.330
And I want to be close to my kids.
I need to repair that relationship.
Um,

2213
02:17:16.930 --> 02:17:19.600
in,
you've talked about it,
you know,
families come second,

2214
02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:24.490
the bottom line when you were at war,
you have so many responsibilities on Ya.

2215
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:28.610
One,
bring your guys home that the families come second.
And so that,

2216
02:17:28.611 --> 02:17:33.610
that was my new priority.
And so,
you know,
testament to the seal community,
they,

2217
02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:34.840
they made things happen.

2218
02:17:34.841 --> 02:17:39.460
They realigned things and they got me a bill it at the University of Texas naval

2219
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:44.400
ROTC.
Um,
we're one,
uh,

2220
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:48.520
Admiral William McRaven was sitting as the,
uh,
the ut chancellor.
Boom.
Yeah.

2221
02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:51.480
And then so,
so did you go to school?

2222
02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.360
So you got down there and was it to get your degree?
It,
no,

2223
02:17:55.540 --> 02:18:00.160
it was to be an ROTC instructor.
Okay.
And,
um,
they'd also prep the battlefield,

2224
02:18:00.161 --> 02:18:02.740
say,
Hey,
the guy wants to get a,
a,
a master's degree,

2225
02:18:03.450 --> 02:18:05.800
but that was the collateral just to get your degree.

2226
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:09.820
And so literally I had one late week to apply for the,
uh,

2227
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:14.530
the full time MBA program at ut.
Uh,
took the a instead of the g mat,

2228
02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:18.910
I took the,
uh,
the Ac new and I'm trying to think of the ECG act,

2229
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:21.790
um,
and um,

2230
02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:27.250
or GRE did you already thank you.
And the scores were,
we're not so hot.

2231
02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:28.450
Uh,

2232
02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:32.860
and I've made some phone calls and I got in and um,

2233
02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.570
you know,
that was a humbling experience as well to start,
you know,
we,

2234
02:18:36.571 --> 02:18:38.920
we in a sense,
I don't want to say mastered,

2235
02:18:38.921 --> 02:18:43.921
but we become very good at become being seals at the art of war,

2236
02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.020
which takes years and years to hone.

2237
02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:49.900
And even then you're never as good as you think you are,

2238
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:51.550
but you've put it and put time in,

2239
02:18:51.551 --> 02:18:55.780
you've built some level of mastery and then to step into accounting and finance

2240
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:57.820
with a bunch of 27 year olds in here,

2241
02:18:57.821 --> 02:19:01.830
the 39 year olds in the a course and you'd have this puzzled look on your face

2242
02:19:01.831 --> 02:19:04.600
cause one you've been blown up a couple of times and actually I went to some

2243
02:19:04.601 --> 02:19:05.500
training where they're like,
hey,

2244
02:19:05.501 --> 02:19:10.120
you've suffered cognitive degregation to the amount of 50%.
Why

2245
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:15.550
make that excel spreadsheet move slower than then?

2246
02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:19.960
So I was grabbing these younger kids like,
Hey,
show me how to do that man.

2247
02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:22.720
I'm no clue what you guys are talking about.
And it's like,
okay.

2248
02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:25.330
And they all love me.
They,
they knew there was something different about me.

2249
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:29.600
And I remember it came time for the,
the first task and one of the younger kids,

2250
02:19:29.601 --> 02:19:32.480
he was actually one of the owners in the class who is 26.
He's like,
sir,

2251
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:36.770
when's the last time you took a test?
I'm like 14 years ago,
so shut up.

2252
02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:41.090
But uh,
so it was a,

2253
02:19:41.091 --> 02:19:44.430
it was hard stepping back into an academic environment and people are like,
well,

2254
02:19:44.431 --> 02:19:47.610
did you been to combat this is going to be easy for you.
Hey,

2255
02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:51.620
it's like a different type of stress brother.
And like,
you know,
one,

2256
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:56.270
we all drive ourselves to do well and the first few test and not come back

2257
02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:59.840
favorable in Mike's is a call him.

2258
02:20:00.290 --> 02:20:04.430
And so I buckled down and I'm actually did quite well.
Um,

2259
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:08.900
but after the first semester,
the basics of business,

2260
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:13.330
it gave me a good grounding and I'm like,
Hey,
I think I can do something.

2261
02:20:13.350 --> 02:20:17.750
I actually think I can do something good.
A payback to the community.

2262
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:22.230
They hooked me up to be here where there's no military base.
Um,

2263
02:20:22.250 --> 02:20:25.250
I'm supposed to go back to the community and I know there's,

2264
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:27.800
there's a problem with debts getting out,
especially seals.

2265
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:31.160
They're not getting jobs commensurate with their abilities and companies should

2266
02:20:31.161 --> 02:20:35.600
be swallowing these guys up.
Leaders.
I mean,

2267
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:40.930
the one thing you can't deny is the military is the preeminent leadership

2268
02:20:41.751 --> 02:20:44.870
training platform in the nation.
No debating it.

2269
02:20:44.871 --> 02:20:46.970
And I'm not saying that the world is,
might be the world.

2270
02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:49.570
I'm not saying there's not great leaders out there that have not been in the

2271
02:20:49.571 --> 02:20:52.010
military.
Actually there,
there,
there are more than,

2272
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:53.900
than people would like to think.

2273
02:20:53.930 --> 02:20:56.360
There's a lot of great leaders and never had an military training,

2274
02:20:56.660 --> 02:20:58.940
but as a whole,
and as you said about the marine corps,

2275
02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:03.650
they tend to turn out this,
this,
this standard product,
which is a cut above.

2276
02:21:03.651 --> 02:21:07.400
And the same thing with the military general.
And so,
uh,
you know,

2277
02:21:07.410 --> 02:21:10.820
dog Nano McRaven and a great guy named who was as vice chancellor,

2278
02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:15.610
Major General Tony Cucolo and this guy has become a real big mentor to me.
Um,

2279
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:20.660
love them.
We talked about this and basically walked myself into a project,

2280
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:25.190
uh,
which we got approved by the McCombs business school 20 vets.

2281
02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:26.291
Uh,
we,

2282
02:21:26.291 --> 02:21:31.100
we did a analysis into the systemic challenges facing veterans when they get out

2283
02:21:31.101 --> 02:21:34.160
in terms of employment.
And it was a 60 page paper,

2284
02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:38.360
which was met with quite a better reception.
And then again,

2285
02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:40.670
walking myself into more work.
Everyone's like,
hey dude,

2286
02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:45.140
we think you guys have a business concept of this,
uh,
out of this paper.

2287
02:21:45.470 --> 02:21:47.000
You need to take it one step further.
We'll,

2288
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:48.920
we'll prove another project the next semester.

2289
02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:52.880
And hence something called the vetted was formed.

2290
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:57.950
And to give a quick brief on vetted,
so vetted,
uh,

2291
02:21:58.190 --> 02:22:00.740
having done all the gap analysis of current programs out there and all the

2292
02:22:00.741 --> 02:22:02.390
research we did,
uh,

2293
02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:06.980
we feel we found a solution and actually Huffington post hailed vetted as

2294
02:22:06.981 --> 02:22:11.870
revolutionizing the way that veterans exit the military.
So 80 is bar none,

2295
02:22:11.871 --> 02:22:15.350
the most comprehensive program out there and it's still building itself up.

2296
02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:20.380
So a partnership between Wharton University of Texas mccomb's MBA program and

2297
02:22:20.631 --> 02:22:24.470
the Texas a and M Mays business program.
Um,
and be a program.

2298
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:28.110
We developed something called the veteran accelerated management program.

2299
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:30.030
It's optional.

2300
02:22:30.031 --> 02:22:34.410
Five months of online education through the Wharton business foundations course,

2301
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:39.870
uh,
as a preparatory to a two month in house,
um,
uh,

2302
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:44.900
residence program that basically gives them a very strong business acumen over

2303
02:22:45.811 --> 02:22:48.690
the know within that two months,
over the course of those seven months,
um,

2304
02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:51.090
they receive more career development,

2305
02:22:51.091 --> 02:22:55.140
which is almost as important as acquiring the business skills than an MBA

2306
02:22:55.141 --> 02:22:59.290
student gets into years.
And that's how to interview how you're,
you know,
uh,

2307
02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:04.230
refine your resume,
optimize your resume and linkedin a mock interviews.
Um,

2308
02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:08.370
but they,
they hit all the basic verticals of business,

2309
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:10.830
even entrepreneurs that they have a business idea.
They came in,

2310
02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:14.460
they have a executable business plan on the back end.

2311
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:18.210
And for those that want to go into industry,
actually every Thursday,
Friday,

2312
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:22.980
they're working on a industry capstone embedded in a company.

2313
02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:25.470
So during that eight weeks,
every Thursday,

2314
02:23:25.471 --> 02:23:27.750
Friday working the project inside a company,

2315
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:33.110
which means industry experience that can go on their resume and then two

2316
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:36.990
organizations offer their placement services free charge.
At the end.

2317
02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:38.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2318
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:41.920
<v 3>Actual on front,
Overwatch and Bradley Morris ink,</v>

2319
02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:45.610
which the two hat could be strategic partners,
which I'm sure we'll get into,

2320
02:23:45.611 --> 02:23:49.630
but I'm of the first pilot program at the University of Texas.

2321
02:23:49.631 --> 02:23:54.631
Mckell homes of the 25 veterans all are placed except for one.

2322
02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:56.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2323
02:23:56.540 --> 02:24:00.650
<v 0>Yeah.
So that,
so you just kind of start talking about,</v>

2324
02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:04.450
the next thing obviously we need to talk about is,
you know,

2325
02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:05.960
at some point while you were doing this,

2326
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:10.400
and here Lafe and I were with echelon front and we work with companies all the

2327
02:24:10.401 --> 02:24:14.330
time.
And every company we work with,
guess what they need.
They need people,

2328
02:24:14.331 --> 02:24:17.240
they need good people.
They need,
they need leaders.
That's what they need.

2329
02:24:17.570 --> 02:24:21.170
And you know,
as you and I discussed this and talked about it,

2330
02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.480
and I don't know if,
I don't know who made the connection mentally.

2331
02:24:26.650 --> 02:24:30.050
Uh,
I think it was you who made the connection mentally.
You're like,
oh wait,
you,

2332
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:34.010
you need people and we're making people,
let's figure that out.

2333
02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:39.340
And that's sort of where we got into this idea of echelon front,

2334
02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:40.460
Overwatch.

2335
02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:41.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2336
02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:45.990
<v 0>We did,
it was,
it was combining chocolate peanut butter,
Reese's pieces.</v>

2337
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:51.060
It was magical.
It was hatching moment.

2338
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:54.990
Sorry.
Wait.
Um,
so you know,

2339
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:57.270
there was a lot of lessons learned from Betty [inaudible] and you know,

2340
02:24:57.271 --> 02:25:00.820
when I started that there was a lot of uh,
mentors of mine,
Mine,

2341
02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.830
<v 3>very successful business matters that are like,
dude,</v>

2342
02:25:02.831 --> 02:25:05.440
you need to capitalize this thing.
And at the time I couldn't see it.

2343
02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:08.110
Like my ultra ultra wisdom sort of drove like,
no,

2344
02:25:08.111 --> 02:25:10.280
it needs to be nonprofit where you're not going to charge people for this.

2345
02:25:10.281 --> 02:25:14.680
And now I recognize that in a capitalistic market you can do more good on the

2346
02:25:14.681 --> 02:25:16.420
for profit side and you came to nonprofit side,

2347
02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:20.440
we live in a free society,
free enterprise.

2348
02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:23.920
And I remember sitting down in,
in Austin,
you guys,
I'm like,
Hey,

2349
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.800
I remember you telling me that every company you talk to is like,

2350
02:25:26.801 --> 02:25:30.220
we're going to get like five of you.
And that just wasn't your game at the time.

2351
02:25:30.250 --> 02:25:34.330
Yeah.
But at the end of the day,
you know,
talent is all about leadership.

2352
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:38.740
Becoming a talent magnet or having a talent mindset within your organization is

2353
02:25:38.741 --> 02:25:43.690
about leadership.
And so,
you know,
knowing our communities,

2354
02:25:43.691 --> 02:25:46.840
the special operations community in combat aviators,
Dave Burke,

2355
02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:51.500
you are our resident fighter pilot,
the bad ass.
Good deal Dave.
We,

2356
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:56.490
we knew we could start something.
And so we created echelon front,
Overwatch,

2357
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.590
what we call e f Overwatch,
Overwatch being the term that the mission,

2358
02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:03.550
we ran it in Ramadi and I think like it has a little appeal in the sense that

2359
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:07.810
now we're over watching our brothers green berets,
Navy Seals,
air force,

2360
02:26:07.811 --> 02:26:12.610
PJ's CCTS,
Marsac guys getting out and the direct support com,
uh,
personnel,

2361
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:16.420
um,
we're over watching them and help them with their transition.

2362
02:26:16.421 --> 02:26:18.850
We're over watching the companies that are in a war for talent.

2363
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:20.290
And that's the thing that people don't understand.

2364
02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:25.090
Even the seals are always hunting for the best talent.
Somebody asked me,

2365
02:26:25.091 --> 02:26:29.780
you know,
funny enough with the most important job in the seal teams is,
and they,

2366
02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:32.590
they thought it was going to say a troop commander on the front lines of that.

2367
02:26:32.591 --> 02:26:34.900
That is important.
At the end of the day,
that's what we do.
But I said,
no,

2368
02:26:34.901 --> 02:26:38.890
it's actually been about butts and trucker.
That is like being a hiring manager.

2369
02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:41.170
You are the filter of the talent coming through,

2370
02:26:41.171 --> 02:26:44.550
which ultimately will end up in that troop commander in that that uh,

2371
02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:47.580
troop chiefs,
uh,
hands and there has to be a standard.

2372
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:50.560
We need to put some of our best guys at Bud's to make sure that only the best

2373
02:26:50.561 --> 02:26:53.350
are passing through.
We'll do the same thing applies to business.

2374
02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:56.110
You are constantly in this war for talent

2375
02:26:57.610 --> 02:27:01.570
and we couldn't think of a better talent pool than combat aviators,
Cobra pilots,

2376
02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:03.280
fighter pilots.
Again,

2377
02:27:03.310 --> 02:27:06.380
all this special operations guys and the direct support personnel that come out

2378
02:27:06.381 --> 02:27:11.260
of Socom that have the soft skills,
the leadership skills that you want,

2379
02:27:12.430 --> 02:27:13.540
they may lack the hard skills.

2380
02:27:13.541 --> 02:27:16.240
You look at their resume and it may not scream right fit.

2381
02:27:16.810 --> 02:27:19.750
But once you get these guys in the interview and you see that one,
they,

2382
02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:22.210
their leaders that they're humble,

2383
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:26.800
that they're willing to roll their sleeves up and get after it and actually

2384
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:30.160
listen and learn.
That is the perfect employee.

2385
02:27:30.750 --> 02:27:32.860
If you can get more of these guys into your business,

2386
02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:37.600
I guarantee you you will create your own army that will dominate your

2387
02:27:37.601 --> 02:27:41.190
battlefield in whatever industry that you're in.
It's,

2388
02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:45.040
it's awesome because people,
every,

2389
02:27:45.041 --> 02:27:48.700
every single time I go up to Auckland company,
they'll,
they'll say,
man,

2390
02:27:48.701 --> 02:27:50.690
it seems like you just,
it seems like you know,

2391
02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:54.220
hey did you do a bunch of research to figure out did you have you been working

2392
02:27:54.221 --> 02:27:56.800
with us?
And we didn't know about it.
And I'd be like,
no.

2393
02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:58.750
Well how do you know what problems we have?
It's like,

2394
02:27:58.751 --> 02:28:01.780
oh cause you're a company cause you're a group of individuals or group of human

2395
02:28:01.781 --> 02:28:03.430
beings are trying to make something happen.
And guess what?

2396
02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:06.940
There's dynamics there that happened with all different organizations that to

2397
02:28:06.941 --> 02:28:08.260
get together and guess what?

2398
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:11.180
If you take these leaders because they're amazed that I can understand that

2399
02:28:11.181 --> 02:28:13.750
their business,
it's like,
no,
I don't understand your business.

2400
02:28:13.930 --> 02:28:16.570
I understand leadership.
That's what,
that's what echelon front.

2401
02:28:16.571 --> 02:28:19.480
We understand leadership so we can go in and look at what's going on and say,
Oh,

2402
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:22.010
you've got to have a leadership problem here and here's how we fix it.

2403
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:25.040
<v 0>And so to take that and say,
you know what,</v>

2404
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.050
we can actually give you people that understand leadership and they can help you

2405
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:33.710
solve these problems.
That is like you said,

2406
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:37.670
a Reese's peanut butter cup,
peanut butter and chocolate.

2407
02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.800
That's what it is.
So it's been on.
Speaking of bringing on talent,

2408
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:45.930
like when this whole thing was going down,
I'm like,
oh,

2409
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:49.880
how far we get a little Mike Cirelli I'd echelon front because guess what?

2410
02:28:49.970 --> 02:28:54.150
That's what we did.
Bring,
bring the band back together.
And you know,

2411
02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:56.450
that's why that's just been,
it's been awesome.

2412
02:28:56.451 --> 02:29:01.250
And if anyone that's coming to the monster,
um,
you know,
Mike's Mike's putting,

2413
02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:03.110
putting on a,
a great,
uh,

2414
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:07.120
talk about leadership inside the monster freaking everyone loved it.
Uh,

2415
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:10.030
I myself included and yeah,
going out,

2416
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:15.070
working with companies again now we just have someone else on the team that can

2417
02:29:15.321 --> 02:29:18.950
get out there that understands leadership,
that sees solutions we're bringing,

2418
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:21.110
we've been bringing you out on a bunch of stuff now.

2419
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:24.530
So you see other companies and you see you're starting to take even what you

2420
02:29:24.531 --> 02:29:27.890
learned in school.
Put that on top of the practical applications that we see now.

2421
02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:33.110
You know the way,
so you see it everywhere you look.
So that's a,
that's a,

2422
02:29:33.111 --> 02:29:37.850
that's another benefit.
So that's where you're at now talking about getting out.

2423
02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:38.460
I mean,

2424
02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:41.190
you talk about what gets you out of the bed in the morning and every company,

2425
02:29:41.191 --> 02:29:45.650
he was like,
do you love what you do?
I'm like,
the fact that Jocko Leif,
myself,
JP,

2426
02:29:45.651 --> 02:29:49.850
Dave Flynn on a phone call talking about leadership,
I'm like,

2427
02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.860
there's nothing against the side of the bed.
More than that.

2428
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:53.630
Like we actually like,

2429
02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:57.220
we love to solve these problems because we've seen them before.
And you know,

2430
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:58.790
people,
people often say,

2431
02:29:58.950 --> 02:30:03.710
well how did the seals like synonymous with business?
I'm like,
you just said it.

2432
02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:05.450
You are a unit,
you're a company,

2433
02:30:05.451 --> 02:30:10.430
you're dealing with people and deal with the same issues and it has been great.

2434
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.360
I mean,
how long have I been on now?
Three months.
Yeah.
Something like that.

2435
02:30:13.361 --> 02:30:14.630
Just love it.
And you know,

2436
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:19.690
my fiance sees a different person because for the listeners I took a high level

2437
02:30:20.061 --> 02:30:21.050
job in higher education,

2438
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:25.280
executive director of veteran services for the Texas a and m system.
And it just,

2439
02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:27.110
you know,
even though the work was rewarding,

2440
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.440
it just wasn't the same as being part of national on front end.

2441
02:30:30.441 --> 02:30:33.770
Like Jordan has seen.
She's like,
you're,
you're actually like,

2442
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:38.480
how did it get out of bed in the morning?
Now I'm like,
yeah,
I'm with the boys.

2443
02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:41.540
Yeah,
that makes a big difference.
And like you said,

2444
02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:45.780
you can't even shut us up.
Like we will have a,
like a,

2445
02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:48.530
we got this thing called the tank where we'll get together and talk about like a

2446
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:48.800
leader,

2447
02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:53.800
like a for working with three companies and there'll be leadership issues at

2448
02:30:53.811 --> 02:30:54.650
each one of the companies.

2449
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:59.950
And so we'll talk about the leadership issue and then how that problem should be

2450
02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:03.560
approached.
And these calls that are scheduled for an hour,

2451
02:31:03.561 --> 02:31:04.940
we'll end up on the phone for,
you know,

2452
02:31:04.941 --> 02:31:06.710
two and a half hours or we'll end up in the,

2453
02:31:06.711 --> 02:31:09.440
in the tank for three hours sitting there going by.

2454
02:31:09.441 --> 02:31:11.090
And because we're learning from it,

2455
02:31:11.091 --> 02:31:14.690
we're also learning how we can apply what we're talking about.
It's just,

2456
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:18.110
it's just,
it's just an awesome,
it's awesome to be part of the organization and,

2457
02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:20.070
and like you said,
to be with people that

2458
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:24.570
<v 3>are just into it,
into it.
And you know,
the funny thing is having gotten my MBA,</v>

2459
02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:25.830
um,

2460
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:30.480
the one thing that is not addressed in any MBA program is leadership and they

2461
02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:34.890
know it.
And right now you're seeing a lot of MBA programs set up,
uh,
or stand up,

2462
02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:39.730
uh,
centers of leadership within their,
their,
their MBA programs.
And,
um,

2463
02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:42.780
you know,
I've had some great discussions.
I mean,
great professors there.
And so,

2464
02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:43.040
I mean,

2465
02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:46.230
strong leaders because they were private sector leaders before they came back

2466
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:48.810
and spoke.
But I mean,
you can,

2467
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:52.530
and they turn out highly successful business practitioners,

2468
02:31:52.531 --> 02:31:56.550
but at the end of the day,
like it's not a a recipe for,

2469
02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:58.230
for leadership training whatsoever.

2470
02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:00.080
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
that's,
it's,
it's been awesome.
That's,</v>

2471
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:03.040
that's why the business has gone so great because there's no one that's offered

2472
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:06.150
what we're doing.
There's,
there's,
there's people say,
well,
who's your competition?

2473
02:32:06.151 --> 02:32:08.520
I'm like,
we don't want,
we don't,
I don't mean this in a negative way,

2474
02:32:08.521 --> 02:32:11.670
but because I'm sure there's companies out there that are trying to do
something,

2475
02:32:11.671 --> 02:32:13.830
but there's no one that's saying,
hey,
this is,
this is what you do,

2476
02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:17.070
this is how you lead this.
This is the way this will apply to your business.

2477
02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:20.190
These are the principles that you can use and you can make happen.
So yeah,

2478
02:32:20.191 --> 02:32:23.460
that's been,
we've been pretty lucky in the fact that we,

2479
02:32:23.461 --> 02:32:28.461
we saw the correlations between these two things and saw him pretty clearly.

2480
02:32:29.071 --> 02:32:30.210
So it's been good.

2481
02:32:30.370 --> 02:32:35.140
<v 3>And I gotta say,
so the muster in dcs who was zero five was my first muster.</v>

2482
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:39.640
And naturally any,
these guys know me,
I'm,
I'm filled with hate.

2483
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:44.110
Cause you sort of what drives me.
One of my nicknames was grumpy.

2484
02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:49.240
Um,
but you know,
I was definitely on board because it's you guys,

2485
02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:51.780
you guys are my brothers.
I'm like,
yeah dude,
I want it in a,
in a uh,

2486
02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:56.380
love discussing leadership.
But naturally,
you know,
I always have a,
you,

2487
02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:59.470
you hold back a little.
I'm like,
okay,
let me see what this monster is about.

2488
02:32:59.620 --> 02:33:00.453
And um,

2489
02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:05.140
the fact that you guys are changing lives and people are coming up to me off of

2490
02:33:05.141 --> 02:33:09.130
one speech and I'm just like,
dude,
what is going on?

2491
02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:11.470
Like I gave one speech and like,
people were like,
dude,

2492
02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:15.930
that actually your perspective has already changed my life.
I'm like,
no,

2493
02:33:15.970 --> 02:33:19.170
I'm glad to hear that out.
I didn't realize the,

2494
02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:22.150
the impact that it has.

2495
02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:25.400
<v 0>No,
it's,
it's,
it's an awesome thing to be a part of.</v>

2496
02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:27.020
And when I say a thing to be a part of,

2497
02:33:27.021 --> 02:33:30.920
it's awesome to be at the muster with the people that are at the monster.

2498
02:33:30.930 --> 02:33:33.140
Not just like,
oh,
we're a part of it and you're not know.

2499
02:33:33.141 --> 02:33:37.730
It's like everyone that's there is a part of it and everyone that there is there

2500
02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:42.760
is contributing to the knowledge that that's being distributed and increased.

2501
02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:50.250
So yeah,
it's uh,
it's awesome.
Yes,
it's a good time.
It is.

2502
02:33:51.650 --> 02:33:55.640
And that's where you're at now.
It was probably a pretty good place to be.

2503
02:33:55.641 --> 02:33:56.300
I probably,
we're,

2504
02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:59.660
we're touching three hours almost right now or two and a half or something like

2505
02:33:59.661 --> 02:34:00.494
that.

2506
02:34:02.390 --> 02:34:04.850
Probably a good place to call it.

2507
02:34:04.970 --> 02:34:08.420
And I'm sure we'll do this multiple times again in the future.

2508
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:12.320
Of course.
Obviously.
Thanks for coming on.

2509
02:34:13.250 --> 02:34:15.140
Thanks for your service in the Marine Corps,

2510
02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.440
in the teams and now Adeline echelon front at Echelon Front,

2511
02:34:21.461 --> 02:34:25.330
Overwatch.
Clearly Mike is out here doing his job.

2512
02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:30.810
He's done his job and now maybe we could get echo to do his job and talk about

2513
02:34:33.011 --> 02:34:38.011
how we can all do our job better in some way somehow.

2514
02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:43.270
Sure.
Could you help us with that one?
Yeah,
sure.
Be Happy too.
Cool.

2515
02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:47.830
We're on the path,
right?
Yeah.
I'm on the path.
You're on the path.
I'm on the path.

2516
02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:52.230
Alright.
Jocko Jocko is the path we owe them.
Let's not get crazy.

2517
02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:57.130
The very least.
You're all up on the path.
The trying to be on the path.

2518
02:34:57.131 --> 02:35:01.690
That's where I'm at.
I need to get crazy.
All right,
so that being said,

2519
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.600
we're all trying to stay on the path the best we can.
So here,

2520
02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:10.600
here are the ways to do this some ways.
Some ways.

2521
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:14.240
Yeah.
Just some suggestion here.
Like you're the authority on the path.

2522
02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:19.910
You're to sound like the ideas and good ideas.
Yeah.
Proven,
proven.

2523
02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:24.800
Most of these are all proven through experience,
true,
et Cetera.

2524
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:29.470
You know,
affirmative origin.
Origin.
Main dot comes called origin.

2525
02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:33.400
Our company origin,
American made stuff.
Jeez.

2526
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:38.470
Rash Guard for Jujitsu.
Other stuff as well.
Apparel.

2527
02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.720
Why does it pair will get like a,
like a tone,
you know?
Because you know,

2528
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:47.410
cause you know how you get,
you know,
but the whole like apparel,

2529
02:35:47.411 --> 02:35:49.810
like you're not a fashion person.
Well then again,

2530
02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:51.750
apparel and fashion is different.
Okay.
Yeah.

2531
02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:56.790
Because apparel is what you wear as a human and fashion is something else that

2532
02:35:56.831 --> 02:36:01.831
you were trying to look a certain way or give a certain flavor to your vibe,

2533
02:36:02.410 --> 02:36:05.920
which I'm not a fan of.
You're not a fan of flavor to your vibe.

2534
02:36:06.810 --> 02:36:09.280
Your goal.
I went to,
when I went to college,

2535
02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:14.050
there was this woman who was a Buddhist monk.

2536
02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:18.660
Sure.
And as I was learning about Buddhists,

2537
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:22.870
they,
one of the things that they said was like,
you're not supposed to stand out.

2538
02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:25.870
Like just just don't stand out.
Just just fit in.
Right.

2539
02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:29.710
That's part of the program.
Yeah.
Technically it's not fit in.

2540
02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:32.390
It's just don't stand out like maybe one of those two.

2541
02:36:32.410 --> 02:36:36.100
And if you're a practicing Buddhist,
you can come on and brief,
brief me on this.

2542
02:36:36.101 --> 02:36:40.450
I'm sure I need help.
This is how I read it.
Okay.
Don't you know,

2543
02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.830
just don't stand out.
You're just trying to be,
it's,
it's like an ego thing,
right?

2544
02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:47.860
It's like,
don't look at me.
Don't look at me because I'm just,

2545
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:50.620
I just wear a black tee shirt and a pair of jeans.
Don't look at me.

2546
02:36:50.621 --> 02:36:53.800
I'm just a normal dude over here.
Nothing special.

2547
02:36:53.801 --> 02:36:58.360
I'm not wearing billing as they call it.
Nope.
So,

2548
02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:02.650
but there was a,
there was a person there that was a Buddhist monk

2549
02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:07.210
and the Buddhist monk war,
all the Buddhist garb,

2550
02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:11.650
like the robe and the stuff,
which I don't care.
Hey,

2551
02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:16.160
when I was in Thailand,
it's awesome.
It's actually awesome seeing the monks

2552
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.840
<v 4>walk around and they come and gather rice for me in the morning.
And it's,
it's,</v>

2553
02:37:18.841 --> 02:37:22.190
it's like awesome.
It's seems to be the most,
uh,

2554
02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:26.810
really chill and religion out there.
Right?

2555
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:30.260
And so I'm down with the Buddhists,

2556
02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:36.200
but if you're not in Thailand with Bu,

2557
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:39.470
other Buddhist monks where it's normal,
well then you what,

2558
02:37:39.471 --> 02:37:40.850
guess what happens when you put on the robe?

2559
02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:43.040
He's damn stand out and you're saying,

2560
02:37:43.041 --> 02:37:47.450
look at me and that's what I gathered from.
And I was like,
Hey,
no,
look at me.

2561
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:52.100
Right.
In fact,
my goal is like,
don't look at me.

2562
02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.020
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
Look at me.
Yeah.
Oh,
so,
okay.

2563
02:37:57.021 --> 02:37:59.740
So I think,
and not to go too far deep into this whole,

2564
02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:04.640
we were just talking about where we're here.
Hey,
you brought it up.
True.
True.

2565
02:38:04.770 --> 02:38:07.880
It's less about,
because when the Buddhist puts on his garb,

2566
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:12.200
regardless of where he or she is,
when they put in the guard,
that's just how,

2567
02:38:12.201 --> 02:38:14.310
that's just the garb kind of thing.
He's there.

2568
02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.810
That's not regardless of where we're hearing where he or she is,

2569
02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:18.770
because check it out.

2570
02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:24.230
If you're in Thailand and you put on the normal monk outfit,

2571
02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:26.310
sure you look normal.
Yes.

2572
02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.480
If you're in a university where everyone's dressed in western clothing,

2573
02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:36.200
shorts,
t shirts,
and you put on the garb,
then guess what?

2574
02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:41.780
You're don't look normal.
Right?
If you stand out and it almost says,

2575
02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:46.640
look at me because the true in my opinion,
like uh,

2576
02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:48.350
like if you really wanted to,

2577
02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:53.660
to attain that level of Ego,
less enlightenment,

2578
02:38:53.810 --> 02:38:57.260
enlightenment,
then you just be dressing like the normal people dress.

2579
02:38:57.261 --> 02:39:01.070
Nothing more,
nothing less just right down the middle.
Right.
But don't look at me,

2580
02:39:01.850 --> 02:39:05.000
I'm just over here doing what I'm doing.
But I think,
and I don't know,

2581
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:10.630
but I think it's possible that it's less about the result of them standing out

2582
02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:17.050
and more about the effort or lack of effort or no effort made to stand up

2583
02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.250
because that's what it is.
Buddhists is like,

2584
02:39:19.251 --> 02:39:22.730
you can't be attached to like your personal,
it's like you what I'm saying,

2585
02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:27.680
so if you,
if you're used to putting on this the garb every day.

2586
02:39:27.681 --> 02:39:32.580
That's just how I put this on you guys.
I can stand out or not stand out.
I'm,

2587
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:35.980
I'm focused on,
I'm just talking about your way.
Yeah,
it's,
it has to be an income.

2588
02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:36.741
Well that's cool.

2589
02:39:36.741 --> 02:39:41.620
I'll change my attitude towards the monk that I went to college with.
That's why.

2590
02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:43.700
That's why he's the the,
what do you call it,

2591
02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:48.680
the leader he knew cause because he just opened my men anyway.

2592
02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:51.110
How can origin main help us stay on them?

2593
02:39:51.170 --> 02:39:53.990
That's why if you order something from origin Maine,

2594
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:58.880
you could order something that is neon green that Pete Robert's designed.

2595
02:39:59.850 --> 02:40:02.210
Those fats are have neon core.

2596
02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:06.050
You could order something that's just black or black and gray,

2597
02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:09.950
which is very low pro low profile profile.

2598
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:13.280
The joggers or low profiles looking as far as the colors and whatnot,

2599
02:40:13.530 --> 02:40:18.000
but they're joggers.
It's,
it's Kinda hip.
That's the thing right now,

2600
02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:21.270
joggers,
we've got a few of them most comfortable joggers in the world,

2601
02:40:21.271 --> 02:40:26.130
by the way.
Proven,
proven by experts expert.
Anyway,

2602
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:28.370
how can I keep you us on the path?
Okay.
You did.
You did too.

2603
02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:31.590
You want to stick with Jujitsu?
You need a new geek.
Boom.
Best gay men in America,

2604
02:40:31.591 --> 02:40:32.940
by the way.
So you,
same thing.

2605
02:40:32.970 --> 02:40:37.650
This is another question comes up all the time is should I wear the white guy

2606
02:40:37.651 --> 02:40:42.390
the black year,
the Blue Guy?
In my Buddhist mind,
it was always,
look,

2607
02:40:42.450 --> 02:40:44.520
the white gay is just the plain g.
That's it.

2608
02:40:44.890 --> 02:40:46.860
You're just aware of the plain white t.
That's the way it is.

2609
02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:51.350
I always only wore the white gay.
Guess what I got now like a Hyena Blackie.

2610
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:52.350
Guess what?

2611
02:40:52.350 --> 02:40:54.860
It doesn't matter anymore because everybody wears all kinds of different colored

2612
02:40:54.861 --> 02:40:57.570
geese while they were white,
blue or black,
right.
There's no,

2613
02:40:57.690 --> 02:41:01.380
it no longer is a thing to where it used to be like if you were a black gay,

2614
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:04.890
you're like,
hey look,
everyone look at me right now.

2615
02:41:04.891 --> 02:41:05.970
Don't give it cares what color.

2616
02:41:05.971 --> 02:41:09.120
Cause there's a lot of those different colors and circulation.

2617
02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:13.560
So whereas a year ago,
I'm saying only a year ago I would've been like,

2618
02:41:13.561 --> 02:41:15.480
hey listen,
you need to just stick with the white gay.

2619
02:41:15.481 --> 02:41:18.780
That's just how right now the mind has been opened.

2620
02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:23.820
If you want to get a black key,
if that's the one that is is you know,

2621
02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:26.940
what's your into get a black one or the blue one or the blue one.

2622
02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:30.240
The green or the not bright neon green and neon green.

2623
02:41:30.241 --> 02:41:34.710
Just for clarification purposes and young green was one of the colors that are

2624
02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:39.570
in the spats,
which are compression pants for stuff.
So anyway,

2625
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:44.250
anyway,
stay on the path,
get a new g,
continue or start Jujitsu.

2626
02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:47.400
Boom Path.
That's right on the path right in the middle of the path too.

2627
02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:49.040
By the way.
It's not,
you're not veering off.

2628
02:41:49.041 --> 02:41:53.010
And did you do to as part of the path also,
Joe,
when I say joggers,
sure,
yes,

2629
02:41:53.011 --> 02:41:57.570
they're comfortable.
I get it.
Come from,
there's no growth in the comfort zone,

2630
02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:01.980
whatever.
But you're pulling,
you're jogging,
getting accurate,

2631
02:42:01.981 --> 02:42:06.600
running,
doing these things.
You want to put on sweatpants,
right,
so to speak.

2632
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:10.110
And you put on some comfortable made in America origin joggers,
bright.

2633
02:42:10.111 --> 02:42:14.680
You're still on the path.
Big Time.
Huge time actually.
Fair enough.
There you go.

2634
02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.870
There you go.
Boom.
So there is growth in the comfort zone in a certain small,

2635
02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:21.690
exceptional compared to talk any more about clothing?

2636
02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:25.260
I will be like older we him,
he's outside of his comfort zone.

2637
02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:28.860
I'll be exiting the fashion area.
Have to be like,
okay wait.

2638
02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:32.430
If we talk about clothes,
see even by me saying like wear this,
don't wear that.

2639
02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:35.730
That's getting in the zone and I shouldn't be in,
which is,

2640
02:42:36.270 --> 02:42:39.840
I'm not going to go there.
I'm done talking about supplements.
I agree.
Cool.

2641
02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:42.090
Supplements.
Okay,
so Mike,

2642
02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:46.900
Remember supplements right when you're young,
take them off.

2643
02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.020
He's going to throw on the muscle.
[inaudible] right.
See Rescue.

2644
02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.810
I'm glad Mike's here.
We can talk about this stuff and get even more.

2645
02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:59.570
So for me to give me the community,
the what?
The protein faster

2646
02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:05.910
in every single way.
Lift more weights to be more big,
bigger,
less working out

2647
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:12.010
and then smaller tee shirts.
You understand?
So,
but we,

2648
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:15.610
and we never thought about,
hey,
what about joint supplements?
You know,
like,

2649
02:43:15.611 --> 02:43:16.930
you know when you're young you're like,
Eh,

2650
02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.950
I'll cool maybe for like older folks or something like this and I get it,

2651
02:43:21.250 --> 02:43:26.200
but not man,
give me the protein powder.
Give me the BCA is right.

2652
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:31.690
You got it.
So current,
you know,
things are always evolving.
New Information,

2653
02:43:31.691 --> 02:43:33.550
better information,
accurate information.

2654
02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:37.690
Joint supplements are more important than protein powder supplements.

2655
02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:41.050
I would agree.
I would agree because look,

2656
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:45.130
if your joints aren't working well in lifting heavy,

2657
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:50.140
you don't need protein supplements because you can't lift the weights to get to

2658
02:43:50.141 --> 02:43:53.720
need the recovery for the protein and for growth and gains seems sane.

2659
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:55.780
That is a valid point.
Before you know it,

2660
02:43:55.781 --> 02:43:58.990
you end up you're 40 and you can barely get out of your car after driving for

2661
02:43:58.991 --> 02:44:02.670
one hour.
Yeah,
and here's the thing that that is funny but not funny bro.
No,

2662
02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:06.760
it's real.
And which brings me to my other,
my other point,

2663
02:44:06.761 --> 02:44:09.040
which actually all joking aside is a big deal.

2664
02:44:09.041 --> 02:44:11.530
This is the biggest deal that I've actually found.
When you,

2665
02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:15.220
when you get more healthy joints,

2666
02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:19.000
your everyday activity is like way different almost till the point where you

2667
02:44:19.001 --> 02:44:23.080
didn't realize that you had jammed up joints.
I'm saying you're like Dang,

2668
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:26.980
all this freedom was waiting for me on the other side of healthy joints decision

2669
02:44:27.010 --> 02:44:28.030
making.
Anyway,

2670
02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.480
point is Jocko some supplements that was joints was a long point.

2671
02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:37.440
Well,
Mike's here.
I figured we'd talk about it.
He's got to educate.
Yeah.

2672
02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:41.530
And and get educated as well.
Anyway,
joint warfare,

2673
02:44:42.530 --> 02:44:45.970
Krill or Super Krill oil.
These are things that go directly to joints.

2674
02:44:45.971 --> 02:44:49.760
Other benefits by the way,
we can talk about if you want Twitter,

2675
02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:54.340
I have my knees hurt.
How does joint warfare no,

2676
02:44:54.341 --> 02:44:58.200
which need to go to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's how I know.
So yeah,

2677
02:44:58.210 --> 02:44:59.420
I have the answer to that.

2678
02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:04.460
That joint joint warfare knows that it goes to both knees.

2679
02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:08.320
Oh,
okay.
So it's like,
hey,
cover and move.
It's going to cover this.
Like,
Hey,

2680
02:45:08.321 --> 02:45:11.760
we got a bunch of guys,
right?
We've got a bunch of guys and they're all like,

2681
02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:15.950
they've been working on to say,
have some issues to say like,
no,
it knows.
Yeah.

2682
02:45:16.090 --> 02:45:18.460
You just tell it before you eat it,
before you take a hit.

2683
02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:22.660
The drone warfare say he left me.
Well,
you'd think it feels like that,

2684
02:45:22.661 --> 02:45:26.140
but this is what it really is.
The joint warfare doesn't know that he's no.

2685
02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:30.310
So it's like,
hey look,
we're all working out.
We're all doing,
you know,
various,
uh,

2686
02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.770
we're,
we're moving,
we're cleaning the guy.
That's what we're doing.

2687
02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:34.980
Or mowing the lawn,
moving our bodies through spirit.

2688
02:45:37.570 --> 02:45:41.590
Anyway,
we're doing yard work,
right.
Me,
Mike,
Jocko,

2689
02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:46.150
some other folks that we know right after while it's hot outside.
And then boom,

2690
02:45:46.390 --> 02:45:46.931
one of our,

2691
02:45:46.931 --> 02:45:51.931
my wife comes outside with the big bucket of ice with waters in it,

2692
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:56.770
right?
Jockos a little bit bigger.

2693
02:45:56.771 --> 02:45:59.650
He may have worked a little bit harder than us.
He's gonna.
He might,

2694
02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:02.470
he might need some more water.
Mike worked a little bit,

2695
02:46:02.471 --> 02:46:03.610
he might need a certain amount of water,

2696
02:46:03.611 --> 02:46:06.850
but we all need varying amounts of water.
Sometimes the least water

2697
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:12.680
is,
I've been in the shade,
maybe not working that much.

2698
02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.720
I may need a half bottle water.
You are assessing?
Yeah.

2699
02:46:16.970 --> 02:46:20.430
So my wife is the joint warfare with all the Omega threes and all the,

2700
02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:25.010
all the stuff.
Oh the nutrients.
You guys are the neat Jockos the bad knee.

2701
02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:27.830
Obviously I'm the good knee.
I need less of that stuff.

2702
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:31.810
So we are the knees choose water,
how much water we need to say.

2703
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:34.010
And this is what's cool about this is this is awesome.

2704
02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:36.120
This is all scientifically proven.

2705
02:46:36.121 --> 02:46:41.090
It 100% that the me will draw in the joint warfare.

2706
02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:44.180
Doesn't know that.
Nino's check Dr Reco.

2707
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:48.920
That's literally how it works.
But yeah,
very important supplement.
You'll know.

2708
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:53.270
Just take it,
you'll know and uh,
yeah.
Discipline.
You can take that.

2709
02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:58.490
You might've seen the video that Echo Charles made about discipline that I was

2710
02:46:58.491 --> 02:47:02.330
taking three scoops of discipline in that it put me into a,

2711
02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:05.790
let's just call it the zone,
his own Jujitsu.
Excellent.

2712
02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:10.730
The zone of Jujitsu excellence.
And you spliced up that video,
you splice it up.

2713
02:47:10.850 --> 02:47:13.730
I got to say thank you.
You splice it up to make me look pretty good.

2714
02:47:13.731 --> 02:47:17.840
I was all grinding on beam and I was all had Andy's arm and I was like,
Dang,

2715
02:47:17.841 --> 02:47:20.720
I look good.
I think it was just so everyone knows.
Yeah,

2716
02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:22.370
the rules don't always look like that.

2717
02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:25.310
We got some good little clips and you only hear something actually really funny

2718
02:47:25.311 --> 02:47:28.250
about that.
That's funny you bring that up.
Okay,
so all that foot,

2719
02:47:28.251 --> 02:47:30.290
remember when I came in,
just filmed whatever.
Right.

2720
02:47:30.291 --> 02:47:33.980
And you're willing with Dean for a lot of that time and you know when you wrote

2721
02:47:33.981 --> 02:47:36.200
with Dean,
it's not,
you're not just dominated.
Dean is good.

2722
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:39.360
So he was kind of getting you for a little bit.
So dean error,

2723
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:42.170
like literally that night he's texting me,
hey,
send me that footage.
Hey,

2724
02:47:42.171 --> 02:47:44.150
send me the photo.
I want to see the footage,
I want to see the footage holders,

2725
02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:47.240
you know,
this and that.
And I was like,
ah,
you know,
I don't know.
You know,

2726
02:47:47.241 --> 02:47:48.930
I'm kind of,
and he said,
hey,
I won't put something in that.

2727
02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:51.470
Just send me the footage.
And I was like,
okay,
didn't send it to them.

2728
02:47:51.530 --> 02:47:55.310
I forgot I wanted to.
But then I was like,
shoot,
should I send them this footage?

2729
02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:57.840
You know what?
Like what if people posted in the internet or whatever's ma'am,

2730
02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:00.500
that's what I'm thinking.
But I'm like,
okay,
here's the thing.

2731
02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.360
Andy said something like that,
like you were filming and Andy's all,
oh,
hey,

2732
02:48:05.361 --> 02:48:08.240
do you want to role even though he's here for,
and I was like,
dude,
I don't care.

2733
02:48:09.430 --> 02:48:12.580
Oh,
oh,
Jujitsu doesn't work on John.
He's not going to tap out.
No,
no,

2734
02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:15.740
actually it works on Jocko and Junko Tepsco was a freaking job.
Gets caught.

2735
02:48:15.741 --> 02:48:19.910
Nick damn arm lock.
So Dean wants this,
this footage.

2736
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:23.150
So I'd go kind of look through the footage and there's one of him,

2737
02:48:23.151 --> 02:48:24.710
he takes you down and it's like funny

2738
02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.310
while he's sitting down by the way.

2739
02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:32.830
And then he like mounts you and he's like grinding his elbow torture.

2740
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:34.700
Let me not put that part in it.

2741
02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.240
So I made you look good and what sucks is like I was doing good cause I was kind

2742
02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.110
of getting after it.
That's what part of it.
Yeah,
exactly.
Maybe look good.

2743
02:48:45.111 --> 02:48:49.000
So everyone,
I thank you dean Lester does not thinking.
Sorry Dude.

2744
02:48:49.930 --> 02:48:51.290
A also,

2745
02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:54.170
you know you talked about protein not being important and I actually think

2746
02:48:54.171 --> 02:48:56.360
you're wrong.
Well tech,

2747
02:48:56.361 --> 02:49:01.361
you need protein and you might as well get your protein from the what's commonly

2748
02:49:01.371 --> 02:49:06.080
known as the only real source of protein.
That's good.
Which is milk.

2749
02:49:06.140 --> 02:49:09.560
Yes.
Do you know what mark is?

2750
02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:13.740
I've seen it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He heard here or you haven't tried it yet?

2751
02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:16.900
I've not tried it all,
man.
Sorry.
Dan will give you some local media.

2752
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:19.540
We get spoon up here.
Yeah,
yeah.
You're,
you're,

2753
02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:23.100
you don't even know what you're missing a Barbara.
So yeah,
you get milk,

2754
02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:27.000
peanut butter,
mark will be out peanut butter,
peanut butter,

2755
02:49:27.001 --> 02:49:31.620
chocolate milk will be out,
we'll call it,
we'll call it very soon.

2756
02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:33.990
Within a week I'm going to call it.

2757
02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:37.180
And then a week cause he good butter had it and it's,

2758
02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:40.680
yeah,
see which kind of goes to,

2759
02:49:40.681 --> 02:49:44.910
you'd think it's counterintuitive to his whole thing.
You know,
it was like,
hey,

2760
02:49:44.911 --> 02:49:49.140
let's make something that's like,
you know,
healthy,
good protein,

2761
02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:52.560
clean all this stuff.
But you don't want what it has to taste delicious.

2762
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:53.400
And you see what I'm saying?

2763
02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:56.160
It kind of goes against his whole hardcore toughness thing,
right?

2764
02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:59.160
Just like the discipline you made.
Sure it tasted good.

2765
02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:00.630
So what I'm saying and that kind of funny.

2766
02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:05.070
It's funny how you think it's funny anyway.
Yeah.
Good,

2767
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:10.020
good one replaced her dessert with milk and boom,
no sugar protein.

2768
02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:10.610
It's weird.

2769
02:50:10.610 --> 02:50:15.210
There's a substance on earth that you can replace your steak and your dessert

2770
02:50:15.390 --> 02:50:19.080
with one item.
And I'm not necessarily,
I'm not saying you got to do that,

2771
02:50:19.081 --> 02:50:21.720
but sometimes he can.
You know,
cooking a steak is a pain.

2772
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:25.770
Sometimes it takes eight minutes.
You know we don't have any minutes.
Sometimes.

2773
02:50:25.771 --> 02:50:29.610
Boom it makes up the milk.
You're good.
Come to the immersion camp.

2774
02:50:29.611 --> 02:50:32.070
We'll have more with the immersion camp in Maine.

2775
02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:37.030
August 26 through September 2nd do you did see immersion camp?
Yeah.

2776
02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.310
Either way to immersion camp.

2777
02:50:38.311 --> 02:50:42.850
Not Italian immersion camp cause we won't be spoken to speaking Italian there or

2778
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:44.400
any other languages.
Most likely.

2779
02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:49.580
Maybe a couple of Portuguese maybe some espanol.

2780
02:50:50.310 --> 02:50:54.150
Sure.
Yeah.
Any other,
anyone else that wants to come and speak other languages?

2781
02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:58.410
All this stuff that echo just talked about.
Origin main.com you can get it there.

2782
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:59.550
Yup.
It's true.

2783
02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.880
Also good way to support yourself and this podcast if you want is the fact or

2784
02:51:05.311 --> 02:51:08.730
knowing that Daca was a store and it's called Jocko store.
Okay.

2785
02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:13.680
How do you support yourself with Jocko store?
If you want to represent,

2786
02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:18.450
if you're on the path you want to represent,
you can get a shirt says Dick.

2787
02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:21.150
Discipline equals freedom to now new designs on there.

2788
02:51:21.151 --> 02:51:23.940
If you care about that sweater you still offering the old one?
Yes.

2789
02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:29.100
That's an interesting decision.
Why?
I Dunno cause they're different.

2790
02:51:29.101 --> 02:51:33.060
They're slightly different.
Yeah,
they're just,
you know,
hey,
okay,

2791
02:51:33.090 --> 02:51:37.950
so I have discipline equals freedom shorts.
I have the green one,
the,

2792
02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:41.190
you know,
the regular hell,
what do you call the head?
They're gray.
Right?

2793
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:46.410
And what's the other one?
Like a charcoal.
All same design.
So I'm like,

2794
02:51:46.411 --> 02:51:50.100
Hey,
you know,
if you care about this kind of thing,
hey,
I'm going to go,

2795
02:51:50.101 --> 02:51:53.550
I don't know,
wherever the post office I've got at the post office,
like,
hey,

2796
02:51:53.551 --> 02:51:56.820
that's a cool shirt.
You don't your charcoal,
just bleeding classroom.
Cool.

2797
02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:57.930
I go to the post office in the next day.

2798
02:51:57.931 --> 02:52:01.260
I'm wearing the Heather one there that he's like,
Bro,
like what up?

2799
02:52:01.290 --> 02:52:05.040
You just like that same design so much.
You get it in all colors.
I said,

2800
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:08.170
but it's,
I'm still left with a thought like,
man,

2801
02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:11.470
maybe I should get a different design,
but I like discipline equals freedom.

2802
02:52:11.770 --> 02:52:15.100
See what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Okay.
I get to,
I guess the new designs,

2803
02:52:15.430 --> 02:52:17.860
I'll come back to the post office.
The guy's like,
hey,

2804
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:21.880
I like this with clinicals from too.
That's dope.
But I am still,

2805
02:52:21.881 --> 02:52:25.480
he still has the sense like,
okay,
he has more than just that one.
Do Name.

2806
02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:29.110
See what I'm saying?
See what I'm saying though,
right?
I do.
Yeah.
I mean,

2807
02:52:29.111 --> 02:52:32.830
I know I'm kind of overstating it,
but it's still,
it's a thing.
It's not nothing.

2808
02:52:33.010 --> 02:52:37.720
Okay.
So on Daca story,
you can get rash cards,
tee shirts,
trucker hats.

2809
02:52:38.050 --> 02:52:40.990
You can get other hats,
hoodies,
hoodies.

2810
02:52:41.770 --> 02:52:45.940
You can get legit hoodies and,
and Hawaiian hoodies.
Twain hoodies,

2811
02:52:47.010 --> 02:52:51.340
if you know that Hawaiian hoodies means,
which we don't cause Jocko made that up.

2812
02:52:52.090 --> 02:52:53.350
It's just a lightweight hoodie.

2813
02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:58.170
It could be called southern California hoodie too.
Yeah.
Good shirt.
Good.

2814
02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:02.020
Sometimes it gets to be 38 degrees in southern California.

2815
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:04.090
The Hawaiian Hoodie ain't gonna cut it.
Yeah,

2816
02:53:04.091 --> 02:53:08.630
I think you're going the less lightweight they look nice.
Yeah.

2817
02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:11.770
And anyway,
if you want to represent [inaudible] dot com he likes something,

I read them.
Sometimes they make me laugh.
Yes,
that is good.

2821
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:26.740
Yes.
Because they can be rough,

2822
02:53:26.741 --> 02:53:30.430
but then you read it a good review that's makes you laugh.
That's positive.

But also the ones you do your little fancy stuff.

2830
02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:05.620
Yeah.
Yeah man.
Uh,
again,

2831
02:54:05.770 --> 02:54:10.140
you're super sensitive about video bacon.
Everyone should know that.
No.

2832
02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:15.430
Okay,
cool.
Anyway,
um,
yeah,
so when you made it,

2833
02:54:15.431 --> 02:54:19.450
you made the monster video.
Yup.
And someone,
this is an interesting point.

2834
02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:21.550
Someone put somewhat,

2835
02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:25.630
I posted it to my Facebook,
I post,

2836
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:27.300
I post it there and there isn't,
you know,

2837
02:54:27.310 --> 02:54:30.460
people commenting and then someone wrote no credit to echo.

2838
02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:36.970
That's it.
Echo just did,
he's doing his job and he's proud of it.
Yeah,

2839
02:54:36.971 --> 02:54:41.830
that's it.
It doesn't want that kind of credit credit.
Um,
I actually,

2840
02:54:41.831 --> 02:54:43.430
I think echo made the video.

2841
02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:50.860
You did your job,
you did what you're supposed to do.
Good.
Congratulations.
Well,

2842
02:54:50.861 --> 02:54:54.670
I think technically two in,
I mean in the spirit of just accuracy,

2843
02:54:54.970 --> 02:54:58.120
I think most people kind of know that I made the video.
Yeah.

2844
02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:01.150
Cause I just make the video.
That's like the routine,
right?

2845
02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:04.090
That's what it seems like anyway.
Anyway.
Sure.
Alright.

2846
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:08.720
<v 0>Yeah,
we're keyed.
Podcast is dope.
That's on youtube as well,
by the way.
Also,</v>

2847
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:12.170
if you want to vary up your workout,
which I think is important thing,

2848
02:55:12.171 --> 02:55:15.410
but you know,
hey,
people are people so,
and people are different,

2849
02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:17.360
but if you want to vary up your workout,

2850
02:55:17.361 --> 02:55:22.100
try some new stuff going on it.com/jocko you get some new gear,

2851
02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:27.270
gear in all capacities,
by the way.
All the way down to socks.
Uh,

2852
02:55:27.290 --> 02:55:32.030
we have the club.
It's a club heavy club.
Huh?
I'm going to have to check this out.

2853
02:55:32.210 --> 02:55:34.970
Yeah.
None of the club that you picked up,
you were like,
Hey,

2854
02:55:34.971 --> 02:55:37.820
are you going to do some just the leases for juggling?
And you're like,
oh no,

2855
02:55:37.821 --> 02:55:41.180
that's not for juggling.
You'll kill somebody in probably yourself.

2856
02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:44.600
But he'd see that backs up the point that I said before about those.

2857
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:46.790
Those are like,
oh yeah,
you don't like cool.
It's a club.

2858
02:55:46.791 --> 02:55:49.880
It looks like one of those clubs that they juggle all the little pins or

2859
02:55:49.881 --> 02:55:53.810
whatever guy.
Yeah.
And you pick it up.
You're like,
Bro,
I can't juggle that.

2860
02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:57.260
That's like something you work out with and here's the thing.
Yeah,

2861
02:55:57.261 --> 02:56:00.500
there's full workouts with that club and there's varying weights or whatever.

2862
02:56:00.501 --> 02:56:05.000
Anyway,
you go to the website,
you can see,
um,
you know what workouts to do.

2863
02:56:05.001 --> 02:56:08.990
A lot of good info on there.
You know,
switch up your workout man.
Itunes,

2864
02:56:08.991 --> 02:56:12.830
Google play,
MP three.
You can get a psychological warfare.

2865
02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:14.480
It's an album and yes,

2866
02:56:14.481 --> 02:56:19.481
it has tracks and it's just me telling echo and you if you're listening not to

2867
02:56:20.241 --> 02:56:24.560
be weak at that moment in time.
Yeah,
no,
no.

2868
02:56:24.890 --> 02:56:29.060
It helps.
It helps you not be,
we were working on the second album.
Well,

2869
02:56:29.061 --> 02:56:33.350
I should say I'm compiling the thoughts for the second album,

2870
02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:37.430
which would seems like we've determined the working title at this point is all

2871
02:56:37.431 --> 02:56:38.930
of your excuses are lies.
Yeah.

2872
02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:43.400
Because that one seems to be a hit home with me,
with everyone.

2873
02:56:43.810 --> 02:56:47.990
All Jocko white tea.
You can get it on Amazon,
in Canada and in America.

2874
02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.430
You can get dry tea,
little tea bags that you brew or you can get the can,

2875
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:55.060
which we are going to put all the big,

2876
02:56:56.140 --> 02:56:56.700
<v 5>yeah.</v>

2877
02:56:56.700 --> 02:57:00.540
<v 0>Unhealthy energy drinks.
We're gonna put 'em out of business.
Yeah.
Yup.
That's the,</v>

2878
02:57:00.541 --> 02:57:04.110
that's the prediction.
Sure.
Because why would you not drink Jocko white tea?

2879
02:57:04.111 --> 02:57:06.890
Why would you drink something that's going to kill you when you could drink

2880
02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:10.740
something that's going to make you more healthy and it tastes better and it

2881
02:57:10.741 --> 02:57:14.130
makes you feel better.
Do you have any answer to that?
I don't have.
That's right.

2882
02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:18.940
Cause I'm right and you're,
you're attitude is wrong.
And

2883
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:23.130
uh,
books,
if you're on Amazon anyways,

2884
02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:27.810
where the warrior kid and Mark's mission and dismayed equals freedom field

2885
02:57:27.811 --> 02:57:31.790
manual,
if you want that on audio,
it's not an audible book.
It's

2886
02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:33.820
<v 5>okay.</v>

2887
02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:37.990
<v 0>MP3,
iTunes,
Google play,
all that other stuff.
Extreme ownership,</v>

2888
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:41.470
which was written by me and my brother Leif Babin.

2889
02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:47.410
It's about leadership and we have a follow on book to that called the dichotomy

2890
02:57:47.411 --> 02:57:47.921
of leadership,

2891
02:57:47.921 --> 02:57:52.921
which is coming out September 25th and we're getting some feedback on it right

2892
02:57:53.771 --> 02:57:57.070
now and people are really stoked.
Lafe and I are definitely stoked on it.

2893
02:57:57.071 --> 02:58:01.090
It's a cool,
cool,
cool book to write.
It's a little problem,

2894
02:58:01.290 --> 02:58:04.160
little area that if the area that people have the most problems with.
Yeah.

2895
02:58:04.230 --> 02:58:08.220
How do you balance between being too much of a micromanager and being too loose?

2896
02:58:08.221 --> 02:58:10.530
How do you,
how do you manage the being,

2897
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:15.720
communicating too much with the group and two little with how do you deal,

2898
02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:17.450
how do you manage being too close to you?

2899
02:58:17.451 --> 02:58:22.440
People are too or too distant from your people,
so all those little things,

2900
02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:25.470
all those little balances that you have to figure out as a leader there in that

2901
02:58:25.471 --> 02:58:29.730
book,
check it out.
You can preorder it anywhere if you preorder it.

2902
02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:34.760
It's helpful because that way our publisher who is,

2903
02:58:35.090 --> 02:58:38.550
you know,
just not aware,
they're not in the game.

2904
02:58:38.670 --> 02:58:40.770
They're not listening to actually,
some of them I listen,
it's fine.

2905
02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:44.070
If they're listening as podcasts,
they should be thinking not,
you know what?

2906
02:58:44.071 --> 02:58:47.730
We need to print a bunch of these books.
Don't miss out on the first dish.

2907
02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:51.390
You don't want the second a dish.
We might end up with it if you don't order it.

2908
02:58:51.570 --> 02:58:54.000
But,
and speaking of which,

2909
02:58:54.900 --> 02:58:57.960
for leadership training,
if you've read the book,

2910
02:58:57.961 --> 02:59:00.630
you need a little bit more inside your organization.
Echelon Front.

2911
02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:05.100
We solve problems through leadership.
To me,
Leif Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,

2912
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:08.310
Flint Cochran,
and now as you have heard,

2913
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:14.150
my brother Mike Cirelli roster zero zero six mustard zero zero six in San

2914
02:59:15.690 --> 02:59:19.820
Francisco,
October 17th and 18th
Mike,

2915
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:20.820
you kind of talked about this,

2916
02:59:20.821 --> 02:59:24.750
but you're feeling like the monster had will have good impact on people.

2917
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:28.320
<v 3>It most definitely is going to have impact on people.</v>

2918
02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:32.430
It's been shown in just the two days I attended.
I walked away.

2919
02:59:32.431 --> 02:59:37.330
I came right back to Jordan and I'm like,
I call it.
I'm like,
dude,
she's like,

2920
02:59:37.350 --> 02:59:42.240
don't call me dude.
I'm blown away.
In fact,

2921
02:59:42.270 --> 02:59:45.820
the funny thing is you remember there was a green moray that came and you know

2922
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:50.460
for the listeners,
hey,
you know there's,
there's strife in our rivalry,

2923
02:59:50.461 --> 02:59:53.340
rivalry between the communities,
all,
all for fun.

2924
02:59:53.970 --> 02:59:57.780
But even he looked at me and he's like,
dude,
this is amazing.

2925
02:59:58.290 --> 03:00:02.610
These guys are having an impact and we are going to a very unique place.

2926
03:00:02.611 --> 03:00:07.611
Silicon valley that is without a doubt one of the most innovative places,

2927
03:00:08.911 --> 03:00:12.750
sometimes lacks leadership,
has innovative products but lacks leadership.

2928
03:00:12.751 --> 03:00:15.480
So this is going to be magical.

2929
03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:18.270
Well it had to go.
Yup.

2930
03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:20.860
<v 0>Yup.
Well that's one of the things,
one of the reasons is cause they'll,</v>

2931
03:00:20.861 --> 03:00:23.110
companies we work with up in Silicon Valley,

2932
03:00:23.140 --> 03:00:27.940
a lot of times they have the technical capacity,
they're smart,

2933
03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:31.810
that they even have the business understanding.

2934
03:00:31.811 --> 03:00:33.880
But the only thing that they need,

2935
03:00:33.881 --> 03:00:36.190
especially once they start to grow as they need,
they need better leadership.

2936
03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:40.750
And so that's why we are the companies we work up with that we work with up

2937
03:00:40.751 --> 03:00:43.180
there.
We know that they need this.

2938
03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:47.140
And so that's why we're doing this one in San Francisco,
October 17th and 18th.

2939
03:00:48.130 --> 03:00:51.880
Um,
come on out.
You can register it.
Extreme ownership.com.

2940
03:00:52.270 --> 03:00:54.670
You'll see that on this one.

2941
03:00:54.671 --> 03:00:57.840
You'll see like a lot of people from the last one cause they're like,

2942
03:00:57.850 --> 03:01:01.000
keep coming.
You know what I mean?
Because not only the updates or whatever,

2943
03:01:01.001 --> 03:01:05.750
but just like how you were saying earlier where the more you learn something and

2944
03:01:05.751 --> 03:01:09.910
then you go to the field,
you know,
you practice,
you don't practice,
you perform.

2945
03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.510
Then you're like,
oh wait,
okay.
Now other problems arise.

2946
03:01:13.511 --> 03:01:16.330
You understand a problem that was on the problem.
Yeah,

2947
03:01:16.331 --> 03:01:18.790
because I see it differently now.
I see more festival,
boom.

2948
03:01:18.791 --> 03:01:21.610
I'm going back to the muster,
see what I'm saying?
And then boom,

2949
03:01:21.611 --> 03:01:25.230
back to the field.
So you'll see people there every time updated.

2950
03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:26.280
And I'm going to tell you this.

2951
03:01:26.281 --> 03:01:30.460
So out of a sewer zero five there's this police officer came up to me,

2952
03:01:30.670 --> 03:01:34.310
or I should say Mountie from Nova Scotia.
Second,
do I want you,

2953
03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:36.340
I want you to come talk to my department.
And then,
yeah,

2954
03:01:36.350 --> 03:01:39.070
when he saw that I spoke with the Louisville,
Kentucky,
uh,

2955
03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:42.700
which are my boys police department,
the police department,
he was like,
hey,

2956
03:01:42.701 --> 03:01:45.520
you need to come out.
So we're coordinating,

2957
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:49.850
I get to go out to Nova Scotia is a zero zero five and that's all awesome.

2958
03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:51.160
A,
you know,

2959
03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:56.160
speaking of law enforcement is because of the cause of the popularity of the

2960
03:01:58.030 --> 03:02:02.050
muster.
And because there's usually law enforcement,
military border patrol,

2961
03:02:02.051 --> 03:02:04.780
firefighters,
paramedics,
all first responders,
basically people in uniform,

2962
03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:07.630
they've,
they've been coming to all the monsters,

2963
03:02:07.631 --> 03:02:12.631
but we wanted to do one that's a little bit cheaper focused on those types of

2964
03:02:13.181 --> 03:02:15.310
jobs.
So we're doing something in Dallas,
Texas,

2965
03:02:15.311 --> 03:02:19.560
September 21st it's called the roll call.
If you want it,

2966
03:02:19.561 --> 03:02:22.900
it's the same register,
register extreme ownership.com.
You gotta be one of those,

2967
03:02:22.901 --> 03:02:24.880
you've got to be one of those jobs to come to that.

2968
03:02:25.150 --> 03:02:29.290
But that's going to be focused on that sort of dynamic leadership that you get

2969
03:02:29.291 --> 03:02:30.880
into in those situations.

2970
03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:36.540
So that's the role call zero zero one September 21st of course.

2971
03:02:36.580 --> 03:02:41.500
Now one more thing to talk about echelon front,
Overwatch,
f Overwatch.

2972
03:02:42.130 --> 03:02:44.560
So check it out.
Real simple to put this out.

2973
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:49.710
If you're a veteran and you're either in the military and you're getting ready

2974
03:02:50.681 --> 03:02:54.730
to transition out of the military,
soft,
soft support,

2975
03:02:55.180 --> 03:02:59.620
um,
combat pilots,
if you're in that situation,

2976
03:03:00.490 --> 03:03:05.490
go to f overwatch.com or if you're a business that wants to bring this type of

2977
03:03:07.451 --> 03:03:09.580
leadership into your team,

2978
03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:14.650
then go to f Overwatch and you see there's real simple instruction to follow and

2979
03:03:14.651 --> 03:03:19.651
we'll proceed to move down the path of putting the best people in the best

2980
03:03:19.721 --> 03:03:23.590
positions.
And on top of that,

2981
03:03:23.591 --> 03:03:28.570
if you want to hang out with us a little bit more virtually until we see you in

2982
03:03:28.571 --> 03:03:31.330
San Francisco at the monster or until we see you at the roll call or until we

2983
03:03:31.331 --> 03:03:32.710
see you at the immersion camp in Maine,

2984
03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:38.100
then we're on the interwebs fully on the Inter webs on Twitter,

2985
03:03:38.390 --> 03:03:43.300
Instagram,
and Dash our phase that bulky Mike is m.

2986
03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:45.970
J.
Cirelli.
It's m j.

2987
03:03:46.180 --> 03:03:50.770
S.
A.
R.
R.
A.
I.
L.
L.
E.

2988
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:54.700
That's him on Twitter.
He's Mike Cirelli on Instagram.

2989
03:03:55.900 --> 03:03:58.210
And he's Michael Sorelli on Dasher

2990
03:03:58.210 --> 03:03:58.540
<v 4>faze,</v>

2991
03:03:58.540 --> 03:04:03.540
a bulky and of course echo is at Echo Charleston and I am at Jockowillink Echo.

2992
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:08.000
Anything else?
Yeah,
here we go.

2993
03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:14.420
Going back,
you did mention,
you said Mini Bud's.

2994
03:04:14.421 --> 03:04:18.200
Did you say mini buds?
That's what you went through many bud.

2995
03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:22.550
<v 3>So I think it's called something else now.
I can't recall.</v>

2996
03:04:22.551 --> 03:04:27.551
So basically there is a vast pool of kids in college and at the Naval Academy

2997
03:04:28.221 --> 03:04:30.950
that one trout be officers in the seal teams.
Yes.

2998
03:04:31.430 --> 03:04:35.510
Because the competition is so fierce the summer before they graduate and

2999
03:04:35.511 --> 03:04:37.610
actually become commissioned as officers in the navy,

3000
03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:42.940
they actually have to compete for the few billets that exist for buds officers.

3001
03:04:43.730 --> 03:04:48.450
Okay.
And so you've got,
I think he ain't worth from a hundred,
200,
uh,

3002
03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:51.440
actually probably more than that trying to get into many bugs and there's only

3003
03:04:51.441 --> 03:04:53.660
so many,
I think like there's 30 per class.

3004
03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:58.880
They run too many buds every summer of about 30,
uh,
candidates each.

3005
03:04:58.881 --> 03:05:02.270
So 60 total and there's probably like 500 kids competing for those slots.

3006
03:05:02.480 --> 03:05:07.160
And then amongst those 60,
they're only going to select,
I think like 50% 30,

3007
03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:07.730
uh,

3008
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:12.590
that actually can step into buds as navy ensigns and try to become a navy seal

3009
03:05:12.591 --> 03:05:15.320
officers.
So,
you know,
it goes back to that talent.

3010
03:05:15.350 --> 03:05:20.210
Everyone is always in a war for town looking for the best candidates.

3011
03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:25.240
<v 4>So you go to a mini buds,
you pass,
then you go to buds.
Yup.</v>

3012
03:05:25.330 --> 03:05:30.110
Yeah.
If you're lucky,
if they select you got you perform well at many buds.

3013
03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:33.270
And again,
this is just for your office or pipeline.
If you're enlisted guy,

3014
03:05:33.271 --> 03:05:36.240
you enlist in the navy and you,
you go to buds,
there's no many bud's for you.
God.

3015
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:41.260
They do have a prep course now up in uh,
Chicago,
uh,
after boot camp.

3016
03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:46.140
You,
you stay in,
you try and they try and get you ready for buds,
but different,

3017
03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:49.110
obviously it's different.
I don't think that's even a selection.

3018
03:05:49.140 --> 03:05:52.620
It's not a selection as,
yeah,
I'm sure they could de-select you,

3019
03:05:52.621 --> 03:05:54.060
but the purpose isn't deselection.

3020
03:05:54.330 --> 03:05:56.280
<v 3>No,
I think the purpose was to,
to,
to,</v>

3021
03:05:56.310 --> 03:05:59.780
to see if we get statistically increase the number of people that they get

3022
03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:01.620
through.
But people actually,
I think it's,

3023
03:06:01.710 --> 03:06:04.680
it hasn't proven effective at the end of the day.
It's,
yeah,

3024
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:07.250
<v 4>it's one thing for whatever reason,
it's an 80% attrition rate,</v>

3025
03:06:07.440 --> 03:06:09.560
like almost all the time or 70 to 80%.

3026
03:06:09.890 --> 03:06:14.660
So one of my friends said this about butts,
about passing,

3027
03:06:14.661 --> 03:06:17.210
but this is a fact.
It's not that the telltale,

3028
03:06:17.250 --> 03:06:21.470
but this is the factor where if you're in a group that,

3029
03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:24.440
and this is going to go back to leadership.
I kind of interestingly,

3030
03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:27.980
if you're in a group where people are real negative and then you know,
when you,

3031
03:06:27.981 --> 03:06:30.380
you're negative,
you want to blame other people.
All right?
This,

3032
03:06:30.470 --> 03:06:34.640
if you're a negative person,
whenever you don't want to take action.
So if,

3033
03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:39.230
if a guy has seemingly getting ganged up on,
you know,
like if everyone's like,

3034
03:06:39.231 --> 03:06:40.730
hey,
you're not pulling your wig,
you know,

3035
03:06:40.731 --> 03:06:42.020
everyone's getting frustrated and then they,

3036
03:06:42.021 --> 03:06:47.021
everyone's like harping on one guy that makes them quit way quicker.

3037
03:06:48.020 --> 03:06:52.340
Then if everyone's like,
yeah,
it's okay.
It's okay,
we can do this.

3038
03:06:52.341 --> 03:06:54.530
You know how like he,
like if you have a leader who's like,
hey,

3039
03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:56.100
it's all good guys.
Come on.
When we got this,

3040
03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:58.800
<v 3>we got this kind of cheering everybody on and saying like,
Hey,
we're all,</v>

3041
03:06:58.801 --> 03:07:01.050
we're all a team here kind of thing.
But if you're like,
hey,

3042
03:07:01.051 --> 03:07:03.960
you're holding us back and everyone's ganging up on that guy,

3043
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:08.250
he'll quit way quicker.
That's what he was saying.
Check there.

3044
03:07:08.350 --> 03:07:12.120
There's only one exception.
I think that's probably accurate for the most part.

3045
03:07:12.121 --> 03:07:16.620
There's only one person that I think that I've seen,
uh,
sort of defy that.

3046
03:07:16.621 --> 03:07:21.360
And how was Ryan Joe?
He would not get in that guy's head,
man.

3047
03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:25.350
And uh,
yeah.
Tough as nails.
Yeah.

3048
03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:28.110
Seems like that would be a factor.
But yeah,
you get bread.

3049
03:07:28.111 --> 03:07:31.770
There's just guys like that who were like,
no,
I'm,
I'll die before I quit.

3050
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:35.220
You know,
where it's just simply not an option no matter how deep you go.

3051
03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:39.720
It's crazy.
But yeah,
it's going to quit.
Maybe they'll ask me what to do,

3052
03:07:39.721 --> 03:07:44.160
how to get through buds.
Don't quit.
That's it.
It's crazy.
Mark,

3053
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:48.570
any closing thoughts?
No.
Well,
yeah.
Phew.

3054
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:53.710
Just people with bank one yo to you and all the boys that I served with across

3055
03:07:53.881 --> 03:07:57.830
all the commands that served named mandate,
it was,
it is a brotherhood a while,

3056
03:07:57.920 --> 03:07:59.730
might not have gotten along with all of you.

3057
03:08:00.390 --> 03:08:02.750
Definitely learn something from everyone.
And A,

3058
03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:05.150
it is a brotherhood that you will never replace them.
And,

3059
03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:08.430
and that was an honor to serve alongside those guys.
And then,
um,

3060
03:08:08.431 --> 03:08:13.280
I think the last two was one of my kids.
Uh,
Cameron then,
and Caden,
I mean,

3061
03:08:13.290 --> 03:08:18.290
that is any man's legacy is how you raise your kids and they mean the world to,

3062
03:08:18.580 --> 03:08:23.220
to,
to me.
And then,
uh,
the last person he's changed my life is a,
my fiance,

3063
03:08:23.221 --> 03:08:27.540
which I hope you guys are reserved from the date.
Uh,
Jordan,

3064
03:08:28.030 --> 03:08:30.790
um,
who's changed my perspective on a lot of things and you know,

3065
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:33.810
helped me through a,
uh,
what is not easy for any veteran.

3066
03:08:33.811 --> 03:08:36.840
And that is that that is transitioning out of the military.
And,
uh,

3067
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:39.690
I'll tell you what are positivity is infectious.

3068
03:08:40.170 --> 03:08:43.320
And she calls me out on my,
you know what,

3069
03:08:43.350 --> 03:08:47.430
all the damn time,
she's younger than me and a,

3070
03:08:47.700 --> 03:08:51.000
it's a hit to the ego.
So thanks to uh,
to,

3071
03:08:51.001 --> 03:08:54.210
to that entire group and a bubby gas.
Awesome man.

3072
03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:58.270
<v 0>Well,
like I said,
of course,
thanks for coming on.</v>

3073
03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:02.140
And also like I already said,
and which I can never say enough.

3074
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:06.250
Thanks for your service in the defense of our freedom.

3075
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:10.750
You're talking about all of those deployments over and over and over again,
man.

3076
03:09:10.751 --> 03:09:14.980
Keep going back into the fray.
It's freaking awesome and thank you for doing it.

3077
03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:17.290
And congrats on your retirement.

3078
03:09:17.440 --> 03:09:21.820
I don't know if I ever even said that to you and you're retired,
but it's,
uh,

3079
03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:26.860
I'm glad that you got to be able to retire and it's awesome to be freaking

3080
03:09:26.861 --> 03:09:29.860
working with you again.
So thanks Mike.

3081
03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:32.470
I'm looking forward to many more years.
Thanks brother.

3082
03:09:33.130 --> 03:09:36.910
And everyone else in the military that's still out there holding the line,

3083
03:09:36.911 --> 03:09:40.720
doing those deployments over and over again.
Thank you.

3084
03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:45.850
And to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and border

3085
03:09:45.851 --> 03:09:50.230
patrol and the rest of you that are holding the line here at home.

3086
03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:55.840
Thanks for what you're doing and to your families as well.

3087
03:09:55.870 --> 03:09:59.680
Thank you for supporting those that support us and to the rest of you.

3088
03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:06.370
I know life isn't perfect and I know life can be hard,

3089
03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:09.250
but it is still life

3090
03:10:11.170 --> 03:10:12.430
and it's your life.

3091
03:10:12.580 --> 03:10:17.580
And there are those that have given their lives so that we can have ours.

3092
03:10:20.420 --> 03:10:23.030
So
for them,

3093
03:10:24.890 --> 03:10:29.780
for those heroes,
live a good life,

3094
03:10:31.310 --> 03:10:36.310
live the best life you can by going out there every single day

3095
03:10:41.820 --> 03:10:42.910
and getting after it.

3096
03:10:45.420 --> 03:10:48.310
And until next time,
this is Mike,

3097
03:10:48.610 --> 03:10:51.820
an echo and Jocko out.
