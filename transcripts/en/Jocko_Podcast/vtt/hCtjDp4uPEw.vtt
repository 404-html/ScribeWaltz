00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.160
As you know,
I wrote a book called extreme ownership,

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:06.390
that the opening chapter of the book is a horrible situation with a fratricide

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.990
happens on the battlefield.
So friendly forces,
killing friendly forces,

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.200
some of those forces being mine.
And you know,
it,

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.900
it's all these people I could blame and all these little incidents that happened

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:19.860
that I could have said,
well,
you know,

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.070
we had this radio cryptographic change that happened in the middle of operation

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.180
and it had people weren't able to talk to each other and we had these Iraqis

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.440
that we didn't speak English.

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.130
So we had these units that we hadn't worked with before and they did things that

11
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.360
we didn't expect and there's plenty of blame to go around.
And,
and uh,

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.260
essentially I said,
hey,
you know who's fault this is,
this is my fault.

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.860
I'm the commander.
And so when I hear you say things like that,

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.130
it strikes me that you uncovered this through your study of history and,

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.430
and philosophy and religion.
And I learned it,
you know,

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.890
as like I said,
a certified knuckle dragger out on the battlefield that realized,

17
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.260
you know,
if you're going to exist as a leader and as a human,

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.810
then you need to take responsibility for what happens around you.

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.970
And that's again,
I have to

20
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.080
<v 1>take,
well,
the religious notion in some senses that you have to take ultimate</v>

21
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:18.060
responsibility in that in some sense,
the things that happen around you.
I mean,

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.923
this is

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
Dostoyevsky I think said something like every man is responsible for everything

24
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:28.260
that happens to him and everything that happens to everyone else.
And that's,

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
you know,
that,
that's,
that's uh,
it's a crazy statement,
right?

26
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.750
It's a crazy statement.
And he was a pretty extreme person in many,
many ways,

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.920
but there's a level at which that's metaphysically true,
you know,

28
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.590
because what happens is that it's,

29
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.090
it's failure to act often that's the most catastrophic,
you know?

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
I mean it's,
it's,
it's to not do the right thing when the,

31
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.390
when the situation presents itself and it's very specific.

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.261
You know,

33
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:03.120
you're constantly in situations where you could do the right thing.

34
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.150
If you are willing to take a risk that's actually a relatively moderate size.

35
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.330
And you know that you could take the risk and you know that you should take the

36
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.810
risk and you don't.
And that happens to people all the time.

37
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.250
And then what happens is the thing that they didn't oppose grows a little bit

38
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.110
and they shrink a little bit and that starts a loop pay.
And so,

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.000
and you say,
well how do you take responsibility for the world?
And the answer is,

40
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.181
well,

41
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.360
you also have to do it with a certain degree of humility because what do you

42
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.300
know?
You know,
and,

43
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.490
and this is part of the reason that I'm so opposed to the activist culture on

44
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.600
college campuses.

45
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.520
You don't teach 18 year olds to go and demonstrate about capitalism,
you know,

46
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:46.290
because they don't know anything.

47
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.770
And they have problems in their own life that need to be solved,
that are local.

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.850
And the local problems aren't trivial.
You know,
they're not disciplined,

49
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.060
they're there.
They're not looking at the world in a straight way.

50
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:01.000
They're not taking responsibility for or for their actions,

51
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.800
their sexual actions among others.

52
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.440
They're not taking responsibility for their family.

53
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.840
They're not looking at how they could contribute to the community.

54
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.270
They don't understand the fact that they don't know anything.

55
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.780
And so they should be taught to start locally and to put things together that

56
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.680
they could put together,
you know,

57
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.790
to make their bed and to clean up the room and to attend their classes with

58
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.000
regularity if they're going to university because that's part of the implicit

59
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.834
contract.

60
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.250
And to straighten up the things around them that are actually within their power

61
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.460
to straighten up.
And then what happens is that if you do that,

62
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.500
let's say religiously,

63
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.410
which I suppose would be the same as in a discipline manner,

64
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.660
that your realm of influence starts to grow,
but it grows in a positive way.

65
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.940
Just like you can go,
you can take,

66
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.730
you can end up in hell one step at a time,

67
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.400
and that's extraordinarily well documented.

68
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.640
You can end up at the opposite place of that one step at a time.

69
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.960
But it's also that same gradual process.

70
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.020
You don't get to leap from being a 17 year old,

71
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.280
not head who doesn't know anything and who isn't disciplined to the critic of

72
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.030
Judeo Christian society.
You just don't know enough to do that.

73
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.420
Especially when you can look at your own life and think about how many things

74
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.600
that you're doing that you know are wrong,
that you could fix,

75
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.060
that you aren't fixing.
And that's the crucial thing.
It's,
it's this isn't this,

76
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.000
this mode of thinking isn't asking people to stretch themselves beyond what

77
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:25.870
they're capable of.

78
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.340
It's just asking them to stretch themselves to the point that they are capable

79
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.850
of and seeing what happens.
And that works.
It works.

80
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.470
I've had many people write me over the last year and this is a great thing,

81
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.610
really.
It's a great thing.
Who said that they stopped,
started to tell the truth,

82
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.580
or at least not to lie,
because who can tell the truth?
Right?

83
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.290
But at least you can not lie.

84
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.370
And that they started to put things in order around them that they could put an

85
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.970
order in that,
you know,
the Po positive things just started to happen,

86
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:58.900
like mad and they're not nihilistic and they've got a purpose in their life.

87
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:02.350
And so,
you know,
thank God for that.
And it does work.
