00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.510
This is Jocko podcast number 17 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.200
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.760
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.020
<v 0>it's been 10 years since April 2nd,</v>

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.020
2006 10 years since those of us in fourth platoon huddled around the radio

6
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.230
outside of an Iraqi army post near Camp Ramadi,

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.590
trying to make sense of the confused and uncertain radio traffic of the exos

8
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:34.861
calm and from voice from the coc trying to determine what truck had been hit and

9
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.324
who was missing

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.410
10 years since we drove the road back towards the Gulf center with fear in our

11
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:49.411
minds and hate in our hearts knowing we had lost close friends,

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.060
but not yet sure of the names.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.280
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.280
<v 0>10 years since I met my platoon commander on the dark and steps of the Gov</v>

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.220
Center as he came down from the COC and confirmed which truck it had been and

16
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.960
when I pressed for who was gone,

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.640
he simply said all of them.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.820
We hadn't yet learned that one guy who was a fucking hard ass who wasn't going

19
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.480
to let death take another marine that day and who's recovery has been an

20
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.180
inspiration to all those men who know him.

21
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.140
10 years since I did my best to pass the word to my team with steadfastness,

22
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.740
but repeating all of them,

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.250
revealing me for the 20 year one year old,

24
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.510
I was through the tiers.
I was trying to hold back

25
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.850
10 years of trying to figure out what their sacrifice meant of shifting views on

26
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.060
what it was.
All four in the end.

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.090
That is something that is still a struggle,

28
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.680
but I've found solace and purpose in these facts.

29
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.320
Staff Sergeant Eric Macintosh,

30
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.840
Corporal Scott Procopio,
Lance Corporal Kuhn,

31
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.470
young Kim and hospital men.

32
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.500
Giovanni Pedea were men who chose to be part of something bigger than

33
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:31.490
themselves.
Men who chose to enter a profession of crushingly hard work,

34
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.590
sacrifice and danger,

35
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.740
all for the simple purpose of protecting the men around them.

36
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.260
Staff Sergeant Mac was the epitome of a fighting marine,

37
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690
a stud who exuded proficiency and professionalism while also being humorous and

38
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:52.100
approachable.
Procopio is without a doubt,

39
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.570
one of the finest men I've ever had the fortune of meeting a beast of a marine

40
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.280
who drove all around him with his and good nature.

41
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.140
While we were peers,
I looked up to him and his natural leadership.

42
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.060
I still do.

43
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.460
Kim had a quiet reliability about him,

44
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.160
unlike the usual loud gregariousness that people tend to associate with grunts.

45
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.610
He was low key and dependable and for some reason I can still see the way a

46
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:27.300
smile would creep over his face when stupid shit was going on and he laugh in a

47
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:32.250
way that made it seem like he was seeing a deeper joke that you didn't get yet.

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
Doc,
the Dia was new to the company and my memories of him are vague,

49
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.890
but the men who knew him better describe a young corpsman who is enthusiastic

50
00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.190
about that his job.

51
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.890
The funny thing with Korman is that sometimes you don't need to know much to

52
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:56.510
judge their character besides the fact that these young men volunteered for one

53
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.490
specific duty to save the lives of their marines in combat.

54
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.570
A more honorable calling is hard to find.

55
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.460
It's easy for today to be dark,

56
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.540
to get sucked into the trap of loss,
regret,

57
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.400
depression and anger.

58
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.700
It's easy to drown it in liquor under the pretense of having one for the boys.

59
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.750
But this morning as we prepare ourselves to face the 10th of these days,

60
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.840
we think of Scott and his booming laugh.

61
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.020
He wouldn't want us sitting around morning like saps,
wasting our precious days,

62
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.760
burdened with his death,

63
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.170
like tormented widows out of some 19th century romance fiction.

64
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.910
He'd remind us that we all joined up for the same reasons.

65
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.383
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.240
<v 0>we are infantry marines.</v>

67
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.100
We wanted to fight to energetically meet the enemy in battle and crushed him

68
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600
to serve be beside men with whom we would build a bond stronger than most we'll

69
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.564
ever know.

70
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.750
While the politics are complicated and the outcomes unclear,

71
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.970
one thing is certain,

72
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.700
their sacrifice was not in vain

73
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.110
as it was the sacrifice that warriors make for each other.

74
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.350
April 2nd is a day that defines us now brings us together as brothers.

75
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.920
It is a day of remembrance and reflection

76
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.520
a day that gives us reason to look at our lives and say,

77
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.500
look,
you son of a bitch.
This is why you have to live life to the fullest.

78
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.400
This is why you must fight every day to be a better man.

79
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.660
And then we must just remember that Scott Procopio would call you a pussy for

80
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.510
doing the opposite.
Semper fi,
gents.

81
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.090
We will never forget you.

82
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.880
So that was a post.

83
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.470
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

84
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 0>that someone forwarded to me that was on reddit</v>

85
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.510
and it was from an anonymous marine.

86
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
Obviously this marine was from the three eight marines who we served with in

87
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.920
Ramadi who were

88
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.670
just outstanding warriors.

89
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.090
And I thought that that tribute

90
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.480
not only to the fallen,

91
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.230
but also a form of council

92
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.860
to his fellow marines.

93
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

94
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.430
<v 0>I just thought that that was a amazing piece of writing and I wanted to share it</v>

95
00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:06.264
with everyone

96
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.863
<v 2>April 2nd.</v>

97
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.780
Now,
speaking of Ramadi,

98
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.023
which

99
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.300
<v 0>you know,
just like this marine,</v>

100
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.660
it's something that I think about all the time and something that I refer back

101
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.710
to in a couple podcasts ago.
We talked about the band of brothers,

102
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.270
the first of the five Oh six who we also served with in Ramadi

103
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.910
<v 2>and
it is a</v>

104
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.200
<v 0>but truly hallowed unit and if you've seen the HBO mini series band of brothers,</v>

105
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.760
just a fantastic memorial and representation of these American fighting men and

106
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.820
the leader of that group or one of the,

107
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.880
one of the leaders of easy company and then of the battalion was a guy by the

108
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:12.750
name of major dick winters and

109
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.520
he wrote after after his,

110
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.610
after he came famous really from the first book by Steven Ambrose called Band of

111
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:28.911
brothers and then the mini series came out called band of brothers.

112
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.490
He wrote a book which is called beyond band of brothers,

113
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.370
the war memoirs of Major Dick Winters.

114
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.313
<v 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.990
<v 0>I got to this book basically because I was going to do band of brothers,</v>

116
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.200
the Stephen Ambrose,
but as everybody knows or if you don't know,

117
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.680
I like to get the source of material from the people that were there,

118
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.340
Steven amorous as a historian and so I identified this book as I was researching

119
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.710
more deeply into band of brothers.
I very quickly found this book,
ordered it,

120
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.830
and yeah,
there's no doubt.

121
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.010
So
want me to kick this off?

122
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.660
As battalion operations officer Hester pointed to where an enemy machine gun was

123
00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:37.661
located in approximately where a four gun battery of one oh fives was situated.

124
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.440
That was all he knew.
Captain Hester turned to me and said,

125
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.800
there's fire along that hedge road there.
Take care of it.

126
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.530
That was the sum of my orders.
No detailed battle plan,
no intelligence,

127
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:55.820
summery,
nothing but a specific tasks to be accomplished without delay.

128
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.540
Easy Company's mission was to silence the battery.

129
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.880
And we talk about the basic principles of combat.
One of them is simple,
clear,

130
00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:09.490
concise.
There you go.
That's your orders.

131
00:10:09.491 --> 00:10:11.890
There's fire long that hedge row take care of it.

132
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.840
And this is also obviously an unbelievable example of decentralized command.

133
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.380
You go solve this problem.
And his response is,

134
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:24.820
I got it back to the book conducting a mental estimate of the situation.

135
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:29.821
I viewed any infantry assault on the battery as a high risk opportunity since

136
00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:34.150
our air forces had failed to destroy the artillery battery in the preliminary

137
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.610
bombardment prior to the seaborne invasion.

138
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.930
Our key would be initiative and immediate appraisal of the situation,

139
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.880
skillful use of the terrain and our ability to destroy one gun at a time.

140
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.420
So you'll notice he's going to,
he's already,

141
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.490
as soon as he knows that there's multiple guns.
What does he decide to do?

142
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.220
One gun at a time,
solve one problem at a time,

143
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.340
a little something we like to call it prioritize and execute.

144
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.830
The first thing I did was have everybody drop all equipment except ammunition

145
00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:10.831
and grenades for that was all we would need if things went from good to bad to

146
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:12.780
get rid of the things you don't need.

147
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.510
Focus on this one task that we've got right now.

148
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:17.970
It's another prioritize and execute order right there.

149
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.290
While the noncommissioned officers prepared the men for the assault,

150
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.470
I conducted a hasty reconnaissance of the enemy position,

151
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.180
a leader gains and advantage in combat if he's able to appraise the terrain and

152
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:34.470
the situation quickly and correctly.
Crawling along the hedge row,

153
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.380
I moved to a position where I could get a better view of the enemy position.

154
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.860
The guns appeared to be set in the trench and the head row in the hedge row

155
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.980
covered by machine gun fire from across an open pasture.

156
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.080
The battery was firing directly down causeway number two in a direction of Utah

157
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:53.190
beach where the initial waves of the fourth infantry division,

158
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.190
we're already landing.

159
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.430
So you've got these German guns in an elevated position hammering Utah Beach

160
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.270
where the Fourth Infantry Division is trying to land right now.
It's a nightmare.

161
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.850
Anticipating that it would be too costly to conduct a frontal attack across an

162
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:10.750
open field.

163
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.610
I determined our chances of success would be greatly enhanced if we could hit

164
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:19.060
the enemy on the flank and silence one gun at a time,

165
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.460
hit the enemy on the flank.
Again,

166
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.640
these are basic principles and I hate calling.

167
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.430
I hate using the word basic because it's fundamentals.

168
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.840
There's nothing basic about it.
It's basic,
but it's,
it's beautiful,

169
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.610
beautiful in its simplicity.

170
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.180
Returning to the company,

171
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:45.181
I assigned specific missions to each man so everybody knows what their task is

172
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:48.790
going to be.
First I placed one of easy companies,

173
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:52.180
two machine guns in a position where they could provide covering fire.

174
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:56.290
As we move carefully into position covering move,
cover and move.

175
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.800
Next I divided our detachment into two units,

176
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:04.801
one led by Lieutenant Buck Compton and the other remaining with me Compton move

177
00:13:06.441 --> 00:13:10.930
down one hedge row with Sergeant Garnier and Malarkey to get as close to the

178
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:12.820
first gun in the battery as possible.

179
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:17.821
Why led my unit down a parallel hedgerow Compton also sent sergeants,

180
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:23.851
Lipton and rainy to come to a concealed position to put flanking fire on the

181
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:28.840
enemy while my detachment crawl Ducote cross the open field to approach the gun

182
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:29.350
first.

183
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.060
So you've got multiple cover and move situations going on right now and again to

184
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.970
the,
to the military folks that are listening to this,

185
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.710
you could breeze through this description and and miss how important that is.

186
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.540
How important and what a great example of cover moved.

187
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:46.570
This is got to put down that cover fire.

188
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.910
You got to put down that cover fire and that's why you've got to bring them

189
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:53.740
heavy weapons out there.
Bring those AWS out boys.
Lots of them.

190
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.370
When my group back to the book,
when my group consisting of Corporal Joe Toy,

191
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.810
Pfc Robert,

192
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.700
Popeye win and private Gerald the rain from regimental headquarters reached the

193
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:10.120
hedge that led to the enemy position.
We stopped here.

194
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:13.600
I placed a second machine gun to engage the first gun that was firing point

195
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:14.440
blank at us.

196
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.040
I gave the gunner instructions not to fire unless he saw definite target so he

197
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.540
would not give away his position.

198
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.110
Then we worked our way up to Compton's hedge row here.

199
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:26.620
I spotted a German helmet and squeezed off two rounds later.

200
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:28.510
I found a pool of blood at this position,

201
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.080
but no Jerry and Jerry's term for German.

202
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.670
Next I sent Compton with two men along the hedge to throw hand grenades at the

203
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:39.550
enemy position while the rest of us supported him with covering fire.

204
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.760
These guys don't do anything without covering fire.

205
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.990
I fired occasionally to fill spots when there was a lull in the covering fire

206
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.770
due to putting in new clips.

207
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.790
Compton took too long getting his detachment into position and we spent more

208
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:59.990
ammunition than we should have,
but in return,
we receive no enemy fire.

209
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.730
So that covering fire,
even though it took too long,
but,

210
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.980
but they didn't receive any enemy fire because they were laying down that fire.

211
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:12.020
They were laying down that call covering fire just as Compton was ready to hurl

212
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:12.711
his grenades.

213
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.790
I started across the field with the rest of the assault team so that what we

214
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:20.930
jumped into position together as the grenade exploded simultaneously,

215
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:24.650
we hurdle additional grenades at the next position.
In return,

216
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:28.460
we received substantial small arms fire and grenades from the enemy.

217
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.100
As we approached the first gun,

218
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Popeye wind was hitting the button and fell down in the trench rather than

219
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:41.000
complaining that he was hit.
He apologized.
I'm sorry,
Lieutenant.

220
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.280
I goofed.
I goofed.
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:44.930
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

222
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.160
<v 0>my God.
It's beautiful.</v>

223
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:50.720
When you think of a guy who is so dedicated to his company that he apologizes

224
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:53.870
for getting hit.
Now.
Here was a soldier,

225
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.210
he hit by enemy fire in Normandy on d day behind German lines and he's more

226
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:04.280
upset that he led his buddies down.
Then he was concerned with his own injury.

227
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.860
Popeye's action.
Popeye's actions spoke for all of us.

228
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.470
Now I'm fast forwarding a little bit too.
They get these,

229
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.500
they get these guns taken down with the entire battery now destroyed.

230
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.030
We now withdrew because the machine gun fire that we were receiving from the

231
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.100
Manor House and other positions remained intense.

232
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.060
I pulled our own machine guns out first.
Then the rifleman,

233
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.580
I was last to leave and as I was leaving I took a final look down the trench and

234
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:41.480
there was one wounded Jerry trying to put a machine gun onto,
into operation.

235
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.430
I drilled him through the head.
On our way back.
I came across Warren,

236
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:48.590
officer j g Andrew Hill,

237
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.000
who had been killed working his way up to help us in all.

238
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:58.270
We had suffered for dead six wounded and we had inflicted 15 dead in 12 captured

239
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:02.390
enemy German forces in the vicinity.
The battery had outnumber,

240
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.420
had numbered about 50 about three hours passed since I had received the order to

241
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:09.080
dispose the battery.

242
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.343
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

243
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.550
<v 0>and then so they,
they take care of that.</v>

244
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:18.551
They conduct some other smaller operations and then it goes to the sort of the

245
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.790
end of d day.
At long last d day was over.

246
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.780
Our success had been to suburb leadership at all levels and the training we had

247
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:31.640
experienced prior to the invasion,

248
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.570
add luck to the equation and easy company comprised a formidable team on

249
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:40.730
reflection.
We were highly charged.

250
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.890
We knew what to do and we conducted ourselves as part of a well oiled machine

251
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.010
because we were so intimate with each.

252
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.500
I knew the strengths of each of my troopers.

253
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.740
This is something that he refers back to a lot,

254
00:17:55.741 --> 00:18:00.390
was really understanding his men and what they were like,
what drove them,

255
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.390
what their strengths and weaknesses were so he could put them in the correct

256
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:04.230
positions.

257
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.670
Evening allowed us a few minutes of quiet reflection with our outposts in place.

258
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.580
I stretched out to catch a few hours of sleep,

259
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.870
even though the rattle of German small arms fire continued throughout the night

260
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.590
before I dozed off.

261
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.580
I did not forget to get on my knees and thank God for helping me live through

262
00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:31.090
this day and to ask his help on d plus one

263
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.270
I would live this war one day at a time and I promised myself that if I

264
00:18:37.271 --> 00:18:38.104
survived,

265
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.540
I would find a small farm somewhere in Pennsylvania countryside and spend the

266
00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:47.260
remainder of my life in quiet and peace.

267
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.803
Now.

268
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.870
<v 2>Okay,</v>

269
00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:01.300
<v 0>you're going to you as you,
as you hear about Dick Winners and that's I,</v>

270
00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:04.910
I wanted to cover at least one engagement on actual engagement and that's,

271
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.800
that's one of them.
So you can kind of see the methodology,
the,

272
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.020
the principles that he's putting into action.
But you know,

273
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:16.130
I want to concentrate not so much on the action now,
but more on the leadership,

274
00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:19.230
the leadership pieces of it,
although they're still be,

275
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.980
I still do talk about some of the,

276
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:27.430
some of the combat situations that they get into because they were in a war,

277
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.050
but I want to check in going back a little bit from where he came from,

278
00:19:33.051 --> 00:19:36.920
what his mindset,
what developed it and he,
he says this,

279
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.300
I had a wonderful mother,
very conservative.

280
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.680
She came from a Mennonite family but never converted to that faith.

281
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.050
Honesty and discipline were driven into my head from day one.

282
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.610
At some point,
am I just going to have to stop?
Like even accenting these things,

283
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.570
these common themes that are just run through these,

284
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.970
these leaders?
Not surprisingly,

285
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.590
I'm mother was undoubtedly one of the most influential people in my life.

286
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.230
A mother takes a child,
she nurtures him,

287
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.480
she instills disciplined and she teaches respect.
My,

288
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.280
this is my mother was the first one up every morning.

289
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.210
She prepared breakfast for my sister and in me and she was the last one to bed

290
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:36.180
every evening.
In many respects.

291
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.210
She was the ideal company commander and subconsciously I'm sure I patterned my

292
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:45.330
own leadership abilities on this remarkable woman.

293
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.210
So it's interesting he all he talked about was that she was the first one to

294
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:54.270
work and she was the last one to leave work meetings.

295
00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:56.530
She was the first one up in the morning and she was the last one to leave.

296
00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.780
And with that statement alone,
he said that she's the ideal company commander.

297
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.930
Now for those of you that aren't in the military,
a company commander is,

298
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.520
is there's several companies in a battalion,
there could be three,
maybe four,

299
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.140
maybe even five,
depending on the task organization,
but it's,
it's a hundred,

300
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.380
maybe 150 guys generally in a,
in a company.

301
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.330
So he's saying that this,

302
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.830
that his mom would be a ideal company commander.
Why?

303
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.460
Because she wakes up early and has a lot of discipline.

304
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.920
Newsflash,
now

305
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.170
speaking of,
yeah,
I won't read any more actions.
Here's another action.

306
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.350
I positioned men on both sides of the road and prepared to move out in order to

307
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:48.400
secure the intersection.
So here they are on a move.
They've got a secure,

308
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:49.330
an inter intersection.

309
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.190
Lieutenant Welsh led first platoon at the head of the company column precisely

310
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:58.300
on schedule.
I hollered Welsh,
move out.
Just as the attack started,

311
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.480
a German machine gun located in a building at the foot of the hill,

312
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:02.800
started to fire up the road.

313
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.250
The German gun crew was in perfect position at the perfect time to wipe out our

314
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:12.430
entire attack from the left hand side of the road.

315
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.150
Welsh pushed six men towards the intersection.

316
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.970
They went straight at that intersection and the enemy machine gun.

317
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.940
The enemy fire,
however,
was very effective.

318
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.330
Our men on both sides of the road kept low profiles in the ditches,

319
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.400
had heads down and they frozen place leaving Welsh and his six men assaulting

320
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:34.960
the intersection alone

321
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.030
to my rear colonel.
Strayer and his staff,

322
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:43.030
including Captain Hester and Nixon could see what was happening.

323
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.830
They in turn were hollering at me,
get them moving winters,
get them moving.

324
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.590
I struggled out of my harness to rid myself of excess equipment so that I could

325
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:57.430
run.
Since it was obvious what needed to be done.

326
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.040
So guess what?
People aren't moving.

327
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.880
People aren't taking action and it's obvious to him what needs to be done.

328
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.150
Standing in the middle of the column on the right hand side of the road,

329
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:11.890
I hollered,
move out,
move out.
This did no good.
Everyone had his head's down.

330
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.070
This was the one and only time in the war that I really blew my top and

331
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:19.720
physically kicked ass.

332
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.890
I came out of that ditch with only my m one in hand and hollering.

333
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.520
I ran to the head of the column,
kicked ass on the left side of the road,

334
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:29.620
then ran to the right side of the road,
back and forth,

335
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:32.350
screaming at my top of my voice.
Get going.

336
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.420
I will never forget the surprise and fear on those faces looking up at me with

337
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:39.640
me running around on the road like a wild man.

338
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.930
The machine gunner seem to zero in on me.
I was a wide open target.

339
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:49.650
The bullets snapped by and glanced off the road all around me for shirt.

340
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:53.300
Short time I had the feeling of being blessed.

341
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.470
That feeling didn't last too long for hours to find out in a few minutes that I

342
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:58.700
wasn't so blessed.

343
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.250
And the reason I highlighted that section right there,
because in the next,

344
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:10.670
literally the next page in the book,
you know,
you get this idea,

345
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:11.620
and again this is this,

346
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.950
the idea that people have of military leaders is that they're these hard ass

347
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:19.190
guys and these kick ass guys that are running around and yelling like what I

348
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.024
just read

349
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.890
and that I wanted to highlight that because now we fast forward one page in the

350
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:27.734
book,

351
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.940
in taking the intersection,

352
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.300
easy companies sustain 10 casualties among our wounded were sergeant Lipton,

353
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.590
Ed Tipper and Burst Smith.
Another casualty was private.

354
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.510
Albert bleive who was in the aid station sitting with his back against the wall

355
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:50.870
when I entered to have my wound cleaned because by the way,

356
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.580
major winners got to hit.
And so he's in there getting his a wound clean.

357
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.620
Now he's looking at private life and he says,
and he says here,

358
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.000
I did not notice any wounds.
So I asked how you're doing life?

359
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.230
I can't see.
I can't see.
He replied.

360
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.540
I remember trying to comfort him by saying,
it's okay.
Be Life,
relax.

361
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.630
We'll have you out of here as soon and they'll send you back to England.

362
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.610
As I started to move away,
blight stood up suddenly saying,
I'm okay.

363
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.530
I'm okay.
I can see now.

364
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.200
As soon as blight regained his vision,
he immediately returned to duty.

365
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.240
If you think about that for a minute,
that boy had been paralyzed by fear,

366
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.500
yet he had the guts and dedication to stick to his buddies and easy company.

367
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:45.270
As soon as he relaxed and pulled himself together,
he returned to the front.

368
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.270
Rather than taking the easy way out with an evacuation,

369
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.000
sometimes all a soldier needed was a calm voice,

370
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.850
reassuring him that everything was fine.

371
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.430
In [inaudible] case,
he rejoined the company and it was wounded in action.

372
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.060
During the upcoming fight after World War II,

373
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.950
he served in the hundred 87th airborne regiment and the Korean War where he was

374
00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:13.560
awarded a Silver Star and the bronze star,

375
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:19.550
by the time he retired from military service life was a company first sergeant.

376
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.690
So the contrast there is that,
you know,

377
00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:28.800
instead of pulling a general George Patton and slapping the guy around and

378
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:31.500
saying,
you're not wounded,
get he realized what he needed to do,

379
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.990
which was just with the guy and say,
hey listen,
everything's gonna be all right.

380
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.650
We'll get you on a plane,
we'll get you back to England.
Just just take it easy.

381
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.340
Here's a section that I'm just going to jump too quickly.

382
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.960
When he's talking about the confusion,

383
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:50.610
getting in the confusion and getting our men into position was as bad as we were

384
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:51.480
to ever see.

385
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.430
One time I found easy company troops firing into troops of another battalion.

386
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.720
Later we had some tank show up for support and they began firing into our own

387
00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:07.140
line.
So that's blue on blue,

388
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.600
it's fratricide and you know,

389
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.760
we talk about it in our book and it's one of those things that they usually

390
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:17.880
don't show it.

391
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.900
They usually don't portray it because it's hard to believe that things can get

392
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:24.510
that confusing,
but they do

393
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.510
and it goes all the way back

394
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.110
and clear example right there.

395
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.630
Now we're going back to blight.

396
00:27:37.631 --> 00:27:42.631
And this is an interesting commentary on training on one of our daylight patrols

397
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.380
led by Sergeant Garnier blight was point man when he spotted a German sniper and

398
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:53.770
a tree
just as he did in training,

399
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.980
he automatically said Bang,
Bang,

400
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.540
instead of dropping to the side of the road and putting his rifle on the sniper.

401
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.620
So if you can imagine you're back in America or that when they were doing their

402
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:07.140
pre pre uh,

403
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.900
attack training in England and they weren't using real bullets,

404
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.360
so they're out on a patrol and if they saw something and go bang,
Bang,

405
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.410
well that's literally what the guy did.

406
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.220
The German reacted first and shop life through the collarbone,

407
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.050
the rest of the patrol,

408
00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:27.160
recovered life and then withdrew to easy la easiest lines.

409
00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.090
So again,
military people that are listening,

410
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.100
law enforcement,

411
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.270
you train how you fight and you fight how you trade.

412
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.840
So you just got to keep that in mind all the time.

413
00:28:40.841 --> 00:28:45.190
If you're giving yourself some kind of a training scar by doing something like a

414
00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:48.730
lip gun.
We actually did this in seal team lip gun was what we called it.

415
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.320
Embarrassing.
You know they my early days,
that's what we,

416
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.510
we didn't have a choice like what you make sound like your mouth.
Yeah.

417
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.550
Thank [inaudible] and you know,

418
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.300
thankfully now they have Brino unbelievable good systems.

419
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.600
You know the paint ball type systems that go in are real guns,

420
00:29:04.601 --> 00:29:08.980
the laser tag type systems so we don't have to use lip guns

421
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.480
back to the book.

422
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.650
Next sector success breeds confidence and easy company.

423
00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:25.380
Success in Normandy instilled the confidence that they would need to succeed and

424
00:29:25.381 --> 00:29:26.940
live to fight another day.

425
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.720
At the same time I could not help but think that had I trained the men harder,

426
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.140
if I had done a better job,
maybe more of my men would come home.

427
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.940
That's something that a leader is always going to be thinking.

428
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.300
Always going to be thinking that what could we have done better?

429
00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:52.560
What could I have done better?
Now they,

430
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.800
they get back to England,
they're taking a break.

431
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.850
They get pulled off the line and he's back in Al and Alice born.

432
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.100
He's just talking about,

433
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.680
he sort of reflecting back on his initial push into Europe

434
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.651
and you know,

435
00:30:10.651 --> 00:30:15.651
you got guys that are out drinking and doing whatever they're doing and he says,

436
00:30:15.811 --> 00:30:18.480
as for myself,
I relaxed.
The Best I could.

437
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.300
Combat had made me tense,

438
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.770
particularly since my decisions now meant life or death to the members of my

439
00:30:25.771 --> 00:30:26.604
command.

440
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.340
Commanding soldiers in combat requires a personal detachment from the men

441
00:30:32.341 --> 00:30:35.310
themselves.
In a sense,

442
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.040
command is the loneliest job in the world.

443
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:44.550
Looking at myself in the mirror,
I could see how much I had changed.

444
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.630
I could sense it.

445
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.000
Another thing that affected me was the importance of discipline,

446
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.220
the necessity of instilling discipline in my troops and getting the job done in

447
00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.054
combat.

448
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.910
In an attempt to escape the tension that combat had caused,

449
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I developed a heavier than usual exercise regimen and I attended church on a

450
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:13.090
regular basis.

451
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.460
There were only a few days that I didn't run two to three miles,
do 80 pushups,

452
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.420
60 setups on a foot locker that a couple of splits and some leg and trunk

453
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:26.590
exercises after the day's work was over.
As a result,

454
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.460
I kept in pretty good shape,
not what I'd call wrestling shape,

455
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.080
but good enough for army work.

456
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.030
Physical activity kept me mentally alert,

457
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.850
built my endurance and kept me supple.

458
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.180
You gotta do it.
You got to have that discipline and you've got to work out.

459
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.670
You got to do it every day.
It's that important.

460
00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.080
<v 3>Yeah.
You see how he mentioned how it kept him mentally sharp?
It absolutely does.</v>

461
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.850
Yeah.
It's it.
That'd be four.
We're,
that's,

462
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.300
that's one of the few things that you can do that affects everything.

463
00:32:05.301 --> 00:32:09.700
Everything in life.
Yeah.
You are correct.
I think people a lot of time in,

464
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:13.250
in regards to the exercise,
people think,
well,
exercise,

465
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.810
that's for a certain kind of person.
You know,

466
00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:18.890
maybe a fitness person or something like that.
It's for a dumb jock,
right.

467
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.400
If a smart person,
so I'm not going to exercise or wrong answer.
Yeah.

468
00:32:22.401 --> 00:32:24.890
I think nowadays people are more hip to it for sure.
But um,

469
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.890
did you say hip hitmen yeah.
Down Down with the cause.
The new stuff.
Yeah.

470
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.670
Yeah.
But yeah,
it is.
Um,

471
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.670
it's interesting how these leaders back then they knew that Yup.

472
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.100
Even though there's been no,
even though at that

473
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.420
<v 0>time there'd been no scientific study there,</v>

474
00:32:42.421 --> 00:32:45.950
scientific studies now that prove it,
he didn't know that.
He just knew it.

475
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.070
He felt that he lived it.
You lived it,
you know,

476
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.280
now they're in a position.
Now again,

477
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:56.360
I'm just fast forward.

478
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.660
And even though I said it wasn't gonna cover too much of the combat I'm covering

479
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:02.690
the combat it give the combat is what is what puts these people in these

480
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:03.710
leadership positions.

481
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.560
Lee Combat is the ultimate teacher,
the harshest teacher.

482
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.860
And it teaches you lessons that you do not forget.

483
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.790
So there are around this village of Foi,

484
00:33:17.791 --> 00:33:22.770
which is a village that was held by the Germans and they'd been waiting and

485
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.990
you'd been,
you'd been awhile and hears,

486
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.810
winter's talking about here's winters talking about his troops.

487
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.750
They were now completely exhausted.
They had had no hot food.

488
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.580
Little sleep,
no rest,
constant tension and the pressure of combat.

489
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.860
The worst time was night when temperatures plummeted and fog covered the

490
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:52.290
battlefield until mid to late morning.

491
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:57.930
The uncertainty of what lay just yards ahead in the next tree lawn was

492
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:02.670
sufficient to break ordinary men.
Not surprisingly,

493
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.100
the men became physically exhausted.

494
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.840
Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion,

495
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:13.500
which in turn causes men to lose discipline.

496
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.690
Loss of self discipline then produces combat fatigue.

497
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.560
Self-Disciplined keeps a soldier doing his job

498
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:25.840
without it.

499
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.340
He loses his pride and he loses the importance of self respect and the eyes of

500
00:34:30.341 --> 00:34:31.780
his fellow soldiers.

501
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.730
It is pride that keeps a soldier going and keeps him in the fight.

502
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.340
This is what I feared.

503
00:34:39.341 --> 00:34:43.360
I would lose the loss of will to measure up to my men.

504
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.300
After seeing others breakdown,

505
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.860
you wondered who is next and you started taking a hard look at yourself.

506
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.770
I often wondered why I didn't break under the strain of combat.

507
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.140
One factor undoubtedly lay in the fact that my battalion headquarters lay 75

508
00:35:07.141 --> 00:35:09.810
yards behind the Ford foxholes.

509
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.120
No longer was I under enemy observation.
Consequently,

510
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.350
I was able to concentrate on my duties without fear of enemies,
small arms fire.

511
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.970
Another factor was undoubtedly my physical conditioning.

512
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.290
I don't think there was a man in the battalion who is in better physical shape

513
00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.124
than I was.

514
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.310
My responsibility to ensure the safety of the soldiers also hardened me to cope

515
00:35:35.311 --> 00:35:37.080
with the daily stress of combat.

516
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.230
One last observation on combat fatigue.

517
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.600
When you see a man break,

518
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.870
he usually slams his helmet down and messes up his hair.

519
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.690
I don't know if it's conscious or unconscious,

520
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.280
but a soldier goes to his head and massages.

521
00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.310
His head shakes it and then he's gone.
You can talk to him all you want,

522
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.970
but he cannot hear you when he reaches that point.

523
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.510
The best thing for everybody is just to let him take a walk.

524
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.870
Combat exhaustion occurs instantaneously.

525
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.620
You don't plan to become a combat fatigue casualty.

526
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.180
How do you prevent combat fatigue?

527
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.980
You talked to your troops and make some excuse to pull a soldier off the front

528
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:24.750
line.
Of course,

529
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.110
pulling a soldier off the front line increases the stress of those who remain,

530
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.810
but as a necessary trade.
Off,

531
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.580
I often asked a soldier whom I saw on the verge of a breakdown,

532
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.920
how about coming back with me to the CP to help out for a couple of days in this

533
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:41.341
manner.

534
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:45.600
You invent a reason for pulling a guy from the line without damaging his psyche.

535
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.833
<v 1>So</v>

536
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.730
<v 0>bunch of stuff there on combat fatigue and,</v>

537
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.510
and I'm not saying that you're going to see combat fatigue and in the civilian

538
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:02.310
world,
I mean,
but you do see people get stressed out in business.

539
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.500
And I thought that that comment about people messing up their hair and grabbing

540
00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:11.310
their head,
that's a,
that's a really good indicator of when people are,

541
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.200
are breaking.
And I'll tell you one of the things,

542
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:20.130
this is something that we talk about the book as well as for us,

543
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.670
the guys that had

544
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.060
the most resistance to combat fatigue with the guys that were most integrally

545
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.340
involved in the planning of the operations because they felt like they had some

546
00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:38.980
control.
And unfortunately for us,
we didn't know this.

547
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.040
So we had guys that weren't involved,
like you know,

548
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.690
maybe they were a new guy or maybe they just,

549
00:37:43.691 --> 00:37:45.910
they just weren't that involved in the planning or whatever.

550
00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.700
So all they were getting told was like,
hey,
get your gear on.

551
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.100
You're going out again.
Right.
Come back from that operation.
Hey,

552
00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:53.320
get your gear on and going out again.
Come back to that operation.
Hey,

553
00:37:53.321 --> 00:37:54.460
get your gear on and you're going out.
Again,

554
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.490
those guys that didn't really get involved in the planning,

555
00:37:57.491 --> 00:38:00.490
it was harder for them because they didn't feel like they had any control and

556
00:38:00.491 --> 00:38:02.920
they didn't see the risk mitigation that was happening and they didn't

557
00:38:02.921 --> 00:38:06.070
understand the strategy well enough.
Why?
Because I didn't tell him my fault,

558
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.350
you know,
I should have been more engaged in them.

559
00:38:08.351 --> 00:38:10.210
I should have explained to him the impact that they were having.

560
00:38:10.211 --> 00:38:12.550
I should have explained to him the overall strategic picture.

561
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.030
And I tried to do that and I thought I did it,
but I didn't do it well enough.

562
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.500
And those are the guys that definitely were the most stressed out.

563
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.570
So leaders out there,
it's just another reason.

564
00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:30.520
It's another reason to tell people why they're doing what they're doing and get

565
00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:34.990
them involved in the planning and get them ownership of the planning so that

566
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.280
feel I have some control

567
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.130
<v 4>over it.
Interesting.
I'll eat,
oh,</v>

568
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.890
they mentioned how they dealt with that when they'd pull them off the line.

569
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:45.910
Right.
But they wouldn't just be like straight up straight dope.
Hey,

570
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:47.680
you're messing up.
Get off the line.
Nope.

571
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.770
It's like they pulled them off the line in a way that wouldn't,

572
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.020
would it mess them up,
you know,
hey,
we need you to take care of the supply issue.

573
00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:57.340
You can go back there for me and get this figured out.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll do it.

574
00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.270
I'll give them a break.
Give them a rest.
There's some Hackworth talked about too.

575
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:05.140
I mean,
Hackworth says,
um,
you know about face,
you know,
he talks about,

576
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.960
he just says,
hey,
everyone's got a cup of a certain size cup.

577
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.200
Some people have a bigger cup than others,
but when the cup gets filled up,

578
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:15.040
that's it.
They're done.
And if you let the cup get filled up and overflow,

579
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:17.470
then they're done forever.
But if you can catch it beforehand,

580
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:19.480
they can go back a little bit and drain their cup out,

581
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.440
but that's exactly what you talk about when you say you say manipulation,
right?

582
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:24.940
Like how you'd,
you'd tell them.
Yeah,

583
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:29.260
just in a kind of a gingerly kind of way to make them,

584
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:33.480
make them signed on to the whole situation.
Yeah.
Yeah.

585
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.323
No doubt about it.

586
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.820
This is going back to his discipline.

587
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:46.170
My routine was to shave every morning and then to inspect the line

588
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.290
in Russ.
In retrospect,
shaving in the bitter cold was pretty ridiculous,

589
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.790
but the practice had originated with one of my first meetings with Colonel Sync

590
00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:02.310
at Tacoma sink.
It required us to shave every morning.
He said,

591
00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:06.810
you shave every morning for the men and if you want to shave every evening for

592
00:40:06.811 --> 00:40:10.860
the women,
but that's up to you,
but I want you to set an example.

593
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.320
He was absolutely right.

594
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.600
I remember one morning when we prepared for our attack on Foy,

595
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.830
I got up in the middle of the night to shave before getting something to eat in

596
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:26.380
the process.
I cut myself up pretty badly.

597
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.510
I must have looked like hell when colonel sink arrived to check on us before the

598
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:35.830
attack commenced,
he took one look at me and had a huge smile on his face.

599
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.480
I later,

600
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.320
I realized later that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold

601
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:42.154
morning.

602
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.690
But that was one of the things I did to set an example for the men shave in the

603
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:51.040
morning and once in a while I would strip to the waist and give myself a French

604
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:53.920
guash,
a routine that caught everyone's attention.

605
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.880
I did this for one reason and one reason only to get the men's attention and to

606
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:04.150
let them know that I was going to be around for awhile and this wasn't as bad as

607
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:07.300
they thought it was going to be.
Make the best of it.

608
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:16.030
And what I like about that is his total awareness is total awareness of the

609
00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:20.580
impact that he's having on his men.
He knows that they are watching them.

610
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:21.900
If you're in a leadership position,

611
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:26.850
you've got to recognize that people are watching you parents.
Yeah,

612
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.780
yeah.
If you're a parent,

613
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:31.140
you got to realize that that person that you're leading called your child,

614
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.950
they're watching you.
It's critical than

615
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.610
<v 3>most of the time anyway.
Then what you say,
so you know,</v>

616
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:41.660
and people will make this excuse kind of the saying that to say,
Hey,

617
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:45.380
do what I say,
not what I do.
Meanwhile,
you're doing all this stuff.
That's not,

618
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:47.270
that's not how they're going to,
they're going to be like,
oh,

619
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:50.270
that's just something you say.
Meanwhile,
this is how you do it.

620
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:54.050
Apparently mom and dad are doing it this way.
That's the way it's done.

621
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.310
Regardless of what they say.

622
00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.423
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

623
00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.710
<v 0>you got to do the right thing and people are watching you.</v>

624
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:05.350
When you're in a leadership position that you are being watched,

625
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.030
you are being emulated.

626
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:12.850
Your emotions are being mimicked.
You don't know that.
You might not sense that,

627
00:42:12.851 --> 00:42:17.680
but your emotions are being mimicked.
You get into a panic mode.

628
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.690
You're going to have a bunch of people panicking.

629
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.150
You stay calm.
Your people are going to stay calm.
You get crazy.

630
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.000
You're people are going to go crazy.
You're people are watching you.

631
00:42:30.001 --> 00:42:33.630
So set the good example and one of the premier he examples he setting as he's

632
00:42:33.631 --> 00:42:35.040
maintaining the discipline.

633
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.890
Now this actually section,
I don't,
it's,

634
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.160
it's very interesting because we had,

635
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.220
I had made a comment on the podcast about,
hey,

636
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:51.210
what do you do?
Someone asked,

637
00:42:51.211 --> 00:42:54.690
what do you do if you get told to do something and you don't believe in it?

638
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.550
Right.
And you know,
I went through a big gray area and said,
look,
you know,

639
00:42:59.551 --> 00:42:59.790
there's,

640
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.270
there's some gray area there and if it's just something small that you could ask

641
00:43:03.271 --> 00:43:04.110
to do and you just,

642
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.710
if you decide you're going to lay down the law right now and bang your fist on

643
00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:09.750
the table and say,
I'm not going to do that,

644
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.440
well then you're going to get fired and now someone else is going to have to

645
00:43:13.441 --> 00:43:15.900
come in there and do that thing that you've been asked to do.

646
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.180
And I had one person on Twitter that kind of went back and forth with me and you

647
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:24.360
know,
uh,
he said,
hey,

648
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.630
it does make an impact when you walk away.
And I agreed with him.
I said,
yes,

649
00:43:27.631 --> 00:43:28.201
I know I,

650
00:43:28.201 --> 00:43:31.050
I'm not trying to say it doesn't make an impact when you walk away cause it

651
00:43:31.051 --> 00:43:31.980
certainly does,

652
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:37.670
but there's cases where it has more of an impact if you stay and you stay in the

653
00:43:40.891 --> 00:43:44.130
game.
So this is an example right here.

654
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:49.610
A pretty shocking example because we have a guy that's 100% on board and is,

655
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:56.010
you know,
a straight shooting guy that listens to his chain of command.

656
00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.600
And here's what happens.

657
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.040
Colonel Bob Sink was a magnificent commander,

658
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.800
but this time he had had a little too much to drink and is ordered to dispatch

659
00:44:07.801 --> 00:44:12.450
another patrol to capture additional prisoners did not make sense.

660
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.260
We had already captured sufficient prisoners for interrogation.

661
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:21.390
A second patrol would only result in casualties for no apparent reason.

662
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:27.770
Further exacerbating the situation was freshly fallen snow along the river that

663
00:44:28.261 --> 00:44:30.240
it quickly turned to ice during the day.

664
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.930
If I followed Colonel Sinks,
order,

665
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:39.350
the enemy would have heard us coming along way off
what to do.

666
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.680
I responded,
yes sir.

667
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.270
And then promptly ignored the order

668
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:55.780
so that he's doing what I was basically what I was saying.

669
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.020
Like if he just said,
no sir,
we're not going to do that.
Guess what?

670
00:44:59.021 --> 00:45:02.710
He's going to get fired and now we're going to get someone else put in charge.

671
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.470
And even if he doesn't get fired,
he's hurting his reputation.

672
00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:11.050
So it's a bad situation,
but what he decides to do is go,
got it sir,

673
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.153
we'll take care of it.

674
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.320
And then he promptly ignores the order to now back to the book to give the

675
00:45:17.321 --> 00:45:19.090
impression of compliance.
However,

676
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.110
I assembled the men in a building and told them we are not going to send out

677
00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:25.390
this patrol because I did not think it was feasible.

678
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.290
I also informed them that my neck was in a noose.

679
00:45:29.291 --> 00:45:31.000
If anyone ever said anything about it.

680
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:36.190
With that the men lay down and caught some much needed sleep and I took the

681
00:45:36.191 --> 00:45:40.660
radio and adjusted mortar and artillery fire on my supposedly objective

682
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.890
and here's his,
here's his thoughts on it.
On reflection,

683
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:50.120
I did exactly the right thing and I have never had any regrets.

684
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.300
There was insufficient time for preparation.

685
00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.860
The field to our front was wide open and I would have lost too many men for no

686
00:45:57.861 --> 00:45:58.694
purpose.

687
00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.940
I wonder what I would've done had I been a career officer concerned about my own

688
00:46:04.941 --> 00:46:09.110
future,
would I have compromise my beliefs,

689
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.020
the deliberate disobedience of a lawful order by my commanding officer presented

690
00:46:15.021 --> 00:46:18.590
in an ethical dilemma of the first magnitude.

691
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.330
<v 1>But</v>

692
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:29.070
<v 0>you can see it's a guy who's staying on his principles and his principles were</v>

693
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.250
to accomplish the mission,
take care of his men,
and he's weighing those things.

694
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.750
Those things aren't black and white.

695
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.800
Those things are not black and white because you look at all the times he did do

696
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:43.740
operations in missions and tasks.
These were his guys got wounded and killed.

697
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.950
But he saw what the purpose was and now we see something where there's no

698
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:49.050
purpose.
And he says,
you know what,
not going to do it.

699
00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.620
But he doesn't tell the boss.
He just does an executed.
So it,

700
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.960
and you know there's stories of seals and Vietnam doing that.

701
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.070
And I heard that from,
from the Vietnam seals would tell me,
hey,

702
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.580
if they got directed to do something that they didn't think was a good mission.

703
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:07.980
I've talked about this before.
Oh,
we're going to go,

704
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:11.670
you want us to go three kilometers away and set up an ambush on this river

705
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:14.310
that's in really tough enemy controlled areas and we don't know what the

706
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:17.550
intelligence is on who's going to come down that river.
Okay,
cool.

707
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.990
And they'd patrol 200 meters out the gate,
set up a little perimeter,

708
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.850
right close to camp where there's no,
no problems.
Smoke a couple cigarettes,

709
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.130
spend a few hours out there.
Walk back.

710
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.200
<v 4>Yeah.
Hey,
nothing happened.
No one came down the river.</v>

711
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.620
I would think you'd have to be pretty responsible though,

712
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:38.710
if you're going to kind of exercise that course of action.

713
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.010
Otherwise you get someone who's just like Noo Noo don't feel like you don't feel

714
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:42.821
it.
Yeah,
no,
it's,

715
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:46.360
it's obviously something that a guy like Dick winters did very rarely and the

716
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:49.080
seals in Vietnam.
So I think they were blowing missions off all the time.
Right.

717
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.120
But they,
you know,
like I said,
if,

718
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.650
if something comes up where you completely disagree with it,

719
00:47:56.651 --> 00:48:00.130
but you don't disagree with it to the point where you want to make,

720
00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.500
you want to make,
um,

721
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:05.470
make a stand that's gonna make you get fired or now you're not supporting your

722
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:09.580
guys anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know?
Okay,
you cool.
You kept him alive that night.

723
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.610
Well,
who's coming in to take your place,
right?
That's the question.

724
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.730
Who's coming in to take your place and you don't know who that is and what's

725
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:17.530
their best interests going to be.

726
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.340
Because whoever comes in to take your place is going to be a company guy that's

727
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:21.971
going to be,
you know,

728
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:25.990
he's going to be a guy that's going to obey every last direct order from the
guy.

729
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.150
And this is,
you know,
it's,
it's strange too.
I mean,
here I am,
I'm a,
I mean,
I was,

730
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:32.620
uh,
uh,
as,

731
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.420
as motivated it to be in the military as I could possibly be.

732
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.580
You know,
so I'm not sitting here calling from mutiny from guys,
right.

733
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.640
But I am telling you to use common sense and you've got to put common sense on

734
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:49.000
top of everything.
And sometimes common sense outweighs or orders.

735
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:53.680
That's just the way it is.
It's rare.
And I said this last time as well,
it's rare.

736
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.860
It's not like you're getting these crazy orders from up the chain of command.

737
00:48:56.861 --> 00:49:00.040
People aren't,
people aren't advancing in the military because they're,

738
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.190
because they're idiots.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

739
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.560
And it's not like they're not on your team and it's not like they want you to

740
00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:07.900
get killed.
And you know,
maybe,
you know,

741
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:10.750
in this case he could have gotten given some push back and said,
hey,

742
00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:13.600
you know what boss,
here's what's going on.
There's fresh snow,
it's good.

743
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:16.240
They're gonna hear is coming a mile away.
We don't have good cover to the front.

744
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.160
This is not a good operation.

745
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:23.540
But maybe he heard the tone of the colonel's voice and just said,
hey,
this guy,

746
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.350
it'd be if I say that and then I don't do it,

747
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.920
or if I say that it's gonna make me suspicious so you know what?
I got it sir.

748
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:34.840
And then don't do it just to judge the judge a judgment of character.

749
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.830
But that's what you've got writing on you and you're in a leadership position.

750
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:43.150
You know you got those guys lives and that's should be more important to you

751
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:44.920
than anything.
And it's,

752
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:49.921
it's a strange dichotomy of leadership because on the one hand you're trained

753
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:57.460
your whole military career that you've got to take care of your men,

754
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.990
take care of your people.
That's something you get trained on since day one.

755
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.280
Take care of your team.

756
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:08.110
And the dichotomy of that is you're going to do missions where you could very

757
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:09.790
well be sending your men to their death.

758
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:14.200
So there's a massive dichotomy there and how you deal with the dichotomy,

759
00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:19.201
you find the balance and the balance is not a cookie cutter response.

760
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.230
The balance is different for each scenario that you're in and how well you can

761
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:28.160
weigh those.
Opposing forces

762
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.340
<v 0>is a,
is a measure of what kind of leader you are.</v>

763
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:41.000
That's what makes leadership hard.
Now

764
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:47.130
we're getting to Dave.

765
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:52.160
They've moved through Europe and now we're about to go from war to

766
00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.410
something even more evil,
which is the concentration camps,
the death camps.

767
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:08.790
So back to the book
as they enter.
This is back to the book.

768
00:51:08.791 --> 00:51:12.180
As they entered the their death camps for the first time,

769
00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.200
the horror of what we observed remains with each paratrooper.
To this day,

770
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.880
you could not explain it.
You could not describe it,

771
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.130
and you could not exaggerate it.

772
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:32.370
It did not take long to realize that the Nazis were intent on eliminating all

773
00:51:32.371 --> 00:51:36.870
the Jews,
Gypsies,
and anyone who disagreed with Hitler's regime,

774
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:43.860
the memory of starved dazed men who dropped their eyes and heads and we looked

775
00:51:43.861 --> 00:51:47.210
at them through the chain link fence in the same manner that a beaten,

776
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.200
mistreated dog would cringe,

777
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:52.230
left a mark on all of us forever.

778
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.800
Nor could you underestimate the barbarity of the Nazi regime.

779
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.100
Even during the latter stages of the war.

780
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:10.500
As I went through the war,
it was natural to ask myself,

781
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.270
why am I here?
Why am I putting up with a freezing cold?

782
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.660
The constant rain and the loss of so many comrades.

783
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.550
Does anybody care?

784
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:27.020
A soldier faces death on a daily basis and his life is one of misery and

785
00:52:28.141 --> 00:52:30.930
deprivation.
He is cold.

786
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.980
He suffers from hunger frequently bordering on starvation.

787
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:41.870
The impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying if only to

788
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:42.744
myself

789
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:48.720
now I know why I am here for the first time.

790
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.380
I understand what this war is all about

791
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.373
<v 2>and</v>

792
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.970
<v 0>obviously seeing that evil firsthand</v>

793
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.500
and that's one of the reasons why I think we explore the darkness and the evil

794
00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:13.860
on a fairly regular basis here and that's why I explore it.

795
00:53:14.261 --> 00:53:19.261
That's why my mind is drawn to these things because you got to understand that

796
00:53:19.511 --> 00:53:23.140
evil's out there and it's still here today

797
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:25.563
and

798
00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.640
has got to take the fight to the enemy.

799
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.873
Now

800
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.370
I'm jumping towards the end of the book and again,

801
00:53:42.371 --> 00:53:45.330
it's not really not giving anything away.

802
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:50.220
I mean we know how World War Two ended,
but this is how

803
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.780
colonel winters,
or sorry,

804
00:53:53.781 --> 00:53:58.700
major winters kind of wraps up their combat

805
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.950
back to the book and so many of the Tacoma veterans returned home yet all would

806
00:54:07.881 --> 00:54:11.990
be forever connected by their shared experiences in combat.

807
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.780
Over the course of the war,

808
00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.840
easy company alone lost 48 men killed and over 100 wounded,

809
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.480
incurring 150% casualties.

810
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:29.410
This percentage was not uncommon among similar units who had fought in the

811
00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:31.150
campaign of northwest Europe

812
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.120
at the peak of its effectiveness in Holland in October of 1944 and in the

813
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:40.830
Ardennes in January,

814
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:45.030
1945 it was as good a rifle company as there was in the world.

815
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.240
According to Arthur,
Stephen,
he Ambrose,

816
00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:53.420
how so many men survived the campaigns in Normandy,
Holland,

817
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.370
Bastogne,
and Germany was a true testament to their courage,

818
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.390
their training and their discipline under fire.

819
00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.850
Now I,
I want to fast forward a little bit more too.

820
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.830
He's,
he's done.

821
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:18.270
He's now out of the military and I know we got a lot of people that listen to

822
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:22.530
the show because a lot of you guys reach out to me and talk about that

823
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:25.380
transition.
A lot of people ask me about that transition

824
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.000
and here's Dick winters transition.

825
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.680
While I was extremely happy to put the army behind me,

826
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:41.190
I realized that I was a different man than I was when I joined the army over

827
00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:42.910
four years earlier.

828
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:49.100
The war had changed me in many ways as it does all who experienced combat

829
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.440
having witnessed so much mass suffering and the unparalleled barbarism that

830
00:55:57.051 --> 00:56:00.260
mankind is capable of inflicting upon itself.

831
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.710
I don't see how any survivor can be ever be cruel to anything.

832
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.440
Again.
In addition,

833
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:16.070
I was a far better judge of character than I had been in 1941 that feeling

834
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:20.070
remains with me today,
a full 60 years after the war.

835
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.590
When I meet people for the first time and get know them,

836
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:28.150
I can't help but judge them and size them up.
Do they have leadership?

837
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:33.340
Would they be good in combat?
Do they pass the test?

838
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:40.970
I was also more disciplined than I remembered being before I deployed to Europe.

839
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:46.260
This discipline helped me adapt to civilian life.

840
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:50.250
Once I returned to Pennsylvania,
like all veterans,

841
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.290
I had to adjust to society.

842
00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.830
The life that you are going to share with others in order to make a living.

843
00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:00.930
I certainly never confused the challenges in the workplace with what I

844
00:57:00.931 --> 00:57:02.310
experienced in combat.

845
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:06.600
There would be no life and death struggles in the corporate world.

846
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:09.480
Business hardly equates to war.

847
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.080
Such comparisons demean the word

848
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.330
and when I read that I actually had to put myself into check.
Hmm.

849
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.780
Because I wanted to make sure that I,

850
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.880
I'm clear about something cause something I am obviously we wrote a book that's

851
00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:31.350
about comparing business and war,

852
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:38.040
but I want to make it clear that what we're comparing and what we say is
similar.

853
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:40.590
In fact they're the same is that principles,

854
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:43.410
the principles of leadership are the same.

855
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:49.230
The struggles and the challenges and the consequences are not the same.

856
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:50.603
They are not.

857
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.150
So I want to make sure I make that clear.

858
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.233
Now

859
00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:04.910
let's get to some of his reflections on leadership.

860
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.520
Back to the book.
Was I a successful leader?

861
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:18.530
They tell me I was and modesty prevents me from disagreeing with them.

862
00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:24.200
I am not so naive that I don't realize the wide appeal of Dick Winters today is

863
00:58:24.201 --> 00:58:26.180
based on leadership in combat.

864
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:31.910
I may not have been the best commander,
but I always strove to be.

865
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:38.110
My men depended on me to carefully analyze every tactical situation to maximize

866
00:58:38.241 --> 00:58:42.800
the resources that I had at my disposal to think under pressure and delete them

867
00:58:42.801 --> 00:58:47.270
by personal example.
I think it's interesting even here,
you know,

868
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.810
he's looking back and he's a humble guy.
You know,

869
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:55.220
I may have not been the best combat commander,
but I always tried to be.

870
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.260
This is a humble man.

871
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:02.540
I am not sure there is such a thing as a natural born leader.

872
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.590
Some leaders are born with special aptitudes or talents,

873
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.390
but any success I might have had was the product of good upbringing,

874
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:16.670
intense study and preparation and physical conditioning that set me apart from

875
00:59:16.671 --> 00:59:19.940
my peers.
Here's Dick Winters.

876
00:59:19.941 --> 00:59:24.941
I mean one of the kind of combat leaders at the tactical level in the modern era

877
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:31.100
and he's saying that it was preparation and physical conditioning,

878
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.150
the setting him apart from his peers.
I was all back to the book.

879
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:39.200
I was also surrounded by a group of men who were disciplined and highly trained

880
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:43.880
to accomplish any mission.
Add luck to the equation and you can understand that.

881
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:47.810
The secret to my success was that somehow I always manage to survive.

882
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:48.644
Another day.

883
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:55.340
In recent years I've been asked to address an increasing number of civic groups,

884
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.660
corporate seminars and governmental agencies on the subject of leadership.

885
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:07.060
Most are looking for cookie cutter solutions as to what constitutes a successful

886
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:07.964
leader.

887
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.980
What is the recipe for success and this is,

888
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.360
this is classic and and actually win win the book.

889
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:18.320
When when Lafe and I,

890
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.880
the book came out and when our book came out we did a bunch of interviews that

891
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:27.881
got turned into either short articles or video clips in and they would,

892
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.170
they title these things,
you know,

893
01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:33.920
like three things every leader must do and that's what they always do.

894
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.080
Everyone's looking exactly for what he says.

895
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.950
Most are looking for cookie cutter solutions to what constitutes a successful

896
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:43.970
leader.
What is the recipe for success?

897
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.830
In truth,

898
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:50.830
there are no simple solutions just as there is no average day in combat.

899
01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:57.200
Each situation is different and each requires a leader to be flexible in

900
01:00:57.201 --> 01:01:01.730
adapting his or her particular leadership style to the specific circumstances

901
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:03.560
required to accomplish any mission.

902
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:09.290
It's a matter of adjusting to the individual and you do this every day.

903
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.160
You don't have just one way of treating people.

904
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.680
You adjust yourself to whom you are talking.

905
01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.790
If I were to give advice to a young leader going to war,

906
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:26.700
based on my observation of what I had constituted,

907
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.800
the success of the outstanding leaders who comprise the mill,

908
01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:33.300
the American parachute,
infantry regiment,
regimens of World War II,

909
01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.450
I would offer a series of principles that I am certain will result in great

910
01:01:36.451 --> 01:01:39.120
success regardless of the field endeavor,

911
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:42.300
field of endeavor in which the individual was participating.

912
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:46.470
So here he's saying the same thing that I say,
which is leadership is the same.

913
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.650
Whether it's in the battlefield or whatever endeavor you're going into.

914
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.480
Leadership principles stay the same.
First and foremost,

915
01:01:55.850 --> 01:02:00.090
a leader should strive to be an individual of flawless character,

916
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.270
technical competence and moral courage.

917
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.580
If you have character,

918
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.380
that means you are the guy that means the guy you are dealing with can trust
you.

919
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.570
The men trust you,
have faith in you and they obey you.

920
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:20.880
No questions asked.
That's character in a nutshell.

921
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:25.620
Character also allows you to make decisions quickly and correctly.

922
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.990
Some may question my decision to disobey a direct order from my commanding

923
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:31.471
officer.

924
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:36.471
This is the story we already talked about and to fake another patrol as a

925
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:41.760
violation of that very principle.
I'm advocating
in my heart.

926
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:42.361
However,

927
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:47.130
I could not send my men to risk their lives for no apparent reason when clearly

928
01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:51.780
nothing would have been gained that we had not already achieved such a course

929
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:54.330
takes a degree of moral core courage,

930
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.280
which I have found is far rarer than physical courage.
Was I correct?

931
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.320
In my estimation?
I thought so and I have never regretted my decision.

932
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.980
The same holds true for developing leaders of competency.

933
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:15.080
Those entrusted to lead must study their profession to become totally proficient

934
01:03:15.081 --> 01:03:18.950
in tactics and technology.
Prior to the invasion,

935
01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.270
I read every tactical manual I could lay my hands on to improve my tactical

936
01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:24.950
knowledge and professional competence.

937
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.160
While other soldiers were out carousing and the pubs,

938
01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.880
while they were enjoying the social life of the neighboring towns,

939
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:36.530
I was reading and educating myself,
getting ready to lead men into combat,

940
01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.510
getting smarter,
opening up the books.

941
01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:48.020
That's what he was doing and that's part of leadership.

942
01:03:48.021 --> 01:03:53.021
That's part of his is characteristics of leadership is to become knowledgeable,

943
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:55.880
to read and study.

944
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.560
He goes on,
don't waste time attempting to define leadership.

945
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.180
No need to go to a dictionary.
The infantry school at Fort Benning,
Georgia,

946
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:12.050
Georgia has defined leadership and just two words via its motto,

947
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.490
follow me

948
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:22.630
and he's gonna do it again right here.

949
01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.790
Physical fitness is another prerequisite for success.

950
01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.690
I freely admit that I was blessed with a sound physical constitution,

951
01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:32.740
but whenever possible,

952
01:04:32.741 --> 01:04:37.741
I took the opportunity to improve my physical stamina because I was in such good

953
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:41.870
physical shape.
I easily survive to Koa.
That's their,

954
01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.880
their initial training that they went through for airborne while men washed out

955
01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:46.990
on a daily basis.

956
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:50.470
The contingent from easy company that completed the training and earned their

957
01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:55.471
wings at Fort Benning were tough as nails because I was in such good shape.

958
01:04:55.930 --> 01:05:00.430
My fatigue level never reached the point of physical exhaustion that contributes

959
01:05:00.431 --> 01:05:03.850
to mental exhaustion and ultimately to combat fatigue.

960
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.410
We all experienced sleep deprivation at times.

961
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.000
That is the nature of stress,

962
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.980
but if physically exhausted leader routinely makes poor decisions in times of

963
01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:15.814
crisis

964
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:21.020
and here he talks about

965
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.360
another piece.

966
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:30.730
I have always felt that my principle contribution to the success of both easy

967
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:35.731
company and second battalion was based on my knowledge of what to expect from

968
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.760
each man.
No your people

969
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:46.050
having selected the right men for the right job.

970
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:51.140
I then delegated the authority to my subordinates and allowed them to use their

971
01:05:51.301 --> 01:05:55.870
initiative to execute the mission.
Do you centralize command,

972
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.390
decentralized command?

973
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:02.820
There is no need to tell someone how you how to do his job if you have properly

974
01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:03.960
trained your team.

975
01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:13.050
Good preparation is always vital to the success of any operation.

976
01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:17.970
But leaders must remain flexible once the action commences.

977
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:23.820
Steve Ambross likes to quote General Eisenhower who claimed before the battle is

978
01:06:23.821 --> 01:06:28.710
joined plans or everything.
Once the battle is joined,
however,

979
01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:30.600
plans go out the window.

980
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.261
Next,

981
01:06:36.261 --> 01:06:41.030
I would encourage leaders to take a moment of self reflection before rushing

982
01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:45.740
into important decisions.
This is a little bit of detachment.

983
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:51.290
Many leaders don't take the time to consider carefully their decisions or the

984
01:06:51.291 --> 01:06:55.010
implications of their actions in battle.

985
01:06:55.011 --> 01:07:00.011
I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises and the chaos of battle.

986
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:02.760
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

987
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.620
<v 0>I found it useful to separate myself momentarily and to carefully think through</v>

988
01:07:07.621 --> 01:07:12.330
what actions I needed to take to accomplish the mission.
Again,

989
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.780
I read this book for the first time last week.

990
01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.760
He's the detachment straight out.
He's saying the exact same in battle.

991
01:07:20.761 --> 01:07:24.990
I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises and chaos of battle.

992
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.140
Hang tough.

993
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:33.360
Never ever give up regardless of the adversity.

994
01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.980
If you are a leader of fellow who other fellows look to,

995
01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.400
you have got to keep going.

996
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:46.620
I would also urge leaders to remain humble.

997
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:53.010
If you don't worry about who gets the credit,
you get a lot more done.

998
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:58.440
Again,
this is when people ask me,
what's the most important quality of a leader?

999
01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.790
I tell them it's humility.

1000
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.950
Leaders should assume the blame when the operation fails,

1001
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.720
when it succeeds.
Credit the men and women in your team,

1002
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:17.470
they do the lion share of the work and now he's going to talk about humility a

1003
01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:22.520
little bit more.
Since the release of the HBO miniseries,

1004
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.220
many of us have been flooded with hundreds,

1005
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.390
sometimes thousands of letters from adoring fans across the nation.

1006
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:35.570
The attention is certainly flattering and greatly appreciated,

1007
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.520
but it remains better to remember Eisenhower's address at Guild Hall Hall on

1008
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:45.920
June 12th,

1009
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.310
1945 to an ecstatic British public,

1010
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:54.530
which showered the supreme commander with a tumultuous parade through the

1011
01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.740
streets of London.
I reminded them,

1012
01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:06.410
humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in

1013
01:09:08.641 --> 01:09:13.641
the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.

1014
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.680
I think anybody that's ever been in a leadership position

1015
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.540
and has been called some kind of hero.

1016
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:26.750
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1017
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.340
<v 0>we'll think back to that statement.</v>

1018
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:34.060
Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in

1019
01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:39.410
the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.

1020
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:49.320
And I think when you
use that word hero,

1021
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.560
it's something that obviously gets thrown around a lot.

1022
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:55.643
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1023
01:09:58.890 --> 01:09:59.723
<v 0>And here's what</v>

1024
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.080
major winners had to say about that.

1025
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:09.420
Perhaps the best characterization of what a true hero consists

1026
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.200
is found in a letter sergeant Mike Rainey sent me in January,

1027
01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.800
1982 shortly before he went back to the hospital for a series of tests.

1028
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:26.200
Historian Steven Ambrose use the passage to conclude band of brothers because

1029
01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:30.910
rainy and capsulated the cohesion that became the hallmark of easy company.

1030
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:36.120
In thinking back on the days of easy company,

1031
01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:42.120
I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who asked,
grandpa,

1032
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.630
where you a hero in the war?
No,

1033
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:51.620
I answered.
But I served in a company of heroes.

1034
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:53.970
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1035
01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.690
<v 0>And I can tell you that I also served with many,
many heroes,</v>

1036
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:01.470
the guys and in tasking to bruiser,

1037
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.390
the guys from two to eight infantry,
the guys from one one AED in the ready,

1038
01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:08.160
first,
the soldiers and the marines.

1039
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.070
All those brave

1040
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.903
<v 1>men</v>

1041
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.350
<v 0>and some brave women as well.</v>

1042
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1043
01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:30.000
<v 0>And to those
men and women,</v>

1044
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:32.430
those soldiers and Marines and I was lucky enough to serve with.

1045
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.190
I think that this statement right here

1046
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.370
from Dick Winters,

1047
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.240
<v 1>okay.</v>

1048
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.940
<v 0>Is something that I think is very fitting.</v>

1049
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.070
As I look back on the men of easy company and the closeness we have enjoyed over

1050
01:11:51.071 --> 01:11:51.904
the years.

1051
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.770
I reminded of the dialogue attributed to a senior German officer bidding

1052
01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.400
farewell to his men in the HBO miniseries.
Miniseries

1053
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.580
paraphrasing his words.

1054
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.120
I would say to easy company and the officers and men of the five Oh six

1055
01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.480
parachute infantry regiment.

1056
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:12.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1057
01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.390
<v 0>It has been a long war.
It's been a hard war.</v>

1058
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:24.200
You have fought bravely proudly for your country.

1059
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:30.850
You are a special group of men connected by a bond that only exists in combat.

1060
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.860
You've shared the incommunicable experience of war and have been tested under

1061
01:12:39.101 --> 01:12:40.270
extreme adversity.

1062
01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.790
You've shared foxholes and have held each other in dire moments.

1063
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.590
You've seen death and if suffered together,

1064
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:56.790
you've lived in an environment totally incomprehensible to those who do not know

1065
01:12:57.221 --> 01:12:58.054
war.

1066
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.170
I am proud and deeply honored to have served with every one of you.

1067
01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.420
You all deserve long and happy lives in peace.

1068
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:17.530
I bet each of you God speed and asked the Almighty to shower his blessings on

1069
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:22.010
you and your families now and for generations to come.

1070
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:26.280
And that

1071
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:28.360
<v 1>okay.</v>

1072
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.410
<v 0>Wraps the book and
yeah,</v>

1073
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:36.610
I was thinking after the last podcast that this was going to be a

1074
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:39.223
lighter one.

1075
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.400
And I picked this book specifically because I see Major Dick winters has as an

1076
01:13:45.341 --> 01:13:49.720
incredible person,
incredible leader and role model for everyone.

1077
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.690
But because we are talking about war,

1078
01:13:58.230 --> 01:13:58.540
<v 1>okay,</v>

1079
01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:02.840
<v 0>there is still tragedy and loss and darkness there</v>

1080
01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:08.670
and that's okay.

1081
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.770
And do you vets out there like the anonymous marine

1082
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.260
that wrote that tribute to his brothers from April 2nd

1083
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.943
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1084
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.830
<v 0>And we know there's hundreds of thousands of veterans that are feeling that</v>

1085
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:33.850
every day.
And if you're having one of those dark days,

1086
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.223
it's okay.

1087
01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:44.910
It's,
it's okay.

1088
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.860
It's okay to feel that darkness

1089
01:14:56.210 --> 01:15:01.210
and it's okay to remember it and miss it then hate it and love it.

1090
01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.560
And it's okay to wish it never happened.

1091
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:11.080
And at the same time to wish it never stopped.

1092
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.400
And it's okay to want to take it all back

1093
01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:22.530
and at the same time

1094
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.480
to want to do it all again.

1095
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:33.890
And,
and if you've got in your mind that,
that,

1096
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.820
that you think that people don't understand,

1097
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.040
<v 1>that's okay.
They don't,</v>

1098
01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:47.603
but you do.

1099
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:53.230
<v 0>Do you know,
darkness,
you know,
evil.</v>

1100
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.460
But more important than that,

1101
01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:02.790
you know,
good.

1102
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:07.440
You know,
light.

1103
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.150
And do you know,
laughter and love better than anyone.

1104
01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:20.990
So

1105
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:26.860
embrace,

1106
01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:34.100
embrace that darkness.
Own it.
Don't look away from it.

1107
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:37.190
Don't bury it in booze or in pills.

1108
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.693
<v 1>Listen,</v>

1109
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:46.610
<v 0>listen to what Corporal Scott Procopio would have been saying to you.</v>

1110
01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:51.350
Live your life.
Embrace your life

1111
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:55.223
with,

1112
01:16:55.710 --> 01:17:00.710
with physical activity and with nature and with Jujitsu and with Sohn and with

1113
01:17:01.021 --> 01:17:06.021
laughter and guitar and good memories and creativity and discipline.

1114
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.540
Discipline yourself

1115
01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.490
so you can free yourself

1116
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.340
and move forward

1117
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:25.850
into the future

1118
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.390
where there's no more darkness and no more war

1119
01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.590
but piece.

1120
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:43.010
Good Evening Echo,
good evening.

1121
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:49.300
Little message to the,
to the,
to the vets out there.

1122
01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:53.950
I hear from a lot of veterans and I wanted to know,

1123
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:57.550
I just wanted to let those guys know,
you know,
kind of where I'm coming from,

1124
01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:03.420
get a lot of real positive stuff from guys and some guys going through hard

1125
01:18:04.121 --> 01:18:06.820
times and I know it.

1126
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.170
And you know,
I'm hoping to be able to,
uh,

1127
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:18.130
kind of spread my thoughts are where I'm at and how well what I think of these

1128
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:20.774
things.

1129
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1130
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.320
<v 0>Cause you know,
if you get guys like</v>

1131
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.230
major winners that,
you know,

1132
01:18:31.231 --> 01:18:35.010
did everything that he did and war and he came back and you know,

1133
01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:39.840
he was able to figure it out and a lot of those veterans were,
and they,
you know,

1134
01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:44.760
he said it wasn't an easy adaptation that they made,
but they made it,

1135
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.393
they made it.

1136
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:53.720
So I think you got to embrace those things
and

1137
01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:00.700
be stronger than them.
And I know,

1138
01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:03.040
and I say it all the time,
you gotta you gotta know that darkness.

1139
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.570
If you really want to appreciate the light.

1140
01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:09.520
And I think the guys that have been to war,
they can do that.

1141
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.733
Um,
and,

1142
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.070
and life can seem so much better

1143
01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.430
because you know how bad it can be.

1144
01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:24.683
So

1145
01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.490
speaking of feedback from people,

1146
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.120
rough transition right now,

1147
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:39.930
but that's what we do here.
What rough,
rough,

1148
01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.360
rough transitions.
And you know what,

1149
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:45.480
you know what's interesting about the rough transitions and that that's out

1150
01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:45.631
there,

1151
01:19:45.631 --> 01:19:48.870
that's listening to me right now or anybody that's not a vet that anyone that's

1152
01:19:48.871 --> 01:19:51.060
been through hard times and loss,

1153
01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.080
it's a big rough transition and you go in and out emotionally and you know,

1154
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.750
you'll be feeling like crap one minute and then the next minute you'll feel okay

1155
01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:04.470
and you'll be laughing.
And that's,
that's all.
Like I said,
that's okay.

1156
01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:08.010
I think a lot of people are scared that they might be

1157
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.570
<v 3>acting the wrong way,</v>

1158
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.080
but it's all right.
Yeah,
it's okay.
Yeah.

1159
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:20.640
And just like how you're saying where it may seem like people don't understand

1160
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.790
and that's okay cause they don't,
that's so true because,

1161
01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:28.710
and this is the way I'll think of it because my best friends are actually,

1162
01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:30.750
they're still in the navy seals.
Um,

1163
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:35.100
so I of these are guys that you grew up with,
grew up with,

1164
01:20:35.101 --> 01:20:38.950
and spend your best friends ever hit my wedding.
Yeah.
Um,

1165
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:42.690
so I,
a lot of them do.
You don't what I talked to him and stuff.
I just,

1166
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.430
in my own head,
I kind of imagine what it's like coming back.
Right?

1167
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:50.880
So if you kind of consider it kind of in a nutshell where you consider,
hey,

1168
01:20:50.881 --> 01:20:54.210
what's your biggest problems?
When,
when you're overseas,
when you're in the war,

1169
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:57.090
what are these big problems you got to worry about?
Okay,

1170
01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:01.800
then let's factor that in.
Okay.
Then we come home and then,
okay,

1171
01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:04.950
let's say in the world your biggest problem is getting shot and dying.

1172
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:08.220
Your men getting shot and die.
Right?
Are you getting

1173
01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:12.990
both of your legs blown off or you know,
or whatever,
whatever the,
the,

1174
01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.500
your biggest problem is as far as weren't worrying about again,

1175
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:20.460
then you come home and on and all your girlfriend or your wife is like,
Hey,

1176
01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:23.530
I thought I told you to do those dishes.
And she's flipping out on you.
Yeah.

1177
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:26.550
And so in the back of your mind,
you're kind of like,
okay,
wait,

1178
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:30.630
the comparison that it was two days ago,
I was in the desert,

1179
01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:33.120
worried about my legs being blown off and now I'm here.

1180
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.920
We're apparently the biggest problem according to my girlfriend and life.

1181
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.250
Yeah.
The biggest problem on earth apparently.
Cause she's yelling at me,

1182
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:45.000
she's really mad,
she's mad,
she won't really talk to me and are the dishes.
Yeah.

1183
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.430
And it's just not computing,
you know?

1184
01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:51.840
And then you go next door and their biggest problem is kind on the same level.

1185
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:54.270
So yeah,
they don't understand.
And you,
in a way,

1186
01:21:54.271 --> 01:21:59.271
you're living in this crazy world where I can see how that could kind of get to

1187
01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:03.990
you and be like,
man,
am I wrong?
You know?
Yeah.
So one of the things that I,

1188
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.310
and you hear me talk about this before is perspective and wanting to see,

1189
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:09.960
I was talking about it from a leadership perspective.

1190
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:13.710
Like I want to think about what my superior is thinking.

1191
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:17.520
Why is he telling me do this?
Let me get his perspective and then what am I,

1192
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.910
what are my subordinates thinking,
what is their perspective?

1193
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:24.480
And it's a very useful tool to use in what you're talking about right now.

1194
01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:30.050
And I remember I had a situation like that where I was at work and I forget what

1195
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:33.750
was going on,
but something was going on.
Like I think we were,

1196
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:38.010
we were preparing to deploy guys earlier.
There's something major was going on.

1197
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.050
There were some major issues.

1198
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:44.060
I think it was Afghanistan and we were getting ready to deploy guys early.

1199
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.080
It was a real big spin up and all this stuff.

1200
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:50.520
And literally I come home and,

1201
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.900
and I mean I'm,

1202
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.510
I'm at work and we're trying to figure out how to put this plan together and

1203
01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:58.170
guys are going to point,
it's rich,
get a horrible and you know,

1204
01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.940
whatever bunch of stress.
I come home and I go,
hey babe,

1205
01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:06.070
you know how you're doing.
I sit on my wife and she's

1206
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.040
<v 4>sitting there and all of a sudden she like picks up the phone and someone calls</v>

1207
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:12.430
her or she,
someone calls her,
she picks up the phone and she hangs up.
She's like,

1208
01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:16.210
I can't believe this.
And I'm just like,
oh,
I thought something,
you know,

1209
01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:20.710
I thought someone died or whatever.
And I said,
I said,
well,
what's wrong,

1210
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:22.640
what's wrong?
And she said,
um,

1211
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:27.100
it was something that along with like the wiggles is the same night as Barney

1212
01:23:27.101 --> 01:23:28.390
and I booked both tickets.

1213
01:23:28.391 --> 01:23:33.010
So it was some things she was taking the kids to that like the literally did not

1214
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:36.580
matter in Amy way,
shape or form to me at all.
But to her,
you know,

1215
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:41.581
she had spent $22 on these tickets for three kids at the time at $66 and now she

1216
01:23:42.341 --> 01:23:46.060
had booked double booked the children for multiple shows.

1217
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.780
It was harsh,
dark.
But what I had to do,
his will,
I,
you know,

1218
01:23:50.781 --> 01:23:55.600
had to go and perspective in her own world,
man,
that was $66 right?

1219
01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.250
Yeah.
And it was the kids and it was,

1220
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.770
they both wanted to see all the shows or whatever the thing was.

1221
01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.250
So in her perspective,
in her part of the world,
that's a really big deal.

1222
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:08.080
And so that's,
I think something you're going to do as a,
as a,

1223
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:11.050
as a human.
Always look at what other people's perspectives are.

1224
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.760
And you know what if people are pissed off,

1225
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.100
if your wife's freaking out cause he didn't do the dishes,

1226
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.290
I got some really easy solution to that.
Do this,

1227
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.200
just do the dishes.
Yeah.
Good viewer.

1228
01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:26.770
It's put on some music and scrubs and pots and pans.

1229
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.390
Let's do this and you know what,

1230
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:32.140
I'll scrubs and pots and pans be happy to let's make this happen.
Yeah,

1231
01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:32.841
that's good man.

1232
01:24:32.841 --> 01:24:37.841
And you know that if you have the ability and kind of the wherewithal to do that

1233
01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:42.010
to really,
it's detaching you detach and looking at their situation,

1234
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:45.160
not looking at it from your own personal situation.

1235
01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.230
If you can manage to do that.
And I think it helps when someone reminds you like,

1236
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:53.020
just like how you say it right now,
and maybe someone will be like,
Hey,

1237
01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.360
you know what I mean?
Let me,
let me go ahead and remember that next time.

1238
01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.210
You know all this stuff and I say this to leaders all the time.

1239
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:00.110
When I go out and work with companies,
it,

1240
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:04.540
it's so much of it is just about awareness.
When you become aware of the problem,

1241
01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.900
you become aware of the mistake or you become aware of the solution and it's

1242
01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:09.700
there in front of you,
then it becomes very easy.

1243
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:13.870
The problem is you people aren't aware of how easy it can be to solve some of

1244
01:25:13.871 --> 01:25:18.340
these things if you just make this small adjustment to your mentality.
Yeah.

1245
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:23.341
All you're aware of is the fact that you're freaking steaming red lining for the

1246
01:25:24.131 --> 01:25:28.030
fifth time.
Your wife told you to do something when,
like I said,

1247
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:32.560
you're worrying about your guys getting killed.
Yesterday's it go.
Yeah.

1248
01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:36.460
As one of my buddies used to say when we were coming home from our first

1249
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:39.190
deployment,
he says,
can you believe this?

1250
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:44.380
Tomorrow we're going to get on an aluminum tube and we're going to wake up back

1251
01:25:44.381 --> 01:25:49.360
in San Diego.
I was like,
okay man,
take it easy.

1252
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:53.410
Take it easy bro.
Uh,
all right.

1253
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.960
Anything else here?
Yes,

1254

1256
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.090

Um,</v>

1257
01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.970
I prefer off brain and shroom tech.
What was it?

1258
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:15.440
What does that,
that Bar oh yeah.
Yeah.
The uh,

1259
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:19.040

this is the anti iDonate.
That's what I like about it.

1260
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:21.990
So the warrior bar,
it's like a,
it's like,

1261
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.770
it's like beef jerky with some spice in it,

1262
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.280
in some cranberries and it's tasty.
Yeah.
It's like the tender,

1263
01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.060
you don't have beef Jerky,
beef Jerky,
but there's that tender be one.

1264
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:34.500
The hand is,
it's,

1265
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:39.760
it tastes really good and like moist.
It's good.
It's not dried.
Right.

1266
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.290
So yeah,
get done with those.
Don't eat your donuts,

1267
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.810
get your warrior Barson and they're,

1268
01:26:43.811 --> 01:26:48.470
they're tasty and a beneficial short and long term benefits.

1269
01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:52.630
I like important to you thinking.
Yes.
Dang.
Warrior bar.
Yeah.

1270
01:26:52.631 --> 01:26:55.510

1271
01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:58.240
Hey,

1272
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:02.780

So yeah,

1273
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:05.930
you're going to get all of that and you can just get after him all day long

1274
01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:11.690
cause cause there you don't,

But you think,

1275

1276
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:18.230

And Click through Amazon.

1286
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.970
We've got some people posting what they're,
what they're buying through Amazon,

1287
01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:58.040
which is awesome.
Ah,
yes.
So yeah,

1288
01:27:58.041 --> 01:28:00.950

1289
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:05.750
just click on our link on Amazon and then do your shopping like you normally

1290
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:09.230
would.
Here's the thing,
I don't know if I told you is what I added,
cause

1291
01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:14.330
my friends on Twitter is troopers.
They,
um,

1292
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:18.620
a lot of people were indicating that they liked the books that you cover.

1293
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:21.500
They're like,
Hey,
let me,
you know,
get those books.
You know what you should do?

1294
01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:24.290
You should link,
you should have the list,

1295
01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:28.310
the library of books that you've covered in Lincoln.
So I guess what I did,

1296
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.460
Echo Scott neck makes things happen.
That's what I like.

1297
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:33.860
And now no one's on Jocko podcast.com on the top.

1298
01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:37.620
I added it on the menu where it says books.
It just his books or I dunno,

1299
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.360
it says books.
Okay.
And you click on there to have all the podcasts episodes,

1300
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:45.500
you know the book,
what podcast episode it was on.
You Click on it,
boom.

1301
01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:50.330
You can get it.
That's awesome.
All right,

1302
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:54.110
let's get to some questions.
Okay.
Question number one

1303
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000
is taking extreme ownership the same as apologizing for failures or for others'

1304
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:05.550
<v 4>mistakes.
I'm having difficulty separating these two concepts.</v>

1305
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:07.800
When I tried to take ownership over failures,

1306
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.990
does taking ownership of failure generally include in,
I'm sorry,
x occurred,

1307
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:15.330
et Cetera,
et Cetera?
Well,

1308
01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:22.780
it isn't just apologizing,
right?
It isn't just saying,
oh,
I apologize,

1309
01:29:22.781 --> 01:29:25.720
this happened.
It's part of it.
Part of ownership is apologizing.

1310
01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:28.510
If you make a mistake,
you got to own it.
And generally you got to say,
hey look,

1311
01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:31.300
I'm sorry this happened.
You got to own that.

1312
01:29:31.301 --> 01:29:34.300
There's been a problem or a mistake or an issue.

1313
01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:37.840
And that does include other people's mistakes,

1314
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:41.380
but you have to literally take ownership of them.

1315
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:46.980
You can't say,
Hey,
I'm sorry these other people made mistakes.

1316
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.390
That's not what I'm talking about.
And it's,
look,

1317
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:54.020
the mistakes that were made were actually my fault.
And,

1318
01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:58.350
and another important thing here is you can't just say,

1319
01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:00.840
hey guys,
it's all my fault.

1320
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.650
You actually need to mean it and you need to believe it yourself.

1321
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.400
You need to believe that you failed in the situation to do the right thing or

1322
01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:14.010
make something happen or make the right decision or make the right call or do

1323
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:16.050
the right preparation or whatever it is that you were supposed to do.

1324
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.470
You need to do that.
You need to believe that.

1325
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.920
You can't just say it and then you say,

1326
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:26.370
these mistakes were my fault.
Here's why it was my fault.

1327
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:30.390
And Yeah,
I'm sorry that these things happen.
I apologize with this happening.

1328
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:32.190
And some people see,

1329
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:37.110
sorry as a sign of weakness and,

1330
01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.300
and honestly there's some,
you know,

1331
01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:43.320
some legal situations you might be in or some negotiations that you might be in

1332
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:46.710
where that might be true.
But most of the time,

1333
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:51.711
especially in a working environment like inside of a team Saris.

1334
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:54.090
Okay.
And,
and in fact,

1335
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.040
an apology is often the first step in moving forward,

1336
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.470
right?
And,
and it's generally going to be a little bit of a blow to your ego

1337
01:31:06.730 --> 01:31:07.110
now.

1338
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:11.970
And that's especially true because you're Mr extreme ownership now or Mrs.

1339
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:15.810
Extreme ownership.
Guess what?
That doesn't mean everyone else's.
Not yet.

1340
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:17.760
They'll get there.
But they're not there yet.

1341
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.540
So you apologize to someone that's gonna be a big blow to your ego,

1342
01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:25.170
especially when someone says you're damn right.
That was your fault.

1343
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:29.310
That's,
that's gonna hurt your ear.
You're going to want to lash back out,

1344
01:31:29.311 --> 01:31:33.840
but you can't got to put your ego in check and you got to go,
Hey,

1345
01:31:33.841 --> 01:31:37.020
I understand that it is my fault.
You know why I'm saying it's my fault?

1346
01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:40.920
Because I truly believe it was my fault because it is because it is your fault.

1347
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:45.970
So you gotta be careful when someone gloats.
Don't let that get your head.
Um,

1348
01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.160
what,
that's what you have to do.

1349
01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.320
And it's not just not just for you that you're doing this.
It's because the team,

1350
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.530
because the team has to figure out what the problem is.

1351
01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:57.630
Someone's got to take ownership for the problem.
That's you.

1352
01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:01.240
And then that's how you get the problem solved.
And I'll tell you something else,

1353
01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:07.360
and you might have predicted this,
but my,
sorry.

1354
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:11.860
And my apology comes with something else.

1355
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.020
99% of the time.
Well,
and that's a good,

1356
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.990
right?
So look,
Hey,
I'm sorry that this happened.
This is my fault,

1357
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:26.680
but I'm glad it happened now.
Oh yeah.
Hey,
you know what?

1358
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:30.100
I'm glad we made this mistake.
We made this mistake.

1359
01:32:30.101 --> 01:32:32.860
Right now it's gonna set us back a little bit.
Good,
because we're now,

1360
01:32:32.861 --> 01:32:36.910
we're not gonna make it with a client.
Oh,

1361
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:40.600
this happened.
This part of the project fell apart.
Good.

1362
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:45.520
Now he can fix it and we know about it.
Oh,
this went sideways.

1363
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.870
I missed it.
Good.
I won't let it happen again.
So

1364
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:54.340
throw yourself a little good on the end of your,
sorry.

1365
01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:57.083
All right.

1366
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.230
<v 3>Yeah.
A lot of times those problems or mistakes or whatever the,</v>

1367
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.600
they add to that experience,
like the experience of being there.
You know,
we're,

1368
01:33:04.601 --> 01:33:07.780
we're,
let's say you go through a path and you make a wrong turn.

1369
01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.080
Now you have that experience that that's a wrong turn.

1370
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:13.990
That's what that looks like,
that that's what that feels like.
And guess what?

1371
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:17.800
We're going to avoid that in the future rather than a bunch of situation where

1372
01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:18.790
were,
for example,

1373
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:23.110
one in the future where it's more detrimental now you don't run into that.
Yeah,

1374
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:24.423
you learned,

1375
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:29.040
you'll learn exactly the video that said be good.

1376
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:32.530
You learn.
All right,
next question.

1377
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.800
Is there a way to be a straight shooter?
Oh,
sorry.

1378
01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:43.360
Is there a way to be straight shooter Jocko and not be a jerk or piss people

1379
01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.333
<v 4>off?</v>

1380
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:50.490
You know this is,
this is a touchy one

1381
01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.820
because everybody want,

1382
01:33:53.821 --> 01:33:58.650
everybody has so much respect for the straight shooter,
right?
Hey,

1383
01:33:58.651 --> 01:34:01.200
that guy's a straight shooter and you want to be a straight shooter.

1384
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.020
You don't want to be someone that you don't want to be the opposite.

1385
01:34:04.021 --> 01:34:07.080
What's the opposite of a straight shooter?
That's like a liar,
right?
Deceiver,

1386
01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.620
deceiver,
right?
Yeah,
so of course we want to be the straight shooter.

1387
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:14.460
Let me tell you,
it is very difficult to be a straight shooter with everybody.

1388
01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:19.380
Even when you have a tremendous relationship with somebody,

1389
01:34:19.410 --> 01:34:21.660
a tremendous relationship with somebody,

1390
01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:26.880
can you really be a straight shooter with them?
True straight shooter.

1391
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:32.210
I've been a true straight shooter with probably three or four people in my life,

1392
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:41.130
in my life.
I've been a straight shooter with maybe three or four people.

1393
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:45.720
That's off the top of my head.
But I'm just saying it's not a big number.

1394
01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:51.060
It's gotta be something that you are so in sync with,

1395
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.340
<v 3>man.
I'm thinking about that.</v>

1396
01:34:53.341 --> 01:34:58.090
I don't think that's even possible for me and my situation,
even though,
cause

1397
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.430
<v 4>it's hard to be a straight shooter with people.</v>

1398
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:01.490
Can you reconcile being a straight straight shooter?

1399
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:03.020
Now consider what that means,

1400
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:07.120
but to be a straight shooter with somebody at all times,
yes.

1401
01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:10.130
You can't really do though.
So what do we do instead?

1402
01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:14.100
You got to use the indirect approach.
The indirect approach,
and I'm,

1403
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:17.030
I'm talking about this all the time and this is a nuance that people,

1404
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.560
people will,
people come out on podcast 12 and they say,
hey,

1405
01:35:21.561 --> 01:35:24.820
I heard you say this or not.
I'm going to go remember that question we got asked.

1406
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:28.670
You know,
uh,
do you ever get told you're too direct and too intense?

1407
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:29.390
And it's like,
no,

1408
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.840
I don't get told that because I don't believe in being trying to be a straight

1409
01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:33.650
shooter with everybody.

1410
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:37.130
What I believe in is trying to get my message across to people so that it gets

1411
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:41.570
absorbed by them and the minute you straight shoot somebody,

1412
01:35:41.571 --> 01:35:43.370
they're defenses go up and he becomes problematic.

1413
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:48.320
So some indirect approaches are when you have these discussions with people,

1414
01:35:48.321 --> 01:35:52.250
when you use conversation to get your point across,
you know,
hey,

1415
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:55.370
I was looking at this and I was wondering what I could do better.
Can you,

1416
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.960
can you help me?
Or you know,
what can we do better?
You know,

1417
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:03.530
you throw in the,
the,
the we on it or you know what?
Then you say something like,

1418
01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:05.420
Hey,
you know,
you've got so much going on right now.

1419
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.580
Do you want me to take anything off your plate?

1420
01:36:07.581 --> 01:36:08.900
You want me to take that thing off your plate?
That,

1421
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:12.590
that's kind of like a small little detail.
Do you want me to handle that?

1422
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.450
Or you know,
hey,
it seems like you're having to micromanage this guy over here.

1423
01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:20.450
You want me to do you want to come over to go straighten that out and run that

1424
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:23.780
or it seems like this guy has taken up too much of your time.

1425
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:26.780
You want me to take that over or take that person over or

1426
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:31.250
you know what's a good one is,
hey,

1427
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:35.690
can you help me with my team members?

1428
01:36:35.691 --> 01:36:38.150
I just want to sit down with you and just like,

1429
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:41.540
have you talked to me about what you see in my team members?

1430
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.790
And then when you're,
you're,

1431
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:48.110
you're discussing your team members and other people,

1432
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:50.480
even your peers and what they do good and bad.

1433
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.500
But what you're really doing is you're just tossing some things their way,

1434
01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:58.820
some little things their way so that they understand and they,

1435
01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:02.180
and it's kind of like teaching Jujitsu,
right?
When you teach,
when you teach them,

1436
01:37:02.181 --> 01:37:05.720
oh,
teaching anything.
When you teach a move,
you learn it better,
right?

1437
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:09.500
If you make somebody teach a move,
they're going to learn it better.

1438
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:14.890
So when you make someone sit down with you and go through the issues that people

1439
01:37:15.021 --> 01:37:19.790
are having,
it actually makes them self reflect.
But they don't know it,

1440
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.290
but they reap the results.
They reap the results of it.
So that's a,

1441
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:28.260
that's a crafty one that I've used a bunch.
Um,

1442
01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:31.340
let's see.
Here's a good one.
I think I'm letting you down.

1443
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:33.770
I don't think I'm doing a good enough job.
You know,
it's like,

1444
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:38.270
I think I'm just be careful though,
without seems like if you,

1445
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:41.960
if you hit the wrong tone bel air,
because you gotta be careful of all of these.

1446
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:44.230
You've got to be tactful.
Yeah.
Uh,

1447
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.300
you can ask some more direct questions,

1448
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:52.190
but when you ask the more direct questions,
you got to be sort of,

1449
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:53.660
you've got to be true.
You gotta be,

1450
01:37:53.661 --> 01:37:57.960
you gotta come across as being very truthful in your,
in your inquisition.

1451
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:59.190
So for instance,
Hey,

1452
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:01.470
what was the strategy that you were thinking about over here?

1453
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.980
Like before this whole thing of fell apart and whatsapp are,
but you know,
hey,

1454
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.720
what are you thinking?
Or,
or,
Hey,
what was,

1455
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.130
what were you thinking about when you put this together?
Cause I,
I don't quite,

1456
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.200
I don't quite get it.
You gotta be careful.

1457
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:16.890
That's another one that had to be sensitive to that tone can come off bad.

1458
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:21.810
What were you thinking?
Right,
right,
right.
Hey,
hey,
you gotta,

1459
01:38:21.811 --> 01:38:23.020
you gotta be soft with you.

1460
01:38:23.021 --> 01:38:27.570
So it's much better to be indirect and most of these cases,

1461
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:31.050
and hopefully you can build relationships with people where you can be more

1462
01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:34.530
direct or you can get that conversation to be where it needs to be to where you

1463
01:38:34.531 --> 01:38:38.550
can get the key critical information across.
But it's very,
very challenging.

1464
01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:42.240
And again,
it's not that challenging.
It's not impossible.

1465
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:43.410
I did it with everybody all the time.

1466
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:48.630
I always had got my point across to people always,
you know,

1467
01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:53.100
and I'll tell you this is something when I would straight shoot somebody,

1468
01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:54.893
I would,

1469
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.220
and this is if I really needed to straight shoot somebody,

1470
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:04.970
I would write them a very lengthy email

1471
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:10.380
to say,
hey,
here's what's going on.
Here's what I'm saying.

1472
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:15.150
And I would really craft it with a lot of patients and,

1473
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.540
and then I would either do,
once I wrote the email,

1474
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:21.750
I would either use that and wouldn't send it,

1475
01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:23.400
but I'd use it as a guide to myself.
Like,
okay,

1476
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:26.280
this is the conversation I'm going to have or I'd send it to him for real.

1477
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:30.750
Like a DL note.
Yeah,
like a DL note.
You know,
I actually read one of those.

1478
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:34.590
I read one of those on,
on,
on um,
or two or the number five,

1479
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.070
I think it was number five.
That is one of those things that I did.
I said,
okay,

1480
01:39:38.071 --> 01:39:41.100
you know what?
I've got to help this guy out.
Got To be direct with them.

1481
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:43.560
He's making some mistakes.
I want them to do better.

1482
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:48.480
Here's a little deal note for you and get you squared away.
The thing is,
uh,

1483
01:39:48.690 --> 01:39:51.780
these,
this is definitely hard,
but it's not impossible.

1484
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:55.560
You got to just have the open mind.
You got to use your tack.
Do,

1485
01:39:55.561 --> 01:39:58.530
you got to use your judgment and you got to build relationships and have

1486
01:39:58.531 --> 01:40:02.880
conversations with people and,
and know what your intention is.

1487
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:07.380
In the conversation and just keep slowly moving in that direction.

1488
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:10.290
You know,
what a tip,

1489
01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:13.620
and I'm going to say this tip because I like when people do it to me when

1490
01:40:13.621 --> 01:40:18.621
they're like correcting me or or whatever is sprinkle in little comments about

1491
01:40:19.801 --> 01:40:24.480
the stuff that,
that they did.
Right?
Yeah.
That's,
that's a common practice.

1492
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.840
But when you do that though,
you add in this yet and,

1493
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:31.980
and that's what I like about you.
You do this,
you know,
so it's the,
you know,

1494
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:33.800
so if you add in,
that's what I like about two,

1495
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:37.770
it kind of individualizes that person.
Like I'm the guy who does that,
you know,

1496
01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:40.050
that good part.
So it gives them that confidence.
So it's kind of like,
yeah,

1497
01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:44.090
tell me more kind of,
kind of attitude.
And then at the end though,

1498
01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.670
in like something along the lines of like,
yeah,
good,
thanks.
You know,

1499
01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:50.600
thanks for the time or whatever and then be like,
I got your back.
Yeah.

1500
01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:52.170
Kind of leaf.
Yeah.
There's all kinds of,

1501
01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:55.750
we could go over techniques on all night long.
Those are both good ones.
Um,

1502
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:59.710
you know,
another one is like,
hey,
listen,
I think you can be a top performer here.

1503
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:02.670
I think you're going to,
this is,
if you're talking to someone that's,
you know,

1504
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:06.490
like a subordinate.
I think you could be a top performer here.
There's,

1505
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.940
here's what you're kicking ass at this,
this,
this and this.
Here's this,

1506
01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:14.530
these two things right here.
If we can get these fixed,
you're going platinum.

1507
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.720
<v 3>When we get these big things,
when we get positive,
look at you.</v>

1508
01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.950
I'm imagining in the sense of you telling me this in like Jujitsu or something.

1509
01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:27.330
Yeah,
yeah.
It's DVDs to say,
like when I'd be like,

1510
01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:31.770
Hey,
and I'd ask him to say I'm in this position and he'd be like,
be like,
yeah.

1511
01:41:31.771 --> 01:41:35.790
Then later on,
you know,
I text him,
it be,
hey,
thanks for going over this with me.

1512
01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:38.880
He's like,
yeah bro,
you don't keep it up and you can be like a world champion.

1513
01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:41.820
He just say that and I don't know who else.
He probably says that to everybody.

1514
01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:46.500
I Dunno.
He's never said that to me.
That's because we hate each other.

1515
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.580
But for that moment I'm like,
hell yeah.
You know,

1516
01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:53.670
like I hope he corrects me more.
I hope he tells me how to do this.

1517
01:41:53.671 --> 01:41:55.660
Cause he obviously believed just like,
are you saying,
you know,

1518
01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.560
you can be a top performer here.
I'd be like,
yeah,
tell me what else.

1519
01:41:58.561 --> 01:42:00.480
What can I do?
What can I do on this?
And actually,
yeah,

1520
01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:04.530
<v 4>the point that you're making is very good point,
which is um,</v>

1521
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:09.600
we know picture go into perspective of the other person and what is it going to

1522
01:42:09.601 --> 01:42:12.510
sound like to them.
And that's,
that's a smart thing to do.
So you're,

1523
01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:16.700
you're hearing what you would hear if you were them.
Yeah.

1524
01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:23.370
Yeah.
Indirect people be indirect.
It's harder,

1525
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:25.590
it's challenging,
it takes more time,

1526
01:42:25.591 --> 01:42:30.480
it takes more patients and it is way more effective fact.

1527
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:31.723
Yup.
Talked

1528
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:35.230
<v 3>about how before,
like some people they'll be like,
hey,
I'm just a,
I'm just,</v>

1529
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:36.610
I tell it how it is,
you know,

1530
01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:41.310
I tell her how it is and if you don't like it kind of thing and I go ahead and

1531
01:42:41.311 --> 01:42:43.240
do that.
But see how that works out for you.
You know?

1532
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:45.450
See how many people follow you.
See,
many people want to listen to you.

1533
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:47.430
You want to,
people want to be around you even,

1534
01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:51.740
<v 4>you know,
I liked the indirect approach to next question.</v>

1535
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:57.370
<v 3>Jacko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've learned from</v>

1536
01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.204
Jujitsu?

1537
01:43:02.610 --> 01:43:03.443
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1538
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:08.570
so Jujitsu emphasizes so much of what I believe that it's tough to narrow down,

1539
01:43:14.370 --> 01:43:15.203
but I will,

1540
01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:21.080
but I will throw some things out there that kind of are part of Jujitsu and are

1541
01:43:21.211 --> 01:43:25.020
part of what I believe.
Um,
first of all,

1542
01:43:25.021 --> 01:43:30.021
what we just talked about being indirect and indirect attacks flanking,

1543
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.000
that's what you have to do.
And you did too.
You have to set things up.

1544
01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.280
You have to detach.
You have to detach from the chaos and from the emotional.

1545
01:43:38.281 --> 01:43:40.170
You cannot get emotional on the mat,

1546
01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:43.410
attack the flanks and got to hit people where they aren't expecting it.

1547
01:43:43.411 --> 01:43:45.930
You got to have a plan,
but you gotta be ready to adapt.

1548
01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:48.750
You've got to constantly improve your position.

1549
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.100
You got to have fun while you're doing it.

1550
01:43:53.490 --> 01:43:55.590
You got to practice being in bad situations.

1551
01:43:55.591 --> 01:43:59.160
You got to make your training as realistic as possible,
right?

1552
01:43:59.161 --> 01:44:04.161
These are all things I talk about these in all aspects of combat and in business

1553
01:44:04.441 --> 01:44:05.760
and in life,

1554
01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:12.180
you gotta be physically fit so your mind stays sharp.
That's,
that's true.

1555
01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.390
True in Jujitsu.
It's true in combat.
It's true in life.

1556
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:20.730
You gotta know when to tap,
right?
You gotta know when to tap.

1557
01:44:20.731 --> 01:44:24.720
You've got a known to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the

1558
01:44:24.721 --> 01:44:29.410
whole war.
Get a train for worst case scenarios.

1559
01:44:29.411 --> 01:44:31.330
You've got to start with that person on your back.

1560
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:34.780
Got To start with a person with you in an arm lock

1561
01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.560
and training for combat.
You got to train for those wars.
Crease snooze.
Well,

1562
01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:41.370
you're outnumbered.

1563
01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:44.010
You got a bunkered position and they're shooting paint ball at you and you got

1564
01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:46.950
down men.
That's what you gotta do.
You gotta train for the worst case scenarios.

1565
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:48.960
And same thing with business.

1566
01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.080
I worked with like sales groups sometimes and they'll do role playing and I'll

1567
01:44:55.531 --> 01:44:56.190
say,
you know,

1568
01:44:56.190 --> 01:45:00.330
be the worst customer you can possibly be is that way when this person meets a

1569
01:45:00.331 --> 01:45:03.780
normal human,
they know how to knock it out of the park.

1570
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:06.240
Here's another one from Jujitsu.

1571
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:11.340
Basically don't judge a book by its cover,
right?

1572
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:15.660
Cause you don't know if the person that you're about to slap his Jeff Glover or

1573
01:45:15.661 --> 01:45:19.050
is dean lister or Jill tutor or Joel tutor,

1574
01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:23.190
you don't know what's going to happen.
So don't judge a book by its cover.
Yeah,

1575
01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:26.640
I mean,
Dean,
you'd be less apt to slap then you would Jeff Glover.

1576
01:45:26.641 --> 01:45:29.110
I guess that's a good point.
I mean,
you can kind of judge by the cover.

1577
01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.810
The cover is pretty evident,
but Jeffe or Joel.
Yeah.
You know,

1578
01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.680
those guys weigh 150 pounds and they're,
you know,

1579
01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:40.320
a surfer guy and uh,
and uh,
whatever Jeff is,

1580
01:45:40.321 --> 01:45:43.440
I don't know what genre of human you put Jeff into,

1581
01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:48.570
but you wouldn't think that he would throw a Darce choke on your face.

1582
01:45:51.210 --> 01:45:52.050
Uh,

1583
01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:57.720
so that's that prioritize and execute in the Jujitsu.

1584
01:45:57.750 --> 01:46:01.170
I mean,
we just talked about it 14 times tonight for combat.

1585
01:46:01.410 --> 01:46:02.760
Talk about in business all the time.

1586
01:46:02.761 --> 01:46:04.380
You got to make sure that the initiatives that you're running,

1587
01:46:04.381 --> 01:46:08.370
you don't have 38 initiatives and Jujitsu,
guess what?
You hear this all the time.

1588
01:46:08.610 --> 01:46:12.630
You get your,
you're about to get choked.
You got to protect your neck.
Number one,

1589
01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:13.860
you've got to protect your neck.

1590
01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:16.710
Then you can worry about your leg and then you can worry about your arm and the

1591
01:46:16.711 --> 01:46:18.150
hooks and everything else.
But you got to protect the neck.

1592
01:46:18.151 --> 01:46:21.900
You've got to prioritize,
prioritize,
got to keep things simple.

1593
01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:27.330
You got to create,
you've got to have an open mind.

1594
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:32.580
You gotta be creative and look for different ways to win and different things to

1595
01:46:32.581 --> 01:46:33.414
do.

1596
01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:39.050
You gotta make sure you don't get trapped into new ruts mentally trapped in a

1597
01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:42.960
row.
This happens to me,
everybody.
I think,
yeah,
it happens to me,

1598
01:46:42.961 --> 01:46:46.530
but I only know what I can tell you about me and that is I get trapped and ruts.

1599
01:46:46.531 --> 01:46:49.080
Would you Jitsu [inaudible] where I get,

1600
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:54.140
I get stuck in something and I'll just go with one move for a long period of

1601
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.960
time.
You gotta be careful that I need to be better about that.

1602
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.560
Discipline equals freedom.

1603
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:06.840
So with Jujitsu,
the more disciplined you are in training,

1604
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:13.650
the more freedom you have on the mat.
So the more you train,
the more you work,

1605
01:47:13.651 --> 01:47:17.940
the more you drill,
the more you can move,
the more you can escape,

1606
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:20.870
the more you can create,
the more you can finish.
Yup.

1607
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:25.580
<v 3>And not to mention the fear that it eliminates,
cause like,</v>

1608
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:26.443
you know how like lifting,

1609
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:28.550
you're not that discipline that you take home two weeks off.

1610
01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:30.170
A lot of them when you come back from that two weeks,

1611
01:47:30.171 --> 01:47:33.350
like you have that added element of nervousness like,
Dang,

1612
01:47:33.351 --> 01:47:35.610
am I going to gas or am I going to get,
you know,

1613
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.490
tapped out in front of everybody when you know,
when,
you know,

1614
01:47:40.491 --> 01:47:43.010
maybe there is a higher expectation on me or something like that.

1615
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:44.330
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
I don't have that.</v>

1616
01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:54.510
Yeah.
Some part of it though,
for sure.
Uh,

1617
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:57.500
but I would say the number one philosophical lesson,

1618
01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:02.660
I guess this is a philosophical lesson is the same thing that I learned from

1619
01:48:02.661 --> 01:48:07.661
combat and that's humility in Jujitsu is absolutely one of the most humbling

1620
01:48:09.141 --> 01:48:10.970
experiences in the world.
And we've actually,

1621
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:16.070
I got people now that have started Jujitsu cause the podcast and they say,

1622
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:20.660
oh I just did my first Jujitsu class.
Damn,
that was humbling.

1623
01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.220
It is extremely humbling.
You're going to get beat,

1624
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:26.990
you're never going to know everything.

1625
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:32.830
You're always going to be learning that there's other ways to do things and

1626
01:48:32.961 --> 01:48:37.010
somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques and that's

1627
01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:37.844
humbling.

1628
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:43.810
And there's other martial arts that have better moves that you need to pay

1629
01:48:44.331 --> 01:48:45.050
attention to.

1630
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:50.050
Like wrestling has better take downs like Samba with the leg locks and catch

1631
01:48:50.781 --> 01:48:51.470
wrestling.

1632
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:54.680
Some of those things that are better moves and you need to apply those.

1633
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:55.371
And guess what?

1634
01:48:55.371 --> 01:49:00.371
You still need to know how to strike because it can be hard to take people down.

1635
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:03.080
It's new,
didn't know how to,
how to strike,

1636
01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.920
and you can't be cocky and you can't be overconfident because the bottom line is

1637
01:49:06.921 --> 01:49:11.150
in Jujitsu you will get beat

1638
01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.600
and you will get beat by smaller guys,
by weaker guys,

1639
01:49:17.601 --> 01:49:19.610
by older guys,

1640
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:24.470
you're going to get beat and there's somebody that's better than you,

1641
01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.910
and if you don't like that or if your ego doesn't like that,

1642
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:36.820
then
you got to find a new game to play.
Yeah,

1643
01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:42.700
because you need to find a softer game or an easier game because Jujitsu is

1644
01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:47.950
honest.
Yeah,
and you escape that

1645
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.630
<v 3>and that's as it should be.
And it's of course this philosophical,</v>

1646
01:49:52.930 --> 01:49:57.930
this philosophy is something that I definitely carried over to combat and carry

1647
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:02.800
over to when I talked to businesses and carry over to life.

1648
01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:05.680
You can't be over coffee.
You,
you can't be over confident.

1649
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:09.970
You're never going to think you know everything.
You have to respect the enemy.

1650
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:13.750
That's part of humility.
You got to respect your,
if you're not humble,

1651
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:16.180
you don't respect your enemy,
you don't respect your opponent,

1652
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.400
you don't respect your competitor.
And if you don't,

1653
01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:25.540
that's when you're going to get caught.
So to me,

1654
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:30.570
humility is the most important thing that Jujitsu teaches you.

1655
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:37.150
Yeah.
And it's kind of a can be kind of a not a trick.

1656
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.660
Yeah.
I'm gonna call it a trick because Kay,

1657
01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.990
you gotta you gotta maintain the humility.
Right.

1658
01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:47.140
But that humility will be tested if you stick with it.
So,

1659
01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.790
and I'll tell you a little quick story about that test being bestowed upon me.

1660
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:58.150
It was like a little after I got my purple belt else really,

1661
01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:02.530
like I really hit my stride.
I was competing a lot in weaning and,
um,

1662
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:06.030
and you were training with me a lot back.
Yes.
That was,

1663
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:09.730
that was right at that time when I was training with you and you are,

1664
01:51:09.731 --> 01:51:11.830
you know what I,
you know,
if,
if there was a,

1665
01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.550
there was a little bit of mentorship going on.
Mentorship.
Yeah.

1666
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:20.590
That was the exact time.
And,
um,
and I was like,
yeah,
that I started to kind of,

1667
01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:25.180
you know,
giving into my own hype,
you know,
like,
Oh,
I'm the man,
and not outwardly,

1668
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.020
but on the inside and um,
and,

1669
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:31.720
and just fun Ju Ju Jitsu man gets cocky on the inside,
on the inside.
Yeah.

1670
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.950
And here's the thing,
a lot of people,
that's how you know it.
In fact,

1671
01:51:35.951 --> 01:51:38.260
a little bit of that is good because you get that confidence,

1672
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.740
that hunger to even learn more and be better.
Um,

1673
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:45.070
so I had that and then Greg and enrolled with Craig since I w I didn't know him

1674
01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:48.880
as good,
but I knew him,
but not as good as I do now.
And last time,

1675
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:50.380
I want to say the last time I rolled with him,

1676
01:51:50.381 --> 01:51:55.150
I was a white belt long time ago and he just would destroy me.
So I was like,

1677
01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.790
Greg,
like,
oh yeah,
hey,
you know,
congratulations to,
you know,

1678
01:51:57.791 --> 01:51:59.830
you've been winning and stuff like that.
I was like,
Oh yeah.
He's like,
all right.

1679
01:51:59.890 --> 01:52:03.650
Yeah,
let's,
let's roll.
So I'm like,
all right,
let me,
shit what,
yeah.

1680
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:07.000
I'm thinking in my mind.
Yeah,
I've been winning here.

1681
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:08.920
Let me go ahead and show you my new stuff.
You know,

1682
01:52:08.921 --> 01:52:11.050
it's going to show Greg in my own mind,

1683
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:16.290
and Greg took me like I was a white belt again,
immediately,
the kind of word,

1684
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.570
literally nothing.
I did work in everything.
He did work.
He was like,

1685
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:22.860
it's like he did a step one,
step two,
step three,
tap me out.

1686
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:24.310
Still wants them to say tap me out.

1687
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:30.390
And that was the time where I got put from like the top of the mountain in my

1688
01:52:31.631 --> 01:52:35.380
own head.
Right to the bottom of the mountain.
Literally to the bottom.
Not to,

1689
01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:38.330
not almost at the bottom to the bottom of the mountain.
Yeah,
that's,
that's,

1690
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:41.740
it's actually,
it's actually so good when that happens.

1691
01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.450
And actually it's something I,
I occasionally Jujitsu,

1692
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.000
<v 4>super humbling.
Occasionally you get someone that</v>

1693
01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:55.370
is really,
really good and they don't recognize,

1694
01:52:55.371 --> 01:52:57.650
they don't come up against people all the time that are,

1695
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:03.160
they don't come up against people very often that are better than them.
Yeah.

1696
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:06.980
Most people in the beginning you have,

1697
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:09.620
you have several years of of being beat down,

1698
01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:13.340
but occasionally get somebody that's a great wrestler or maybe they were a judo

1699
01:53:13.341 --> 01:53:14.031
player or something,

1700
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:16.940
so they come into the game or they're just super strong or they're just a freak

1701
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:19.400
athlete and so they very quickly,

1702
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.500
you don't want a matter of six months to a year,

1703
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:25.130
all of a sudden they're doing really well.
Yeah.
Sometimes those people,

1704
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:28.770
sometimes those people mentally,
they might be good at Jujitsu,
but they,

1705
01:53:28.771 --> 01:53:29.570
they don't,

1706
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:34.340
they don't mentally get it and they become really bullies and that's a,
that's,

1707
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:36.860
that's one of the,
it doesn't happen that often,
like I said,

1708
01:53:36.861 --> 01:53:40.430
but it does occasionally happen where you get somebody that just is a dominant

1709
01:53:40.431 --> 01:53:43.850
force,
they don't get humbled enough and,

1710
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:47.710
and they don't because even if you don't actually get humbled Jujitsu,

1711
01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.460
normally in the beginning you learn like,
oh,

1712
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:52.940
because one of the things I say to people is,
I'm not,
you know,

1713
01:53:52.941 --> 01:53:56.870
because I can tap you.
It doesn't mean that I'm a better human than you.

1714
01:53:57.130 --> 01:54:00.230
It just means I trained more Jiu Jitsu than you.
There's,
you know what I mean?

1715
01:54:00.231 --> 01:54:01.280
That's all it means.

1716
01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.150
And that means that someone else was training Jiu Jitsu more than me and they

1717
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:06.890
can beat me.
And that's just what it is.

1718
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:12.080
But sometimes people think that because they can tap somebody out that they're

1719
01:54:12.081 --> 01:54:15.500
better than them.
Yeah.
As a human,
yeah.

1720
01:54:15.501 --> 01:54:18.830
There is a superiority that's not a good attitude to have.

1721
01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.240
That's not what you did to,
should be about.
Yeah.

1722
01:54:21.241 --> 01:54:22.720
And let's go with a lot of times because they,

1723
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.800
and this is just kind of a one way to put it,

1724
01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.460
they don't pay their dues so to speak.
Right.
You know,
like a normal,

1725
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:30.890
they don't get the humility lesson over and over and over again.

1726
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:32.090
They get it like a few times,

1727
01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:35.960
but then they overcome it quickly and it outweighs that outweighs.
Yup.

1728
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:40.580
So you gotta be careful of that.
And so just,
just be,

1729
01:54:40.581 --> 01:54:43.820
just be careful that if you're,
if you're a person that's naturally really adept,

1730
01:54:43.821 --> 01:54:48.660
that Jujitsu,
make sure you're not getting,
uh,
turning into a bully.
Yeah.

1731
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:51.470
And a lot of times that can block you from learning.

1732
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.390
Oh it definitely box cause it's like why would I,

1733
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:56.660
why would I start learning all this Weirdo game?
Like if you're strong wrestler,

1734
01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:59.150
like why would I start learning bottom game?
Yeah.

1735
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:03.170
If when I'm killing with all this other stuff because there's someone that's a

1736
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:04.580
better wrestler than you.
Yeah.

1737
01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:08.750
That's why we're just knows the combination because a lot of times certain guys

1738
01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:13.460
they'll,
they'll know the combo to beat wrestling without having to do wrestling.

1739
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:15.350
Yeah.
Make some guys that they're just like that,
you know?

1740
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:19.700
So part of it Jujitsu.

1741
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.890
Okay,
next question.

1742
01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:27.460
Have you ever been so dug in on a solution or an opinion that it felt impossible

1743
01:55:27.681 --> 01:55:30.020
to admit that you are in fact wrong?

1744
01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:35.210
So I actually almost gave up on this question and

1745
01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:37.940
because it's been,

1746
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:42.440
I learned this lesson a long time ago that again,

1747
01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.500
the humility that you get from Jujitsu and from combat and from life is that I

1748
01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:53.001
very seldom dig in on something that I'm not a hundred percent sure of.

1749
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:58.470
[inaudible] which means I don't dig in on the locks.
I'm not 100% sure of much.

1750
01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:03.030
Right.
Who can be 100% sure of a lot of things and when I do do that,

1751
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:06.540
it's not that hard for me to realize that a wrong stifle my ego,

1752
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.850
admit it and change course,
it's not that big of a deal to me.

1753
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:14.490
When I,
like I said,
when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision,

1754
01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:16.410
it's because I know

1755
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:20.820
like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right.

1756
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:23.390
Otherwise I'm going to leave myself a little bit of an out.

1757
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:29.160
I'm not going to just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because

1758
01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:31.800
why would I,
why would I do that?

1759
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:36.870
Now when I end up being wrong,
if I do take a stance on something,

1760
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:37.704
it's no big deal.

1761
01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:41.610
I'm going to use that as an opportunity to show that I'm humble and show that I

1762
01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:44.940
can admit when I'm wrong,
I'm going to take advantage of it.
Good and wrong.
Good.

1763
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.820
And you know,
so I would say just keep your options open.

1764
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.940
Keep an open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in,

1765
01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:03.590
just check yourself and admit that you're wrong and move on.

1766
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.820
And one thing I think that happens with people is people think that digging in

1767
01:57:15.090 --> 01:57:20.090
and having a strong 100% opinion makes them appear stronger or it makes their

1768
01:57:20.431 --> 01:57:23.520
idea appear stronger.
But I don't think so.
I don't,

1769
01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.690
I'm not saying to be wishy washy on stuff,
I'm just saying no,

1770
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.610
I have an open mind because I think that's the ultimate strength.

1771
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.340
That's kind of my opinion.
I mean,
the last time I came close to digging in,

1772
01:57:35.341 --> 01:57:40.020
I was advising a company and they were going through some rough,

1773
01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.400
a little bit of a rough patch,

1774
01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:46.410
and they started multiple initiatives to try and turn some,
some things around.

1775
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:50.160
And one of the initiatives of all the initiatives,

1776
01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:53.850
there was a couple that the CEO wanted done immediately and two of those

1777
01:57:53.851 --> 01:57:56.850
initiatives,
when I looked at them,
I thought it,

1778
01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.830
I thought that they were redundant and so I said,
look,
I wouldn't waste,

1779
01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:04.110
I wouldn't do both these initiatives.
Just pick one.

1780
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:05.340
I think this one's the better one,

1781
01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.320
just do this one and I think it will cover the problem.

1782
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.760
And I convinced him and it was pretty easy to convince them because they were

1783
01:58:11.761 --> 01:58:14.910
had limited resources at the time and limited assets.

1784
01:58:14.911 --> 01:58:16.890
So it wasn't like they had a bunch of stuff to spread around,

1785
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.680
but he was pretty set on it.
But I convinced him otherwise and he agreed.

1786
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:24.681
And within a matter of days it started to look like I was wrong and it started

1787
01:58:24.901 --> 01:58:25.770
to look like both systems.

1788
01:58:25.771 --> 01:58:30.330
We're going to be needed to solve that specific issues.
So I didn't like,

1789
01:58:30.331 --> 01:58:34.320
wait,
I didn't say,
oh,

1790
01:58:34.321 --> 01:58:37.350
I hope that things go.
I said,
look,
Hey,
I think I was wrong about this.

1791
01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.940
I think you were right.
Uh,

1792
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.410
let's get the other initiative going and let's get this problem covered.

1793
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.370
And that's it.
And I'm telling you,

1794
01:58:45.371 --> 01:58:50.200
he didn't lose respect for me because I said,
hey,
I'm wrong.

1795
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:54.820
After a few days of watching what the results are and making an early decision,

1796
01:58:55.390 --> 01:59:00.040
he actually thought it was awesome and he,
and he knew.
He was like,
Hey,
I wish,

1797
01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:03.160
I wish everyone could admit when they were wrong like that he would make

1798
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:04.420
everything around here so much easier.

1799
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:06.120
And I said well that's why I'm here in the first place.
Right.

1800
01:59:06.690 --> 01:59:08.560
Is to help with that.
So

1801
01:59:10.590 --> 01:59:15.030
just be cautious when you dig in.
You know,
cause when you dig in you're actually,

1802
01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:19.380
when you dig in you're taking away your ability to maneuver.
Yeah.

1803
01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:23.790
You don't want to do that.
It's good.
So,
so watch out

1804
01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:26.653
<v 2>now</v>

1805
01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:32.240
<v 4>should I read this question because this is a question for Echo Charles.</v>

1806
01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.840
So that means I get you,
we'll just part of it.
It's two questions actually,

1807
01:59:35.841 --> 01:59:39.650
but I put them together cause they're pretty close.
Jocko Willink.

1808
01:59:39.710 --> 01:59:42.380
What brought you an echo Charles together.

1809
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:48.050
Can we get the backstory there?
I like the chemistry echo.

1810
01:59:48.051 --> 01:59:51.740
Charles,
question for you to answer on Jocko podcast.

1811
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:56.770
What have you learned from Jocko and how has your life changed since this is

1812
01:59:59.061 --> 02:00:01.700
Echo's?
First response to a question.

1813
02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.720
Don't screw it up.
Here we go.
I can heckle you.

1814
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:10.390
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
of course.</v>

1815
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:13.850
Which is funny cause that's kind of how what brought us together.

1816
02:00:13.851 --> 02:00:15.220
We're a part of what brought us together.

1817
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:19.450
And I think it's good that I answered this part because you probably remember a

1818
02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:20.860
lot less of it.
So

1819
02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:23.773
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1820
02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:29.980
<v 3>I would say it was oh six.
I see.
I'd seen you like the,
the first,</v>

1821
02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:34.540
you know,
whatever within the first year of,
of joining with Dean and oh five.

1822
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.550
But I didn't know you didn't talk to you or nothing like that.

1823
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:41.290
I just said heard of you from dean.
Um,
and then in like,

1824
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.770
oh six when we moved over to the boxing club,
I rolled with you one time.

1825
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:49.180
I was still a white belt and uh,
so that could have been still owe five,

1826
02:00:49.181 --> 02:00:52.090
I don't know.
And then,
you know,
you beat me up and you,
you kind of,

1827
02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.080
you were just more like a,
this stoic guy basically.

1828
02:00:56.081 --> 02:00:59.980
I would imagine the same guy that people interpret you to be from the outside,

1829
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:04.210
you know,
Kinda like,
not intense,
but just real like oil,
just real matter of fact,

1830
02:01:04.211 --> 02:01:08.220
you know?
Um,
so you beat me up or whatever.
And then I was,
so I,

1831
02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.960
since I had already heard of you,
you were deans black belt and you know,

1832
02:01:10.961 --> 02:01:14.650
all this stuff that I was like,
yeah,
that's about right.
You know,
he's,
you know,

1833
02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.630
good,
you just do whatever beat me up.

1834
02:01:16.631 --> 02:01:20.040
But that wasn't really saying much cause everyone was beating me up and then,
um,

1835
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.930
time went on.
I didn't see you for awhile.
And then,
um,

1836
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:28.780
when I started to kind of get golf,
I was trained with Brent.
Brent.
Yeah.

1837
02:01:29.130 --> 02:01:32.590
I was training with him and then with Ileus a little bit and then you'd come

1838
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:37.030
back,
I was competing and then you are just around for whatever reason.
Um,

1839
02:01:37.210 --> 02:01:38.080
and then yeah,

1840
02:01:38.081 --> 02:01:42.630
I just started training with and think that's when we opened victory.
Right?
Yes.

1841
02:01:42.631 --> 02:01:46.880
There's around the same time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
And then,
um,
yeah,

1842
02:01:46.881 --> 02:01:51.550
what was funny is that you never came off.
Like once they knew you,

1843
02:01:51.551 --> 02:01:54.860
like immediately you never came off as this super intense person.

1844
02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:58.430
Like it was more like you were just sarcastic,
like,
well,
you know,
like any other,

1845
02:01:58.470 --> 02:02:01.250
uh,
any other of my friends.
But

1846
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.130
you could still always tell that there was something behind the scenes,
you know,

1847
02:02:06.131 --> 02:02:08.510
you know,
Darrel Rogan said like he's seen you and he was like,

1848
02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:10.770
there's one thing to note with this guy,
you know,
he's like,

1849
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:14.060
he's kind of got that same feeling,
but you were always just like,
oh yeah,

1850
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:17.630
this real matter of fact,
but fun,

1851
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:22.040
funny like kind of person or whatever.
Like,
but when I say matter of fact,

1852
02:02:22.041 --> 02:02:25.890
I mean like,
um,
like that one,
this one tournament when,
uh,

1853
02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.200
it was kind of later where I lost two Sean Roberts and he got me with a Gogo

1854
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.000
Plata and you know,
when you lose in Jujitsu,

1855
02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:36.740
and that was the first time I lost in since I went advanced,
you know,

1856
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:40.210
cause I was doing a lot of Nogi I had never lost and Sean Roberts gives me with

1857
02:02:40.211 --> 02:02:43.820
a Google Plata.
So instead of you saying,
Hey,
you know,

1858
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:45.810
it's okay or nothing like that,
you send me a text,

1859
02:02:45.811 --> 02:02:48.500
you're sitting across the arena,
you're right there.
You send me a text,
hey,

1860
02:02:48.501 --> 02:02:51.230
you got caught with a Gogo that's got a stick.

1861
02:02:52.130 --> 02:02:56.310
<v 4>This is a tournament.
It's not a practice,
you can say that.
I was like,
ah,</v>

1862
02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:00.160
<v 3>whatever.
But I think that,
um,
that,
you know,</v>

1863
02:03:00.161 --> 02:03:02.670
training together and just kind of getting,
you know,
you,

1864
02:03:02.671 --> 02:03:06.880
you kind of had that thing that you could say that kind of stuff because really

1865
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:11.810
it's not that serious,
you know?
Yeah.
I don't think,
I don't think there's a,

1866
02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.370
there's not many people who could have conveyed that though,
you know,
it,
um,

1867
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:19.600
I think it had to come from you anyway.
So yeah,

1868
02:03:19.601 --> 02:03:23.700
that's kind of how we met.
And then,
um,

1869
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:28.600
kind of after a while,
how did the idea of a podcast come up?

1870
02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:30.910
Cause we kind of talked about it

1871
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:33.580
<v 4>that a little bit before,
I forget the formation,</v>

1872
02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.050
but it was in my mind when I went on Joe Rogan's,
I think we had talked about,

1873
02:03:38.051 --> 02:03:41.800
hey,
you know,
we should do something.
I think you said to me like,
Hey,

1874
02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:44.710
you should do it.
And so when I went on Joe Rogan's and he said,

1875
02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.320
you should do a podcast.
I think what Tim Ferriss said,
hey,

1876
02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:52.720
you should do a podcast.
And then I kind of be you being a techie sound guy,

1877
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:56.170
video guy.
I just said,
hey,
do you know how to make a podcast?
That's right.

1878
02:03:56.290 --> 02:03:59.080
I just said,
hey,
how do you knew how to make a podcast?
So I need to make one.

1879
02:03:59.530 --> 02:04:03.040
Yeah.
Cause everything to be is just a total caveman.
Right.

1880
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:07.090
How do you do I need a tape recorder?
What do I need?
You know,
that's what my,

1881
02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:11.920
and so then you said,
yeah,
I know,
I know how to do that.
I could make that happen.

1882
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:17.370
And then you said it'd be cool instead of just you sitting there talking if you

1883
02:04:18.311 --> 02:04:20.680
had someone to talk to.
And I said,
yeah,
you're right.
That would be cool.

1884
02:04:20.710 --> 02:04:24.590
And then you'd said it'd be cool if it was me.
Well My,

1885
02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.020
my selling point was that strange.
If it's just you right

1886
02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.130
<v 3>sitting there,
you know,
it's,</v>

1887
02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:34.260
it's more strange and it's better if you have someone to kind of bounce things

1888
02:04:34.261 --> 02:04:36.960
off of.
I suppose just someone who can kind of be like,

1889
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:38.370
oh I'm just an everyday guy.
Like,

1890
02:04:38.371 --> 02:04:41.490
so I can like ask questions to kind of reiterate the point in which to someone

1891
02:04:41.491 --> 02:04:44.600
who might not get it.
Yeah.
I had it all thought out,
you know,

1892
02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:48.630
in my mind I did anyway.
Um,
but yeah,
then yeah,

1893
02:04:48.850 --> 02:04:53.280
obviously Joe Rogan was kind of the tipping point when he suggested it.
Yeah.

1894
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:57.570
Yeah.
No,
that was good.
Great insight from Joe Rogan and I'm glad he did.

1895
02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:02.520
And I'm glad you did it.
I'm,
Oh God,
we did make this podcast happen.

1896
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:06.660
So to answer the question,
what have I learned?
Um,

1897
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.380
and this is interesting cause I asked myself this exact same question like,

1898
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:14.670
like a week ago because I am literally a different person now in ways that kind

1899
02:05:14.671 --> 02:05:18.690
of are kind of surprising in a way.
So I took the first thing that's Kinda,

1900
02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:22.830
kinda not that surprising,
but um,
it's,

1901
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:25.440
it's very prevalent is when people blame.

1902
02:05:25.441 --> 02:05:29.610
When I see people blaming other people or blaming me or I feel the compulsion to

1903
02:05:29.611 --> 02:05:34.290
blame someone else,
it stands out like a sore thumb.
Almost.
Like if,

1904
02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:39.220
if I'm feeling that and it like,
almost like if I want to say something to,

1905
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.100
to indicate that I'm going to blame somebody or something,

1906
02:05:41.101 --> 02:05:45.150
it's almost like a red flag.
Like I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind.

1907
02:05:45.151 --> 02:05:48.630
It's like this hard and fast rule.
And like I said,

1908
02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:53.490
they just stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV,
you know,
the guy,

1909
02:05:53.550 --> 02:05:55.920
not even my conversation.
Oh,
I see what you're doing right there.
You know?

1910
02:05:56.490 --> 02:05:57.323
So it's like,

1911
02:05:57.690 --> 02:06:02.310
it's like your whole way of life in that regard is just shifted extreme

1912
02:06:02.311 --> 02:06:04.380
ownership and the awareness of that,

1913
02:06:05.070 --> 02:06:08.520
seeing it in other people or lack of it and other people definitely stands out

1914
02:06:08.521 --> 02:06:10.980
like crazy once you start thinking about it.
Yeah.

1915
02:06:10.981 --> 02:06:14.790
And I have the luxury of being around you talking about these things,

1916
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:19.350
talking about examples of it every week,
right?
So throughout the week I'm like,

1917
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:22.190
I can't even help but notice it,
you know,
and it's Friday.

1918
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.080
It helps men because it applies to everyone who'd been everything.

1919
02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:27.750
Like most relationships are going to apply these principles,
you know,

1920
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:32.640
if you're involved in them.
Um,
so yeah,
it's all automatic now.
So,

1921
02:06:32.670 --> 02:06:36.540
so when it comes to ownership and really blaming myself,

1922
02:06:36.541 --> 02:06:41.070
if anyone and focusing on my responsibility in any scenario,

1923
02:06:41.071 --> 02:06:44.580
whatever it comes automatic now I would say is a huge step.
I mean,

1924
02:06:44.581 --> 02:06:45.840
whether I make the right choices,

1925
02:06:45.841 --> 02:06:48.570
that's always going to be a work in progress I think.

1926
02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.650
But as far as that attitude,
it's automatic.
No,

1927
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:58.230
that's awesome.
And then,
um,
in regards to,
okay,

1928
02:06:58.231 --> 02:07:03.231
so I've always been into working out and so me not feeling like working out is,

1929
02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.360
I've always felt like working out.
So

1930
02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:14.610
as far as not feeling like it,
that wasn't really a factor.

1931
02:07:14.611 --> 02:07:19.470
But in a bunch of other things in life it was a factor.
And so,

1932
02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:24.810
and so you're saying we not feeling like doing Y or z?

1933
02:07:25.050 --> 02:07:26.360
Yeah.
Like,
oh,
I got to,

1934
02:07:26.890 --> 02:07:29.430
I got to go to the post office today and that's on the low end.
And then,

1935
02:07:29.431 --> 02:07:34.060
or the other one is,
I dunno,
I gotta I dunno,
something more important.
Right.

1936
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:38.050
But maybe I'll wait,
I'll wait until really the last minute or you know,

1937
02:07:38.051 --> 02:07:42.370
procrastination type stuff.
So you're getting into the here and now.
Yeah.

1938
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:45.850
And not feeling like it.
That means absolutely,
you know,
absolutely nothing.

1939
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:48.450
It's something needs to be done and I don't feel like it.

1940
02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:50.230
And you know how like you have,

1941
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:54.400
you have the certain ideas already and then other ideas are introduced and then

1942
02:07:54.401 --> 02:07:57.910
those ideas kind of mingle with your existing ideas and they formulate this

1943
02:07:57.911 --> 02:08:02.860
whole new course of action.
Right.
So the not feeling like it is no excuse.

1944
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:06.070
That idea came in and so now I'm like,

1945
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:10.250
it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who gets what I'm going

1946
02:08:10.251 --> 02:08:11.710
to do,
I'm going to do it right.
Also,

1947
02:08:11.770 --> 02:08:15.460
it's almost like this personal challenge now you know?
And Man,

1948
02:08:15.461 --> 02:08:19.240
as far as results go,
man,
you get everything done.
I hit,

1949
02:08:19.241 --> 02:08:22.150
eats up so much stuff done and it's not so probably compared to you,

1950
02:08:22.151 --> 02:08:23.290
it's nothing.

1951
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:27.160
But I get stuff done like so many things done during the day that I had never

1952
02:08:27.161 --> 02:08:30.030
thought that I could do that many things in a day.
That's awesome.
All,

1953
02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.950
I was always looking for maybe a rest or a nap or something like that.

1954
02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:37.660
But now every once in a while I'll be challenging myself to do as many things as

1955
02:08:37.661 --> 02:08:40.000
I can.
It'd be like solid and on top of that.

1956
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:43.980
And you're the one who said this was,
um,
one time,
one of the things,

1957
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.660
you were kind of tired and you were like,
you know what?
But I liked this.

1958
02:08:46.690 --> 02:08:48.730
I liked just grinding and grinding and grinding.

1959
02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:50.860
And then at the end of the day when I go home,

1960
02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:54.250
go to bed where my head just crashes into the pill.
I liked that.
And I was like,

1961
02:08:54.251 --> 02:08:58.150
yeah,
that sounds nice.
You know?
So when I approach things like that now,

1962
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:04.430
and also I think of all the good things that have been done,

1963
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:06.430
great things and just good things,
whatever,

1964
02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:09.640
if these people didn't do it because they didn't feel like it,

1965
02:09:10.110 --> 02:09:12.550
I think these things wouldn't have got done,
you know?

1966
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:18.340
So if you've got stuff to do,
you do it whether you feel like it or not.

1967
02:09:18.341 --> 02:09:22.000
That's what I have for myself now.
Um,
and the last thing

1968
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:26.530
is,
I kind of knew this,
but man,

1969
02:09:26.531 --> 02:09:31.531
it's so clear now that you can get certain messages and information and tips and

1970
02:09:31.931 --> 02:09:36.910
tactics and stuff from,
from people or the internet or books or whatever.

1971
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:40.600
But if you're not ready to accept them,

1972
02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:45.280
you just won't accept them.
Or they'll just go in one ear and out the other.

1973
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:47.920
And a lot of times that has to do with Hussein it.
So

1974
02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:53.620
if like,
I don't know your neighbor some goof off,
he's drinking a beer,

1975
02:09:53.621 --> 02:09:57.520
smoking a cigarette,
he's like,
Hey,
guess what?
You know,
you should do this.

1976
02:09:57.521 --> 02:09:59.590
And it's the,
it can be this great advice,
but you can be like,

1977
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.050
I'm not going to listen to you.
I'm not even gonna listen to you.

1978
02:10:02.051 --> 02:10:03.640
I'm not even get past that part.

1979
02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.150
The fact that you're the one that's saying this already walked me off from what

1980
02:10:07.151 --> 02:10:09.700
you have to say.
And that's natural I think.

1981
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:12.700
But a lot of these things,

1982
02:10:12.701 --> 02:10:16.390
like you're reading these old books that have these messages that you've been

1983
02:10:16.391 --> 02:10:18.880
saying,
so it's not new stuff.
And a lot of stuff,

1984
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:22.270
like I heard that take responsibility for your actions.
Yeah.
How's that?
Yeah.

1985
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:26.860
That's not new.
If I bust out,
hey,
hey,
you guy had on the street,

1986
02:10:26.861 --> 02:10:28.930
take responsibility for your actions.
If something comes up,

1987
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:31.660
I'm just saying he'd be like,
yeah,
that's nothing new.
It wouldn't stand out.

1988
02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:35.750
But for some reason when you're saying it,
it gets you think,
yeah,

1989
02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:39.800
let me take responsibility.
You know,
so that,
so yeah.

1990
02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:44.120
It say when it comes to listening to you,

1991
02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:45.980
this podcast,
all the,
you know,
the,

1992
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:49.940
the answers that you have for these questions and any questions I even have,

1993
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:55.510
it seems like it comes and I process it way more readily than,

1994
02:10:56.030 --> 02:11:00.700
you know,
memes on Facebook or wherever,
you know.

1995
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:06.350
So,
yeah.
That's awesome.
Pretty true.
See,
that's really cool.
That's,

1996
02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:08.090
that's great to hear.
And I've,
I mean,

1997
02:11:08.091 --> 02:11:13.091
I've definitely seen a transition in everything you're doing.

1998
02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:13.911
I mean,

1999
02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:18.770
everything you're doing is spot on and that's legit.

2000
02:11:19.290 --> 02:11:20.480
It's legit to see.

2001
02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:25.820
It's legit to see someone moving towards their potential as a human.
Yeah.

2002
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:30.680
That's awesome to see.
And another thing that kind of a,

2003
02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:35.480
I came to as not a conclusion but it,
which is a result,

2004
02:11:35.481 --> 02:11:37.400
it's not a direct,
like you didn't tell me this,

2005
02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:41.600
but this is what all my existing thoughts mixed with all your input kind of

2006
02:11:41.601 --> 02:11:45.860
arrived at.
One of the things is that it's up to you.

2007
02:11:45.861 --> 02:11:50.861
It's up to me what I spend my time doing totally up to me and it's up to me what

2008
02:11:52.851 --> 02:11:56.060
I feel my head filled my head with.
So you know,

2009
02:11:56.140 --> 02:11:57.710
like I used to have these shows that I love to,

2010
02:11:57.711 --> 02:12:01.600
I love the watch Hawaii five o and shark tank and that's Kinda it.

2011
02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:03.470
I don't really watch that much TV,
but those two

2012
02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.190
that's maybe you know,

2013
02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.090
two hours or so that I could be reading something that's going to help me

2014
02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:14.570
through the rest of my life or getting better at something that's going to help

2015
02:12:14.571 --> 02:12:17.510
my,
you know,
relationships or career or something like that.

2016
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:22.400
And I use that example because that seems pretty,

2017
02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:26.990
pretty like not in consequence in consequential because it's only two shows.

2018
02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:29.810
It's not like I spend 10 hours a day watching TV.
It's just do shows who cares.

2019
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.100
No harm in that.
Right.
But that's up to me.
I'm not missing out by missing Hawaii,

2020
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:35.353
not missing out.

2021
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:38.240
That's not going to affect my life in any negative way in the future at all.

2022
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:40.820
I didn't want to affect my life in any way actually.

2023
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:45.650
But if I read something useful,
educate myself in,
you know,

2024
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:48.980
whatever arena that's going to improve my interests or my,

2025
02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:53.960
or my relationship or something like that,
that will,
that will help me.

2026
02:12:54.230 --> 02:12:57.050
Yeah.
No,
I,
that's one of the things I've noticed.
And I'd show up,

2027
02:12:57.110 --> 02:13:01.550
show up at the studio and you take all,
I was reading this book today about,

2028
02:13:01.690 --> 02:13:05.240
you know,
how we could get this to sound better.
And I read this thing about,

2029
02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:05.541
you know,

2030
02:13:05.541 --> 02:13:10.010
you're coming back to me with all this information and it was something that

2031
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:13.610
just transitioned in your brain where you said,
you know what,

2032
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I could be watching TV in wasting my mind or I could be applying myself and

2033
02:13:20.421 --> 02:13:25.340
learning.
Yeah.
And that's,
that makes a huge difference rather as well.

2034
02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:29.950
One of the things I read actually,
um,
and I read it on,

2035
02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.180
I want to say Wikipedia,
this specific thing,
but there's this,
um,

2036
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:36.420
this automatic way of thinking and uh,

2037
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:40.830
it's called hyperbolic discounting,
right?
And all that,
it,

2038
02:13:40.831 --> 02:13:44.520
all that means is you choose immediate payoffs versus,

2039
02:13:44.521 --> 02:13:45.750
and I kind of mentioned this before,

2040
02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.050
you choose immediate payoffs versus longterm pass,
right?

2041
02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.770
And it's there for a reason.
Survival mechanism and all these ways,
but it's old.

2042
02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:56.070
It exists for an,
you know,
an environment that's not current.

2043
02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:01.740
So if you can basically a,
be aware of that and combat that were,

2044
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:06.240
don't do the immediate payoff things.
So just take,
take what you're about to do,

2045
02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:09.510
evaluate it.
Is this going to help me other than the pleasure that I think,

2046
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:13.740
whether that in regards to food,
drinking,

2047
02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.490
TV shows,
like if you watch reality TV,

2048
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.570
check yourself on down and ask yourself,

2049
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:23.160
is this going to help me in the future?

2050
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.790
And typically the answer for those types of things are going to be no.

2051
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.570
And then consider an alternative that you can do.

2052
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:35.070
And a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and

2053
02:14:35.071 --> 02:14:39.420
it's totally up to you.
It's totally up to you.
Why not make the good choice.
Yeah,

2054
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:43.250
and the pay off.
Not only is it bigger,
it lasts longer.
Yeah,

2055
02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:46.920
the immediate payoff is gone.
It's just a memory.

2056
02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:53.310
<v 4>Awesome.
That's awesome to hear.
And
it actually,</v>

2057
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:58.050
we got that next comment here is sort of the same vein it's coming from and we

2058
02:14:58.051 --> 02:15:02.580
get a bunch of emails,
but I just thought this one was,

2059
02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:06.840
was interesting to hear someone kind of talking about their transition here.

2060
02:15:06.841 --> 02:15:08.790
She says,
I'm one of many,

2061
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:14.070
many people who live their lives as they think they should and end up mid

2062
02:15:14.071 --> 02:15:17.700
forties lost chubby and depressed.

2063
02:15:18.930 --> 02:15:21.480
I definitely don't hear a worship you,

2064
02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:24.960
but I'm truly grateful for your online presence.

2065
02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:29.940
I now get up at 5:00 AM daily and I screen grabbed my phone every morning as the

2066
02:15:29.941 --> 02:15:33.870
alarm goes off and post that shot with another shop from my walk.

2067
02:15:33.871 --> 02:15:34.710
A few minutes in.

2068
02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:39.330
I walked for an hour daily and it started stretching daily for an hour,

2069
02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:41.400
but this doesn't stop there.

2070
02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:45.300
I now have a bunch of friends who are getting up early and going for a walk or

2071
02:15:45.301 --> 02:15:46.260
going to the gym,

2072
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:51.530
getting after it has you say we are all noticing an improvement in our lives so

2073
02:15:52.891 --> 02:15:55.320
we might not be military or police.

2074
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:59.280
We are not planning on becoming Jujitsu champions at this stage.

2075
02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:02.880
We are just people who lost themselves,
lost their way,

2076
02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:07.980
who are finding their way back in part thanks to you.

2077
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:12.750
I credit you at least twice a week and tell people to find you on Twitter.

2078
02:16:13.170 --> 02:16:16.950
I had to write here because there's no way I could fit this into 140 characters

2079
02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:20.430
and thanks to Tim and Joe for having you on their shows.

2080
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:24.700
That's where I found you have a great day.
So it really cool.
You know?

2081
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:28.560
Really cool to hear that.
Really great to get that feedback and

2082
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:34.180
you know,
this is what I like about it.
Well,
first of all,
if you don't,

2083
02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:37.090
I think people were spreading the words and it's really good to hear that

2084
02:16:37.091 --> 02:16:39.610
feedback.
It fires me up to hear the feedback.
And when people say,

2085
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:42.610
when people say,
I motivate them,
I'm always like,
you motivate me.

2086
02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:47.310
You know that it motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5:00 AM and,

2087
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:51.790
and turning your life around.
I think that's awesome.
And also what I,

2088
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:56.470
what I liked about this was they pointed out that this isn't just military or

2089
02:16:56.471 --> 02:16:57.910
police or Jujitsu players.

2090
02:16:57.911 --> 02:17:02.230
It's for pretty much anybody in any station in life,

2091
02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:06.430
in any job,
any age,
man or woman,
any country.
And as a matter of fact,

2092
02:17:06.431 --> 02:17:11.050
I was in England and my wife's from England and when I was in England,

2093
02:17:11.051 --> 02:17:16.051
I went and saw one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you

2094
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:21.370
know,
here's this woman
who's,
I don't know,

2095
02:17:21.371 --> 02:17:25.720
40 something years old,
she's lives in England,

2096
02:17:25.721 --> 02:17:29.380
she's got three kids.
She's like,

2097
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:33.940
couldn't be any further detached from me in my life.

2098
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:35.951
And when I was,

2099
02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:39.430
I was hanging out with her husband in London before we went to their house and

2100
02:17:39.431 --> 02:17:42.310
he said,
when we got on the train to go to his house,
he said,
listen,

2101
02:17:42.311 --> 02:17:44.950
you got to be ready.
And I'm like,
for what?
And he says,

2102
02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:50.500
my wife loves your podcast.
And I said,
really?
And he said,

2103
02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:54.340
no,
no,
no,
I'm serious.
She loves your podcast and we have dinner night.

2104
02:17:54.341 --> 02:17:55.780
She's going to ask you questions all night long.

2105
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:58.420
She's been asking me the questions that she was going to ask you.

2106
02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.010
And so I showed up and seriously,
it was great.

2107
02:18:03.011 --> 02:18:05.320
She was asking me all these detailed questions about everything.

2108
02:18:05.650 --> 02:18:09.430
And it was really cool because I realized that this,
I mean this,
like I said,

2109
02:18:09.431 --> 02:18:13.480
this person doesn't do Jujitsu,
doesn't,
you know,

2110
02:18:13.481 --> 02:18:15.970
doesn't do anything that I do nothing.

2111
02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:19.120
And yet she was,

2112
02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.940
I had all these lessons learned and all of these things she had taken away and

2113
02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:24.380
it was awesome to see that.
And it was interesting to,

2114
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:28.360
because that's how I was talking to her.
It was on a Friday or a Saturday.

2115
02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:29.560
And as I'm talking to her,

2116
02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:34.420
she had listened to the latest podcast on the day before.

2117
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:38.530
And so she was saying to me,
you know,
well yesterday you said this,

2118
02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:41.530
and yesterday you said that.
And so in her mind,

2119
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.750
I was talking to her yesterday,

2120
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:49.120
I was talking to her yesterday and that's when I kind of realized that how

2121
02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:52.150
impactful it is,
what we talked about,
where you know,
where the words,

2122
02:18:52.151 --> 02:18:54.760
the podcast wars are going directly into your brain.

2123
02:18:54.761 --> 02:18:57.400
And I've had a bunch of people say,
you know,
Oh,
when you're talking,

2124
02:18:57.401 --> 02:18:59.740
oh you were telling the story,
I wanted you to talk about this story.
You know,

2125
02:18:59.741 --> 02:19:04.690
if these are friends of mine.
And so,
so I think that's,
that's really cool.

2126
02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.033
And um,

2127
02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:09.420
I think that's why a lot of people are getting into the game and enjoying it.

2128
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:13.090
And you just said it and I,
I say it all the time.

2129
02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:19.770
There's nothing new here and we're not giving out any groundbreaking techniques

2130
02:19:20.681 --> 02:19:25.681
and there's no miracle drug and there's no three minute exercise that's going to

2131
02:19:25.781 --> 02:19:26.620
change your life.

2132
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:33.250
<v 3>I'm not selling this self help reach your potential through this magical</v>

2133
02:19:36.561 --> 02:19:37.394
mystery.

2134
02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:43.130
I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about things that

2135
02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:45.770
people know to be right in their own heads,

2136
02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:48.560
like discipline and hard work and consistency.

2137
02:19:48.561 --> 02:19:51.890
Those are the things and we all know those things,

2138
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:55.343
but

2139
02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:56.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

2140
02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:59.610
<v 3>To everybody that's,
that's kind of known these things for a while,</v>

2141
02:19:59.611 --> 02:20:04.590
but they've recently started to get after it.
Good on you.

2142
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:09.380
Yeah.
And get on that path.
Yeah.
It feeling,

2143
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:13.440
stay on that path.
That's what I'm talking about.

2144
02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:18.310
Very cool.
I feel like,
um,
like just like how you were saying like we,

2145
02:20:18.311 --> 02:20:21.450
we a lot of this,
we already knew,
we already know about state discipline,

2146
02:20:21.451 --> 02:20:23.970
we already know about all this stuff or whatever.

2147
02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:26.730
But coming from you it helps.

2148
02:20:26.731 --> 02:20:29.590
And then on top of that new than an added an element that I'm,

2149
02:20:29.610 --> 02:20:34.610
that I'm kind of really starting to really understand and feel is that,

2150
02:20:34.741 --> 02:20:37.980
you know,
how like you on Twitter,
like you engage,
you know,

2151
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:39.930
you like if someone asks you a questions,

2152
02:20:40.350 --> 02:20:45.350
it seems like you're engaging them a lot more so than if somebody asked me the

2153
02:20:45.631 --> 02:20:48.210
question,
I'm going to answer the question.
Yeah.
I'm not rude,
which is good.

2154
02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:52.380
I tried to for sure.
Um,
I would imagine you'd be,
you know,
have way more than me,

2155
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:55.770
but um,
kind of as a result of everything,

2156
02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:58.200
I feel like we're all kind of doing this together.
You know,

2157
02:20:58.230 --> 02:21:01.040
you know how the guys done in Australia,
they'll post all that.
You know,

2158
02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:03.620
a lot of people,
eh,
everyone they're posting their,
you know,

2159
02:21:03.810 --> 02:21:07.860
4:30 AM wake up time to do this.
Everyone.
Yeah.
Cause that's what you did.

2160
02:21:07.861 --> 02:21:10.500
Now guess what?
We're all doing it.
Yeah.
You know,
we're all doing it.

2161
02:21:10.501 --> 02:21:13.110
You're responding,
they're responding to you,
you're responding to them.

2162
02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.610
We're reading questions from them.
Yeah.
Kind of weird.

2163
02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:20.100
Like these are other people.
Yeah.

2164
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:25.190
In through this weird interweb you're actually asking questions from some

2165
02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:29.400
unknown partner.
We're having a conversation basically.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2166
02:21:29.401 --> 02:21:32.850
It's kind of delayed,
but yeah,
that's exactly what's going on.
So example,

2167
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:35.970
I should've just grabbed my phone and saw that,
I forget the guy's name,

2168
02:21:35.971 --> 02:21:39.870
but he was like,
hey,
echo Sunday workout Sunday.

2169
02:21:39.871 --> 02:21:43.060
This was like early this morning,
or maybe late last night,
whatever.
Sunday out.

2170
02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:46.170
Give me one.
I need a Sunday workout.
So I was like,
oh,
okay.

2171
02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.270
So I gave him the workout.
It was basically,
um,
uh,
two rounds,

2172
02:21:51.390 --> 02:21:56.340
five sets of,
um,
cleaning clean and press fights,

2173
02:21:56.430 --> 02:22:00.150
five reps clean and press five times,
and then five burpees.
That's one set.

2174
02:22:00.151 --> 02:22:01.560
Do five sets,
45 seconds,

2175
02:22:01.561 --> 02:22:04.930
rest in between rest for two minutes in the new five more,
45 seconds rest.

2176
02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:09.630
That's it.
That's it.
Use 135 pounds.
I only said 135 pounds because that's what,

2177
02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:12.630
that's the exact thing I do after I lift.
And that's like,
to me,

2178
02:22:12.631 --> 02:22:16.290
that's the hard lifting side,
that heart.
But that part's kind of hard to me.

2179
02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:19.920
The metcon,
the metcon.
Yeah.
So I'm like,
but I don't know,

2180
02:22:19.921 --> 02:22:22.560
maybe I don't know if I'm in good shape or not.
Yeah.
As far as that goes.

2181
02:22:22.561 --> 02:22:25.560
So I think I say you do it and use that weight.
But the thing,

2182
02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:30.750
if he's smaller for,
I don't know how big he is,
we're just talking on Twitter,

2183
02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:34.140
you know?
So you know that put the weight didn't really matter.
It doesn't,

2184
02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:37.800
he scaled it properly.
Well,
he said later on he was like,
Dang,
that allows pain.

2185
02:22:37.801 --> 02:22:41.380
But I feel great.
I was like solid.
He said,
hey,
but I adjusted the weight.
Okay.

2186
02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:44.880
So I'm saying,
okay,
you know,
that makes sense.
But my,

2187
02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:49.890
my two reasons why I'm into that is because I wanted that interaction.

2188
02:22:49.891 --> 02:22:52.770
Like,
Hey,
do my workout.
You know,
and what I'm going to do,

2189
02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:55.730
and I thought of this earlier this morning where,
um,

2190
02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.390
or earlier today I'm going to send them back.
So you give me a workout,
oh nice.

2191
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:04.260
And I'm going to do it and make it something at least close to what you do or

2192
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.140
something you do.
And I'll give you an evaluation.
Right.
You know?

2193
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:10.350
So hopefully I can get some variety and it will help that interaction.

2194
02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:13.950
I think that's dope.
Yeah.
Like how he actually went and did it.
Yeah.
I was like,

2195
02:23:13.951 --> 02:23:17.660
heck yeah,
let's do that.
Some barn in Iowa or some,
yeah,

2196
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.230
he was awesome.
Good deal.
Last question.

2197
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:28.200
There must be some aspect of the tootsie situation that I don't understand.

2198
02:23:28.390 --> 02:23:31.830
Even if I'm on the losing side of a fight,
I still want to go down swinging.

2199
02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:34.380
I could tell how much this affected Jocko.

2200
02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:39.900
It would suck to be so close to such an unjust fight and not be able to do

2201
02:23:39.901 --> 02:23:44.770
anything about it.
Yes,

2202
02:23:47.350 --> 02:23:52.350
it is hard to look at that situation and really understand it and it's horrible.

2203
02:23:53.561 --> 02:23:55.120
Look back at it now

2204
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:59.980
and know that we didn't do anything about it,

2205
02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:05.590
but,
but what can we do with it?

2206
02:24:05.620 --> 02:24:10.090
How can we apply this to everyday life?
Because I agree with you.

2207
02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:13.450
You gotta go down swinging.

2208
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:15.543
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2209
02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:20.030
<v 3>And I'll tell you this.
If you,
if you fight with all you've got,</v>

2210
02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.160
<v 2>okay.</v>

2211
02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.920
<v 3>More often than not,
you won't go down at all.</v>

2212
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:26.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2213
02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:27.733
<v 3>You win.</v>

2214
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.360
But you gotta make that attitude part of your everyday life,
the extra rep,

2215
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:40.440
the extra mile,
the extra round,
the right choices

2216
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:46.680
to make yourself stronger mentally and physically

2217
02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:51.550
stand and fight.

2218
02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:56.820
Fight against weakness and against fear.

2219
02:24:57.220 --> 02:24:57.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2220
02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:00.990
<v 3>They're fighting against time and decay.</v>

2221
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:05.610
Fight back,
go down,

2222
02:25:05.611 --> 02:25:06.444
swinging.

2223
02:25:09.250 --> 02:25:14.080
Give everyday everything you've got.
Yeah.

2224
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:16.050
And when can,
when you face a challenge,

2225
02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:18.930
even something where you don't believe you can win.

2226
02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:19.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2227
02:25:19.890 --> 02:25:21.990
<v 3>Maybe to situation where you cannot win,</v>

2228
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:29.310
<v 4>but if you can't win,
remember this,</v>

2229
02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.570
you have nothing to lose.

2230
02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:39.700
So stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory fighting with

2231
02:25:41.631 --> 02:25:44.570
everything you've got.
Every ounce of energy,

2232
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:48.770
every beat is sweat and every drop of blood

2233
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:55.470
to your last breath.
And then,

2234
02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:01.310
and only then
you can stand down

2235
02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:07.930
and you can put down your sword and you can put down your shield

2236
02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:14.800
and rest
in peace.

2237
02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:24.700
I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2238
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:30.490
So thanks all you troopers out there tuning in and listening.

2241
02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:45.460
So thanks for remembering them,

2242

2268
02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:30.990
which has not been utilized as much yet.
Right.

2269
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:34.420
And I've been slowly checking them.
Um,
all right,

2270
02:28:34.430 --> 02:28:37.160
We pulled questions from him.
Oh,

Good.
Okay.

2272
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:45.260
getting the questions from there.
Oh yeah.
Everywhere.
Probably.

2273
02:28:45.261 --> 02:28:49.160
Really good question.
It's a good question.
The long questions.
I mean,
yeah,

2274
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:50.450
it's hard.
Good spot.

2275
02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:54.950
Don't take pictures of long questions and post them cause I copy and paste them

2276
02:28:54.951 --> 02:28:56.780
into a document.
All right,
sir.
Yeah.

2277
02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.680
Folks out there that took pictures of questions and I twittered you back and

2280
02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:12.290
Leif Babin and I wrote extreme ownership.

2281
02:29:12.291 --> 02:29:15.260
It's all these basic principles we talk about all the time.

2282
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:18.590
You can get it hardcover kindle,
or you get an audio book,

2283
02:29:18.591 --> 02:29:21.740
which the Audio Book is myself and life reading it.
So,

2284
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:25.670
or any books that you've covered on any of these podcasts,
Jocko,

2285
02:29:25.671 --> 02:29:29.010

You Click on that,

2286

2287

2288
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:39.350
So finally and most importantly to everybody out there,

2289
02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:44.030
you sitting there with your headphones on listening.
Thank you.

2290
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:48.980
Thanks for deciding that you are going to hold the line,

2291
02:29:50.410 --> 02:29:54.680
that you're going to fight through the discomfort and the weakness and the pain,

2292
02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:59.260
and you're going to get up
and get after it,
right?

2293
02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:03.190
