00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.300
This is Jocko podcast number nine with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.983
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.820
Perhaps I stabbed our savior in his sacred helpless side,

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.980
yet have called his name and blessing when an after times I died

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.520
through the travail of the ages,
midst the pomp and toil of war.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.590
Have I fought and strove and perished countless times upon this star,

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.830
I have sinned and I have suffered,

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.950
played the hero and the nave fought for belly shame or country and for each have

9
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.450
found a grave.

10
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.400
So as through a glass darkly,
the age long strife,

11
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:52.900
I see where I fought in many guises,
many names,

12
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.550
but always me.

13
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.410
So forever in the future shall I battle as of your dying to be born a fighter

14
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.440
but to die again once more.

15
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.180
And that is a poem by General George S.
Patton.

16
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.843
<v 0>And</v>

17
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
<v 1>I've been thinking about the podcast and about the direction and about the</v>

18
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.410
things and about what we talk about and what I talk about.

19
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.470
And I was actually had been looking for a,

20
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.520
for a nonmilitary book,

21
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.970
for a book that talks about the same kind of things that I think about.

22
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:47.440
But it's not about war because there's a very small population that are engaged

23
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.870
in war,
in real war.
So I've been looking for a book and I've,

24
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.530
and I've got a bunch of books and books that I enjoy and books that I like and

25
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.060
I've been looking for a,
uh,

26
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.220
a good book that is not a war book.

27
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.080
And I had some close ones and maybe they'll make the cut,

28
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.800
but,
but,
but we're not there yet
because,

29
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.680
because quite simply war is at another level.

30
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.530
It's not better and it's not a good thing and I don't worship war,

31
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.850
but it is in fact the ultimate human struggle.

32
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.073
Yeah.

33
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.240
<v 1>And as Judge Holden
in the book,</v>

35
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.740
Blood Meridian puts it.

36
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.970
This is the nature of war.

37
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.230
Who stake is at once the game and via authority and the justification.

38
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 1>Scene.
So war is the truest form of divination.</v>

40
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.751
It is.

41
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.751
The testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger we'll,

42
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.540
which because it binds them is therefore forced to select

43
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.690
wars.
The ultimate game.

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
Because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.

45
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.180
War Is God.

46
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.990
Now I'm going to tell you I'm not going to go into blood meridian tonight.

47
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.400
Blood Meridian,

48
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.440
half talked about it on a couple occasions and one day we will,

49
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.810
and it's probably going to take multiple shows and it's going to take research

50
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.110
but that is a heavy heavy book that is thick with content and meaning and words

51
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.980
that are powerful
and that's it.

52
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.670
Tiny slice of blood meridian and we will get to it at some point and I actually

53
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.960
get,
you know people are always like,
hey do blood Maruti and do blood money.

54
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.260
Cause there's a lot of people that take a lot of information,

55
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:13.060
a lot of meaning from that book.
But I am not ready yet.

56
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm not.
Do you know that's going to take,

57
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.880
and it's the same thing with Shakespeare.
People are like hey,

58
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:22.330
when are you going to do the Bard?
And it's the same thing.

59
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.310
I want to be fully prepared and I'm either going to to through,

60
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.410
maybe I won't be fully prepared to do the whole thing,

61
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.030
but maybe we'll take chunks of blood meridian.

62
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.200
Some chunks is Shakespeare and start to try and digest them because those are

63
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:43.120
big meals now.
That's why,

64
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.610
you know,
that's why we're not talking about a business book tonight.

65
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.770
That's why we're not talking about a business leader.

66
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.510
That's why we're not talking about a sports leader.
That's when I,

67
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.620
we're not talking about,
uh,

68
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.340
a public figure that had to struggle through whatever to get to the top of the

69
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.150
mountain that they were climbing or mountain climber.

70
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.470
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about war.

71
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.420
And
like I said,

72
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.130
war is not God.
Like judge Holden describes you in blood Meridian,

73
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:20.400
but it certainly is a powerful force in it.
Certainly is the ultimate struggle,

74
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.600
the ultimate struggle for life against other humans that want to end your life.

75
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:31.590
And that's it.
Which brings us to patent.

76
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.990
And that poem,
you know,
obviously in Patton's mind

77
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.380
he was a warrior before,
over and over again.

78
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.090
Yeah.
He thought he was reincarnated.
Reincarnate,
like,

79
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.660
well was a soldier for Caesar for hundreds and thousands of years.

80
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
And

81
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.120
before I do jump into pattern,
I do the tankers,

82
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.260
the tankers up the world that the u s military,

83
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.390
we worked with the [inaudible],
the First Brigade,

84
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.850
first armor division in Ramadi,

85
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.080
Iraq in 2006 the ready first and

86
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.570
the techs,

87
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.560
the 68 ton Abrams main battle tank with a giant turbine engine grinding the

88
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:30.521
street apart as they come to support and rescue and save

89
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.330
the seals,
which they did over and over again

90
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.430
and there was no
better sound in the world.

91
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.480
Then those tanks firing up their engines and putting main gun rounds in

92
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.530
buildings to kill bad guys and protect American troops.

93
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.700
And we heard a lot about patents while we were working with the 180 because the

94
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.610
guy is the kind of the foremost tanker.

95
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.510
And even me,

96
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.520
I grew up with patents because the George See Scott movie was released when I

97
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:21.521
was a kid and to this day I remember watching that for the first time and being,

98
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.013
you know,

99
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.540
Austrac my patent and when you stick your hand into a bunch of Goo that a moment

100
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:37.760
ago was your best friend's face,
then you'll know what to do.

101
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.730
<v 1>That's all.
And so that was just a,
that's how I grew up.</v>

103
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.330
I mean,
I grew up,
I watched that movie so many times.
I can't even remember.

104
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.450
Do you still watch it?
We watched it in Ramadi.

105
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.350
We watched in Ramadi what?
Just to get fired up

106
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.750
and in.
It is a great movie.

107
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.760
But let's talk about the real Patton,

108
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.820
who actually in many ways was more colorful and more charismatic and really

109
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:12.540
larger than life in real life.
Then George C.
Dot.

110
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:14.580
Scott and the movie could make him out to be.

111
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.590
<v 2>Hmm.
I read that he would,</v>

112
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.320
when he'd talk and stuff,
he'd swear a lot of you use a lot of profanity,
but he,

113
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.730
he did that on purpose.
He did it like to,
to,

114
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.040
to send a message or to get his guys fired up.

115
00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:32.150
But in regular conversation he didn't really know.
He's

116
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.620
<v 1>a,
he's a mysterious guy with a lot of different facets to them.</v>

117
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.100
So I'm going to kick this off.

118
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.490
So we're going to the book George S.

119
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.310
Patton War is,
I knew it

120
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.000
and,
uh,
interestingly,

121
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.570
this book was given to me by Leif Leif Babin who wrote extreme ownership with me

122
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.870
and who served with me and Ramadi and is one of my brothers.
So

123
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.760
general order number 18,

124
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.830
this is from patent to his troops.
Soldiers of the seventh army,

125
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.710
born at sea,
baptized in blood and crowned with victory.

126
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.700
In the course of 38 days of incessant battle and unceasing labor,

127
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.570
you have added a glorious chapter two,
the history of war,

128
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:32.090
pit it against the best Germans and Italians could offer you have been

129
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.870
unfailingly successful.
The rapidity of your dash,

130
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.280
which culminated in the capture of Palermo,
was equaled by the dog,

131
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:44.180
had tenacity with which you stormed cornea and captured Messina.

132
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.000
<v 0>Okay?</v>

133
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.610
<v 1>Every man in the army deserves equal credit.</v>

134
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.740
The enduring valor of the infantry and the input impetus ferocity of the tanks

135
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:56.790
were matched by the tire clamor of are destroying guns.

136
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.600
The engineer's perform prodigies and the construction and maintenance of

137
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:03.060
impossible rolls over impassable country.

138
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.780
The services of maintenance supply performed a miracle.

139
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.670
The signal correlate over 10,000 miles of wire and the medical department

140
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:15.720
evacuated and care for our sick and wounded on all occasions.

141
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:19.920
The navy has given generous and gallant support throughout the operation.

142
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:21.420
Our air has kept the sky clear,

143
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.410
entirely actually supported the operation of the ground troops.

144
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

145
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.340
<v 1>As a result of this combined effort,</v>

146
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.880
you have killed or captured 113,350 enemy troops.

147
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.160
You've destroyed 265 of his tanks,

148
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.310
2,324 vehicles and 1,162 large guns.

149
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.960
And in addition,

150
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.190
you have collected a massive military booty running to the hundreds of tons,

151
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.410
but your victory has a significance be above and beyond.
It's physical aspect.

152
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.840
You have destroyed the prestige of the enemy.
The president of the United States,

153
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.950
the secretary of war,
the chief of staff,
General Eisenhower,

154
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.420
General Alexander,
General Montgomery have all congratulated you.

155
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.310
Your fame shall never die.
Gs Patent Junior,

156
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.850
lieutenant general US army commanding.

157
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.120
<v 0>Okay,</v>

158
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.010
<v 1>so you were talking about getting fired up and what he would do to get fired to</v>

159
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.630
get people fired up.
Very habit.
Yeah.

160
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.480
Obviously a very skilled writer with great command of the language.

161
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.910
Can you even imagine what you'd feel like hearing that address to you and your,

162
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.640
your people when you and your troops,
you and your brothers?

163
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.813
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

164
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.540
<v 1>A little bit about patent.</v>

165
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.000
Few military figures in history have laid siege to the public imagination.

166
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.100
More relentless leaving George S.

167
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.100
Patton Jr half a century after his exploits in North Africa on Sicily and across

168
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.900
occupied Europe.

169
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.220
His name still evokes the dash and Briova Cavalry cavalry charge.

170
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:08.610
He is widely considered the best field commander in the American Army of World

171
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.950
War Two and he is certainly one of the,

172
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.340
one of the most feared by the Germans who paid him the compliment before

173
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:20.341
Normandy of massing defenses against a nonexistent army patent group by V e day

174
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.720
in 1945 he commanded 18 divisions and 540,000 soldiers,

175
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.681
uh,

176
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:34.681
force comparable to the size of the American military at its peak in Vietnam,

177
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.410
the New York Times described,

178
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.440
declared in his obituary history is reached out and embrace general George

179
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:48.010
Patton.
His place is secure.
He was not a man of peace.

180
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.130
Oh Man.
Of Peace.
He was not.

181
00:12:53.131 --> 00:12:57.060
But his legacy clearly transcends his military conquest.

182
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.240
He was complex and contradictory,

183
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.120
larger than life and yet all too human.

184
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.180
It is the patent paradox that trans fixes,

185
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.570
and this is something that we've talked about before on this podcast and it's

186
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:13.050
something that I talk about all the time and that is people's strengths can be

187
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:13.884
their weaknesses.

188
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.900
And you get a guy like patent who's hyper aggressive and that actually ends up

189
00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:22.500
being a negative in some cases.
Even though it's extremely positive and others,

190
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.570
back to the book,
a warlord fighting in the name of democracy,

191
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.880
he was also an unrepentant Eris aristocratic snob.

192
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.250
So this is a guy that,
and they talk about this some more,

193
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:43.251
but a guy that was like proud of soldiers almost to a fault he revered soldiers

194
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.920
and yet he's the rest of crap.
[inaudible]

195
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.350
his devotion to common soldiers bordered on reverence,

196
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.750
yet is slapping of two enlisted men,

197
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.330
nearly caused him to sit out the war in disgrace.

198
00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:58.740
And we'll get into that a little bit more.

199
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.530
He exuded confidence and relentless,
relentless certitude.

200
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.790
In truth,
he was insecure and often confused.

201
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.460
He was well read,
fluent in French.

202
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.240
And as a wealthy,

203
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.480
as a wealthy child of privilege and the husband of an heiress at home and

204
00:14:21.481 --> 00:14:23.850
society's most fashionable salons,

205
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.250
he could also be crude,
rude,
and plain foolish.

206
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.580
His humility seemed heartfelt,

207
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.020
yet he acknowledged an overdeveloped personal ambition.

208
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.640
And once confessed,

209
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.660
I don't like the dirt at all except as a means to fame.

210
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.490
So I said,
this guy has a complex guy.

211
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:50.970
This isn't a salt of the Earth David Hackworth Guy.

212
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.910
You never got that from him.

213
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:57.911
You never got it from like a guy like Hackworth that he had any sort of quest

214
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:03.620
for glory.
He just to complete opposite.
And that's why patent for me is,

215
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:07.400
uh,
is not a pure figure.
You know,

216
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.350
not that I would really say that I can think of any pure fingers,

217
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.360
but he's definitely a very faulted leader and which makes it good to learn from.

218
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.260
And he had someone May,
I mean,
obviously I should,
I'm here I am

219
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.390
a complete idiot losers city here calling,
uh,
you know,

220
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.890
General George Askpat.
George says pat and say he's faulted leader,

221
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.660
so don't get me,
don't get me wrong here.
Yeah,
the guy was unbelievably

222
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.050
powerful leader,
an incredible leader and incredible tactician and strategist,

223
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.560
but it is very clear that he had some of those dichotomies that when a little

224
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:51.470
bit too far in one way or the other

225
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.240
as a warrior,
back to the book as a warrior,

226
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:01.300
his fundamental prescription for waging war involved the violent attacks

227
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:03.290
everywhere with everything.

228
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.450
Yet he considered the carpet bomb bombing of German cities to be barbaric,

229
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:12.680
useless and statistic.
So that's,
that's a contradiction.

230
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:13.940
Don't hear very much about them.

231
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.270
And here's how you seen by the higher ups a little bit.

232
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.500
Eisenhower who once referred to Patton as this mentally unbalanced officer also

233
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:29.630
told George Marshall Patent is a problem child.

234
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.700
But he is great.

235
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.870
He is a great fighting leader in pursuit and exploitation.

236
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.430
A division commander describe the general as invaluable and war,

237
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.880
but a disturbing element in times of peace and to that pattern was flattered.

238
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.510
But perhaps the epitaph you would treasure most came from one of his soldiers

239
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:55.580
before the allied invasion of France.

240
00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:01.310
Here was a man for whom you would go to hell and back so clearly to his troops.

241
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.360
They held him in very high regard

242
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.190
quote from Patton,
may God have mercy on my enemies,
they will need it.

243
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.100
That's,
that's the kind of thing that when he says people,

244
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.350
you know,
the front line troops are going to hear that and say,
yes,

245
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.330
we are ready to roll.
Uh,
he also said leadership is a thing that winds battles.

246
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.340
I have it,
but I'll be damned if I can define it.

247
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.820
In patents career,

248
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:39.320
we see certain trademarks are relentless aggression and faith in the offensive

249
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.240
and uncanny instinct for enemy intentions and disposition.

250
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.800
Common theme that we talk about all the time being on offense,

251
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:53.190
being aggressive and patent was an absolute probably.

252
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.490
I think he's probably the most aggressive of the people that we've talked about

253
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.130
and I've pretty much,
I think of anyone I've ever heard of

254
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.550
and Nico was a little bit negative and we see to the creeping arrogance,

255
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:18.370
the Hubris which would cost the American army so dearly in Vietnam,

256
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.110
summing up the achievements of his troops in crushing the German counter attack

257
00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:24.760
of December,

258
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.760
1944 patent with ponderable pride claims to have moved farther and faster and

259
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:35.950
engage more divisions in less time than any other army in the history of the

260
00:18:35.951 --> 00:18:38.890
United States.
Possibly in the history of the world.

261
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.040
No country can stand against such an army.

262
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.370
This smug pride,

263
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.570
the disease of victory and I love that.
That's a,

264
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.400
that's a little something we should all remember the disease of victory.

265
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.460
Victory,
supposed to be all positive,
but guess what?

266
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.760
There's something called the disease of victory.

267
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.190
Back to the book.

268
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.220
This disease of victory would rot the army from within leading future commanders

269
00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:14.411
to underestimate their enemies and overestimate their own battlefield prowess.

270
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.280
Tragically,

271
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.430
the only antidote to this disease of victory would be the humiliation of defeat.

272
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.310
We see that sometimes in sports a lot and we see it in sports.

273
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:33.630
We see it in business.

274
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.670
Sometimes people need to get humbled and when they get humbled,

275
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.840
they get arrogant from the victories and then they get humbled and they get back

276
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:45.180
in the game and they realize what they have to do to win

277
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.940
back to the book.

278
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.940
His passion from military life ran so deep that he considered it as natural for

279
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:55.770
me to be a soldier as to breathe.

280
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.370
War He claimed is the only place where a man really live.

281
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.253
<v 0>This</v>

282
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.120
<v 1>beyond a keen interest in technological developments of armored vehicles and</v>

283
00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:11.960
airplanes,

284
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.200
he retained a near fanatical belief and the importance of being mentally and

285
00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:21.980
physically ready to fight.
Even in war wary,

286
00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:25.130
1920s he admonished junior officers,

287
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.310
you must school yourself to savagery.

288
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.060
And speaking of savagery,

289
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.440
this is the the slaps.

290
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.310
When he slapped these young enlisted troopers,

291
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.243
the infamous

292
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v 0>heard round the world patents memoir gives the episode short shrift,</v>

293
00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.460
but it nearly wrecked his life in early August while visiting wounded troops on

294
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:01.294
Sicily,

295
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.140
the commander cuff to soldier who had been diagnosed as suffering from battle

296
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:08.110
fatigue patent called cowardice.

297
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.310
Further examination revealed the man had malaria and dysentery.

298
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.760
A week later patent repeated his behavior with another soldier and this time

299
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:23.050
made motions to draw his pistol as if to shoot the wretch.

300
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.943
Okay.

301
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.140
<v 1>Pat and publicly apologized,</v>

302
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.560
but remained privately unrepentant had other officers had the courage to do

303
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:36.281
likewise.

304
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:41.281
He wrote the shameful use of battle fatigue as an excuse for cowardice would

305
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:44.080
have been infinitely reduced.

306
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.783
<v 0>Okay,</v>

307
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.090
<v 1>so that was a significant incident.</v>

308
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.560
Had He,
you know,
he publicly apologized,

309
00:21:57.561 --> 00:22:01.380
but he obviously didn't really mean that he felt he had done the right thing,

310
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.810
but still there was much glory to be one patents exploit in the battle of the

311
00:22:06.811 --> 00:22:11.811
bulge abruptly wheeling his army around and driving 100 miles to the ICR dens to

312
00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:18.321
hit the Germans in the flank with 17 divisions remains among the most storied

313
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:20.880
campaigns in modern warfare.

314
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.610
And then after the war as

315
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.130
Europe was now almost an occupied state,
many places.

316
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.730
And as
it has,

317
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.440
people talked about Patton being good for war but not being good for peace.

318
00:22:42.441 --> 00:22:46.850
And that turned out to be pretty accurate,
no longer able to Adak.

319
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.040
He indeed became bullies.
Patent was arrogant,

320
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.420
defiant

321
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.570
and erratic as the summer of 1945 past.

322
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.790
And that's kind of the intro on patent.
Now,

323
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.880
going back now to the beginning of the war,

324
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.933
<v 0>and</v>

325
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.600
<v 1>his first one of his early journal entries,
he says,</v>

326
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.630
have been giving everyone a simplified directive of war use steam roller

327
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:33.961
strategy that is make up your mind on course and direction of action and stick

328
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:38.260
to it.
But in tactics,

329
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.620
do not steamroller attack weakness,

330
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.190
hold them by the nose and kicked him in the pants.

331
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.370
This is something that we talk about all the time.
It's,
it's,

332
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.430
it's flanking people.
It's not keeping,

333
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.530
not going into their strengths and keep attacking their strengths.
Know you,

334
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.340
you attack their strengths to keep them occupied,

335
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:03.860
but then you come around to the flank,
you know,
it's in Jujitsu,

336
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.580
you attack the arm and you get the knack or your attack the neck,

337
00:24:06.581 --> 00:24:10.400
and you get the arm in combat.
It's flanking.

338
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.680
That's what it is.
And he was a master of this and pushed it very,

339
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.100
very hard.
Now

340
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.800
we can get into

341
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.170
a little bit more of his,

342
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.240
what he says are his reflections and suggestions.

343
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.520
And in this book,
if you,
if you do end up getting this book,
uh,

344
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.210
I'm basically skipping the war part.
The,
the,

345
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.820
the entire book is about what he did and how he did it.

346
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.520
And I'm skipping that,

347
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.570
and I've said this before because I liked to know about what they did and how

348
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:55.160
they did it because that is important.

349
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.060
But I like to know why they did it and what they were thinking and what

350
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:02.420
principles they were falling in this book.
Beautiful.
He breaks it down again,

351
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:06.560
it's written by him,
but it breaks down what he was thinking,

352
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.890
why he did take these actions and what his strategies and tactics were.

353
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.710
And this is great because he starts off saying something that's very similar to

354
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:20.480
what Lafe and I say in the beginning of our book,

355
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.430
which is like we didn't invent this stuff.

356
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.310
So here's general George Askpat and saying the same thing.

357
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.910
Probably there is nothing original in what I shall now put down because war is

358
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:33.890
an ancient subject and I,

359
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.690
an ancient man have studied and practiced it for over 40 years.

360
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.830
So what appears to me as original fought may say,

361
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.320
maybe simply subconscious memories.

362
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.430
So he's saying I didn't necessarily think of all this.

363
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.730
Then Lafe and I in the beginning of our books say the same thing

364
00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.110
concerning the soldier.
The soldier is the army.

365
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.750
No Army is better than its soldiers.
The soldier is also a citizen.

366
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.613
In fact,

367
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.840
the highest obligation and privilege of citizenship is that a bearing arms for

368
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:16.460
one's country.
Hence it is a privilege to be a soldier,

369
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.240
a good soldier,
to be a good soldier.

370
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.260
A man must have discipline,
self respect,

371
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.540
pride in his unit and his country,

372
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:31.790
a high sense of duty and obligation to his comrades and to his superiors and

373
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.880
self confidence.
Born of demonstrated ability.

374
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:38.640
His number one

375
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.400
characteristic was which should come as no surprise there has been and is now a

376
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:54.651
great deal of talk about discipline but few people in or out of the army know

377
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:58.050
what it is or why it is necessary.

378
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.713
<v 0>Okay.</v>

379
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.370
<v 1>No sane man is unafraid in battle but discipline produces in him a form of</v>

380
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:15.710
vicarious courage,
which with his manhood makes for victory.

381
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.550
Self respect grows directly from discipline,

382
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.270
self confidence.

383
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.660
The greatest military virtue results from the demonstrated ability derived from

384
00:27:28.851 --> 00:27:33.851
the acquisition of all the preceding qualities and from the,

385
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.480
from exercise in the use of weapons.

386
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.080
So self confidence comes from practice and skill and that's derived from

387
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:43.224
discipline.

388
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.090
Discipline is clearly a subject we talk about quite a bit and its importance in

389
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.370
the military is

390
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.940
cannot be overstated.
It really can't be.

391
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:03.270
And I would go so far as to tell you that disciplines importance in life cannot

392
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.370
be overstated.

393
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.340
The root of all good characteristics is the discipline.

394
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.870
Battles are won by fire and by movement.

395
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.350
The purpose of movement is to get the fire in a more advantageous place to play

396
00:28:27.051 --> 00:28:30.650
on the enemy.
This is from the rear or the flank.

397
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.440
You're gonna hear this guy talk about flanks all the time.

398
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.450
He's going to talk about firing movies,

399
00:28:35.451 --> 00:28:40.451
give her talking of cover move as Lafe and I called it in our book cover and

400
00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:45.530
move.
And this is again,
this is teamwork,

401
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.533
teamwork,

402
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.570
constantly working with your team and your other teams that are with you to make

403
00:28:53.511 --> 00:28:57.980
sure that if I'm putting down cover fire,
you're moving,
you're moving,

404
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.740
and when you're putting down cover fire,
I'm moving.

405
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.230
You've got to work together to make that happen.

406
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.920
And every business in the world has multiple little units in it that have to

407
00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:10.910
cover and move.

408
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.360
Talking about bravery and courage.

409
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.810
If we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality,

410
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.640
which knows not fear.
I have never seen a brave man.

411
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.720
All men are frightened.
The more intelligent they are,

412
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.130
the more frightened they are.

413
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:38.670
The courageous man is the man who forces himself in spite of his fear to carry

414
00:29:38.981 --> 00:29:39.500
on.

415
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.333
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

416
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.020
<v 3>And where does that come from?
It comes from discipline,
pride,</v>

417
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.400
self respect,

418
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.580
self confidence and the love of glory or attributes which will make a man

419
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:58.990
courageous even when he is afraid.
There's not too many people.
I mean you would,

420
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.400
Hackworth would never talk about the love of glory and just not,

421
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.690
not his deal.
Not as deal.
The w when you,

422
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.670
what you mentioned about bravery,

423
00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.660
just how you were talking with Sam Harris about it,

424
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:18.340
where braveries only present if you are scared of something.

425
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:19.390
Because if you're not scared of it,

426
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:22.700
you're not being brave to overcome anything or to go,
you know,

427
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:27.940
to do any kind of activity that's um,
you know,
they,
that you're scared of.

428
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.900
So the very,

429
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.120
although I don't know if I necessarily agree with that because there's guys that

430
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:37.810
are,
you know,
he's says he's never seen anyone that's not not afraid.

431
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.060
I seen some pretty cool,
I mean it's almost the word to use.

432
00:30:41.061 --> 00:30:46.061
It's like crazy guys that are just so brave in do you look at them and they,

433
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:52.000
they you go,
this guy is going to sky.
I had guys with me,

434
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.460
you know,
in my task unit and

435
00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:01.170
some of those guys were so brave that I didn't think they were going to make it

436
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:08.110
home.
And it is it,
cause they were like,
um,

437
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:12.700
it's like they weren't scared to die at all.
Like it didn't,
yeah.

438
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.090
And,
and you see the,

439
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:21.790
almost a lack of self preservation,
you know,
not,

440
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:25.840
not stupid,
not,
not suicidal,
but like,

441
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.820
oh this guy doesn't think he can be killed.
You know,

442
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.810
we were talking about that on the last podcast on,

443
00:31:29.811 --> 00:31:33.820
and I forget the name of the major that was on the beach landing at Toro,

444
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:36.700
I think.
And he's up and he's like,
hey look,
they can't hit me.
Come on.

445
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.810
I've seen guys do that.
Yeah.
So

446
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:47.020
as far as actual bravery goes though,
so would you consider that,
um,

447
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.640
like let's say k two guys are going to go,
go do some,
let's say an MMA fight,

448
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.360
right.

449
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.360
And one guys were just really scared of competing in front of people.

450
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:00.310
It's his first fight or something like that.
Then you have this other guy who,

451
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:04.000
who's not,
who just feels different,
same exact situation,
but he's like fired up.

452
00:32:04.001 --> 00:32:07.700
He's not scared at all and they both go into it.
Do,

453
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.860
did they both exercise the same bravery?
Yeah.
I don't know.

454
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.140
You know,
and I don't know if it matters.
Yeah.
For one thing,

455
00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:19.870
I can tell you the guy that's acting like he's not scared,

456
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:23.840
it's probably the one that's more scared.
Yeah.
With MMA fights and it's,

457
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.890
and I actually see that combat two guys that are overly like bravado are

458
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:32.890
probably more scared.
And,
and again,
there's nothing wrong with that.

459
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:36.370
I'm not holding it against him.
But,
um,
you know,

460
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.130
I've seen guys sitting in briefs to go out operations

461
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.580
<v 1>that you can tell are,
are,
are petrified.</v>

462
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.260
Usually it's a guy that's
not used to it.

463
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.161
Maybe,

464
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:53.060
maybe someone that's visiting and an area of operations and shows up and it's,

465
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.140
oh,
we're going to take you out on a,
on an operation.
And you get to see them.

466
00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.690
They're,
they're scared because they're not used to it.

467
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.710
All the guys from my task unit,
you know,
they might be scared,

468
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:07.110
but they're confident.
They know what they're doing.
They're,
they've,

469
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.850
they've put that fear aside over and over again.
So it's not that big of a deal,

470
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:14.450
but you see a guy dealing with that fear for the first time and especially

471
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:17.900
stands out because you've got a bunch of confident guys that,
that know,

472
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.020
that understand,
that,
understand the risks so you can see their faces.

473
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:26.060
Then you see like that guy that's come in from another area and is going to go

474
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:28.760
out and operation and,
and they're,

475
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:33.650
they're tapping their toes during the brief and they're looking around and they

476
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:36.410
got to overcome that fear.
And if they stay there for a few weeks,
they'll,

477
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.730
they'll get used to it too.

478
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:42.410
<v 2>Yeah.
So it could kind of be looked at as,
um,
just,
just the act itself,</v>

479
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:44.870
whatever act,
if it's understood as being,
yeah.

480
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.850
<v 1>Yes.
Sam Harris,</v>

481
00:33:45.851 --> 00:33:50.851
his point was that it doesn't matter if there's a machine gun nest and you're

482
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:57.090
horrified to go charge it and I'm not,
and we both go charge it.
It,

483
00:33:57.091 --> 00:33:59.690
you just had to pretend that,
that you weren't scared.
It doesn't matter.

484
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:04.070
You were still being brave and,
and I didn't have to pretend,
but I'm being brave.

485
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:08.950
So it doesn't matter whether you're pretending or not,
you're brave if you go and

486
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.830
<v 2>well,
maybe just to overcome or do something that's understood generally as being</v>

487
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.880
scary,
just as not security.
Yes.
Gary,
you,

488
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:21.160
you're still being just as brave.
You are.
But yeah,
I pay.
Yeah.

489
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:22.740
And I guess in a real black and white terms,

490
00:34:22.741 --> 00:34:26.850
it's like if you're not scared of this activity you're doing and you do it and

491
00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:28.590
you're not scared of it,
then you're not being brave.

492
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.530
And that's just in generally speaking like,

493
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.940
<v 1>well,
skydivers skydivers with 5,000 jumps that are not right.</v>

494
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.920
They're not scared anymore.
Yeah.
I mean,
I know even when I had done like,

495
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:42.360
you know,
50 jumps,
you're not really scared anymore.
Right.
You're just doing it.

496
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:44.310
And guys that have thousands jump,
they're not scared at all.

497
00:34:44.311 --> 00:34:46.770
And that's what they do.
Right.
So they're not being brave.

498
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.570
They're just doing their job.
They're just doing their thing.

499
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.540
<v 2>Yeah.
So what if some guy's jumping out for the first time and he's scared and he</v>

500
00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:56.650
overcomes that fear and jumps out?
He is being brave.
Yeah.
Right.
So yeah,

501
00:34:56.651 --> 00:34:58.960
that's kind of the point.
Yeah.
So if I go outside and check the mail,

502
00:34:58.961 --> 00:35:00.730
I'm not being brave.
No,
you're not being brave.

503
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.180
But what if there's like a tiger or something out there and I really need that

504
00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:09.040
nail.
That's pretty brave,
right?
Tiger's going after tigers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

505
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.883
You're right.

506
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.190
<v 1>Uh,
section here,
small unit tactics.</v>

507
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.530
And you want us question whether I wanted to put this in there,

508
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.070
but I know that I'm getting a lot of feedback from guys that are in the
military,

509
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.270
guys that are in squat,

510
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.860
and this is something that I used to talk about and I know it's true.

511
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.310
Squads should sell them be split,

512
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.790
so you want to keep your force it together as much as possible.
However,

513
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.980
if it is necessary to split a squad,

514
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.660
be sure that the unit separated as at least capable of mutual support.

515
00:35:40.661 --> 00:35:42.450
So is something I used to hammer the seals about.

516
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:45.270
If you get too far away from your other unit where you can't support them

517
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:47.760
anymore,
that's problematic.

518
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:51.720
Now that now that other units alone and that means that each unit that separate

519
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:55.020
should have the ability to support it means it has to have some firepower and

520
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:55.770
some strength.

521
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.580
This means that the unit separated from the squad should have not fewer than

522
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:00.414
three men.

523
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.430
The squad possesses in itself weapons necessary for a base and fire and

524
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:10.110
maneuvering element.
This should be an,
this should be,
this should be,

525
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.030
it's in variable method of attack,

526
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:16.050
but the squad leaders should not spend so much time thinking which way he is

527
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:19.500
going to envelop that he suffers casualties,

528
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:24.300
which would have been avoided had he attacked at once.
So don't hesitate.

529
00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:27.900
Don't sit around when it's time to get it on.

530
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.693
Get it on

531
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.890
Patton's a all about the taking action.

532
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:41.750
Another small unit tactic does a short one always captured the highest terrain

533
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:47.820
feature in your vicinity at once and stay on it.

534
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.990
And that is something that we executed all the time in Ramadi.

535
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.030
Get in the high ground getting those buildings.

536
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:56.400
Find the three story building amongst the two story buildings.

537
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:58.740
Find a two story building amongst the one story building.

538
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.720
Always looking for that high ground in the,

539
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.010
in the rural areas,

540
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.950
any kind of knoll and he kind of bump anything they give you.

541
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:09.930
The high ground is what you're looking for.

542
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.880
And as I said last time from an ethical and from a moral standpoint,

543
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.360
I ground take the high ground or the high ground it'll take you

544
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.630
got to watch out for that.

545
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:31.700
Don't delay the best is the enemy of the good.

546
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.510
And these are,

547
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:38.510
I mean that's just a common saying now the best is the enemy of the good.

548
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.970
By this I mean that a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect

549
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:45.390
plan.
Next week.

550
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.600
War is a very simple thing and the determining characteristics are self

551
00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:53.160
confidence,
speed and audacity.

552
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.450
None of these things can ever be perfect,
but they can be good.

553
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.590
He's talking about now general officer's meeting the senior leaders and these

554
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:06.840
apply to everything and not just senior leaders.

555
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.760
There are more tired division commanders than there are tired divisions.

556
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.590
Tired officers are always pessimists.
Remember this,

557
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:20.610
when evaluating reports,
generals must never show doubt,

558
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:22.620
discouragement or fatigue.

559
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.610
General should always adhere to one type of dress so that soldiers will

560
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:27.510
recognize them.

561
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.490
They must always be very neat and most importantly,

562
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.370
from my perspective,
I like what he says in cold weather.

563
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.660
<v 3>General officers must be careful not to appear to dress more warmly than the
men.</v>

564
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.530
Well,
you don't want to do that.

565
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.040
You don't want to be in the comfort zone when the boys are suffering.

566
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.830
You look like you're debating.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I'm not giving it.

567
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:54.820
I was thinking about it.
Probably get shutdown,
but question,

568
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.350
send the question.
So
let's say you're a boss,
right?

569
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:03.910
You have this office and this office like decked out.
Meanwhile,

570
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.810
everyone on your team may have normal offices.
Is that an example of what he's,

571
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.120
no.
Generally,
because you actually do have more work to do.
You have,

572
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.750
you have to have meetings in your office.
And,
and,

573
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.040
and it's interesting too because,
uh,
I,

574
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.030
I didn't highlight it and in this for this series,

575
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:26.410
but they were saying that General Patton wasn't a four star general.

576
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:30.220
He was at 28 star general because when he would put his full uniform on,

577
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.780
he had four stars on his color,
on each color,
four star on each shoulder,

578
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:36.040
four stars in the helmet,

579
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:41.310
and four stars on each one of the handles of his pit of it's Pearl handled

580
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:45.880
pistol grip,
40 fives.
So the guy was like a little bit of,

581
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:49.540
I mean that's a,
that's a showman.
That's a,
that's a,

582
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.230
that's a diva,
right?
Yeah.
So he didn't know,

583
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:57.790
he knew that there a certain amount of showmanship to being in a leadership

584
00:39:57.791 --> 00:40:00.850
position in that sort of what he's talking about by being recognizable.

585
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.480
I mean he's a very recognizable,
he had stars all over his cars and everything.

586
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:09.430
Yeah.
So it's more like the comfort of,
of battle.
So yeah.
But she could,
you could,

587
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:13.390
as a CEO,
you could absolutely take that to the wrong level where you're,

588
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:13.990
you know,

589
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.490
just living in total luxury and all your people are out and you cramped into

590
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:20.560
cubicles that,
you know,
your,

591
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.890
your folks would definitely look at you in a negative way.
Yeah.
But to,

592
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:28.720
but to have what's needed for the job,
you know,
of when I was to you commander,

593
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:33.040
I had an office that was mine,
you know,
and I had space in there to work.
Right.

594
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.290
But I wasn't,
you know,

595
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:40.110
shipping in stakes for me to have every night while the men were eating.
Right,

596
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.920
right.
[inaudible] yeah.
So just gotta be careful,

597
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.740
keep yourself in check a little bit.
What about when you travel,

598
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.210
you go FirstClass meanwhile,
you send your team and coach that.
I,
once again,

599
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:54.730
sometimes the boss is traveling first class,

600
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:57.940
cause when he lands he's got a present and he's gotta,

601
00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.000
he's gotta be a little bit better rested sometimes.

602
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:05.020
The boss man has just sick of being cramped in a little tiny seats.
Mm hmm.

603
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.050
Well,
yeah,
you do.
Got It.
You got to keep that in check.

604
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.490
And I'll tell you when I was,
when I,

605
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.880
when I worked for the admiral of all the seals,
we didn't fly first class,

606
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.390
we were in the cheap seats who they are very careful about that.

607
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.570
They don't want to think that,

608
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:22.480
oh the the military elite is flying around first class.
No,

609
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:27.250
we were in the cheap seats sitting in the back of Delta,
you know,
eating peanuts.

610
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.330
Yeah.
Yeah.

611
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:33.830
There's so many justifiable reasons

612
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.760
<v 2>in business.
Like you would go along with that</v>

613
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.700
<v 1>too,
but you just got to use your judgment.</v>

614
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.330
You got to use your judgment and make sure that,
you know,
everyone's wearing,

615
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:44.651
you know,

616
00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:49.180
a 10 year old field jacket when it gets cold and you're wearing a brand new down

617
00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:54.070
and Gore Tex jacket,
you're people are going to not respect you.
You know,

618
00:41:54.071 --> 00:41:59.071
you can't just deck yourself out when the boys or the troopers are

619
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.730
<v 2>suffering.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,</v>

620
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:07.731
and how he mentioned where or how you mentioned what he's talking about where it

621
00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:11.530
can be categorized as being recognizable,
you know,
so there's a lot of things,

622
00:42:11.531 --> 00:42:15.950
even stuff outside of just uniform that a CEO,
how he presents himself.
Yeah.

623
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.410
That'll keep him recognizable.
Yeah.
Go for all these reasons.
But I'm sure,

624
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.460
I'm sure most of the time no one's perfect where they're gonna,

625
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.740
they're gonna start doing it discussed.

626
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.890
<v 1>There's good business leaders now that,
that follow this type of lead.
I mean,</v>

627
00:42:31.891 --> 00:42:35.220
look at some of these new younger business leaders are not getting decked out.

628
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.790
I saw a picture of the guy that runs Facebook.

629
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.320
I saw a picture of his closet the other day.

630
00:42:40.321 --> 00:42:41.970
He's got like a bunch of gray tee shirts in there.

631
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:46.170
<v 2>Right.
You know,
and um,
from what I hear it like been to the office or nothing,</v>

632
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.430
he,
his,
he doesn't have an office.
He,
there's this open space,

633
00:42:50.431 --> 00:42:53.010
everyone's coding and stuff like that.
And he's just cruising in,

634
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.880
in there as well,
you know?
So yeah,
there's,
yeah.
I guess this all kinds of,

635
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.860
yeah.
Yeah.
I guess it would depend on the business as well.

636
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.800
<v 1>However,
this part is on debatable,</v>

637
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.520
a general officer who will invariably assume the responsibility for failure,

638
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.970
whether he deserves it or not and invariably gives credit for success to others

639
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.210
whether they deserve it or not,
we'll achieve outstanding success.

640
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.350
It's a little something that we call extreme ownership.
You know,

641
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.560
that's the name of our book.

642
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:30.710
Someone that's taking ownership and there's Georgia has patents.

643
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.350
Sorry for Jack in your ideas.
George Askpat.
Yes.

644
00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.940
<v 2>I think that's crazy how that was like such a prominent idea back then because</v>

645
00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.600
like growing up and I dunno,
I just,

646
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.280
<v 1>we never heard about that.</v>

647
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.960
I know and when Lafe and I presented this book to people,

648
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.830
they don't say,
oh,
this is a very common theme that I've heard my whole life.
No,

649
00:43:51.831 --> 00:43:52.221
they go,

650
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.810
this is outstanding and we're saying the exact same thing that general George

651
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:56.960
patents saying,
right.
Air,

652
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.700
which is a obviously extremely important,

653
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.510
issuing orders.

654
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.520
The best way to issue orders is by word of mouth from one general to the next.

655
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.140
Failing this telephone conversations,
which should be recorded at each end.

656
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:16.251
However,

657
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:20.750
in order to have a calm Fermentory memorandum of all oral orders,

658
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:23.960
given a short written order,
should always be made out.

659
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.300
Not necessarily at the time of issuing the order,

660
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.650
but it should reach the junior prior to carrying out the order so that if he has

661
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:31.471
forgotten anything,

662
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:36.270
he will be reminded of it and further in order that he may be aware that his

663
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:40.140
senior has taken definite responsibility for the operation ordered orally.

664
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.840
This is something that I used to do this all the time.

665
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.750
If I had a conversation with my boss,
I still to this day,

666
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.840
if I have a conversation with someone and we talk about something,

667
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.960
I'm following it up a little email because also oral conversations,

668
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.200
people hear what they want to hear and they might hear two different things.

669
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:02.340
You know,
if I tell you,
hey,
we're going to report record this podcast,
Hey,

670
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:05.910
can we record this podcast on Saturday?
You're like,
Oh yeah,
definitely.

671
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.110
Does that mean we are?
Does that mean in your mind you think we are,

672
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:11.310
but I didn't come back.
You know,

673
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:13.980
so I just follow stuff up and I used to do that in the seal teams to,
you know,

674
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.300
we'd get an order,
I'd get it,

675
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:18.000
I'd have a conversation with someone that was either above me or below me or

676
00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:18.720
whatever.

677
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.950
I'd followed up with an email of what I thought the conversation meant and say,

678
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:26.700
hey,
just to confirm what we talked about,
here's the three bullet points.

679
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.090
I'm going to do this,
you're going to do that,
we're going to do this and boom,

680
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:32.580
it's done.
And we have a document of it and it exists.

681
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:37.581
And that we were confirmed how you bring up that example where if you say,

682
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.610
hey,
can we record a podcast on Saturday?
Technically you just,

683
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.110
that's a yes or no question.
Like,
yes we can.
We are,
we have that ability.

684
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.900
That's the night you didn't schedule anything you said.

685
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.070
So I could have taken it either way.
It can be like,
yeah,
we can,

686
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.960
and I show up here at eight and you're like,
oh yeah,

687
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:57.650
I didn't know we were actually going to do it.
You just said,
you know,
um,

688
00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:01.650
when I first started getting,
uh,
more,
more higher end clients,

689
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.190
it was immediately noticeable that that was a common thing.

690
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.000
They'd always follow up with an email right after and it helps so much,
man.

691
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.170
It does.
You got to do it.
It is my,
Oh,
this,
I love this.

692
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:17.250
It is my opinion that army orders should not exceed a page and a half of

693
00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:18.450
typewritten text.

694
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.440
And it was my practice not to issue orders longer than this.

695
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.160
Usually they can be done on a one page in the back of the page is used for a

696
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:26.994
sketch map.

697
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:32.610
W my favorite part about this is if you get someone that can't give you the

698
00:46:32.771 --> 00:46:37.770
orders in like a page,
yeah.
Then that means there are orders are too complicated.

699
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.260
If that means they need to simplify their plan

700
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.430
and he's going to say this a few times,

701
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.960
commanders must remember that the issuance of an order or the devising of a plan

702
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.980
is only about 5% of the responsibility of command.

703
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.700
The other 95% is to ensure by personal observation or through interposing of

704
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.850
staff officers that the orders carried out.

705
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.360
Orders must be issued early enough to permit time to disseminate them.

706
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.690
So he's saying like,
Hey,

707
00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:10.770
it's only 5% of your job to come up with a plan and disseminate the plan.

708
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.980
The other 95% of your job is to make sure it happens.

709
00:47:13.981 --> 00:47:16.650
Take ownership of the plan and get it implemented,

710
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.820
and this is the most important part of this section.

711
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.430
Never tell people how to do things,
tell them what,

712
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.280
and they tell him what to do and they will you with their ingenuity.

713
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.710
So you want to give them sort of the broad,

714
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.430
hey,
this is what I want you to get done and let them figure out how to do it.

715
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.640
You're not going to be able to tell everybody on your team app what the do and

716
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.930
you want to do it and all that.
You got to let them run.
Yeah,

717
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.950
you got to use a little decentralized command is we like to say,
yeah.

718
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.410
In the creative world.
That's a really,

719
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.560
really significant thing to just say what you want and then let that person do

720
00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:02.890
it.
Because if you have some creative vision,
let's do a little critique of Jocko.

721
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.480
How do I do with that?
Because you're,

722
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.190
you sort of the creative end here and how am I good as well?
I do.
I say,

723
00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:10.750
you know what?
Echo,
here's what I think,

724
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.550
and then I just back away and let you run with your game.
Yeah,
and that's the,

725
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:19.160
yeah,
that's,
I don't manage.
No,
I don't micromanage,

726
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.820
especially in the creative field.
Well,
I don't know,
but I'm sure it's,

727
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:26.440
it's equally as applicable everywhere.
Yeah.
I realize that.

728
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:30.630
I can't,
when he was,
you got an expert,
you know,
it's the same thing.
There was an,

729
00:48:30.631 --> 00:48:34.120
the teams,
it's same thing in the,
in the business world,
if you're the,

730
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.060
if you're the big boss,
man,
you shouldn't,

731
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.270
you're not going to know how to do all the technical things at the folks on the

732
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:40.601
front line.

733
00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:42.370
You're not going to have the creativity because you're going to have the

734
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.860
capability because you got other things you should be worried about.

735
00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.850
So get on those other things and let your people run.
Yeah.
Let him run.

736
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.603
And this,
uh,

737
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.920
it is sad to remember that when anyone is fairly mastered,
the art of command,

738
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.850
the necessity for that aren't usually expires either through the termination of

739
00:49:00.851 --> 00:49:05.560
the war or through the advanced age of the commander.
And this is just a,

740
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.510
this is just a damn shame and it's the way it is.
And it's just,

741
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.590
it's this way in the military.
You're the,

742
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.750
would you start feeling like you've really gotten good at that job,

743
00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:21.070
you're onto your next job.
And uh,
that doesn't feel good.

744
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.250
It's a bummer.
Um,

745
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.520
and there was a little

746
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:32.440
example when I talked about him being ultra aggressive,

747
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.800
and this is from a section,
this is from a section which I didn't take.

748
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.020
I don't think I took much out of it.
All this one's called,

749
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.450
or the section was called during my pain.

750
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.050
He talks about these important decisions that he made,
but they're there.

751
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.560
They take,
they're a little bit complex,
some of them,

752
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.990
but this one was fairly concise.
About the 5th of September,

753
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.330
it became apparent that we would run out of gasoline.

754
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:55.330
He's talking about for his tanks,
we would run out of gasoline.

755
00:49:55.810 --> 00:50:00.810
I directed the two core to continue the advance until the tank's ran out of gas

756
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.670
and then to go on on foot.

757
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.980
This was actually done and the bridge head across the muscle river was secured.

758
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.813
As a result,

759
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.600
there was considerable resistance on the part of the corps commanders to do what

760
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:17.560
appeared to them an unnecessarily dangerous operation.

761
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:22.360
It's success again,
proved that it was not dangerous,
so that's,

762
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.940
that's pretty aggressive.
Hey,

763
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.890
you drive until the tank's running a gas in it takes to run a gas,

764
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.000
get out of the takes and walk.
Yeah,
that's a pretty legit,

765
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.910
we used to say like,
hey,
in the seal teams,
hey,

766
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:39.911
we're going to take the boats when the boats run out of of gas.

767
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.820
We'll tell the boats if the toe and boats run out of gas,
we'll get out and swim.

768
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.920
We'll keep going until we get it done.

769
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

770
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.920
<v 3>Letter of instruction number two.
So these are what,</v>

771
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.310
these are what this guy and I love,

772
00:50:55.311 --> 00:51:00.260
this is what this guy was writing as instructions to be handed out to all of his

773
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:01.210
men.
I mean,

774
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.390
<v 1>and this is documented so you wonder what patent thinks about.</v>

775
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:06.860
You don't have to wonder.
It's right here.

776
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.730
So here's this is letter of instruction.
Number two,

777
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:16.720
disciplined.
There is only one sort of discipline,

778
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:21.460
perfect disciplined men cannot have good battle discipline and pour

779
00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:22.630
administrative discipline.

780
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:27.010
Discipline is based on pride in the profession of arms,

781
00:51:27.011 --> 00:51:31.720
on meticulous attention to detail and on mutual respect and confidence.

782
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:36.640
Discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement

783
00:51:36.641 --> 00:51:38.830
of battle or the fear of death.

784
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:44.870
<v 3>And this is why it's every day in every decision that you make and keeping that</v>

785
00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:49.410
discipline.
And I actually have been hearing,
you know,
I hear that this,
this,

786
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.920
that you will power deteriorates.
And I actually don't believe that.

787
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:57.840
I think the more they say,
oh,
you'll eat throughout the day,
you will power.

788
00:51:57.841 --> 00:52:00.090
If you test it too many times it gets weaker and weaker.

789
00:52:00.091 --> 00:52:02.400
And I actually don't believe that.
I actually believe it gets stronger.

790
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.360
Mind gets stronger when I'm,
yeah.

791
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.350
The more I hold the line,
the stronger the whole this,

792
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.830
the better the grip is clearly day by day,
day by day,

793
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:17.580
and normally like it's all together.
It's all grouped together.

794
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.430
When you wake up early and you get your workout in it,

795
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.400
you just stay on track.
You're like,
you know what?

796
00:52:23.401 --> 00:52:25.860
I'm not going to eat that food that I don't need right now.
I'm not,
yeah.

797
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.210
You know,
it's so much easier.
But the day when you're like,
oh,
I didn't worry,

798
00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.510
I woke up late and I didn't get my workout done.
And you know what,

799
00:52:33.511 --> 00:52:37.470
there's a donut,
you know,
and it'd be breakdown.
So you want to,

800
00:52:37.471 --> 00:52:41.400
you want to use the discipline.
Discipline enforces discipline.
Yeah.

801
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.460
Discipline more discipline makes more discipline.
Yeah.

802
00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:48.300
It kind of seems like that.
It would be just like any other exercise,

803
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:51.930
writing your,
exercising your discipline.
So in May,
I don't know,

804
00:52:51.931 --> 00:52:56.150
but maybe this is what that means when they say AP,
your willpower wears down,

805
00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.793
<v 0>let's say</v>

806
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.360
<v 3>trying to stick to this diet.
Right.
And you're going to be like,
Hey,</v>

807
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:05.180
I'm not going to let myself get too hungry because when I let myself get too

808
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:05.571
hungry,

809
00:53:05.571 --> 00:53:10.190
I know that doughnuts seem way more viable.

810
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:16.050
Doughnuts are not viable,
but you know,
as far as the pay it pay off,
uh,

811
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.690
you know,
Detrick it,
um,
you know,
it's like basically,
so if I test my willpower,

812
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:22.810
I'm just saying throughout the span of a day or you know,

813
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.530
however many hours when you start to get hungry,
so

814
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:29.400
<v 2>they're saying,
okay,
so let's say you take your hunger to a certain point,</v>

815
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:32.250
then you say,
you know what?
I'm going to stick the stick.
Stay strong.

816
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.360
Usually I eat way before this,
but I'm,

817
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.750
and I'm real hungry and really want those doughnuts,
but you know what?

818
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:38.480
I'm going to stick with it.
Right?
And you have that one,

819
00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:43.380
that one experience of taking your hunger to a certain point and still sticking

820
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:46.260
to it.
You do that,

821
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.010
you let your hunger go on for even more.
That's your willpower wearing down,

822
00:53:50.011 --> 00:53:53.610
wearing down,
but,
but say you stuck to it,
boom,
and you stuck to it that day.

823
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:58.611
Then the next day you have experienced going that far and your hunger and you

824
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.230
will be stronger and know how to deal with it.

825
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.980
<v 1>I actually,
I actually disagree with you.</v>

826
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.070
I think that when you stay strong you get stronger.

827
00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.950
And when you break like how often does this happen?

828
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.630
All just have one bite of that donut for me every single time a then you have

829
00:54:13.631 --> 00:54:17.830
that one bite of what happens.
Yeah,
yeah.
Gosh,
think a that one bite 10 bites.

830
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.170
So that's what I'm saying.
Stay strong.
Holds your discipline in place.
Okay.

831
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:24.830
<v 2>Yeah.
So to compete,
compare that to like a workout.
Right?
So let's say I,</v>

832
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.850
I do a hard set of,
I dunno pushups,

833
00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.960
then I do another heart set of pushups.

834
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.490
I'm going to be less strong than that second set and I do another set,

835
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.593
I keep testing it,

836
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:43.690
but the next day or the next week I'm going to have benefits from that workout.

837
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.080
Yeah.
So it does reinforce,
um,
so the workout,

838
00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:50.860
the fatigue is that temporary fatiguing.
You recover from it and then you're

839
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.260
<v 1>stronger than way through that.</v>

840
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:56.910
I think a better example is like when you say no to the one bite you or it's

841
00:54:56.911 --> 00:55:01.110
easier to say no to the whole donut.
Yeah.
When you say yes to the one bite,

842
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.830
it's easier to say yes to the whole no.
That's so say no to dope.
Yeah.

843
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:10.260
Keep your discipline in tact.
Discipline back to the book.

844
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:15.030
Discipline can only be obtained when officers are so imbued with this sense of

845
00:55:15.031 --> 00:55:18.360
they're awful obligation to their men into their country,

846
00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:23.361
that they cannot tolerate negligence officers who fail to correct errors or to

847
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:29.841
praise excellent our value listen piece and dangerous misfits in war.

848
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:35.810
So he's giving equal equal importance to correcting errors and praising

849
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:39.240
excellence can see how important that is.

850
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:41.180
And that's something that I've never been very good at.

851
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:45.780
I was never a big praiser of excellence.
And in reading this,
I look back and say,

852
00:55:45.781 --> 00:55:47.220
I should've done that more.

853
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.353
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

854
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.380
<v 1>Officers must assert themselves by example and by voice they must be preeminent</v>

855
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.480
in courage,
deportment,
and dress.

856
00:55:59.110 --> 00:55:59.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

857
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:04.970
<v 1>One of the primary purposes of discipline is to produce alertness.</v>

858
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.410
A man who is so lethargic that he fails to salute,
will fail,

859
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:11.630
we'll fall an easy victim to the enemy.

860
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.940
So the discipline just keeps you on track.

861
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:22.620
Combat experience has proven that ceremonies such as formal guard mounts,

862
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:26.260
formal retreat formations and regular and supervise Reveley formations are a

863
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:30.880
great help and in some cases essential to prepare men and officers for battle to

864
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:34.720
give them that perfect discipline,
that smartness of appearance,

865
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:39.850
that alertness without which battles cannot be one.
And this is something,

866
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.740
you know,
the seal teams for sure are

867
00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:46.950
<v 0>okay,</v>

868
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:51.950
<v 1>very on disciplined when it comes to uniforms,</v>

869
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.650
when it comes to march,
I mean we don't March,
I mean we,

870
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.150
we barely can get into whenever,

871
00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:59.670
whenever a bunch of seals have to do something militaristic.

872
00:56:59.671 --> 00:57:03.510
It's usually a pretty,
we have to dumb it down and make it as easy as possible.

873
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:08.220
And because we just don't do it enough,
you know,
and,
and that's just,
I'm just,

874
00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:11.580
I'm kind of stating that because we spend all of our time,
you know,
when we're,

875
00:57:11.581 --> 00:57:13.170
when we're practicing for war,

876
00:57:13.171 --> 00:57:16.920
we're not doing anything ceremonial.

877
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.240
We practice for war.

878
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:23.660
So this is kind of a funny little dichotomy there is that seals generally are

879
00:57:25.411 --> 00:57:28.800
not ready for military inspection,
but they're ready for combat.

880
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.440
So there's a little little hypocrisies in a little heartbroken,

881
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:33.690
a little hypocritical item about that

882
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.900
combat principles.
Number one,

883
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:44.610
there is no approved solution to any tactical situation.

884
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:51.520
Little theme of creativity coming back again.
Yeah,
there's no approved solution.

885
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:52.870
You got to figure it out.

886
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.820
There is only one tactical principle which is not subject to change.

887
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000
It is to use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wounds,

888
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.900
death and destruction on the enemy,

889
00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.920
the enemy in the minimum amount of time.

890
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:17.970
That's a pretty simple and straightforward principle and according to General

891
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:20.650
Patton,
it does not change.

892
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.120
Battles are won by frightening the enemy.

893
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:30.530
Fear is induced by inflicting death and wounds on him.

894
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.440
Death and wounds are produced by fire.

895
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.600
Fire from the rear is more deadly and three times more effective than that from

896
00:58:38.601 --> 00:58:42.380
the front.
But to get fire behind the enemy,

897
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.820
you must hold him by frontal fire and move rapidly around his flank.

898
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:52.280
Frontal attacks against prepared positions should be avoided if possible.

899
00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.740
I told you he was going to talk about flanks.
He's talking about flanks.

900
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.010
Catch the enemy by the nose with fire and kick them in the pants with fire in

901
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:05.680
place through movement.
That's flanks.

902
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.560
You can never get too strong.

903
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:13.710
Get every man and gun you can secure provider does not unduly delay your attack.

904
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:17.320
I used to say we,

905
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:21.530
we've tried to figure out how many guys would bring on a mission and I'd get

906
00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:22.070
some kind of,

907
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.010
<v 3>you know,
restriction like,
Hey,
we only want you to bring this many guys.</v>

908
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:25.401
And I'd say,

909
00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:28.700
well this isn't soccer where we're only allowed to bring 11 per side.

910
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.720
Well why would I not bring 38 if I can bring 38 why would I stop myself at 28

911
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:36.830
seven you don't bring as many people as you can and let's go,

912
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.720
let's rock and roll.

913
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.710
The larger force and the more violence you use in the attack,

914
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:45.350
whether it be men tanks or ammunition,

915
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.290
the smaller will be your proportional losses.

916
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.590
Violence of action is what we used to call that in the seal teams.

917
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.330
Violence of action never yield ground.

918
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.340
It is cheaper to hold what you have than to retake what you have lost.

919
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:09.380
Never permit a unit to dig in until the final objective is reached.

920
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.740
Then dig wire and mine.

921
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.950
So you can't rest until you get to good spot.
I I,

922
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:20.690
this is a little statement I used a lot in Jujitsu coaching cause cause people,

923
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.330
they,
they get in a position and they rest before it's time to rest.
You know,

924
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:29.960
you gotta you gotta get the guard back.
You've got it.
If someone,

925
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.760
if someone passed your guard,
you don't,

926
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:35.960
you'll settle there on your back and let them settle in and start to smash you.

927
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:39.170
As soon as someone passes your guard,
your recovery,
your work,
you don't,

928
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:41.570
you don't settle down until you're back to a good position.

929
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.310
You can never do that.

930
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:47.630
I noticed that and I actually brought it up to remember less than just last week

931
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.280
or whatever when we rolled.
And I was like,

932
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:52.880
there's something that I noticed about you that,
um,

933
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.040
and that was that in the scramble,

934
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:59.510
you won't just settle and hangout in my guard.

935
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.960
You don't even accept the guard.
And he talks about it a long time ago before,

936
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.980
but it was real for whatever reason,
just really prevalent that day.
That yeah.

937
01:01:06.981 --> 01:01:11.330
In the scramble,
scramble goes on for let's say a longer time.

938
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:15.850
Let's say the scramble goes on for six seconds.
Pretty Long.
Scrambles it.

939
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:21.850
It seems like you still wouldn't even stop the scramble until you're beyond the

940
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:25.520
guardian,
the girl.
Yeah.
You won't just hang out with me of,
Hey,

941
01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:29.540
I thought I'd see it right in that garden,
get my restaurant.
But um,

942
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.460
and it's surprisingly painfully affective.
Yeah.
Do that.

943
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.290
I was talking to Dean about that yesterday.

944
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.440
If Dean is in a mindset where he's accepting a guard pass or he's accepting,

945
01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:45.290
it becomes a much,
much,

946
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:49.820
much easier game when he decides he's not going to let you settle until he gets

947
01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:51.560
to the advent advantageous position.

948
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:56.510
It's a nightmare because he won't stop moving and he's a good scrambler.
The F.

949
01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:00.650
You know what's interesting about these,
I have a note in here that you know,

950
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:05.030
he said never yield ground,
never permit a units.
Dig In.
He says never.

951
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.150
And that's something that I own Sec,
right?

952
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.760
Because it takes away the fact that of what he said earlier about there's no

953
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:16.070
written rule.
There's no approved method.
You shouldn't use that word.

954
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:20.070
Never.
Because sometimes you should yield ground and sometimes you should

955
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.670
<v 1>dig in even when the final objective is.
So I know he's just being extreme,</v>

956
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.330
but it is.

957
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:28.650
I did make a note of that to point out general training back to the book,

958
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.040
more emphasis will be placed on the hardening of men and officers.

959
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:38.190
All soldiers and officers should be able to run a mile with combat pack and 10

960
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:40.470
minutes and March,
eight miles and two hours.

961
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:42.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

962
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.110
<v 1>The hardening of men and officers,</v>

963
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:48.520
he goes on to say sharpen axes,

964
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:52.240
pick axes and shovels now and keep them sharp.

965
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.273
<v 0>Okay?</v>

966
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.210
<v 1>That's just an attitude,
right?
Look,</v>

967
01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:00.370
the pick ax that you're gonna use to dig in,

968
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.870
make it sharp because you got to hack somebody's brain out.
Keep it sharp.

969
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.550
Yeah.
Battles are fought by platoons and squads.

970
01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:12.540
Place emphasis on small unit combat instruction.

971
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:15.850
So that is conducted in the same precision as close order drill.

972
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:21.250
A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution.

973
01:03:21.251 --> 01:03:23.350
10 minutes later.
Common theme.

974
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

975
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.520
<v 1>Needless requirements.</v>

976
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.350
He's actually got a section here called needless requirements.

977
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.820
There is a tendency,

978
01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:41.090
and I used to see this in the military and I see it in businesses now,

979
01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.580
this is the needless requirements.

980
01:03:43.581 --> 01:03:47.510
There's a tendency for the chain of command to overload junior officers by

981
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:50.960
excessive requirements in a way of training and reports.

982
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:57.260
You will alleviate this burden by eliminating nonessential demands.

983
01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:02.120
You go to any business and they've got reports that people are generating and

984
01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:06.740
meetings that they're attending and conference calls.
That's what this is about.

985
01:04:06.741 --> 01:04:10.580
Those are needless requirements.
Get rid of them.
Yeah man.

986
01:04:10.581 --> 01:04:12.330
Especially those meetings like

987
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.740
<v 3>I think people just like meetings cause it,
it,
um,</v>

988
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.210
it helps them think or feel like they're doing something,
doing something,

989
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:24.530
you know?
Which do you make meetings 20 minutes long,
Brad?

990
01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:28.040
Just call them on the phone.
Yeah.
Or You just call him on the phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.

991
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:30.650
But meetings would make them make your meetings 20 minutes long if you have to

992
01:04:30.651 --> 01:04:35.030
schedule them,
show up on the meeting,
ready to,
don't need,

993
01:04:35.031 --> 01:04:37.580
don't need to learn anything.
Let us know what we're going to talk about.

994
01:04:37.581 --> 01:04:40.340
Let's talk about the decision because that's what everyone needs to get on the

995
01:04:40.341 --> 01:04:43.270
phone for.
It's for the decision.
Yeah,
you should.

996
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.010
You can get informed by reading a quick bulleted list.

997
01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:48.890
So I go over those bullets with me when I already did that.
Yeah.

998
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:51.830
Unless they have questions or something like that,
like I got a question.

999
01:04:51.831 --> 01:04:54.200
That's what I'm saying.
That's the discussion piece.
Yeah.

1000
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:58.430
And then in the meeting,
a lot of the time,

1001
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:01.790
let's say there's a meeting of 10 guys and let's say three,

1002
01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:05.270
four guys or are discussing stuff and maybe they're trying to solve this problem

1003
01:05:05.271 --> 01:05:08.120
that they specifically have.
And then the other few guys,

1004
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:12.860
they feel compelled to want to be contributing to the meeting.

1005
01:05:12.861 --> 01:05:16.070
So they say just more of the stuff that's so unnecessary.

1006
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.310
Just so they can have to say in the meeting

1007
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:23.020
<v 1>Sidebar,
take it somewhere else.
You've angered echo people,</v>

1008
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:28.030
tobacco,
the meetings,
keeping them 20 minutes.
There's a whole,

1009
01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:30.040
there's a whole lot of people in America,

1010
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:34.630
in business world that are listening to that needless requirements and they're

1011
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:35.770
thinking about the need,

1012
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:39.840
this requirements they fulfill on a daily basis and it makes them angry.
It's a,

1013
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:42.670
it's a,
it's a source of frustration.
I talked to folks about it all the time,

1014
01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:45.820
like they feel like they don't have time to do their job and we felt like that

1015
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:50.170
in the military.
Like,
are you serious?
We have to do,
you know,

1016
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.670
fill out this document,
attend another call with the so-and-so commander.

1017
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:58.090
Just tell me,
you know,
give me the highlights and let me do my work.

1018
01:05:58.091 --> 01:05:59.770
I got a job to do here.
People,

1019
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:03.303
infantry,

1020
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.090
infantry must move in order to close with the infantry must move in order to

1021
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:12.550
close with the enemy.
It must shoot in order to move again.

1022
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:16.240
There's covering move when physical targets are not visible.

1023
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:21.870
The fire of all infantry weapons must search the area occupied by the enemy,

1024
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.650
use marching fire.

1025
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.550
It reduces the accuracy of his fire and increases our confidence.

1026
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:31.840
Shoot Short ricochets make nasty or sounds and wounds.

1027
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.250
That's something that they used to have us do all the time in the seal teams so

1028
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.181
you don't eat.

1029
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:40.150
You make sure you're shooting low if you're going to make a mistake,
aim low.

1030
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:44.110
So the to the rounds hit in front of where the enemy is and they ricochet up and

1031
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:47.560
they hit him with all kinds of frag and rocks and you have a chance of still

1032
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:50.350
hitting.
If you shoot over their head and it misses him,
it's called Gotcha.

1033
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:55.830
Interesting to halt under fire is folly to halt under fire and not fire back his

1034
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:00.610
suicide.
And this is what we just talked about in Jujitsu to halt under fire.

1035
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.470
That's what you're doing when you win,
when you let me keep scrambling,

1036
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:08.380
when you stop scrambling,
that's what I'm going to get a little thing.

1037
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:13.300
You're halting under fire and guess what it says here that that is suicide.

1038
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.550
Move forward.
Out of fire officers must set the example.

1039
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.440
Few men are killed by the bay and net.

1040
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.260
Many are scared by it ban that should be fixed.
When the firefight starts,

1041
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:33.400
bayonets must be sharpened by the individual soldier.

1042
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:39.390
The German hates the band net and is inferior to our men with it are men should

1043
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:44.340
know this little psychological warfare here and you got to sharpen your own band

1044
01:07:44.341 --> 01:07:46.390
that you're better at it than the enemy.

1045
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.140
Put that thing on the end of your gun when the firefight starts and get ready to

1046
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:53.920
get some.
Yeah,
that's,

1047
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.470
that's general pattern right there.
Keeping it real.

1048
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:03.370
I wanted to work for General Patton.
Care of men.

1049
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:08.200
Officers are responsible not only for the conduct of their men in battle,

1050
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:12.670
but also for their health and contentment when not fighting and officer,

1051
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.850
and this is where he's going back to the CEO and how they act and officer must

1052
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:21.110
be the last man to take shelter from fire and the first to move forward.

1053
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.400
Similarly,

1054
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.290
he must be the last man to look after his own comfort at the close of a march.

1055
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.450
He must see that his men are cared for.

1056
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:34.700
The officer must consider constantly inner interest himself in the rations of

1057
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:35.534
the men.

1058
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.250
He should know his men so well that any sign of sickness or nervous strain will

1059
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:44.720
be apparent to him and he can take such action as may be necessary.

1060
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.920
Same thing we were,
we were talking about

1061
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.300
and we're about to,
uh,

1062
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.020
wrap this up here with a couple more and I kind of saved the best for last to be

1063
01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:02.630
quite honest with you.
Such as this right here,

1064
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:06.470
command leadership.
And this is a,

1065
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.750
this is actually another letter of instructions to the,
again,

1066
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:12.950
this is just what you want to know.
How general patent fought here.

1067
01:09:12.951 --> 01:09:17.951
It is his own words on what he wanted his men to know as they prepared for

1068
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:23.000
combat leadership.
Full duty.

1069
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.040
Each in his appropriate sphere will lead in person.

1070
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:34.180
Any commander who fails to obtain his objective and who is not dead or severely

1071
01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:37.490
wounded has not done his full duty.

1072
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.060
Doesn't need to be much clearer than that.
Yeah,
there's your,
there's your,

1073
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:48.080
there's your standard.

1074
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:53.140
If you're not dead or severely wounded and you haven't achieved your objective

1075
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.000
objective,
you haven't done your full duty visits to the front.

1076
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:03.230
The commanding general,
his chief of staff should visit the front daily.

1077
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.190
The function of these is to observe,
not to meddle.

1078
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.100
In addition to their own specialty,

1079
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:13.850
they must observe and report anything of military importance.

1080
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.290
Remember that praise is more valuable than blame.

1081
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:19.530
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1082
01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.000
<v 1>so if you're going to go to the front line troops,</v>

1083
01:10:21.001 --> 01:10:23.010
don't go up there and blame them.
Praising them.

1084
01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.690
Remember too that your primary mission as a leader is to see with your own eyes

1085
01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:32.670
and be seen by your troops while engaged in personal recognizance

1086
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:38.530
execution,
in carrying out a mission.

1087
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.060
The propagation of the order represents not over 10% of your responsibility.

1088
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:48.070
The remaining 90% consists in assuring by means of personal supervision on the

1089
01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:53.071
ground by yourself and your staff proper and vigorous execution.

1090
01:10:53.981 --> 01:10:58.630
And that's when we already talked about,
yeah,
you put together the plan.
Yeah.

1091
01:10:58.631 --> 01:11:01.030
You disseminated the plan.
That's great.

1092
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.930
Your job is to make it happen and ensure that it happens.

1093
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.050
Take ownership of it and execute it.

1094
01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:12.873
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1095
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.860
<v 1>Plans.</v>

1096
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 0>Plans must be simple and flexible.
Actually.</v>

1097
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:24.290
They are only a form of data plain from which you build as necessity directs or

1098
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.090
opportunity offers.

1099
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.440
<v 1>So he's saying that plan is just a,
just something to build off of as,</v>

1100
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:38.900
as necessity directs or opportunity offers.
I got asked this the other day at a,

1101
01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.750
at a,
at an event,
you know,

1102
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.190
when do you know what it's time to change the plan when I,
you know,

1103
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:51.080
when necessity directs or opportunity offers,
that's when you make the change.

1104
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:52.123
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1105
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:58.080
<v 1>Plans should be made by the people who are going to execute them.</v>

1106
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.383
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1107
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.710
<v 1>Formal orders.</v>

1108
01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:08.390
Formal orders will be proceeded by letters of instruction and by personal

1109
01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:10.850
conferences.
In this way,

1110
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear together with the mission

1111
01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:19.340
to be accomplished by each major unit.

1112
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:22.190
So he's saying that though the,

1113
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.540
the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear

1114
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:31.530
so that if during combat,

1115
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.990
during combat communication breaks down,

1116
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:39.290
each commander can and must so act as to obtain the general objective.

1117
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1118
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:47.040
<v 1>There you go.
So if you understand what the overall broad mission is,</v>

1119
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:49.740
when we go out to attack in,

1120
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:52.590
all of a sudden you're separated from us or you don't,

1121
01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:57.030
can't communicate with us anymore or so something happens and you need to make

1122
01:12:57.031 --> 01:12:57.870
an adjustment,
your plan,

1123
01:12:57.871 --> 01:13:02.070
as long as you know what the broad mission is,

1124
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:05.490
the whole purpose of the operation of which later ended up being called the

1125
01:13:05.491 --> 01:13:07.350
commander's intent.
That's what we called it and eh,

1126
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.450
in the modern military w as long as you know what the commander's intent is,

1127
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:15.780
what the intent of the operations,
then you can execute on your own.

1128
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:19.440
You don't need any more direction from me.
Yeah,
go and make it happen.

1129
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.160
Keep your own orders short.
Get them out in time.

1130
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.800
Issue them personally by voice when you can

1131
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:34.790
keep troops informed,

1132
01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:40.300
use every means before and after combat to tell the troops what they are doing,

1133
01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.590
what they are going to do and what they have done.

1134
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.750
Reiterating discipline.
There is only one kind of discipline.
Perfect discipline.

1135
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:56.140
If you do not enforce and maintain discipline,

1136
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.480
you are potential murderers.

1137
01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:02.200
You must set the example condition.

1138
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.130
Hi,
physical condition is a vital to victory.

1139
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:14.260
We talked about that and we about that all the time.
Your physical conditioning,

1140
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.220
high physical condition is vital to victory.

1141
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:23.410
There are more tired core and division commanders than there are tired core and

1142
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:24.460
divisions.

1143
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.880
Fatigue makes cowards of us all men in condition do not tire.

1144
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.300
So you gotta be in shape.
And here's the close,

1145
01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:38.590
and this is the last one,

1146
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:44.430
and it's the shortest one and it's probably the most important one to remember

1147
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.160
from general patent

1148
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.180
courage.

1149
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.760
Do not take counsel of your fears.

1150
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.413
That's it.

1151
01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.740
That's what he had to say about courage to all of his troops as they embarked on

1152
01:15:07.741 --> 01:15:12.600
this intense combat day after day,
week after week.

1153
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:15.060
You want to know what you do with your fear.

1154
01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:18.180
Do not take counsel of your fears,

1155
01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:24.060
No vote.
They don't get a vote and your fears don't get a vote.

1156
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:29.610
So next time you feel that fear,
no matter what it is,

1157
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.740
it's pretty easy.
You the you don't take counsel,
love it.
They get no vote.

1158
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.740
That's general patent.
Great Book,

1159
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:45.150
Great Leader,
lots to learn,
lots to pass on

1160
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.590
war as I knew it.

1161
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.480
Questions from the interweb.

1162
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.823
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1163
01:15:55.370 --> 01:16:00.370
First Question Jocko Willink is Bjj really practical for street defense where

1164
01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:01.460
there are no rules.

1165
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.750
My understanding is that it doesn't fair well against knives and multiple

1166
01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:10.040
attackers compared to something like Krav Maga.
Muy Thai boxing.

1167
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:13.120
<v 1>So this is a</v>

1168
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.240
good question obviously and it's a question that we get a lot.
I get a lot.
Uh,

1169
01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.720
I actually did a video,

1170
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:26.250
we did a video like this and Tim Ferriss port it out so you can look for that.

1171
01:16:26.251 --> 01:16:29.760
If you kind of want to hear another version of this,

1172
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.920
maybe we could link to it on Jocko podcasts.
I think we can do that.
Yeah.

1173
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.220
Excellent.
Um,
what,
okay,

1174
01:16:38.221 --> 01:16:41.400
so self where we're talking about true self defense here.

1175
01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:45.180
First and foremost,
most important thing,

1176
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.610
and I actually didn't say this on the last video,

1177
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.460
but I should say it now,

1178
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.940
is situational awareness and putting yourself in good situations where bad

1179
01:16:58.351 --> 01:17:01.170
things are not going to happen to you and doing that to the best of your ability

1180
01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:02.940
and your being aware of your surroundings.

1181
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.840
That's the very important first step in self,

1182
01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.660
second
guns.

1183
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.420
Uh,

1184
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.420
if you are a person that really needs to defend yourself and you live in a

1185
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:27.970
horrible area and there's violent people around and you might be us small,

1186
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:35.141
a very small person or you might be elderly or you might have some sort of a

1187
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.490
physical limitation,

1188
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.360
then how you're going to defend yourself is using guns using a gun.

1189
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.760
So I mean that's just,
that's just the way it is

1190
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:56.260
now.
Okay.
So that being said,
uh,

1191
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.660
maybe you can't have a gun,

1192
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:03.110
maybe you don't have a gun and you don't always want to have to pull a gun out.

1193
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.890
Even though a gun is a great deterrent in most people if they see that you have

1194
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.020
a gun or not going to want to fight you anymore.

1195
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:13.550
But obviously you can't be just yanking the gun out at anything that happens and

1196
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:17.060
you don't always have them with you.
For instance,
you know,

1197
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.540
in certain places you're not allowed to have a gun.
Certain states,

1198
01:18:20.541 --> 01:18:23.930
you're not allowed to have a gun in the,
in the water.
If you're surfing,

1199
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.710
you're not allowed to have a gun.
Uh,
so what do you do?

1200
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:32.990
How does did you to stack up against these other martial arts?

1201
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:39.250
I say that you should learn Jujitsu first should be the first martial art that

1202
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:43.430
you try and learn to defend yourself.

1203
01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:48.410
And there's a reason for that.
There's a bunch of reasons for that.
Number one,

1204
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:52.730
it's sort of a base reason,

1205
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.990
but do you do to is probably the most complex to learn.
There's the,

1206
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:58.011
it's the,

1207
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:03.011
it's the most three dimensional martial art.

1208
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.370
It's not linear,
it's very three dimensional.
There's a ton to learn.

1209
01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.990
It's infinite in what you can learn.

1210
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:12.350
So you want to get into it early because it's going to take longer to learn it.

1211
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.630
But that's,
that's actually a secondary reason.

1212
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:19.870
The primary reason to learn Jujitsu first is because of the nature of self

1213
01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:26.960
defense situations.
So

1214
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:33.670
we are born with our primary form of self defense and we learn it from a very

1215
01:19:34.281 --> 01:19:35.114
young age.

1216
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.540
And our primary form of self defense will keep you safe from most of these

1217
01:19:41.871 --> 01:19:45.350
situations.
And that is running

1218
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:51.560
and using your legs to run.
So,
and if you think of,

1219
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:52.580
now think about this,

1220
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:57.110
you're kind of chuckling because you don't understand the gravity of what I'm

1221
01:19:57.111 --> 01:19:59.990
saying cause it's very accurate.
So listen,

1222
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.640
we're talking about self defense.
We're not talking about offense,

1223
01:20:04.641 --> 01:20:07.300
we're talking about defense.
How do you stay safe?
Yeah.

1224
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:10.110
So if I square off with you,

1225
01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.633
<v 0>okay.</v>

1226
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.370
<v 1>And I want to fight and punch you</v>

1227
01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.153
<v 0>runaway,</v>

1228
01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.190
<v 1>I am not holding onto you,
right?</v>

1229
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:23.770
I had run away if there's me and three of my friends

1230
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:26.340
<v 0>run away,</v>

1231
01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.080
<v 1>if I have a knife and I'm going to try and stab you,</v>

1232
01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.233
runaway.

1233
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:41.610
So all these kind of attacks there,

1234
01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:46.290
a disconnected attack.
I'm not holding onto you.
So run away from me.

1235
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:49.350
Get out of there.
Run into a public place.

1236
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:52.680
Run to where there's other people that can help you run.

1237
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.520
Where this changes

1238
01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:00.820
is when somebody grabs a hold of you.

1239
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:04.390
When somebody grabs a hold of you,

1240
01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:09.540
you can no longer run away and you have to be able to make them on grab you let

1241
01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:16.450
go of you.
And how do you do that?

1242
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.080
You do that by knowing how to grapple and grappling as Jujitsu.

1243
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:27.690
So that is why the first thing you should learn is Jujitsu.

1244
01:21:29.230 --> 01:21:33.700
Because if someone's not grabbing a hold of you,
run away from them.

1245
01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.960
If someone's trying to square off and and go toe to toe with you,

1246
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:43.990
run away from them.
If there's five guys that want to fight,

1247
01:21:43.991 --> 01:21:45.790
you run away from them.

1248
01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:51.070
If someone pulls out a knife on you run.
But here's the deal.

1249
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:55.420
If that person knocks you down and gets on top of you,

1250
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:58.090
you can't run anymore.
So what do you have to do?

1251
01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:03.570
You have to grapple them and you have to know Jujitsu to to get them up and off

1252
01:22:04.191 --> 01:22:07.900
of you and get away from them or submit them and put them to sleep or break

1253
01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:12.280
their arm.
That is why you should start with Jujitsu.

1254
01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:18.340
Pretty straightforward.
Agreed.
Once you know Jujitsu,

1255
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.330
absolutely.
Learn Moitai,
learn wrestling,

1256
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.400
learn boxing,
learned Krav Maga,
learn a screamer on it.

1257
01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:31.000
Learn everything you can about fighting.
Do It of course,

1258
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:36.270
but set your base with the one that you're going to need if somebody grabs you.

1259
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:38.920
And that's Jujitsu.

1260
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:46.830
The other thing about Jujitsu is it's pretty easy to add in

1261
01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.700
some of these other more animalistic self defense situations.

1262
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:59.310
So if somebody grabs you and pulls you to the ground and you want to get away

1263
01:22:59.531 --> 01:23:02.380
from there,
yeah you can.
You need to know your body positions,

1264
01:23:02.381 --> 01:23:05.530
but it's pretty easy to decide you're going to bite their ear off or big take a

1265
01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:06.070
big chunk

1266
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.690
<v 2>out of their face with your teeth or GM,
your fingers into their eyes.
It's,</v>

1267
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:13.490
it's not hard to augment that stuff.
Yeah.

1268
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:17.860
So these are all things that you can do within Jujitsu that Jujitsu does not

1269
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:23.950
hamper that ability to be savage in your attacks on people.

1270
01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.980
And that's interesting you bring up,
because

1271
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:32.260
everyone's heard the guy where he'll be like,
hey,
what's that?

1272
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.130
You get through whatever.
And then,
I dunno,

1273
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:37.600
you just show him where you explain it and they'll be like,
oh,
wolf all just all,

1274
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.980
I just gouge your eyes out right here.
Or I just,
um,
you know,

1275
01:23:41.981 --> 01:23:45.370
I don't know the strike your throat or something like this.
Right.

1276
01:23:45.371 --> 01:23:48.340
So take the eye gouging option.

1277
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:52.450
You don't have to be trained to eye gouge.
So we both,

1278
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.920
well I go to each other like if you're,
if we're going to go eye gouging.
Yeah.

1279
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.160
I've had people try not to gouge me before.
Yeah.

1280
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.660
It's not going to stop it and that it hasn't stopped.
That's a second point.
Um,

1281
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.860
Sarah's brother,
we was off for like,
metamorris were talking and he,
he,

1282
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.390
he'd basically did that.
He was asking questions.
He'd be like,
no,
I won't lie.

1283
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.280
I don't have to learn Jujitsu.
I would just do this.
And he'd like,
he's like,

1284
01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:18.770
I know like pressure points that sub people.
And I was like,
yeah.
So I said,
okay,

1285
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.970
Darth Vader.
Yeah,
exactly.
So I was like,
okay,

1286
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:24.490
well what's the pressure point though?
So I was like,
okay,

1287
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:27.100
do the pressure point on me.
I won't even like fight you back.

1288
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.710
And he did the one like here by the neck.
And I was like,

1289
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:33.850
not only does that not hurt right now,
I mean I can see it.

1290
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.380
It hurts more than if you did it here.

1291
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.120
But not only does that not really hurt that much right now,
if,

1292
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.200
if we're in any kind of fight situation,

1293
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:44.430
I don't even think I would even notice that they'll still,
he was like,
oh yeah,

1294
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.820
yeah,
will live you get this one.

1295
01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:49.030
And he did one like behind me here and then where my ribs,
same exact thing.

1296
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:53.330
It's yet,
it's more sensitive for sure.
But it's not going to start a fight,
man.

1297
01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:57.430
Yeah,
it's,
it simply does not work.

1298
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.940
But the Jujitsu,
you know,
Jujitsu,

1299
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.270
you can still do all those things if you want to do it,

1300
01:25:04.271 --> 01:25:07.560
but you don't even have to.
Yeah.
Cause we're going to put them to sleep.
Yeah.

1301
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.520
And I would say even in my opinion,
more accurately do you do to help you?

1302
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:17.470
Or it'll give you the ability to control the fight.
Oh,
for sure.

1303
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.510
So you can look,
if you get to,

1304
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:23.920
you're not going to learn how to throw like a sick left hook or nothing like

1305
01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:24.910
that.
You're not going to learn that.

1306
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.600
But you'll control the fight where if you want to punch someone,

1307
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.930
you'll be in the perfect position to punch him no matter how much punching

1308
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:35.240
training you have.
You can have no punching training and you can just,
I dunno,

1309
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:37.360
just throw your fist at them in whatever capacity.

1310
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:41.650
It will be way more effective when you know Jujitsu and that goes through any

1311
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:46.651
other one of these moves that people say they'll do if you do Jujitsu on them,

1312
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:48.700
know you're the one going to control the fight.

1313
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.530
With all those people who've come to me and I've gone through them all,

1314
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:56.890
no factor of the pressure points,
the this,
the,
that doesn't work.
Sorry.

1315
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.000
Sorry to tell you.

1316
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:03.810
It might work like you know the risk ones if you sit there

1317
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.710
<v 3>and let them do it and be like,
okay,
yeah,
that hurts.</v>

1318
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.410
And also going against someone that's completely untrained.

1319
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.150
You can't have some sort of success with some of this stuff.

1320
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:18.290
Right.
Not against a determined attacker.

1321
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:22.160
Kind of the point where it's like,
yeah,
I say,
yeah,

1322
01:26:22.161 --> 01:26:24.290
it might work if you let them do it,
but that's the thing.

1323
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:25.190
You don't let them do it.

1324
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:30.470
So ultimately it learned the likelihood of that work can very,

1325
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:35.030
very low.
Just in the spirit of fairness.
Fun.
Yeah.
It's creative.

1326
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:38.780
It's a good workout.
It ups your confidence.
It gets,

1327
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:42.950
you used to come combative situations where you're going 100% you get,

1328
01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:45.560
you used to having someone grind on you and try and smash you.

1329
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:49.650
That's a big deal that I didn't even think about where just having someone in,

1330
01:26:49.651 --> 01:26:53.810
in girls especially or just people who aren't used to confrontation and then

1331
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:55.220
when you get in a fight,

1332
01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.280
it inoculates you to the terror of having somebody all up winding up on you and

1333
01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:05.570
trying to smash you.
I want to say it was UFC

1334
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.970
for which one was one with our Jimmerson with the one glove was that it was a

1335
01:27:10.971 --> 01:27:12.270
wall and that was one.
Okay,

1336
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:17.040
so he got mounted and tapped in men.

1337
01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:20.470
That's a perfect example.
He didn't get punched,
you know,

1338
01:27:20.471 --> 01:27:23.110
he didn't tap from any kind of punch or submission old.

1339
01:27:23.111 --> 01:27:26.380
He got mounted and then in an interview later I saw,
he said,
man,

1340
01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:29.710
I was just feeling claustrophobic over there.
And if you watch it,

1341
01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:33.490
he wasn't mounted for very long.
No,
it was just,
man,
he just wasn't used to that.

1342
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:36.580
And in hedging,
if that was a real life fight,

1343
01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.790
someone attacks you and they're like,
oh,
I'm good on you and you don't know,

1344
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:42.700
then you can't tap man.
You're,
you're not gonna be able to handle that.
Right.

1345
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.980
If you know Jujitsu,
you get mounted.
That's no factor.

1346
01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.210
Press to some people they know mountainscapes so good where they hope they get

1347
01:27:49.211 --> 01:27:50.920
mobbed until they can get on top.
You know?

1348
01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:55.690
And then so you compare those two sides of the spectrum do just to know that you

1349
01:27:55.691 --> 01:28:00.370
get to know the Jujitsu.
Next,

1350
01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:05.020
next question.
Can you expand on how to appropriately,

1351
01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.060
effectively and tactfully lead up the chain of command in a profession that's

1352
01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:12.160
considered to be very paramilitary?

1353
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:18.380
My Line of work.
Sometimes it works against this limiting,

1354
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:22.790
limiting ideas and ways of doing things and they're talking about the tradition

1355
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:26.450
in their line of work.
Uh,
okay.
So what do you do?

1356
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.830
You got to organization you're working in and you've,

1357
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.800
how do you lead up the chain of command?

1358
01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.020
<v 0>Well,
eat</v>

1359
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.050
<v 3>even in a paramilitary organization of which you know,</v>

1360
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:47.070
infers that this is a very hierarchical structure and its chain of command

1361
01:28:47.111 --> 01:28:47.944
driven,

1362
01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:52.960
that how do you possibly get your boss to do what you want them to do?

1363
01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:58.780
Well,
it's actually fairly simple,
fairly simple.

1364
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:02.160
Not Easy,
but simple.
It,
it is hard to do.

1365
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.540
<v 1>It does take a lot more though.
It does take a lot of tack.</v>

1366
01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.060
It takes a lot of patients.
So number one,
you got to build trust.

1367
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:10.890
You've got to build trust with your,

1368
01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:13.080
the people that are above you and the chain of command.

1369
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:15.510
You got to build a relationship.
You got to be proactive.

1370
01:29:15.511 --> 01:29:20.320
You've got to stay ahead.
You know,
when I joined the military I one,

1371
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:23.100
you know one day just told my dad,
hey by the way,
I joined the,

1372
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:24.750
I enlisted in the navy,
I'll be,

1373
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:28.350
I'll be gone in three weeks or whatever if my dad just looked at me and shook

1374
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:32.490
his head and he says,
you're going to hate the military cause you hate authority.

1375
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.200
You don't listen to anybody.

1376
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.070
And I was kind of a young stupid kid and I'm like whatever.

1377
01:29:38.071 --> 01:29:41.970
I'm going in the seal teams,
it's a team.
We don't have to listen to anybody.

1378
01:29:41.971 --> 01:29:46.800
Of course I was completely wrong and you do listen to people and you do have a

1379
01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:47.760
chain of command.

1380
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:53.390
But he was right in the fact that I didn't like to listen to people and I didn't

1381
01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:56.760
like authority.
So how did I get ahead of that?
It was pretty easy.

1382
01:29:56.761 --> 01:30:01.650
What I did to get ahead of that was I got ahead of it and that's what you need

1383
01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:03.600
to do here.
You have to start that,

1384
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:08.750
start that attitude of where you're doing what needs to be done before you get

1385
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:10.980
told to do it.

1386
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:16.130
So you start to appear to have more knowledge and good foresight of what's going

1387
01:30:17.931 --> 01:30:22.290
to happen.
Now you got to be careful that you're not showing up the boss.

1388
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.530
You can't be throwing in their face and already did that,
you know,

1389
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:28.140
because I'm so much better than you.
That's not the goal here.

1390
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:31.950
The goal is to build confidence,
not to build animosity.

1391
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.950
You don't want to build animosity.
You want to build trust,

1392
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:36.090
you want to build confidence.

1393
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.130
You want to make that person start to realize how good you are.

1394
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:45.540
Again,
be careful not to throw it in their face.
Now,

1395
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:48.150
the tradition piece and,

1396
01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:53.760
and sometimes people do cling on to the traditions and they use the traditions

1397
01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.900
to shut down evolution.

1398
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:03.830
And that's bad because what they're really doing is they're protecting their

1399
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:08.880
world.
They're protecting their existence.

1400
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.150
And so that's a,
that's a big wall.

1401
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.300
That's a big hard wall to get through.

1402
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.890
Now most people do have traditions and traditions.

1403
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.940
What are traditions built on?
Do We build traditions?

1404
01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.210
Are Traditions of failure and we're proud of that or the traditions of losing or

1405
01:31:27.211 --> 01:31:29.970
Pat,
no,
no,
no.
The traditions are proud traditions,

1406
01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.910
the traditions of winning their traditions,
of excellence.

1407
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.420
And in some way traditions of excellence and traditions of winning and

1408
01:31:39.391 --> 01:31:44.130
traditions of domination have to be tied in some way

1409
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.980
to evolving into adapting and to getting better.

1410
01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.670
Because that's how we win.
That's how we dominate.

1411
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.300
So you have to find that hole in the tradition,

1412
01:31:57.510 --> 01:32:02.510
that part of the tradition that implies that what we do in our tradition is we

1413
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:06.550
get better.
That's all it is.

1414
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:10.360
You just got to find that thing that says we get better,
we win.

1415
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:12.460
And you take that and you carry that,

1416
01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:17.610
that lead that little crack in the armor of tradition and you turn that into,

1417
01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.770
you know,
yeah,
we have a proud tradition because we're the best.

1418
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:25.420
And if you're going to be the best is the best stagnate.
No,
the best evolves.

1419
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:28.540
And again,
you gotta be careful.
You can't throw this in their face.

1420
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:31.870
You got to say,
Hey,
you know what?
Our traditions that we're the best.

1421
01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:36.190
We make things happen and we get things done and we always do it better than

1422
01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:39.510
everyone else.
So you know what?

1423
01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.630
Here's one way we could do a better,
we did this.

1424
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:47.900
You got to look for those little Araks in the tradition to bring forward change.

1425
01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.780
Now again,
the most important thing though is you got to continue to build that

1426
01:32:54.781 --> 01:32:58.140
relationship with your superiors.
You're constantly trying to build that,

1427
01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:01.560
and I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.
No matter who I ever worked for,

1428
01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.710
I had the same relationship with the crazy boss,
with a knucklehead boss,

1429
01:33:04.711 --> 01:33:07.440
with the loser,
with a great guy,
had the same relationship all the time,

1430
01:33:07.441 --> 01:33:10.620
and that was they trusted me,
didn't matter who I work for.

1431
01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:13.320
So you got to build that relationship of trust.

1432
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:20.010
You've also got to be careful that as you're trying to be proactive and as

1433
01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:21.360
you're trying to get things done,

1434
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:24.990
that you're not looking to do it for your own ego to get credit,

1435
01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.340
because that disturbs the people at the top.
It makes them say,
oh,

1436
01:33:29.341 --> 01:33:32.730
he's just trying to shine.
He just trying to look good.
Screw him,

1437
01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:37.770
throw his ideas out.
That's what you got to watch out for.
So that's your ego.

1438
01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:42.780
Don't make your ego fight their ego because they've got an ego too.

1439
01:33:42.781 --> 01:33:44.400
You want to let your ego go,

1440
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:46.000
<v 0>okay,</v>

1441
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.640
<v 1>build that relationship.
Make the change slow.</v>

1442
01:33:50.641 --> 01:33:52.740
It's going to be slow,
steady,

1443
01:33:52.741 --> 01:33:57.300
and it's going to take persistence in the long war.

1444
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.990
Dope.
You got to have patients.
Tradition doesn't break down overnight.

1445
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.700
Tradition takes time to morph.

1446
01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:09.060
So you gotta be ready for that long war and don't get frustrated.

1447
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:11.910
You're a part of a winning team.

1448
01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:14.220
You're part of a team that has a proud tradition.

1449
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:17.070
You just got to add to that tradition and that's gonna take time.

1450
01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:24.210
<v 0>That's how you do it.
Next question.</v>

1451
01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:28.290
Hi Guys.
How about on a podcast?

1452
01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:33.291
Do you talk about what is the essential equipment for a home gym?

1453
01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:41.160
<v 1>Uh,
okay.
So for me,
first of all,</v>

1454
01:34:41.161 --> 01:34:43.530
if you have nothing,
if you're building from zero,

1455
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.290
the first thing you need is pull up bars,

1456
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:50.300
a pull up bar and a dip bar somewhere.

1457
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:53.940
Did you dips in somewhere to do pull ups in?
And that's what you need.

1458
01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:57.000
Now be careful if you're listening and you're like,
okay,
I'm going to go buy,

1459
01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.070
pull up bar.
In a dip bar.

1460
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:03.430
Don't get the little flimsy looking things that costs $129.

1461
01:35:05.190 --> 01:35:07.820
Do you don't want that.
It's almost worthless.

1462
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:11.060
It's better than nothing but is almost worthless.

1463
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:15.500
You want to get a legit dip bar and a legit pull up.

1464
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.570
Our dip bars are a little bit easier.
You can go,

1465
01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.710
you can go pretty cheesy on dip bars,
but pull up bars.
You can pull up bars,

1466
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:25.370
you need something legit strong,
you can bolt it to your wall,

1467
01:35:25.371 --> 01:35:27.470
but you need a nice pull up bar with a,

1468
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.090
with a inch and a half or a two inch metal pipe.

1469
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:36.200
I still have a pull up bar that I bought from home depot.

1470
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:37.370
Uh,

1471
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.520
I bought it in 1998 I've had it ever since and it's bolted on to my squat rack,

1472
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.060
but that's all it is.
A piece of,
you know,

1473
01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.970
two inch pipe and that's what you do pull ups on.
So when you say it,

1474
01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:52.821
make sure it's legit.

1475
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:57.290
Why is that so you don't feel it doesn't break while you're using it basically.

1476
01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:00.010
Yeah.
And also it's got to have some weight to it.

1477
01:36:00.011 --> 01:36:01.910
So you can do kipping pull ups or you're not,

1478
01:36:01.911 --> 01:36:04.490
the thing's not shaking all over the place.
You get,
you see these,

1479
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:06.620
I mean this is just going total cheese ball,

1480
01:36:06.621 --> 01:36:11.621
but things with like the foam handles that just rotate and fall off and they're

1481
01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:15.800
just,
it's just a nightmare.
You want to,
what you need is a pipe,

1482
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:20.710
has what you need is a piece of pipe from home depot
and,

1483
01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.480
and then you need somewhere to do dips.

1484
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.480
Now one thing that you can do that will cover both these as you can get rings,

1485
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:31.700
you know,
gymnastics rings and you can have,

1486
01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.080
you can adjust the height of the rings and you can do dips and pull ups on
ranks.

1487
01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:39.110
And then you can do muscle ups as well.
So rings are Omel.

1488
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.990
So like if there's one thing you could have,

1489
01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:44.600
if you could have one piece of equipment for working out,

1490
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:49.120
it probably be smart to go with just wooden rings,
uh,

1491
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:53.480
because that there are that flexible and you can do that much different stuff.

1492
01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:56.210
I mean you can do dips,
you can do muscle ups,
you can do pull ups,

1493
01:36:56.211 --> 01:37:00.590
you can do pushups,
can do all kinds of stuff.
You can do levers,

1494
01:37:00.591 --> 01:37:02.240
you can do front levers,
back levers,

1495
01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:04.070
there's all kinds of gymnastic movie you can do.
I mean,

1496
01:37:04.071 --> 01:37:06.950
you could basically work for the rest of your life on rings and be good to go.

1497
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:11.950
So rings are a way of handling the whole pull up and dip bar situation.

1498
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.980
But,
and that's why it's pretty much the number two thing for me is,

1499
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.300
is
pull up bark dip bar slash,

1500
01:37:23.301 --> 01:37:27.740
rinks because those are all going to kind of get you those basic body movements

1501
01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:32.210
to build your strength.
Uh,
once you get past that,

1502
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:37.130
now it's time for a squat rack.
It's got to have a squat rack.

1503
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:40.320
And as soon as you have a squat rack,
now my school,

1504
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:44.900
my squat rack has a pullup bar on it,
which I bolted on myself.

1505
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:49.930
My squat rack is the same year when I bought my first house,

1506
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:53.510
immediately had a garage gym.
It was 20,
I don't know,

1507
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.190
27 years ago or something that built

1508
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:59.310
<v 3>a garage gym immediately bought a squat rack.</v>

1509
01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:01.130
It's still have the same squat rack bolted,

1510
01:38:01.131 --> 01:38:02.880
a pull up bar onto it's still have that.

1511
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:07.080
I modified it a little bit and made dip bar.
So I had a dip bar on it.

1512
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:10.760
This is before you could buy gymnastic rings or I didn't know how to get ahold

1513
01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:13.320
of gymnastics rings back in those days.

1514
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:17.160
And then the next thing get you need is you need,
um,

1515
01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:21.300
an Olympic lifting bar and,
and bumper plates.

1516
01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:26.220
And so you can do your squats,
your cleans,

1517
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:28.350
your cleaning jerks,
your dead lifts,

1518
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:31.980
and all your basic strength movements.

1519
01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:33.960
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1520
01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.160
<v 3>Um,
after that,
for me,
I think kettle bells,</v>

1521
01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:42.660
um,
you know,
so now you have,
you can do your swings,

1522
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:48.120
you can do your farmer's walks,
you can do your snatches,
you can,
I mean,

1523
01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:51.580
there's a ton of exercises,
Turkish getups.

1524
01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.050
I mean there's a ton of exercises that you can do there that kettle bells now

1525
01:38:55.110 --> 01:39:00.110
add to the situation and you can do some really psychotic conditioning,

1526
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:05.370
metabolic conditioning with the addition of kettle bells as well.

1527
01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:09.570
At this point,
if you only have one set of rings,

1528
01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:13.110
I have three sets of rings and I have one that's high for muscle ups.

1529
01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:17.070
I have one that's medium for depths and I have one that's low for for pushups

1530
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.050
and I just have those all the time.

1531
01:39:19.051 --> 01:39:21.960
So then you don't have to adjust them cause I guess I'm too lazy to want to

1532
01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.280
adjustment rings all the time.

1533
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:28.620
The next piece for me is

1534
01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.020
I like rowers.
The concept two rowers,
I have one,
I've had it for a long time.

1535
01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.430
They're brutal workout.

1536
01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.480
I think that you can just destroy yourself very easily and very quickly and I

1537
01:39:43.931 --> 01:39:47.110
think like uh,
like an Airdyne or an air assault type bike,

1538
01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.510
I don't have one of those.
I'm probably going to get one very soon,

1539
01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:54.880
but I think those are outstanding as well.
I didn't say jump rope earlier.

1540
01:39:54.881 --> 01:39:59.881
That's another good kind of cardio kind of metcon kind of get after it and then

1541
01:40:00.431 --> 01:40:05.170
maybe some medicine balls.
Um,
and after that,

1542
01:40:05.171 --> 01:40:09.220
I mean I think,
you know,
the question was essential equipment to me,

1543
01:40:09.221 --> 01:40:13.840
that's sort of my list.
And then from there it just becomes fun.
You know,

1544
01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:14.371
it becomes a,

1545
01:40:14.371 --> 01:40:18.220
what kind of other implements can I bring into the situation that are going to

1546
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:23.020
eliminate boredom,
increase creativity,

1547
01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:25.750
increased dynamic and functional movement.

1548
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:28.420
And I think these,

1549
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.960
these are pretty good and this is all stuff that's pretty common nowadays.

1550
01:40:31.961 --> 01:40:35.630
There's a bunch of different places to get it and make it happen.
Yeah.

1551
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.563
Especially,

1552
01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.510
especially when you kind of start with kind of one thing and you slowly just add

1553
01:40:40.511 --> 01:40:44.890
on.
Yeah.
And essential.
That's kind of a complex question in any way to,

1554
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:47.490
to begin with.
And you did say for you,
right?

1555
01:40:47.491 --> 01:40:50.860
So it depends on what kind of gym you're doing.

1556
01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:53.900
Like what kind of results you want you.
So if you're,

1557
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:58.840
everyone that's listening to this podcast wants to just peak physical

1558
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:01.720
conditioning in a broad array of,

1559
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:05.740
of environments and tasks.

1560
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:10.280
I would assume that as well.
But it's not necessarily a fat.

1561
01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.130
So like I'm just saying if they have different goals but name are going to look

1562
01:41:15.131 --> 01:41:18.370
different.
Name a goal that won't be covered by this.

1563
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:24.250
You can't do it and get their bench up.
Okay.
That's it.
That's one.
If you weren't,

1564
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:27.970
if you want to get your bench up,
you need to bench.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1565
01:41:27.971 --> 01:41:32.020
I think your list is pretty elaborate cause so it's just my opinion because

1566
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:34.450
you're going to break it down cause you're like a minimalist over here.

1567
01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:37.600
And when it comes to working out,
no,
let's hear.

1568
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.780
Most well essential equipment,
right?

1569
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:44.860
I would say the many depends.
So yeah.
Okay.

1570
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.750
It does.
Yes.
It depends on what you,
what results you want.

1571
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.560
So if you just want to be a bodybuilder with big muscles,

1572
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.360
go to listen to different podcasts.
That's not the question.

1573
01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:01.600
The question and the people that are asking these questions are listening to his

1574
01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:04.990
podcasts.
They into physical fitness.
They want to be healthy,

1575
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:07.390
they want to be Jujitsu players,
they want to be fighters.

1576
01:42:07.391 --> 01:42:11.800
They wouldn't be able to functionally move well.
They want to stay healthy.

1577
01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:15.880
They're not just getting their bodybuilder on.
Okay.

1578
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.500
That's still is it assumption though?

1579
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:21.040
But it's correct assumption for the sake of efficiency.

1580
01:42:21.041 --> 01:42:24.310
I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna let you,
I'll tell you what,

1581
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:27.040
make that assumption as well.
One minute to come down.

1582
01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.650
It's not about completing the list.
I was going to elaborate a little bit more,

1583
01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:36.200
but do no,
I think that,
and I actually,
I agree with you.

1584
01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:39.490
You're gonna have any elaboration then just one more thing.

1585
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:43.240
You probably added a bench on there.
Yeah.
Is that what your dad on anything else?

1586
01:42:43.450 --> 01:42:45.820
Yeah.
Anything that would,
that would,
yeah,

1587
01:42:45.821 --> 01:42:49.540
that would facilitate the same thing a bench would facilitate.

1588
01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:55.280
Other than that,
it's pretty a pretty good list I think.
Yeah,
I think that's uh,

1589
01:42:56.050 --> 01:42:59.470
yeah,
that's a big time.
I think that's the deluxe lists though,
man.

1590
01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.960
I think you could cut a few of those losses.
Still get good eats.
It's a,

1591
01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.100
it's an escalation though.
If someone's listening right now and they're like,

1592
01:43:06.101 --> 01:43:07.240
you know what,
I'm going to go get in shape.

1593
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.450
First thing you do is get a set of rings that you can do.

1594
01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:14.860
Pull ups and that's number why I got you.
Then you can get a squat rack,

1595
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:17.680
then you with the squat racks going to come with a pull up bar and a dip bar

1596
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:20.650
somehow.
So you're good there.
Then you,

1597
01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:24.130
then you got to get the bar and bumper plates right,
which you can escalate.

1598
01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:27.880
You can start with,
uh,
you can start with just a bar and you know,

1599
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
to 25 pound bumper plates and then every month by another 45 pounds or a hundred

1600
01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.560
pounds or whatever and you're good after you see those gains you started
jacking.

1601
01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:43.561
The biggest thing about home gyms is if you work out at home,

1602
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:45.430
especially this,
these kinds of workouts,

1603
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:49.510
you get more of a testosterone boost.

1604
01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:52.070
If you work out at edit

1605
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.000
<v 2>public gym,
like at a 24 hour fitness or crossfit gym or something.</v>

1606
01:43:57.650 --> 01:44:00.560
If you work out well,
it basically,
if you work out in front of people,

1607
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:04.430
if there's other people around you,
you get a testosterone booster,

1608
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.430
how still then you would,
it's,
it's this thing where,
I dunno,

1609
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:13.190
it's weird,
it's,
there's some guy did an experiment long time ago where,
um,

1610
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:14.241
I dunno how long ago,

1611
01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:18.200
but he did an experiment where he found out all these little things that you can

1612
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:20.520
do in front of people that will boost your testosterone.

1613
01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:22.520
One was like drive a car,

1614
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:26.060
like a certain kind of car and if you do it in front of people,

1615
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:31.520
it boosts your testosterone.
So if you,
and not only do you get,

1616
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:35.990
get that,
you get,
um,
cycle mental priming as well.
So when you walk in the gym,

1617
01:44:35.991 --> 01:44:38.600
like the crossfit gym,
all the smells,

1618
01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:42.440
the sounds and all that basically primes your mind and your physiology for a

1619
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:45.860
workout.
So don't take it at home.
I mean,

1620
01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:49.390
I'm sure you could do that.
I don't think he would,

1621
01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.460
it would replace the actually being there.
Just that part of it.

1622
01:44:52.461 --> 01:44:53.720
I'm not saying home gyms are junk.

1623
01:44:53.721 --> 01:44:58.160
I'm not saying that at all cause when I walk in my home gym fee you are prying.

1624
01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.440
I feel Brian
and that's part of it as well.
So,

1625
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.660
um,
the whole reason,

1626
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:08.990
the whole reason I set up a home gym was so I don't have to make that drive to

1627
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:11.260
the gym and you know Gil

1628
01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:15.690
<v 3>but that kind of works against interesting that you use that.</v>

1629
01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.670
Like I say,

1630
01:45:17.671 --> 01:45:22.671
Hey I have a home gym so I can just be alone in the giving of the cavern of doom

1631
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.650
and just get after it,

1632
01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:31.170
don't me and I can be alone in my pain world of pain and proving myself and your

1633
01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:34.920
you did it cause you're too lazy to go to the gym.
Yeah.
To make that drive.

1634
01:45:34.921 --> 01:45:37.800
It's just more of a pain.
I can save some time.
Right.

1635
01:45:37.801 --> 01:45:40.060
Which it is an efficiency thing for sure.
Yeah.

1636
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:44.670
<v 2>That efficiency thing can convince them who you are.
Yeah.
It'll backfire.</v>

1637
01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:49.500
Like for example,
I'll be like,
hey,
I don't have to,

1638
01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.640
you feel like you don't have to get the most study your workout because I can

1639
01:45:53.641 --> 01:45:55.620
just come right back here.
You know,

1640
01:45:55.621 --> 01:45:59.820
in an hour when I quote unquote feel better or when I feel more like doing it

1641
01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.220
<v 3>or the TV's right there and lift a,
the</v>

1642
01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:07.450
book big time.
It's a lack of discipline.
It can be.

1643
01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:12.010
And if you're looking for helpers for that discipline,
a home gym file,

1644
01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.150
it could go either way,
man.

1645
01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.440
I personally that I'm able to work out sometimes only because I have a home gym,

1646
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:24.520
you know?
In other words,
if my time is in a day,

1647
01:46:25.210 --> 01:46:28.980
I'll get up super early and if I wouldn't be able to hit my own gym quickly,

1648
01:46:28.981 --> 01:46:31.810
you in 30 minutes and get a workout in,
I wouldn't be able to get,

1649
01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.590
it would take me 30 minutes to just get to gym and back.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1650
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:38.260
Well I recommend if you make a home gym,

1651
01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.850
you do it in a positive way to increase your discipline.
That's what I recommend.

1652
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:48.400
I like how you know your home gym is kind of separate from my house.

1653
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.160
You have to kind of go

1654
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:55.200
<v 2>to it.
Yeah.
So I do get to escape.
Yeah,
I feel like that,
that's a big factor.</v>

1655
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:59.400
Mine is like right outside next to the barbecue next to the little,

1656
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:02.940
you don't know whether you want to,
yeah,
I know about cruising or lifting,

1657
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:04.050
you know,
so

1658
01:47:06.650 --> 01:47:10.650
she doesn't know if he's cruising or lifting.
Next question.

1659
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:18.270
Okay.
Podcast question.
Uh,
how does it feel to do Tim Ferriss podcast,

1660
01:47:18.271 --> 01:47:21.870
Joe Rogan podcast and get thousands of followers,
listen to your podcast,

1661
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:23.910
reading your book,
et Cetera.

1662
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:29.270
Do you worry that some of your fans placed you on a pedestal and engage in hero

1663
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:30.684
worship?

1664
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.311
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1665
01:47:32.311 --> 01:47:35.730
so this is a question that I was actually not going to do cause I was a little

1666
01:47:35.731 --> 01:47:37.830
bit uncomfortable with it and then I was like,
okay,

1667
01:47:37.831 --> 01:47:41.340
why are you uncomfortable with it?
It's not that big of a deal.
It,

1668
01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:42.930
although I will say like,

1669
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.960
it does make me feel uncomfortable to think of people thinking of me in a heroic

1670
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:50.420
way or whatever.
Uh,

1671
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:56.040
that does feel strange to me.
Uh,

1672
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:59.750
as far as being on Rogan and Ferris and,

1673
01:47:59.751 --> 01:48:04.470
and Sam Harris and doing some of these podcasts,
uh,
it's,

1674
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:08.690
you know,
it was,
it was really cool.
It's definitely,
uh,

1675
01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:15.330
you know,
people all the time as I travel and meeting people that have read,

1676
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.460
read our book and,
and have gotten a lot out of it,
you know,
and that,

1677
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:23.190
that feels very rewarding.
You know,
it feels very rewarding.

1678
01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:25.770
It feels great when someone says,
Hey,
you know,
I use this chapter or Hey,

1679
01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:27.480
your book.
I mean people are saying that like,
Hey,

1680
01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:30.930
your book changed my life and I take that with a grain of salt.

1681
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:35.610
But it feels real.
It feels good.
It feels positive,
you know,
it feels,
I like that,

1682
01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.750
you know,
I want to help people and so that feels good.

1683
01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:41.460
But as far as,

1684
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:46.340
it's not like my social media presence,

1685
01:48:46.341 --> 01:48:51.341
which I had zero before and now I have it and it's,

1686
01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.720
it's not really that big of a deal because it's just me.

1687
01:48:59.930 --> 01:49:04.000
Um,
I'm still just me and there's no,

1688
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:05.200
there's nothing

1689
01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.150
that's different or has changed.

1690
01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:13.790
And when we talk about doing this podcast,

1691
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:19.470
we don't talk about how we should act or how I should act to get more people to

1692
01:49:24.071 --> 01:49:24.904
listen to it.

1693
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.300
I'm only doing what I'm doing because this is me and I'm not going to be

1694
01:49:31.451 --> 01:49:35.980
different in order to achieve anything else.

1695
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.890
I'm only going to be who I am.

1696
01:49:39.130 --> 01:49:44.130
And that's why the font of people putting me on a pedestal or whatever,

1697
01:49:45.730 --> 01:49:49.780
that's
it.

1698
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.270
I know that I'm just a person and,

1699
01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:55.840
and I think that it might be how,

1700
01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:57.790
<v 0>okay,</v>

1701
01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:02.410
<v 1>how I get presented,
you know,
by the media,
how I get presented.</v>

1702
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.970
Even on this podcast,
when I'm on this podcast talking to you,

1703
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:12.030
we're talking about specific subjects that we are interested in and it's not,

1704
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.200
you know,
I could see where someone might think,
oh,
you know,

1705
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:18.120
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1706
01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.460
<v 1>Jack was the super,
you know,
super human and,
and no,</v>

1707
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:26.790
I know I'm not.
So if I come across like that,
it's only because you're seeing a,

1708
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:30.900
a sliver of me that appears that way.
Right.
I'm not seeing him.

1709
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:35.750
I know I'm not totally normal as well.
I mean,
I know I'm not a normal person.

1710
01:50:35.751 --> 01:50:39.230
I know him a little bit to the,
to the edge of,
you know,

1711
01:50:39.231 --> 01:50:42.910
being a little bit extreme.
Yeah.
A little bit extreme.
Yes.

1712
01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.710
In some ways.
Yeah.

1713
01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:49.790
And I know a lot of that just has to do with my habits as a person.
Uh,

1714
01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:50.713
but

1715
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

1716
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:51.890
<v 1>The,</v>

1717
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:56.890
the fact of the matter is that no matter what happens and no matter what I come

1718
01:50:59.581 --> 01:51:01.320
across and,

1719
01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:05.190
and no matter what people might perceive me as,

1720
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:08.700
I don't perceive myself as

1721
01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:15.260
special or as a hero for sure because [inaudible] one thing that will not,

1722
01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.700
that will always stay with me is that

1723
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:28.800
I been in combat and I've been humbled by combat.

1724
01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:34.400
And I think that I've been on the battlefield and I've been confused and I've

1725
01:51:35.461 --> 01:51:39.000
been outmaneuvered and I've had my guys killed.

1726
01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:40.973
And so

1727
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:47.890
I know what a real hero is and it ain't me.

1728
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.720
And that's always good to keep me grounded and I will never forget that.

1729
01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:01.740
<v 2>Yeah.
And you,
um,</v>

1730
01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:05.910
as far as being worried about people putting you on a pedestal,

1731
01:52:05.970 --> 01:52:09.320
like how you're saying you just,
you be,
you,
you,

1732
01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:11.130
and that's all you're going to do is be you.

1733
01:52:11.131 --> 01:52:14.110
You're not trying to live up to anyone's expectation.

1734
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:16.950
That was never a goal of yours.
No.

1735
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:21.420
So if someone has an expectation since that's not your goal,

1736
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.470
how can you worry about it?
You're going to continue to be you.
And it was,

1737
01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.600
I think,
I don't know if it's irony,

1738
01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:31.500
but the more you do that and just be just authentic or whatever,

1739
01:52:31.501 --> 01:52:34.590
it seems to draw more people to you

1740
01:52:35.490 --> 01:52:36.510
<v 1>I guess.</v>

1741
01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.770
But I don't know because I'm not acting any other way that I acted a year ago or

1742
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:46.280
you know,
four years ago,
I'm just,
you know what I do,
I train Jujitsu,
I work out,

1743
01:52:46.281 --> 01:52:51.230
I wake up early in the morning,
I try and get smarter.
I uh,

1744
01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.090
<v 0>okay.</v>

1745
01:52:52.090 --> 01:52:56.130
<v 1>Try and do better.
Yeah.
That's what I do.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1746
01:52:57.130 --> 01:52:59.860
so,
so yeah,
I'm just gonna,
you know,

1747
01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:03.760
I'm me and I actually,
I'll tell you,

1748
01:53:03.761 --> 01:53:05.770
this is interesting is that

1749
01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:07.280
<v 0>okay.</v>

1750
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.230
<v 1>People that I interact with now,</v>

1751
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:13.280
I enjoy it and I get something out of it.

1752
01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:17.940
I'm taking away their given me as much inspiration is I'm given them.
Yeah.

1753
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:22.610
You know,
there's one girl on the,
on the,
on Twitter.

1754
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:28.130
And I don't want to say her name cause I,
I mean it's a,
I don't know how,

1755
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:31.640
I don't,
I don't like to disrupt people's privacy.
I mean,
she's on Twitter,

1756
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:35.450
but she's,
uh,
uh,
clearly a little bit of an older lady.

1757
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:37.820
She's um,

1758
01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:38.710
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1759
01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:43.300
<v 1>she's a cancer survivor.
I mean,
when I say older,
I mean she's in her,</v>

1760
01:53:43.810 --> 01:53:45.980
at least in her sixties and,

1761
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:51.310
and she put a picture on the Internet the other day on Twitter of her at the gym

1762
01:53:52.151 --> 01:53:55.950
and she's got,
you know,
like a kettle bell,
um,

1763
01:53:57.070 --> 01:54:02.070
well medicine ball and an oxygen tank in the game cause she's,

1764
01:54:02.650 --> 01:54:05.450
because she's in there working out and she's,
yeah,

1765
01:54:05.451 --> 01:54:08.050
I gotta bring my oxygen tank because of what,
you know,

1766
01:54:08.110 --> 01:54:12.460
I don't know know specifically why,
but amen.

1767
01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.640
If she can bring an oxygen tank to the gym and get after it at age 65 or 70,

1768
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:23.940
you don't,
that's inspiring.
And,

1769
01:54:23.941 --> 01:54:28.900
and I can get up and get after it and do my piece just,

1770
01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:33.940
you know,
just to at least just as well as as she could.
And,

1771
01:54:33.941 --> 01:54:36.580
and so I think that that's,
I think that's what's,

1772
01:54:36.581 --> 01:54:41.581
what's been interesting about this is seeing other people that are fired up and,

1773
01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:43.390
and you know,
that's,

1774
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:47.560
that's another thing that kinda happened early on in this journey for me.

1775
01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:51.820
I have not a bunch of friends,

1776
01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.020
but one of my friends who's a seal,

1777
01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.830
when I was just about,

1778
01:54:59.831 --> 01:55:04.510
I think I had recorded the Tim Ferriss podcast and

1779
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:11.200
I knew it was going to be released and I knew it was going to be heard by,

1780
01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.000
by people
in when,
when I did,
when I got back I,

1781
01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:19.640
I texted my friend and I said,
Hey,
uh,

1782
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:26.560
I did this podcast and it's going to be released and

1783
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.670
<v 0>okay</v>

1784
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:30.200
<v 1>I'm going to be one of them.</v>

1785
01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:35.860
And when I meant by that was one of these guys that sold out for lack of a

1786
01:55:36.111 --> 01:55:38.810
better word.
Right.
And I'm out there,
you know,

1787
01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:40.940
on the navy seal and I'm the biggest,

1788
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:43.980
baddest guy cause there's plenty of those guys out there now I'm going to be one

1789
01:55:43.981 --> 01:55:47.550
of those guys.
And so I said,
I said I'm going to be one of them now.

1790
01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:49.103
Sorry.

1791
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:55.580
And he wrote me back and he said,

1792
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.283
that's awesome.

1793
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:04.370
And we got so many guys running around saying all kinds of stuff you should be

1794
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:09.810
out there representing you should be.

1795
01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:13.800
And he went on to say something even more powerful.
And he said,

1796
01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.493
you know what?

1797
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:21.120
There's a lot of people in this world that deed to role model that needed dad.

1798
01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:23.100
I needed a dad.

1799
01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:26.820
I needed a father figure and that's what you were for me.

1800
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:32.750
And for you to go out there and be out there in the world and be that role model

1801
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:36.660
for other people,
it's awesome and you should do it.

1802
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:40.380
And I love the fact that you're doing it.
And when he wrote that to me,

1803
01:56:40.381 --> 01:56:44.670
it kind of changed my attitude because I did look at the role models that people

1804
01:56:44.671 --> 01:56:48.420
look at in,
I said to myself and,
and again

1805
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:54.000
I think part of what might make me a good role models that I don't think I'm a

1806
01:56:54.001 --> 01:56:57.180
good role model because I'm still trying to get better and I've done all kinds

1807
01:56:57.181 --> 01:56:58.014
of stupid stuff.

1808
01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.200
We need to have a dozen podcasts on the stupid things I've done in my life and,

1809
01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:09.060
and talk about the mistakes I've made growing up and all the just,
I mean,

1810
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.670
I'm,
that's another thing like when you would,

1811
01:57:11.671 --> 01:57:14.340
when people see me on the podcast over,
hear me on the podcast,

1812
01:57:14.341 --> 01:57:18.990
or they read the book,
they're seeing the good part right there,
seeing,

1813
01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:22.770
I would hesitate to say,
but they're seeing the best part of me.

1814
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:25.350
They're seeing them mature person.
I'm not that mature,

1815
01:57:25.351 --> 01:57:26.910
but they're seeing that they're seeing the older,

1816
01:57:26.911 --> 01:57:28.530
the maturest that I've ever been,

1817
01:57:28.531 --> 01:57:32.760
which is right now they're not seeing the idiot,
you know,

1818
01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:37.290
growing dummy that I was in,

1819
01:57:37.291 --> 01:57:39.420
that many of us were when we were younger.

1820
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.730
Now might I have had a little edge,
a little bit of advantage.

1821
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:48.630
Maybe it was just a little bit ahead in some cases,
but man,

1822
01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:50.910
I didn't,
you know,

1823
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:55.050
and so that when I got that tax,

1824
01:57:55.051 --> 01:57:58.950
that was a series of texts from,
uh,
from my brother,

1825
01:57:59.850 --> 01:58:03.630
that really gave me a different attitude on this whole thing.

1826
01:58:03.631 --> 01:58:06.630
And it made me feel more

1827
01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:13.940
comfortable with the fact that I was selling out and that I was now going to be

1828
01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:18.510
out there in the public view.
And,

1829
01:58:19.230 --> 01:58:20.790
and all this being said,

1830
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:26.220
at some point I'm probably going to go right back to the cave that I came from

1831
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:31.020
and um,
um,
I'm,
I don't want,

1832
01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.160
um,
you know,
I don't have what patent had,

1833
01:58:35.161 --> 01:58:39.630
which would just like this huge desire to be famous.
I have no problem not being,

1834
01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:42.130
I was an unrecognizable to the world

1835
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.970
<v 2>for my whole life.
And the fact that I'm a little bit recognizable now,</v>

1836
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.940
it doesn't make me feel great.
It doesn't do anything for me.

1837
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:52.600
I'm just doing what I do.
It's not my goal.
But there,

1838
01:58:52.601 --> 01:58:55.840
is there a goal to try and help some people out there?
Yes.

1839
01:58:55.841 --> 01:58:59.740
And I think hearing that from that buddy of mine made me solidify that goal a

1840
01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:04.450
little bit.
And again,
not to try and say,
hey,

1841
01:59:04.451 --> 01:59:05.950
be like me.
No,

1842
01:59:05.951 --> 01:59:09.490
it's to say learn from what I learned from,

1843
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:11.380
I did some dumb stuff.

1844
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:14.950
I been through some stuff that most people don't have to go through.

1845
01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:18.700
So if you can take something away from it,
awesome.
You know,

1846
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:21.280
don't worship me by any stretch,

1847
01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:25.330
but let's work together and see if we can get better as a team.

1848
01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.290
And you're a good,
like some,

1849
01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.140
a lot of your messages and the things that you say,

1850
01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.670
a lot of it is new and then a lot of it's not new.
Right?
So,

1851
01:59:37.090 --> 01:59:42.090
and so this is one point where in some of this stuff people may have heard

1852
01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:43.300
before,

1853
01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:48.300
but someone like you who's done what you've done and think the way you think and

1854
01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:51.970
do what you do right now,
you're the perfect medium for that,

1855
01:59:51.971 --> 01:59:54.970
for that information to get passed on to someone.
You know,
like,

1856
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.670
you know when you're a teenager or something,

1857
01:59:57.671 --> 01:59:59.860
your dad tells you to do something to your mom telling you,
do you,
you're like,

1858
01:59:59.861 --> 02:00:00.401
how fucked up.

1859
02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:03.340
But then when you go and then you go to your friend's house and then like he

1860
02:00:03.341 --> 02:00:06.010
tells you to do it the exact same thing and you're like,
hey,
yeah.
You know,

1861
02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:09.490
it just,
it takes that same message,
but from someone who you can,

1862
02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:13.780
for lack of a better way of putting it,
someone you can accept it from.

1863
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:18.070
And so all your messages are perfectly in line with who you are.

1864
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:22.120
So there's still like,
you're so eager to accept them,
you know,

1865
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.670
so like how you put online,

1866
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:28.300
you'll post a picture of your watch every morning and you're kind of the workout

1867
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:33.240
setting and stuff like that.
Um,
and you're kind of your message,
um,

1868
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:38.230
more or less is get up every morning and get your work done,
get a workout in,

1869
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:40.810
whatever,
and then you're doing it and there's the proof right there.

1870
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:44.200
So if you're just some dude,
like,
yeah,
work out every day and you don't do it.

1871
02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:46.210
And it was like,
hey,
it's going to be harder,
harder to accept.

1872
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:50.950
So people will get those messages and they'll,
they'll,

1873
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.610
they'll internalize them way more readily from someone like you given the

1874
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:59.200
messages that you're,
you're,
you're,
um,
you're sending,
that's one,
two,

1875
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:04.400
the whole broadcasting yourself thing is,
is totally understandable for,

1876
02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.850
for someone like you in that,

1877
02:01:05.851 --> 02:01:10.851
that it's good that you kinda got your kind of got turned on to the notion that

1878
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:12.100
it's more,

1879
02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:17.970
you have really good messages in good content that w improve people in their

1880
02:01:19.451 --> 02:01:22.810
life,
whether it be older people,
younger people,
girls,
guys,
everything.

1881
02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:27.970
And this is especially like a podcast situation or even like certain online

1882
02:01:27.971 --> 02:01:28.691
profiles and stuff.

1883
02:01:28.691 --> 02:01:31.990
They're good ways to get that information out that people need.

1884
02:01:31.991 --> 02:01:35.500
Men like to improve themselves.
Like A,
if you're in an,
in a,

1885
02:01:35.501 --> 02:01:38.260
in a neighborhood that we're in an environment with a bunch of people improving

1886
02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:40.490
themselves,
that's going to be a good neighborhood.

1887
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:43.700
And if they have the means to improve themselves,

1888
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:47.390
then that's us a good service that you're putting out there.
And,
and,

1889
02:01:47.391 --> 02:01:51.740
and to reach as many people as you do,
you're essentially,

1890
02:01:51.741 --> 02:01:54.260
you're helping the world with your message.

1891
02:01:56.750 --> 02:02:00.980
Okay.
I'm telling you.
See what I'm saying?
Broadcasting yourself is a good thing.

1892
02:02:01.050 --> 02:02:04.650
<v 1>Yeah.
It definitely was a hard thing to,
to</v>

1893
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:09.710
overcome the,
the uh,

1894
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:11.420
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1895
02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:15.890
<v 1>the aversion.
Yeah.
To Broadcasting Yourself,
which is something I,
you know,</v>

1896
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:20.720
I talked about with Tim Ferris and I talked about it with Gi Joe Rogan is this

1897
02:02:20.721 --> 02:02:24.560
idea of people that are talking.
Yeah.
And you know,

1898
02:02:24.561 --> 02:02:29.540
you look at the extreme examples of social media,
you know,
abusers,

1899
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:33.300
abusers and worthlessness.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

1900
02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.520
and you just don't want to have anything to do with them.
And when you're,

1901
02:02:37.610 --> 02:02:38.780
when you're doing it,

1902
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:41.780
regardless of how much you don't want to have anything to do with them,

1903
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:44.360
you have something to do with them because you're doing it too.

1904
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:47.300
And it's very difficult for me not to feel like that.

1905
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:48.920
Now obviously I've gotten over it.
I mean,
I,

1906
02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:52.250
I've gotten over it to a point where I'm saying,
okay,

1907
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:57.400
these are kind of the acceptable parameters that I operate within for my

1908
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:01.130
personality.
Right.
You know,
which is,

1909
02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.350
there's things that I haven't done and I won't do on social media.

1910
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.270
Right.
You know?
Yeah.
Because I'm not there to promote me.
Yeah.

1911
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:12.820
Um,
uh,

1912
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:17.890
but I'm there to only open the door of observation.

1913
02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:23.390
I would say not to,
not to knock on people's door and enter,

1914
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:26.720
but just to open the door of observation and say,

1915
02:03:26.721 --> 02:03:31.721
this is how I try to live and this is the steps that I take to try and live that

1916
02:03:35.871 --> 02:03:38.910
way.
Observe and,

1917
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:42.860
and if you want to enter my house and hang out with me,
come on in.
Yeah.

1918
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:46.610
As long as you're likeminded and,
and you have the same sort of goals,

1919
02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:49.790
then come on in and,
and you know what?
You're going to make me stronger.
Yeah.

1920
02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:52.790
You're going to bolster me up your ice.

1921
02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:57.260
So many people now they're posting pictures of their watches on my Twitter.
Yeah.

1922
02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:57.951
When I wake up,

1923
02:03:57.951 --> 02:04:02.840
I'm looking at 50 to a hundred watches every day and I'm going,

1924
02:04:02.841 --> 02:04:06.470
wow,
that's a lot of people.
And that is unity.

1925
02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:10.790
And that is leadership.
And it does make me feel like,
okay,
cool.

1926
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:13.740
There's other people in the world that are up and getting after it.
Yeah.

1927
02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.050
It Day 20.

1928
02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:20.270
<v 2>Yeah.
And there,
there was a guy who's a teacher posts good.</v>

1929
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:25.490
He's a teacher here,
posted good on his classroom door in his classroom door man.

1930
02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:29.400
And so now he's,
yeah,
I'm kind of pushing that,

1931
02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:34.370
those good messages to the kids,
you know?
Yeah.
So,
yeah,

1932
02:04:34.371 --> 02:04:38.020
I mean it's all,
I think it's all positive social media.
It easy to get

1933
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:43.110
<v 3>to get that attitude towards it because of all the people who will abuse it,</v>

1934
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:46.130
quote unquote.
But you know,
like if you went,
I don't know,

1935
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.010
like on the highway and all you saw was people speeding,
reckless driving,

1936
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:53.580
it still doesn't change the fact that you still want to drive on highway because

1937
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:58.020
you have something to do.
You know,
your,
your,
your pursuit is different.
But yeah,

1938
02:04:58.021 --> 02:04:59.550
there's going to be everyone.

1939
02:04:59.610 --> 02:05:03.270
The other weird thing is I have no idea where this is going,
you know?

1940
02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.260
And so like this podcast,
I didn't,
you know,

1941
02:05:07.261 --> 02:05:10.920
we just kinda did it.
I went on with Tim Ferriss,
so just kind of did it.

1942
02:05:11.190 --> 02:05:15.160
I started Twitter.
I had no idea what that was going to be.
Yeah.

1943
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:16.860
And so it's,

1944
02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:21.960
it's fun for me to be adventuring into things that I don't know the outcome of.

1945
02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:25.650
This is one of them and Twitter is one of them.

1946
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:28.590
The book was one of them and you know,

1947
02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:31.950
I don't know what's around the corner next and I don't know where this is going,

1948
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:37.250
but I will stay with the principles that I believe in

1949
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:43.560
to the best of my ability.
And I think that's what makes it an interesting ride.

1950
02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:49.020
Where's that going?
Go?
Yeah,
we'll find out.
Okay,

1951
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:53.040
last question Jocko.
What motivates you?

1952
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:57.180
I heard you mentioned the man in the cave.
Can you go deeper on this?

1953
02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:59.460
What motivates me?

1954
02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:05.643
<v 0>Well,</v>

1955
02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:11.260
<v 3>I've talked about this before and it's kind of what we were talking about a</v>

1956
02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:13.393
couple of minutes ago as well.

1957
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:18.550
And that is first of all with the man in the cave and this idea and this thought

1958
02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:22.760
of the enemy.

1959
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:29.210
And that was a thought that used to drive me and kind of haunt me and make me

1960
02:06:31.671 --> 02:06:35.900
get up early and work hard to push myself because I knew

1961
02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:42.540
that somewhere out there there was an enemy,

1962
02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:48.850
a real enemy,
a real man,
a person,
a human

1963
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:55.910
that was waiting for me and that was preparing for me and therefore I needed

1964
02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:03.560
to prepare for him.
I needed to be ready.

1965
02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.560
I needed to be the things I always talk about.

1966
02:07:06.561 --> 02:07:09.830
I needed to be stronger and faster and smarter and better

1967
02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:16.240
so that when we did meet on the battlefield,

1968
02:07:19.210 --> 02:07:22.780
I would be ready for that run.

1969
02:07:22.781 --> 02:07:25.510
Dayvoo for that meeting,
that fate,

1970
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:31.820
that battle,
and that thought,

1971
02:07:31.821 --> 02:07:35.830
that thought of the enemy.
It,
yes,
it absolutely

1972
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.720
<v 1>fueled me.
It,</v>

1973
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.680
and when I was a leader in the seal teams,
in charge of men,

1974
02:07:46.290 --> 02:07:47.940
it was even more profound

1975
02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.620
because I was thinking about that rendezvous

1976
02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:58.410
for everybody,
that I led everyone else in charge of everyone that I trained.

1977
02:08:01.170 --> 02:08:05.910
And I felt that burden,
the burden of responsibility

1978
02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:12.200
to prepare those men and protect those bowls.
Men,

1979
02:08:12.201 --> 02:08:17.190
those those frog men was warriors,

1980
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:20.840
my brothers.

1981
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:26.703
And it,

1982
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:32.350
it was my burden to train those guys and prepared them.

1983
02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:42.060
And that burden,
it may have made me a little bit crazy,

1984
02:08:42.061 --> 02:08:45.540
a little bit paranoid,
a little bit over the top,

1985
02:08:50.150 --> 02:08:50.983
<v 0>but</v>

1986
02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:54.090
<v 1>I didn't really know any,</v>

1987
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:57.510
any other way.

1988
02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:08.330
And
so now

1989
02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:12.350
I am no longer

1990
02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:17.100
a combat leader.

1991
02:09:20.070 --> 02:09:23.040
I no longer prepare men for war.

1992
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:31.210
So the drive
and the motivation,

1993
02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.910
it's from a different place.

1994
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:42.470
It's from a solemn place,

1995
02:09:46.090 --> 02:09:49.060
the drive now when the motivation now is

1996
02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:53.860
not really from the enemy anymore,

1997
02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:01.970
now it's from my friends,
my brothers.

1998
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:06.040
It's from

1999
02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:10.990
those seals

2000
02:10:12.630 --> 02:10:13.560
that I knew

2001
02:10:22.130 --> 02:10:23.270
and that I

2002
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:33.070
cared about more than anything.

2003
02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:38.960
And that they sacrificed

2004
02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:43.043
<v 0>everything</v>

2005
02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.190
<v 1>for us and for me and those guys.</v>

2006
02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.250
They gave their lives for us.

2007
02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:06.753
And now

2008
02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.440
I cannot help but think and remember that every breath that we take is a,

2009
02:11:20.770 --> 02:11:21.880
it's a gift.

2010
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:26.620
It's a sacred gift from those men.

2011
02:11:28.690 --> 02:11:32.890
Every day we have every sunrise,
every thought,

2012
02:11:32.891 --> 02:11:36.700
and every smile and every laugh.
It's a gift.

2013
02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:49.020
And I will treasure that gift,

2014
02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:51.310
that gift of life.

2015
02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:58.980
And I will not let it go to waste.
Not One second of it,

2016
02:12:03.330 --> 02:12:08.330
and I will cherish every moment of it and I will live it.

2017
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.930
I will live

2018
02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:13.853
<v 0>it</v>

2019

2020
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.690

2021
02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:39.330
I think that's a,

2022
02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:44.330
that's about it for the night.
