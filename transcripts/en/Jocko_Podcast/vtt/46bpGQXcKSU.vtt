This is Jocko podcast number one 36 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.880
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.463
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.350
<v 0>Who are these?</v>

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.720
<v 0>Why sit they here in twilight,</v>

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.070
wherefore rock,

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.100
they purgatorial shadows drooping tongues from jaws that slob there relish

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.490
bearing teeth that lear like skulls teeth.
Wicked

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.820
stroke on stroke of pain.

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.520
<v 0>but what?</v>

13
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.870
Slow panic gouged these chasms rounds there.

14
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:58.700
Fretted sockets

15
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.360
ever from their hair and threw their hands,
palms,
misery.

16
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:08.230
Swelters

17
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.790
surely we have perished sleeping and walk in Hell,

18
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.610
but who?
These hellish.

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.290
These are men.

20
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.870
<v 0>Whose minds the dead have ravished</v>

22
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.580
memory fingers in their hair of murders.

23
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.970
Multitudinous murders they once witnessed

24
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.270
waiting slews of flesh.

25
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.510
These helpless wander treading blood from lungs that adds loved laughter

26
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.020
always.

27
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.020
They must see these things and hear them batter of guns and shatter a flying

28
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.661
muscles carnage in comparable and humans squander rocks too thick for these

29
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:15.750
men's extrication.

30
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.280
<v 0>Therefore,
still their eyeballs shrink,</v>

32
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:27.710
tormented back into their brains

33
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.210
because on their sense,
sunlight seems a blood smear.

34
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.160
Knight comes blood black.

35
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds a fresh,

36
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.690
thus their heads where this hilarious,

37
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.490
hideous,
awful falseness of sets,
smiling corpses.

38
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.120
Thus

39
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.570
<v 1>their hands are plucking at each other,
picking out rope.</v>

40
00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:05.910
Coutts of their scourging.

41
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.103
Yeah.

42
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 0>Snatching after Ross who smoked them.</v>

43
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.523
<v 1>Brother</v>

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.490
<v 0>Pauling.
US.</v>

45
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.090
<v 0>Who dealt them war
and madness.</v>

47
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.960
And that is a poem.

48
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.300
It's a poem called the mental cases

49
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.500
and it's a poem that was written by Wilfred Owen.

50
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.980
He wrote it in 1918 he was a British poet,

51
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.720
but he was also a British soldier

52
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.090
and he was wounded in the first world war.

53
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:08.790
He was blown up by a trench mortar.

54
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.640
And then he spent several days on unconscious lying with the shredded remains of

55
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:16.260
one of his fellow officers.

56
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.940
And with those wounds he was also diagnosed,
diagnosed with shell shock.

57
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.950
And he was sent to a place called Craig Lockhart Hospital,

58
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.930
which is where they sent these soldiers to be treated.

59
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.750
And there he recovered to some extent.

60
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.560
<v 0>And then he went back to the front
and dawn,</v>

62
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.710
October 1st in 1918 he led a unit from the second Manchester's as they assaulted

63
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.940
enemy positions in John Court

64
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.660
and he was awarded the military cross for that action.

65
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.780
<v 0>And on the 4th of November,
1918</v>

67
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.390
<v 1>okay.</v>

68
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.640
<v 0>Seven days prior,</v>

69
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.170
<v 1>okay.</v>

70
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.810
<v 0>To November 11th which was the end of the war,</v>

71
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.900
Wilfred Owen was killed in action.

72
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.460
He was shot by a German machine gunner.

73
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.893
And that poem,

74
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.170
<v 1>okay,</v>

75
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.170
<v 0>is obviously about the psychological damage that he saw when he was in Craig</v>

76
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.030
Lockhart,
recovering from shell shock.

77
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.870
And I've talked about world war one on this podcast before,

78
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.960
and I've talked about the,
the shell shock.

79
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.060
And if you go to youtube and you Google World War One shell shock and you watch

80
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:06.960
some of the videos,
you can see the horror of the shell shock,

81
00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:09.270
which reflects the horror of the war itself,

82
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.320
the trenches,
the wounds,
the gas,
the deaf,

83
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.560
the madness of the thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths

84
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:25.140
over and over and over again.

85
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.200
And that poem,
mental cases,

86
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.780
it reflects,

87
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.490
<v 1>okay,</v>

88
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.490
<v 0>the nightmare of the shell shock inside the nightmare.</v>

89
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 0>Well this war
and I</v>

91
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.980
wanted to hear a little bit about what shell shock looked like from the outside.

92
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.500
Did I found an article called Shell shock revisited an examination of the case

93
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:07.501
records of the National Hospital in London by Stephanie Lind in an Edgar Jones

94
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.350
and they had some good excerpts coming directly from doctors,

95
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.200
nurses that worked in these wards.

96
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.490
And here's one,

97
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.920
this is a case from the case with 27 year old rifleman known as Frank d,

98
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.420
who is diagnosed with functional tremor and neurosis like Dog Korea.

99
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.510
And if you don't know what that is,

100
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:38.110
it's a disease that gives dogs seizures and tremors and fits.

101
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:42.580
And if you again go to youtube,
you can see these dogs suffering like that.

102
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.790
And this is what the doctors wrote about.
Frank d patient is a territorial,

103
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.330
which has a reservist who serve heavily in world war one.

104
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.320
Patient is a territorial and went out to France in January.

105
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.040
He has been quite well up to a week ago.

106
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.240
Went on April 26 he was buried under a bomb explosion in the trench.

107
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.190
He was not unconscious but dazed and all in a tremble.

108
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.720
All his limbs were shaking.

109
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.860
He was conscious being carried by his comrades out of the trenches to a dug out.

110
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220
A few hours afterwards he had to cry and he was crying for two days.

111
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.550
At the same time,
his arms began to twitch very frequently at first,

112
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.010
<v 1>okay.</v>

113
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.780
<v 0>He was transferred to the 12th General Hospital and from there to here.</v>

114
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.210
Another case,

115
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.230
another entry about a 23 year old Scottish private known as Henry and Henry m

116
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.350
from the 18th to SARS who is diagnosed with functional facial spasm

117
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.310
on May to May 13th and this is 1915 patient was struck by several pieces of

118
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.620
shrapnel on the right hand,
forearm,
shoulder,

119
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.790
and on the right side of the nose at its base.
He was very dazed,

120
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.600
but did not lose consciousness.
The wounds healed in a month.

121
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.060
About a week after being wounded,

122
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.480
he was operated on and ordered that a piece of shrapnel might be removed from

123
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:21.330
his face on recovering from the anesthesia.

124
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.260
He found himself unable to move the right side of his face or open his mouth.

125
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.160
This condition,
which is quite painless,

126
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.660
has persisted since and he's not eating solid food or been able to take out his

127
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.494
false teeth.

128
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.680
He has been fed through a rubber tube inserted between his teeth in all other

129
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:40.920
respects.
He feels well.

130
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.070
Patient sits up in bed gasping in a highly alarming manner with his left face

131
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.220
and a strong tomic spasm and his jaws tightly set.

132
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.370
All efforts to open his mouth are unavailing so strong as the contraction of his

133
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.304
masters.

134
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.800
He declares himself unable to breathe unless sitting up.

135
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.450
And when made the lie down,

136
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.660
his neck is strongly retracted and set and he breathes it violently through his

137
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:10.460
clenched teeth and holds his breath for as long as he can.

138
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.170
Assuming a purple tinge,

139
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.560
which is apt to be disconcerting until one is a costume to it.

140
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.690
<v 0>By the moral aid given by strong</v>

142
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.460
Farrah Deism,

143
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.830
which is an electric current applied by the physician and force applied to the

144
00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:32.030
jaw,
it is,
it was possible to remove a filthy set of false teeth.

145
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.450
<v 0>During this performance he uttered piercing shrieks and foamed and is rigidly</v>

147
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.400
held arms shook violently tears,

148
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:47.870
ran from his eyes and he sweated profusely from his muscular exertion and

149
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:51.530
resisting the attentions.
Well-Intended though they were of the physician

150
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.370
when asked to close his eyes,
he was able to do

151
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.660
in fact the left eye is half closed and spasm.

152
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.900
All test revealed good power and both sides of the face,

153
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.330
the facial and jaw spasm would seem to be voluntary and due to frank malingering

154
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.520
in the intervals of this grotesque performance.

155
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.960
He lives back on the pillow without any dyspnea,

156
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.690
but he induces an apparent difficulty in breathing.
It will

157
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.623
<v 1>okay.</v>

158
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.630
<v 0>Examinations reveal no organic or injury in either nervous or other systems.</v>

159
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.413
<v 1>Okay,</v>

160
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.370
<v 0>so just to
recap</v>

161
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.940
there stating that the facial and jaw spasms would seem to be from voluntary and

162
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.860
from malingering.

163
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.320
Basically saying that he's doing this so that he can avoid the war.

164
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.470
Here's another different type of system.
Symptom of shell shock.

165
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:10.010
This is a 23 year old private named Albert are and it's reported that he had

166
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:14.490
marked twitching of the face and the whole body at times trembles.

167
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.400
He looks ill and regurgitates wind.

168
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.500
He complains of a peculiar feeling of worms growing in the lower part of the

169
00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:26.310
abdomen.
He coughs considerably and said that his stomach swells up.

170
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.190
A lump appears in his throat,
which chokes him

171
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.100
and he is continually expectorating.

172
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.370
<v 0>The knights are particularly hard on him.</v>

174
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.740
He sits up in bed and has great difficulty breathing,
cannot lie down properly,

175
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.790
but lies over to one side,
either left or right,
puts his hand up

176
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.600
<v 1>okay</v>

177
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.940
<v 0>to hold his head still from shaking.</v>

178
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.350
<v 0>He has a depressed and solid look.</v>

180
00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:00.300
There are involuntary movements characterized by a very fine tremor manifested

181
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.790
when his hands are spread out and his fingers are separated.

182
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.650
There's a slight tremor in his legs of the same nature as appears in the other

183
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:09.940
part of the body.

184
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.530
So those are some examples of this,
this horrible,

185
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.160
the affliction of shell shock.

186
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.640
And as you noticed in some of these,

187
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.960
in that one right up in particular,
there was people that were saying,
oh,

188
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:35.750
they're just faking this.
They could overcome this if they would.

189
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.570
<v 1>Okay,</v>

190
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.403
<v 0>be braver.</v>

191
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.530
Some people did recognize that this was a serious issue and that this was a new

192
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:47.531
kind of wound in a new kind of war in November of 1914 so this is pretty early

193
00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:53.060
on.
November,
1914 Lord Knutsford,

194
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.620
chairman of the London Hospital House Committee wrote an appeal that was

195
00:13:57.621 --> 00:14:00.710
published in London newspapers and here's what he wrote.

196
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.160
There are certain number of our gallant soldiers for whom no proper provision is

197
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.620
at present,
obtainable,
but is solely needed.

198
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.700
They are suffering from very severe mental and nervous shock due to exposure,

199
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.890
excessive strain and tension.

200
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.440
They can be cured if only they receive proper attention from the physicians who

201
00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:27.020
have made a specialty of treating such conditions.

202
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.880
These men are quite unsuitable patients for general hospitals as their chance of

203
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:36.590
recovery depends on absolute quiet and on the individual and prolonged attention

204
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.990
of the physician.
If not cured,

205
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.200
these men will drift back to the world as rex and miserable racks for the rest

206
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:47.854
of their lives.

207
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.280
So there were some people

208
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.180
<v 1>that recognize this was a,
uh,</v>

209
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.890
a factor that went well beyond the bravery of the individual.

210
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.480
But unfortunately that was probably less percentage of people.

211
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.480
Most most people thought that these individuals that suffered this affliction of

212
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:16.760
shell shock thought that they were just there.
They were,
they weren't brave.

213
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.850
And you know,
we've,
we've talked about it with a bunch of podcasts.

214
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.740
Dick winters talks about it.
Hackworth talks about it,

215
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.830
that there's a cop that gets filled and if it gets filled too much,

216
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:31.730
people can't take any more.

217
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.850
And it's not because they're not good people stop because they,

218
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.340
they aren't brave were they weren't brave.
It's,
it's they,
they're done,

219
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.870
they're done.
And there's ways you can treat them.
We've talked about it before.

220
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.080
You see a guy that's looks like he's going to be done.
You need to get him rest.

221
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:46.700
And if they get rest,
they can recover.

222
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.370
If they don't get rest and they just get continually put into it,

223
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.140
you're going to burn that engine out,
you're going to burn out their brain.
Well,

224
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.520
<v 0>they didn't quite understand that yet.
And again,</v>

225
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:05.450
this type of warfare was totally knew there wasn't this kind of just continual

226
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.720
slaughter

227
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.583
<v 1>ever before.</v>

228
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.780
<v 0>And if it was,
it was like an incident.
Oh,</v>

229
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:13.680
there was a huge battle and there was a bunch of people killed.

230
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.740
It wasn't like we're going to go do that again tomorrow.
Well guess what?

231
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:19.310
These guys are going to go ahead and go and do that same thing tomorrow and the

232
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.230
next day and the next day and the day after that.

233
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.263
So

234
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.110
I want to talk about something that is

235
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.340
as horrible as World War One was.

236
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:39.110
This might be the most horrible part of World War One.

237
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.720
And I know that's a bold statement,

238
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.340
but I want to start by telling you the story of one individual soldier.

239
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.860
His name was Harry far

240
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.043
<v 1>and</v>

241
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.610
<v 0>I'm going to go to a book about his life.
The book is called the,</v>

242
00:16:57.611 --> 00:16:58.780
he was no coward.

243
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.750
It was written by Janet Booth and James White.

244
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.270
And it tells the story of Harry far the Harry far story.

245
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Now it starts off by giving a little background on Harry far and he grew up

246
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:22.350
young man and it kind of starts off with him meeting who he would eventually

247
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:26.440
marry a woman by the name of Gertrude and we'll go to the book.

248
00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:28.900
Gertrude and Harry started a walking out together.

249
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.530
They both loved visiting the gaity theater and many a happy evening was spent at

250
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:38.000
the Hammersmith Empire.

251
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:42.080
Watching the variety show is the Paris soon became girlfriend and boyfriend and

252
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:44.300
for the next four years they became inseparable,

253
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.250
but not without some bumps in the roads at the age of 20 Harry was four years

254
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.010
Gertrude's senior,
something her family was not happy about.

255
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.080
But what did she say?
She said,
I love him,
I'm going with him.
And that's that.

256
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.300
So they're young,
they're in love.

257
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.660
And Harry was earning good money working as a scaffolder on the building sites

258
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:14.100
across London.
And it came as quite a shock in April,

259
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.650
1913 when Gertrude realized she was pregnant,

260
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.880
a child born out of wedlock would bring shame and disgrace on the immediate

261
00:18:21.881 --> 00:18:24.550
family owing to the pending arrival of the baby.

262
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:27.880
They had to bring their wedding forward and were married as soon as possible.

263
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.830
By the time of the wedding,

264
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.630
they had been together for three years and they were married in Kensington

265
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:39.630
Registry office in the summer of 1913 a baby who was to be their only child was

266
00:18:40.991 --> 00:18:44.770
born on October 29th of that year.
They named her Gertrude Nelly,

267
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.640
her middle named after Harry Sisterhood emigrated to America.

268
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.200
But the new baby would be known affectionately as little dirty.

269
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.010
Now
prior to meeting,
uh,

270
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.020
dirty Harry had,
well,
I'll go to the book.

271
00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:09.100
Harry had chosen adventures path that in 1908,
so this is previous.

272
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.980
When he had just turned 18 he had decided to join the army.

273
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.740
He enlisted as a regular soldier in the first battalion of the West Yorkshire

274
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.890
regimen known as the Prince of Wales.
Home.

275
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.160
Little is known of his two years as a regular soldier,

276
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.530
but later records records show he was considered to be a reliable and

277
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:36.000
trustworthy soldier with an exemplary record of good behavior.

278
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.290
Now this happens in America as well when you're on active duty,

279
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.680
which is what he was those first two years.
When you get done with active duty,

280
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:46.950
they put you on some sort of reserve status.
There's,

281
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:51.951
I think it's called IRR and maybe it stands for immediate regular reserve.

282
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:53.700
I don't really remember.

283
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:56.640
I was on it for some amount of time but I don't remember and it's basically when

284
00:19:56.641 --> 00:20:00.270
you're out,
but they can recall you and then you can say active reserve,

285
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:01.890
which is when you're still getting paid.

286
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:03.600
Maybe you should do some drills and what not.

287
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:05.460
It sounds like he was in a combinate when he got out.

288
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:07.830
He was in a combination of those two will go to the book.

289
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.630
Most soldiers who had left the army were automatically placed in the section be

290
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.200
reserved.

291
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.620
It meant that for five years they could be called upon in the event of general

292
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:20.940
mobilization and were paid three shillings and six pence per week as a retainer

293
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.120
while also being obliged to undertake periodic training.

294
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.860
So that's sorta like the reserves.
I had to throw this in there.

295
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:31.890
And a pamphlet entitled a Short History of the West Yorkshire Regiment,

296
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:37.370
the excitable introduction to the unit nicknamed the old and bold claims.

297
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:42.420
No regimen in the British army has a more glorious history than the West

298
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.250
Yorkshire Regiment.
The Prince of Wales Zone.

299
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

300
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.070
<v 0>for its record and gallon and</v>

301
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.780
<v 1>devoted service to king and country in many parts of the empire is equaled by</v>

302
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:55.530
few and surpassed by none.

303
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.490
So proud history
and

304
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.930
can probably figure out where this is going.
The war kicks off.

305
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.170
World War One kicks off and he gets recalled to go and serve back to the book.

306
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:13.480
He had previously served with the regimens first battalion,

307
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.750
but its soldiers were already in France when he returned to duty.

308
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:20.020
So he joined the second battalion before his passions to France.

309
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.790
Harry was granted a weekend passed,

310
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.110
allowing him to return to London and spend a precious last few days with his

311
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:28.960
wife and young child dirties.

312
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.820
First Birthday was celebrated that weekend and Gertrude promise to write her

313
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:38.821
husband frequently as well as sending him food and clothing parcels after what

314
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:40.840
must have been an extremely difficult for a well.

315
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.840
Harry returned to camp having slightly overstate as pass,

316
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.260
subsequently being forced to forfeit four days pay

317
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.143
like Harry,

318
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.410
the majority of his fellow comrades had never boarded a boat before,

319
00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.440
let alone left England shores despite reasonably smooth crossing to France,

320
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.770
many of the men suffer from seasickness.
Those not being sick.

321
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.950
We're in good cheer and eager to face the enemy in battle.

322
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.100
The general consensus of the men being that by Christmas this bloody war will be

323
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:19.630
over
so that doesn't,
it turns around pretty quick.
Even in the book.

324
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:23.530
That part turns around quick,
pretty quick and obviously I skip some sections,

325
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:25.330
but we get right into it.

326
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.220
On November 13th at 11:00 PM the West Yorkshire is to relieve the Devin regimen.

327
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.271
The very next day,

328
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:33.940
the soldiers came under fire for the first time and suffered their first

329
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:37.580
casualties with three men wounded.
Okay?

330
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.830
<v 0>Indeed.
One account of the battalions.
First taste of trench warfare.</v>

331
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.850
Describe the soldiers great discomfort in heavy mud

332
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.700
at times.
During this period,

333
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:52.070
the trenches occupied by the West Yorkshire Regiment.

334
00:22:52.071 --> 00:22:57.071
Soldiers were two to six feet deep in water and cold mud baths were common,

335
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.590
so also was the inevitable accompaniment of sickness.

336
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.450
On November 19th for the battalion lost its first man to sniper fire with

337
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:08.680
another six wounded.

338
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.420
Even when the men were resting in the barns and houses allocated behind to to

339
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:16.810
them behind the lines,
there was no response from the shelling

340
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:25.170
acting sergeant Walter Western record the difficulty of fighting in the rapidly

341
00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:26.460
deteriorating conditions.

342
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:30.660
He wrote the continual rain where the whole terrain had turned into a quagmire

343
00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:33.540
of liquid mud,
making it difficult for the transport,

344
00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:37.560
carrying supplies and weapons to continue along the muddy roads.

345
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:41.520
Every so often they had to stop and push the vehicles over.
The cloying mud,

346
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.460
even more harrowing was to try to pull comrades out of the mud.

347
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.660
Many perished by slipping off the duck boards and disappearing into the slime.

348
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.170
The day spent in wet and muddy trenches,

349
00:23:55.171 --> 00:24:00.171
left some soldiers incapacitated by trends foot and invariably resulted in many

350
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:06.870
of the men having a foot or both feet amputated.

351
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.360
Pitiful sight of the horses and mules stuck in the rain.

352
00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:14.690
Sodden soil struggling to free themselves from the mud.

353
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.320
So yeah,
we think about trench foot and you know,
think,

354
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.930
oh your feet are uncomfortable or whatever.

355
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.590
You don't think about having one or both of your feet amputated.

356
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.673
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

357
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.050
<v 0>December 18th the West Yorkshire regiments kernel and captains were told that</v>

358
00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:34.410
the second battalion Devin regimen would be attacking the German trench and two

359
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:39.090
companies of Yorkshire men would be sent in support to dig and make good any

360
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.800
captured trenches.
The official battalion diary records,

361
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:48.660
the Devin attack commence from the left and was late and starting the right

362
00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:51.720
company,
never advanced,
thus creating a block in the trenches.

363
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.800
The left companies attack was unsuccessful owing to the wire arrangements,

364
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.941
but the left center,

365
00:24:56.941 --> 00:25:01.941
a company occupied 150 yards of the main German trench.

366
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.940
I've midnight the entire second battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment was

367
00:25:05.941 --> 00:25:09.840
ordered to take over the captured trench and improve it for defense while their

368
00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:12.120
comrades dug in alongside.
However,

369
00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:16.680
at 8:00 AM the Germans responded with hand grenades thrown in great quantities

370
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:21.150
and very rapidly forcing the men occupying the trench to retreat to the British

371
00:25:21.151 --> 00:25:25.570
front line.
As a consequence of the sudden action,

372
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.870
the company of West Yorkshire soldiers attempting to dig on the right were left

373
00:25:31.061 --> 00:25:35.020
exposed and suffered withering on filleted fire.

374
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.150
They also retreated an end.

375
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.040
The attack ended in failure and the battalion suffered.
Two officers killed,

376
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.240
two wounded and 120 other ranks,
killed or wounded,

377
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.630
almost all sustained in the retreat

378
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.860
the new year.
And again,
um,
um,

379
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:05.510
advancing through the book and to get the full details,
get the book and read it.

380
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.990
The New Year of 1915 began as the old one finished for the Yorkshire Man,
cold,

381
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.020
wet,
and in the trenches.
January six,

382
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:17.810
one man was killed and a lieutenant was taken to the hospital

383
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.360
despite the hostile nature of the enemy,

384
00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:22.710
just a few hundred yards in front of them.

385
00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:26.820
The battalion nine diary noted that the main cause of casualties was

386
00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:29.190
increasingly a result of sickness

387
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.810
as well as the of the ever present water and mud disease and sickness was

388
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:45.600
carried by living sources from the lice that infested every bit of clothing to

389
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:48.120
the rats that feasted on the unbury dead.

390
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.220
Paul Fussell writes,
the stench of rotten flesh was over.

391
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:58.221
Everything hardly replaced by hardly repressed by the chloride of lime sprinkled

392
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:01.890
on particularly offensive sites,

393
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.190
dead horses and dead men and parts of both where sometimes not buried for months

394
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.570
and often simply became an element of parapets and trench walls.

395
00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.090
You could smell the line miles before you could see it.

396
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.300
So if you've ever smelled a dead body before,
it's,
it's an absolutely horrible,

397
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.090
horrible,
horrible smell.

398
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:32.500
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

399
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.500
<v 0>and when you think about the places where you're living are actually partially</v>

400
00:27:38.471 --> 00:27:42.010
built from bodies and parts of bodies,

401
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.920
it's hard to even imagine what the stench was and how bad it was.

402
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.053
Back to the book.

403
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.900
One man was killed and another wounded on January 12th on January 19th the

404
00:27:57.901 --> 00:28:01.380
trenches,
it dried out slightly and four men were injured in action.

405
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.790
On January 25th rifle,
fire was recorded as being heavier than usual,

406
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.620
but ultimately the expected attack never came though three men were killed in

407
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:11.520
the course of the day.

408
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.710
The following day was off to the billets in La Flint Gay.

409
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.430
This time in the brigade reserve,

410
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.850
two men were killed in one wounded,
but a draft of 50 men arrived.

411
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.433
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.310
<v 0>On the last day of the month,
snow fell with water building in the trenches,</v>

413
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.450
but the enemy was quiet.

414
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:41.100
The whole month of January had been spent either in the trenches or in the

415
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:45.780
nearby reserve with no time spent any distance away from the guns.

416
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.540
<v 0>On February 4th the battalion relieved second battalion,</v>

418
00:28:52.541 --> 00:28:54.520
four men were killed and five are wounded.

419
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.050
On February 10th the battalion was back in the line losing one man and two

420
00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:00.670
wounded on February 11th

421
00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.780
<v 1>okay.</v>

422
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.680
<v 0>March 6th five men were injured some severely.
When they hit,</v>

423
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.180
they were hit by shrapnel in the morning.

424
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:11.370
Two of the five died of their wounds later that day.

425
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:20.190
It's weird you think about this.
It's just pecking away.

426
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.480
It's just pecking away day after day after day after day.

427
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.940
Yeah,
you got,
you got 250 guys or something in your company,

428
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.960
maybe 200 guys in your company and it's too here.
It's three there.

429
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.080
It's eight wounded there.
It's full wounded there and then you get,

430
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.750
you get drafts come in,
which is new,

431
00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:45.250
fresh 50 of them coming in to replace the guys that you've lost.

432
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.790
Officers were issued with a full set of orders on March 9th for the attack on

433
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:55.870
new VA Chapelle

434
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.350
March 10th at 7:30 AM the bombardment of enemy positions began with wire
cutting,

435
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:05.200
shrapnel to aid any breakthroughs by the infantry.

436
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.410
The first shell to fall was fired by an impressive 15 inch howitzer and wait and

437
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.290
incredible 1400 pounds.

438
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.860
However,
their advance was blocked.

439
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.610
The battalion then withdrew back to British trenches and held the line.

440
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.680
Casualties had been severe as they had crossed,
as they had across the front.

441
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.230
On the murderous first day of the battle,
23 members of the battalion were dead.

442
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.950
51 men had been wounded.
Three we're missing,

443
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.100
but the savage fighting was to continue.

444
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.910
At 4:00 AM the next day orders received to move.

445
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.510
17 members of the regiment were killed outright.

446
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.510
40 men and one officer were wounded.
Format,

447
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:54.100
we're missing shelling continued inflicting heavy casualties on the severely

448
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:59.101
depleted West Yorkshire men as they huddled in the trenches in cold and misty

449
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.160
conditions.

450
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.430
<v 0>By this stage of the attack,
the infantry soldiers were exhausted.</v>

452
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.750
Dead on their feet,
would have been an accurate description.

453
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.530
The condition of the gallon fellows who had been fighting and marching to and

454
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:21.430
from the trenches since the early hours of the 10th with practically no respites

455
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.380
was now pitiable.

456
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

457
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:30.090
<v 0>Men fell asleep at every Holt having to be roused by violent means</v>

458
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.660
among the ranks.
14 men were killed.

459
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.300
31 wounded six when is missing?

460
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:40.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

461
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.640
<v 0>At 7:00 PM the soldiers moved off the unoccupied a line of trenches.</v>

462
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.920
Grimly the battalion diarists noted.
We found this trench unoccupied.

463
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

464
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.920
<v 0>And full of dead.</v>

465
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

466
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.830
<v 0>The deaths and injuries continued forward.</v>

467
00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:02.880
Killed 28 wounded three went missing during the day.
November 5th

468
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.380
General Haig who was to become the commander in chief of the British

469
00:32:07.381 --> 00:32:10.830
expeditionary force the following year wrote in his diary

470
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.320
that why my one fought was how soon I could get my battle worn troops relieved

471
00:32:19.831 --> 00:32:23.580
and give it a few days rest out of the trenches and shell fire.

472
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

473
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.230
<v 0>On July 30th,</v>

474
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:34.520
1915 he was even more explicit saying one lesson of this war was that troops

475
00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:39.230
could stand up for days,
hard fighting and then must be relieved.

476
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.270
So you take that right there,
you take four days,

477
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.670
but that that's an average from this guy that's seen these folks on the front

478
00:32:47.671 --> 00:32:49.220
line does.
That means there's people that are less than that.

479
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:51.770
There's some people that are more,
some people can handle eight days,
10 days.

480
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.740
Some people can handle one day,
but some people can't handle any.

481
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.980
The average is four days and here are these guys on the line for 10 20 1317 days

482
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.100
at a time and there is times that I'm not mentioning where there they're going

483
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:06.770
back off the front line and they're getting a little bit of recovery,

484
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.850
but then they're going right back in and it's not four days if they're going

485
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:13.280
into before they're going in for eight days for 12 days.

486
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.170
Back to the book,
there was a little action with two men killed in one wounded.

487
00:33:20.171 --> 00:33:24.150
The battalion was relieved by the Second Battalion Lincoln Regiment and marched

488
00:33:24.151 --> 00:33:26.560
to bill.
It's just a mile away from the battleground.

489
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.430
The second battalion had lost more than a quarter of its strength.

490
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.530
Marching teeth dawned cold and wet and despite the battalion diarists noting

491
00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:43.800
that it was quiet.

492
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.810
<v 1>Okay,</v>

493
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:46.710
<v 0>three men were killed.</v>

494
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.040
Quiet day three men were killed.

495
00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.930
April 6th the shell exploded in a company,

496
00:33:55.931 --> 00:33:58.150
bill it killing three and injuring eight

497
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.290
5:00 AM on May 9th the artillery bombardment of the enemy trenches began with

498
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:08.120
the attack launched just 40 minutes later.

499
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:13.121
So here we are on another attack on another attack during the shelling and small

500
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:17.690
arms fire from the Germans.
There were three were killed,

501
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.260
13 were wounded and three posted is missing.

502
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:30.270
And this results in the French attack on vme ridge failed after a week costing

503
00:34:30.311 --> 00:34:32.950
the French a hundred thousand casualties.

504
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.730
<v 0>The British attack on Aubers Ridge,
which is what they were working on,</v>

506
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.930
failed ignominiously.
So that's the life,

507
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:49.360
if you can call it that.

508
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.460
And here's where we start to hear a little bit about Harry.
By this time,

509
00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.840
Harry had been withdrawn from the front line suffering from what was becoming

510
00:34:58.841 --> 00:35:02.950
known as shell shock.
He was taken off duty on May 9th

511
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.660
however,
rather than being viewed as a psychological condition,

512
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.530
some doctors and researchers were viewing the symptoms more in line with a

513
00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:16.531
neurological disorder or the result of a concussion from shell blast treatment

514
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.000
for the condition.

515
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.210
Largely involved rest away from the front line and possibly some talking

516
00:35:22.211 --> 00:35:25.330
therapies that we would now refer to as counseling.

517
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.040
Some doctors utilize the electric shock therapy in isolation therapy on

518
00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:33.460
softwares,
but both were unproven and experimental.

519
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.060
<v 0>And there's a Dr. Stevenson that says post stress disorder,
this is looking back,</v>

521
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.710
post traumatic stress disorder was exacerbated by the special conditions of

522
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:48.420
static warfare in which soldiers endured repeated bombardments in confined

523
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.510
spaces with little control over their fate

524
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.940
and live day by day in close proximity to their comrades.

525
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.270
Decomposing remains.
So I've talked about this before.

526
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:02.370
We talked about it when Jordan was on with Jordan Peterson.

527
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.310
When you don't have any control,
when you're not on offense it,

528
00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.870
it's a lot harder to deal with psychologically and this is the ultimate

529
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:10.620
defensive.

530
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.350
You're just going to get bombed and there's nothing you can do about it.

531
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.020
And by the way,

532
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.430
you're going to watch your friends and your comrades get wounded and killed

533
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.810
every single day.
Back to the book,

534
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.710
in the summer of 1915 Gertrude received a letter from France,

535
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.890
but she did not recognize the handwriting on the envelope as Harris.

536
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.850
So his wife gets a letter,
she has recognize the handwriting.

537
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.300
The letter stated that Harry was ill and in the hospital he had been evacuated

538
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.870
from the hoop lanes area in May as he had been suffering from what was known as

539
00:36:50.971 --> 00:36:54.900
shell shock stricken by nervous exhaustion.

540
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.210
His hands had been shaking too much to hold a pencil,

541
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.710
so a nurse at the hospital had written the letter for him.

542
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.603
Again,

543
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.450
uncontrollable shaking is what these guys are experiencing so bad he can't write

544
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:18.740
his letter.
A letter to his wife after the extended period behind the lines,

545
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.550
Harry was assessed and certified fit.

546
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.660
He was sent back to the West Yorkshire Regimen this time joining the first

547
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:31.661
battalion part of the 18th Infantry Brigade sixth division in October of 1915

548
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.500
October 21st 89 men including Harry,

549
00:37:36.501 --> 00:37:39.830
joined the battalion while it was camped behind the line.

550
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.040
Shortly after the Germans launched a huge barrage against allied rest areas

551
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:50.950
along all the front end retaliate in retaliation for royal artillery shelling of

552
00:37:51.411 --> 00:37:55.770
their own billets.
Although little damage was done,

553
00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.950
the sound of the guns which had caused Harry to fall ill before had begun all

554
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:04.650
over again for him.

555
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:06.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

556
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.730
<v 0>At the end of the month of Italian,</v>

557
00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:12.290
began an 11 day spell in the trenches characterized by heavy rain collapsing

558
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:13.790
fortifications and mud.

559
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:18.320
By November 3rd and officer had been killed and almost all dug outs had

560
00:38:18.321 --> 00:38:21.740
collapsed,
leaving men with little respect from the appalling weather

561
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:31.080
on December 5th the battalion march to Everling spending the next 10 days

562
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.680
forming working parties to carry out tasks such as repairing paths despite not

563
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:36.790
being in the line.

564
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.750
Casualties were sustained when the parties were shelled and fired upon.

565
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:44.410
By rifleman.
Though even when you go back to the rear,

566
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.630
you're still getting shot and killed.

567
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:51.430
December 19th when the area came under antillary bombardment and that

568
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:55.510
frightening phenomenon of battle,
the use of gas,

569
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.720
the action began at 5:30 AM when the British held trenches came under heavy

570
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:04.840
rifle fire than at 6:45 AM when troops were stood.

571
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.630
Two in anticipation for an attack.

572
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.930
Shell's containing gas were fired by the Germans.

573
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.700
The effect,
the gas was instantaneous and horrifying during the day.

574
00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:21.570
11 men died in 23 were wounded to suffering the effects of gas.

575
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:27.050
Total allied losses on the day as a direct result of gas were 1069 casualties

576
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.020
and 69 deaths.

577
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.730
The battalion was back in the trenches for the end of the year and the start of

578
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:38.440
the new one on December 30th

579
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:39.810
<v 1>okay.</v>

580
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.360
<v 0>The battalion headquarters were shelled suffering.</v>

581
00:39:42.361 --> 00:39:44.100
Two men killed and four injured.

582
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.500
On February 14th German artillery shells fell again in the battalion killing

583
00:39:49.501 --> 00:39:53.640
five and injuring 15 by the time the first battalion left the trenches the next

584
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.140
evening,
it had suffered the losses of nine killed and 51 injured.

585
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.080
It underscores the losses suffered by the British army during the first World

586
00:40:04.081 --> 00:40:09.081
War when 7,000 soldiers were killed and wounded every day.

587
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.880
As a matter of course.

588
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.790
<v 1>Okay,</v>

589
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.200
<v 0>7,000 a day.</v>

590
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.850
March 17th as they marched the four miles to begin a period of rest,

591
00:40:25.851 --> 00:40:28.880
that was the last a month two men were killed and three men were wounded.

592
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.880
How the soldiers were afflicted as not recorded.

593
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.340
It's first spell back in the trenches of that.
Go get some rest.

594
00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:40.580
Now it's coming back at a first bell back in the trenches after a month away

595
00:40:40.581 --> 00:40:45.360
from the line.
Five were wounded in five killed
during April.

596
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.020
Harry reported sick with nerves and was treated at addressing station for two

597
00:40:49.021 --> 00:40:51.030
weeks before returning to frontline duty.

598
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.690
His problems were worsening,
yet the fact

599
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:03.620
he was not sent far behind the lines suggest medical officers did not deem him

600
00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.190
sick enough to be evacuated.

601
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.323
June 3rd

602
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.500
nother operation losses during the operation.

603
00:41:13.501 --> 00:41:17.100
We're heavy with one officer in five sergeants killed as well as five other

604
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:21.730
ranks.
Two Sergeants in 24 other ranks were wounded,

605
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:24.550
a total casualty rate of about 17%

606
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.680
on July 1st less than a hundred miles south of position.

607
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:38.450
Following a week in which 1.6 million shells were fired.

608
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:43.580
British forces attacked on Mass on a 15 mile long front.

609
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:48.700
The slaughter that ensued on the first day of the battle of the Somme was

610
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:53.360
prodigious
with almost 60,000 British casualties.

611
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.530
A third of them dead

612
00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.920
news of the slaughter took days to filter back to Britain and thanks to heavy

613
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:04.700
censorship of the press,
the horrors of the battle.
We're not truly expressed,

614
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.360
but the casualty lists gave no lie to the situation.

615
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.203
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:17.890
<v 0>On July 15th the West Yorkshire's left camp and moved by train to eat braze</v>

617
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.440
where they relieve the 11th battalion.

618
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.680
Harry again reported sick with nerves on July 22nd and was detained by Medical

619
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.120
Corp soldiers for the day.

620
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:32.060
But this time he was returned as fit for duty the next day.

621
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.220
So this guy's fallen apart.

622
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.220
He keeps asking for help and they keep sending him back to the front.

623
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.520
And mind you,
he's an estate.
I mean,
not all the time,

624
00:42:41.521 --> 00:42:45.030
but he's at least reaching a state where he can't even write a letter to his

625
00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:47.490
wife,
can't even steady as hand for that,

626
00:42:47.491 --> 00:42:49.500
and they're putting him back to the front.
Over and over again.

627
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.580
On August 6th camp was broken and the battalion march the battalion have joined

628
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:54.600
the battle of the Somme,

629
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.270
infamous for the unprecedented British losses and intensity of the shelling

630
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:00.104
operation.

631
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.880
The next four days were spent in the brigade reserve as before with hundreds of

632
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:07.640
men sent digging and caring duties.

633
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.200
This work proved more hazardous than the previous week with four killed,

634
00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:15.290
nine wounded,
one man missing believed to have blown up.

635
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:22.370
On September 11th the battalion proceeded with brigade to an area known as sand

636
00:43:22.381 --> 00:43:26.610
pits.
The following day was spent with the brigade in reserve.
In

637
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.600
six men were killed and four more wounded Amman.

638
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.050
Amid a general British offensive across the sector involving the use of the

639
00:43:35.051 --> 00:43:36.460
latest weapon tanks.

640
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.930
On September 18th the battalion joined other forces of six division in attacking

641
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.490
opposing trenches.
At 5:50 AM whistle sounded along the line,

642
00:43:45.491 --> 00:43:50.020
his soldiers poured up over the front trenches through previously cut barbed

643
00:43:50.021 --> 00:43:52.690
wire and petite and between breast works.

644
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.720
Companies were met with very heavy machine gun and rifle fire and more.

645
00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:02.980
First forced to retreat back from the trenches where the attack started from.

646
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:04.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

647
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.620
<v 0>The cost was shockingly high with more than a hundred casualties across the</v>

648
00:44:08.621 --> 00:44:13.480
battalion and attrition rate of more than 10% among the 13 dead were three

649
00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:17.590
officers,
almost a hundred officers,
almost a hundred soldiers were wounded,

650
00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.120
including four officers.

651
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:26.580
Later on September 19th the exhausted soldiers made their way to bill.

652
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:30.120
It's eight miles away where they remained overnight and the following day

653
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.020
the attack was considered a success,

654
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:39.230
but private far had not taken part in the operation is final nervous collapse

655
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:44.451
took place on September 17th Harry had fallen out sick on September 16th yet

656
00:44:45.641 --> 00:44:48.640
when he made his way to addressing station the following day,

657
00:44:48.641 --> 00:44:50.650
he was not seeing because he was not wounded.

658
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.870
On September 17th he was ordered to the front in the company of a rations party,

659
00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:00.970
but was founded 11:00 PM that night at the same place behind the lines having

660
00:45:00.971 --> 00:45:02.110
disobeyed the order

661
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.950
when he was subsequently sent to the front under escort,

662
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:12.310
he struggled with his guards and was released after refusing to see a medical

663
00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:14.540
officer further to forward here,

664
00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:17.960
we ran back towards the transport lines and the rear end was held under guard

665
00:45:17.961 --> 00:45:22.160
before being placed under arrest on September 18th and charged with cowardice.

666
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.010
The timing of his collapse ahead of the impending attack may have helped along

667
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:30.330
the decision to charge him.

668
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.250
The Battle of the Somme resulted in the greatest loss of life in military

669
00:45:37.251 --> 00:45:40.160
history at the time for negligible gains

670
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.830
across the whole offensive.
During that awful summer and autumn,

671
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:50.860
between July 1st and November 19th British army suffered 420,000 casualties.

672
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.280
The French 195,000 and the German losses stood between 500 and 650,000

673
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.693
<v 1>okay.</v>

674
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.880
<v 0>So the massive fighting that was going on at the battle of Somme is also</v>

675
00:46:07.881 --> 00:46:11.630
reflected in the fact that they're being super hostile towards him.

676
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.670
October 2nd,

677
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:23.670
1916 private Harry far stood trial by field general court martial,

678
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.900
which was convened

679
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.540
at Hill Serrano in France.

680
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.910
Since his nervous collapse and arrest his battalion had again been an action

681
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:42.090
following their part in the success in the capture of the quadrilateral.

682
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:48.940
This time they'd helped attack and take the village of live buffs.

683
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.830
On September 25th part of the wider battle of more vol,

684
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:58.570
it was against this backdrop of missing two significant actions that Harry was

685
00:46:58.571 --> 00:46:59.404
tried

686
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:06.190
a field general court martial was a wartime disciplinary tribunal with the power

687
00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:10.460
to try all military offenses.
So obviously,
you know,

688
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.560
these guys are are,

689
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.730
they're not looking to hear about your excuses of why you can't get after it

690
00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:19.940
with the rest of the troops and the rest of the troops are going forward.

691
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.560
The rest of the,
I mean,

692
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.100
the rest of the troops are going forward and they're fighting and they're

693
00:47:25.101 --> 00:47:27.380
fighting hard and they're making incredible sacrifices.

694
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:32.440
Something that he wasn't physically able to do at this point.
He was,
he lost it.

695
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.670
He had seen too much.
He had done too much and he was done.

696
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.180
So they're sending him to court.

697
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:48.181
Marshal Harry was charged with an offense contrary to section four seven of the

698
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:56.641
army act of 1881 the exact charge wasn't misbehaving before the enemy in such a

699
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:02.560
manner as to show cowardice,
to which he pleaded not guilty.

700
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:09.160
He Harry appeared without a prisoner's friend.
So there was,
there wasn't no,

701
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:14.140
there was no like lawyer to defend him.
It was just him,
just him

702
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.020
assessing the overall situation.
Captain Whitlow said,

703
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:23.560
I cannot say what has destroyed this man's nerves,

704
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.490
but he has proved himself on many occasions incapable of keeping his head

705
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.430
inaction.
And likely to cause a panic.
However,

706
00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:35.080
the officer made a point of differentiating between these problems and the

707
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:38.530
unfortunate soldiers nature saying apart from his behavior,

708
00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.570
his conduct and character are very good.

709
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.750
So he's got one person that comes forward and says,
Hey,
he's not a bad guy.

710
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:45.730
He's just,
he's just lost it right now.

711
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.063
<v 1>Okay.</v>

712
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.990
<v 0>Because he did a fair amount of fighting.</v>

713
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.860
The next piece of evidence was signed by Wwe William the battalion's medical

714
00:48:59.111 --> 00:48:59.950
officer.
He wrote,

715
00:48:59.951 --> 00:49:04.951
I hereby certify that I examined Private Harry Far First Battalion York's on

716
00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:10.300
October 2nd,
1916 and that in my opinion,

717
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:15.520
both the general physical and mental condition or satisfactory.
Interestingly,

718
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.210
the word good appears before the word satisfactory,

719
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:24.370
but it's struck out by the same hand indicating some doubts in the officer's

720
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:28.270
mind.
The trial began formally with a prosecution witness,

721
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.470
regimental sergeant,
sergeant major h laking,

722
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.700
who said on 17 September,

723
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.380
1916 about 9:00 AM the accused reported himself to me at a line transport.

724
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.640
He states that he was sick and had fallen out from the company the night

725
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:47.890
previous on the march up to the trenches.

726
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.980
He states he could not find his company commander for permission to fall out.

727
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.150
I order him to report to the dressing station when he returns.
He states that he,

728
00:49:55.151 --> 00:49:57.370
they would not see him as he was not wounded.

729
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.730
I then ordered him to proceed to the battalion with the ration party,

730
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.130
which was going in the evening.

731
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.540
The ration party paraded about 8:00 PM the accused was present and marched off

732
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:11.830
with it.
On the arrival at the ration dump company,

733
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:16.831
Quartermaster Sergeant Booth reported to me that the accused was missing on

734
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:22.171
returning to the first line for about 11:00 PM I saw the accused standing near a

735
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:28.400
brazier.
I asked him why he there?
He replies,

736
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.990
I cannot stand it.
I asked him what he meant.
He again replies,

737
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:37.520
I cannot stand it.
I told him he would have to go to the trenches that night.

738
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.170
He replies,
I cannot go.

739
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.333
<v 1>I order</v>

740
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.280
<v 0>company Quartermaster Sergeant Booth to take him up to the trenches under
escort.</v>

741
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:53.150
After going 500 yards to the accused commences to scream and struggle with his

742
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:53.900
escort.

743
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.740
I again warned him that he would have to go to the trenches or be tried for

744
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:00.950
cowardice.
He replied,
I am not fit to go to the trenches.

745
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.200
I then said I would take him to see a medical officer.
He refused to go saying,

746
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:11.180
I will not go any further.
That way.
I ordered the escort to take him on.

747
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.750
The accused,
started against struggling and screaming,

748
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.150
so they were actually wanting to take him to a medical officer.

749
00:51:21.151 --> 00:51:24.870
That's further forward and he's not going.
He's done.

750
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:31.400
The second witness to be called was company Quartermaster Sergeant Jw booth of

751
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:36.401
the First Battalion West Yorkshire Regimen and he says on September 17th,

752
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:43.310
1916 about 3:00 PM I ordered the accused to parade with the caring party at 6:00

753
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.530
PM to go up to join his company in the trenches.

754
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.490
The accused paraded and marched off with the rash and party on arrival at the

755
00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:51.380
ration dump.
The accused was absent,

756
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:53.720
having fallen out on the way without permission.

757
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.850
About 9:00 PM I saw the accused near the first line transport.

758
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:03.530
The regimental sergeant major ordered me to take the accused with the escort to

759
00:52:03.531 --> 00:52:06.800
the trenches about 500 yards from the first line transport.

760
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:08.360
The accused became violent,

761
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.770
threatened the escort and eventually broke away returning to the first line

762
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:13.580
transport.

763
00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:18.440
The regimental sergeant major ordered me to place the accused in charge of a

764
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:19.274
guard.

765
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

766
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.490
<v 0>those stories kind of line up.</v>

767
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.580
The third witness was private d Ferrar who also appears to have survived the
war.

768
00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:32.770
He said on September 17th,

769
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:36.700
1916 about 11:30 PM I was ordered by company quartermaster sergeant booth to

770
00:52:36.701 --> 00:52:41.350
form part of an escort to take the accused up to his company in the trenches.

771
00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.050
After going about 500 yards,

772
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.850
the accused started struggling and saying he wanted to see a doctor.

773
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.170
The sergeant major said he would see one when he got a bit further up the

774
00:52:50.171 --> 00:52:53.260
accused refuse to go any further.
I tried to pull them along.

775
00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.100
The sergeant major told me to let him go and the accused went back to the first

776
00:52:57.101 --> 00:52:57.940
line transport.

777
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.980
So there's the perspective of the folks that were with

778
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:09.260
private far and here is private fars defense.

779
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:11.660
This is what he had to say about the situation

780
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.400
on 16th September,
1916 when going up to the trenches with my company,

781
00:53:18.401 --> 00:53:19.510
I fell out sick.

782
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.840
I could not find the company officer to obtain permission to sergeant.

783
00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:28.140
I asked has now been or went back to the first line transport arriving there

784
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:32.010
about 2:00 AM on 17 September,

785
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:36.510
1916 I would've reported at once the regimental sergeant major only I was told

786
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.980
he was asleep.
I reported about 9:00 AM on 17 September.

787
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.080
The sergeant major told me to go to the advanced dressing station.
They however,

788
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:48.270
would not see me as I was not wounded.

789
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.320
The sergeant major told me to go up with the rash and party at night.

790
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.710
I started with this party and had to fall out sick.

791
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:57.390
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

792
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.560
<v 0>I could not get permission.</v>

793
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.380
As I was in the rear and the sergeant major was in the front,

794
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.480
but left word with a private soldier,

795
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.270
I returned to the first line transport,

796
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.390
hoping to report sick to some medical officer there

797
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:14.390
on the sergeant major's return.

798
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:18.050
I reported to him and said I was sick and I could not stand it.

799
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

800
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.750
<v 0>He then said,
you are a fucking coward and you will go to the trenches.</v>

801
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.750
I give fuck all for my life and I give fuck all for yours and you'll get fucking

802
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:31.584
well shot.

803
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.450
The sergeant major company,

804
00:54:36.451 --> 00:54:40.230
quartermaster booth and private Farrar then took me toward the trenches.

805
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:46.020
We went about a mile when we met a caring party returning from returning under

806
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.520
lance corporal form.

807
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:54.030
The sergeant major asked Lance corporal form where I was and he replied,

808
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:57.780
runaway,
same as last night.
I said to sergeant major,

809
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.960
you have got this all made up for me.

810
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

811
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:07.040
<v 0>The sergeant major then told Lance corporal form to fall out to men and take me</v>

812
00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:09.230
to the trenches.
They commenced to shoved me.

813
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:14.410
I told them not to as I was sick enough as it was the sergeant major.

814
00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.430
Then grab my rifle and said,
I'll blow your fucking brains out if you don't go.

815
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.010
I then called out for an officer,
but there was none.

816
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:23.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

817
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:26.960
<v 0>I was then tripped up and commence to struggle after this.</v>

818
00:55:26.961 --> 00:55:30.170
I do not know what happened until I found myself back in the first line

819
00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:31.610
transport under a guard.

820
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.570
If the escort had not started to shove me about,

821
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.400
I would have gone up to the trenches.

822
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:39.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

823
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:44.810
<v 0>It was on account of their doing this that I commenced to struggle</v>

824
00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:49.360
after the statement.

825
00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.160
Harriers Cross examined by the courts prosecutor who asked if he had had the

826
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:59.190
opportunity of reporting six since September 16th here we replied yes.

827
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:02.980
After it was put her under arrest on 18 September.

828
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

829
00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.900
<v 0>A member of the court marshal then asked why he had not reported sick since his</v>

830
00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:12.140
first arrest,
to which he replied fatefully

831
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.000
because being away from the shell fire,
I felt better.

832
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:21.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.120
<v 0>Evidence too as to the character private far was presented to the court.</v>

834
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.730
The battalion's adjutant,

835
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:33.330
lieutenant w Paul stated that he knew Harry for six weeks.

836
00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:35.080
He said on working parties,

837
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.400
he has three times asked for leave to fall out and return to camp as he could

838
00:56:39.401 --> 00:56:41.650
not stand the noise of our,
the artillery.

839
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.570
He was trembling and did not appear to be in a fit state.

840
00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:55.180
So Harry had spent four years in the service of his country two years before the

841
00:56:56.421 --> 00:56:58.550
war and two years during it.

842
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:03.410
The private soldier took part in a number of actions with his infantry
battalion.

843
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.460
Most notably the battle of [inaudible] Chapelle.

844
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.920
It was one of the most intense and attritional chapters of the entire conflict

845
00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:13.970
on the western front.

846
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.310
One of the first examples of the wholesale slaughter of British troops for which

847
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:22.220
the first world war has become renowned.

848
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:24.350
Within months he was in the hospital.

849
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.610
His nerves shattered with a diagnosis of shell shock.

850
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:36.680
Yet he returned to the front in October of 1915 and fought on for another 11

851
00:57:36.681 --> 00:57:41.570
months with two more spells of sickness because of his shell shock.

852
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:50.630
According to Chris Walsh in the cowardice of brief history as a world war,

853
00:57:51.661 --> 00:57:52.680
one dragged on,

854
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:57.681
Captain Charles Wilson of the Royal Army Medical Corps observed fear was no

855
00:57:58.441 --> 00:58:01.530
longer an occasional and exotic visual visitor,

856
00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.980
but a settler in our midst.

857
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.260
It's cumulative effect led Wilson later Lord Moran,

858
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.550
which was Sir Winston Churchill's personal doctor to think that a man's ability

859
00:58:17.551 --> 00:58:18.960
to hold up against it,

860
00:58:18.961 --> 00:58:22.770
his courage was not absolute quality of his character,

861
00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:27.240
but something he had a certain amount of like money in a bank account and which

862
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:32.241
could be depleted slowly or suddenly by the hardships and horrors of war.

863
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:40.690
Harry far had reached the limit of his endurance and could go no further.

864
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

865
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.940
<v 0>And so the trial was over.</v>

866
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:52.910
There was no lawyer,
those soldiers,
friend,

867
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:54.043
no support,

868
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.510
and there was no mercy back to the book.

869
00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:02.990
The wording on the charge sheet was starting

870
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.863
<v 1>okay.</v>

871
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:10.260
<v 0>Under a column entitled finding.
And if convicted sentence,</v>

872
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:14.220
two words were handwritten in Pencil.

873
00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:17.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

874
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:18.543
<v 0>Guilty.</v>

875
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:21.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

876
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.483
<v 0>Yes,</v>

877
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.770
there was no right to an appeal.

878
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:36.140
And late 1916 a telegram arrived for Gertrude,

879
00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:38.240
far from the war office,

880
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:44.470
opening the envelope with trembling hands and a fucking heart.

881
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:49.770
She read the bold type written message that realized her worst fears.

882
00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.630
Okay.
Harry far had died in France,

883
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:02.780
but not in battle or of wound sustained under fire.

884
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.030
Rereading it in disbelief.
Gertrude learned that her husband

885
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.390
had been executed by firing squad.

886
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.200
The stark message read we,
we get,
we regret to inform you.

887
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

888
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.470
<v 0>That Harry Thomas,</v>

889
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.500
far of the first West Yorkshire Regimen has been shot for showing cowardice in

890
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.080
the face of the enemy.

891
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:38.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

892
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:45.420
<v 0>Shot for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy.</v>

893
01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:46.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

894
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.360
<v 0>And unfortunately he was not the only one.</v>

895
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.800
There were 351 men executed by the British army during World War One and more

896
01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:02.270
than 300 of those,

897
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.970
just over 300 of those were for there.

898
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.480
Suppose it to cowardice.

899
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:11.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

900
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.810
<v 0>And there is a book called a shot at dawn.</v>

901
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.450
Bye Julien.
Put Koski and Julian Sykes

902
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.700
and it's called shot at dawn because that was generally when these executions

903
01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:28.880
were carried out.
They were carried out in the,
in the early morning.

904
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.590
And it details some of those men that actually details all the men and their

905
01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:37.730
deaths and

906
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.240
<v 1>okay.</v>

907
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.240
<v 0>Provide some insight from some of the people that were there during these</v>

908
01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.720
horrible times.
So I'm going to go to that book.

909
01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.360
The first sentence of death imposed on a soldier.

910
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.230
Of the B e f which is the British expeditionary forces,

911
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:06.580
was carried out in the fifth week of the war and the condemned soldier was

912
01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:09.250
private,
Thomas Highgate from Kent.

913
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:14.670
He had been born in the little village of Shoreham nearest Sevenoaks seven oaks

914
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.210
and I joined the army in February,

915
01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:23.160
1913 like many who enlisted for regular army service.
The latter joined up

916
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.350
at the age of 17
after less than two weeks in action,

917
01:02:29.351 --> 01:02:32.110
the private have deserted on the day that he went missing.

918
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:37.540
His battalion had started to move northwards advancing Highgate who's wearing

919
01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:41.860
civilian clothing was discovered by a game keeper hiding in a barn.

920
01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:45.370
His uniform,
his concealed nearby.
When questioned,
he said,

921
01:02:45.371 --> 01:02:48.220
I want to get out of it and this is how I'm going to do it.

922
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.020
Not surprisingly private Highgate and was found guilty.

923
01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:59.410
The sentences imposed was that he would suffer death by being shot.

924
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.790
17 year old kid

925
01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:09.260
in March,

926
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.640
1915 to soldiers from one West Yorkshire Regiment were convicted of desertion

927
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.010
and then were shot within a few days of each other.

928
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:21.700
The first Lance Corporal Alfred Atkinson deserted whilst in rest,

929
01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:25.310
the battalion being under orders to proceed to the front.

930
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.570
In January of that year,

931
01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:31.571
Atkinson had want us some of money gambling and after about of drinking,

932
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.130
subsequently deserted after three weeks,

933
01:03:34.131 --> 01:03:38.620
he was then arrested by the military police.
At his trial,

934
01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:42.310
the court was told that Atkinson was a good soldier and previously have

935
01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:46.750
excellent character.
As a result,
his sentence bore a recommendation to mercy.

936
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.290
A soldier serving with the battalion at the time later confirmed his opinion

937
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.810
saying that Atkinson was clean,
smart,

938
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.070
brave soldier represented by all are respected by all his comrades.

939
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:02.280
When General Sir Horace Smith Dorian reviewed the proceedings.

940
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.520
He was of the opinion that an example was required and the sentence was

941
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:08.544
confirmed

942
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.860
and here's an eye witness of an account.
The two men,

943
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.830
and this is labor and Pete Ernst.

944
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:24.850
Third will the two men I selected for the firing party went with the adjutant.

945
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.840
<v 1>When they came back,</v>

946
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:32.070
<v 0>tough characters though,
they were supposed to be,
they were sick.</v>

947
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:32.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

948
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.400
<v 0>They screamed in their sleep,
they vomited immediately after eating.</v>

949
01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.430
All they could say was the site was horrible,

950
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:44.690
made more so by the fact that we had shot one of our own men,

951
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.420
<v 1>private Abraham.</v>

952
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.020
<v 0>Bev Verstein</v>

953
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.200
was the only son of an east end family because it was considered dishonorable in

954
01:04:58.201 --> 01:05:01.710
certain Jewish circles to be a soldier.

955
01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:06.980
Bev Verstein had signed up under the false name of Harris 1915 Christmas Eve

956
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:12.540
private.
Bev Verstein was a wounded in the back he had,

957
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.980
he was admitted to the hospital suffering from these wounds and also from shock

958
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.580
in his letters home private.

959
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.790
Bev Verstein told of his progress in the hospital and that he had been detained

960
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.370
there since 19 January,

961
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.370
1916 because he had developed a pressure sore on his heel first January,

962
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.970
1916 dear mother,
I'm very sorry that I did not write before now,

963
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.800
but we were in the trenches on Christmas Day and we had a lot to do.
Also,

964
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:41.980
I was taken ill and was sent to the hospital.
I am feeling a little better,

965
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.450
so don't get upset.
Also,

966
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.730
don't send any letters to the company because I won't get them all.

967
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:50.410
So you cannot send any letters to the hospital as I won't get them.
Dear mother,

968
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:54.700
do not worry.
I will be all right hoping all of you are getting on.
Well,

969
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.800
I was only hurt in the back.

970
01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:00.880
I will try to send you letters every few days if I can to let you know how I am

971
01:06:00.881 --> 01:06:04.060
getting on.
We get plenty of food in the hospital.
Dear mother,

972
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:08.440
I know it will break your heart this,
but don't be upset about it.

973
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.100
I will be all right,
but I would very much like to see you.

974
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.930
I will try my very best

975
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.310
and he did recover

976
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:20.803
<v 1>and</v>

977
01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:26.360
<v 0>he went back to the front.
On 13 February,</v>

978
01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.160
the soldier had left his position in the front line trenches and made his way to

979
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:33.800
one of the company headquarters in the rear.
He reported to his company,

980
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:37.670
Quartermaster Sargent and stated that a grenade had burst very close to him and

981
01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:41.060
that he was suffering from shock believing him to be a nervous condition.

982
01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:44.450
This NCO told Harris to report the medical officer.

983
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.160
Bev [inaudible] reported to the medical officer who examined him but found

984
01:06:49.161 --> 01:06:52.310
nothing wrong.
As a result,
the private was ordered to return to the trenches.

985
01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.050
Beverage scene,
however,
did not obey,

986
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.340
but made his way to a farmhouse in the rear where he took refuge.

987
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.890
Shortly thereafter,
waltzed warming himself by a fire.

988
01:07:00.891 --> 01:07:04.490
An officer from another regimen came into the farm house and suspecting that

989
01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:08.570
beverage [inaudible] was deserted,
replaced the lad under arrest.

990
01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.070
The letter sent home indicated that beverage scene wasn't trouble but did not

991
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.200
disclose the serious nature of his predicament.

992
01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.230
Clearly as a soldier did not realize that his life was at stake.

993
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.140
But the letters relate that at the time of his desertion,

994
01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:26.210
the private had been feeling unwell.
23 February,
1916 dear mother,

995
01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.520
we were in the trenches and I was ill,

996
01:07:28.521 --> 01:07:32.480
so I went out and they took me to prison and I am a bit of trouble now and I

997
01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:35.990
won't get any money for a long time.
I will have to go to the front,

998
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.680
go in front of a court.
I will try my best to get out of it,
so don't worry.

999
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.520
But dear mother tried to send some money,
not very much,
but try your best.

1000
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.560
I will let you know in my next how I got on,
give my best love to mother,

1001
01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:51.170
father and Kate,
your loving son

1002
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.103
<v 1>Abby.</v>

1003
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.330
<v 0>On March 4th when he was court marshaled private beverage,</v>

1004
01:07:57.331 --> 01:08:01.920
Dean explained that on the day of his absence a grenade had exploded beside him

1005
01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:05.010
and this had been more than his nerves could stand.

1006
01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.110
He added that he had done lost control.

1007
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:11.670
The court was unimpressed by this story and in spite of an unblemished record,

1008
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:16.400
the soldier was sentenced to death and the finding was confirmed by the

1009
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:18.890
commander in chief private beverage teens.

1010
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:21.500
Parents were left unaware of their sons predicament.

1011
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.560
The next communication which they received came from the army.

1012
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:28.640
It was an official army form which carried a blunt message.

1013
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:29.970
<v 1>Yeah</v>

1014
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:30.331
<v 0>Sir.</v>

1015
01:08:30.331 --> 01:08:34.830
I'm directed to inform you that a report has been received from the war office

1016
01:08:34.831 --> 01:08:36.930
to the effect that private Harris,

1017
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:41.990
a 11th Battalion Middlesex Regiment G S was signed with sentence after trial by

1018
01:08:43.561 --> 01:08:48.360
court marshal to suffer death by being shot for desertion and the sentence was

1019
01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:52.020
duly executed on 20 March,
1916

1020
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.760
another one,
and again this book is,

1021
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.990
is details every single soldier and I'm picking out some of the,

1022
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.670
some of the ones that stood out a bit to me.

1023
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:08.470
The next soldier concern was rifle been Albert Parker serving with seven kings

1024
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.330
royal rifle core.

1025
01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:14.510
His crime was typical example of desertion committed with the intention of

1026
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:15.770
avoiding service in the line.

1027
01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:18.620
35 year old Parker admitted drunkenness at his trial,

1028
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.800
but this did not mitigate his offense and I witness later recalled the

1029
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:26.990
promulgation of sentence and the execution that followed.

1030
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.200
Then the prisoners cap was taken off

1031
01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.790
and he was told to take one pace forward,

1032
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:38.910
which he did the a p m commence to read the papers.

1033
01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:43.690
The man was then told to take a pace back again,
which he did without a quiver.

1034
01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1035
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.190
<v 0>A braver man at that moment.
It wasn't to be found in France.</v>

1036
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.670
He was then marched away to the place where he was to be shot.

1037
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:59.570
We were then ordered to about turn and the brigade transport officer threatened

1038
01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.480
us that any man who turned around would be put on a crime.

1039
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:05.250
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1040
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.330
<v 0>so we stood in silence for what seemed hours,
although only minutes.</v>

1041
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:14.310
Then the shots rang out and one of the Yorkshire's fainted.

1042
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:15.840
The strain was that great.

1043
01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.650
Still we stood in silence until we heard another shot,

1044
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:24.830
which I afterwards ascertained was the doctor shot to make sure he was dead.

1045
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:31.911
Private.

1046
01:10:31.911 --> 01:10:36.911
Phillips of one Coldstream guards was executed for desertion.

1047
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.940
The clergymen who attended private Philips was captain t Guy Rodgers chaplain to

1048
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:47.240
the second guards.
A brigade.

1049
01:10:47.241 --> 01:10:51.920
The core Jamon documented his feelings and what he clearly regarded as a most

1050
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.610
whoring or deal 31 May,

1051
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:59.090
1916 shall I tell you over the terrible experience I've just gone through.

1052
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.011
If so,

1053
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:06.011
it must not go beyond the family circle of yourself and the hows Lems it has

1054
01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:12.380
just fallen to my lot to prepare a dessert before his death.

1055
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.380
That breaking the news to him,
helping him with his last letters,

1056
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:20.850
passing the night with him on the straw in his cell and trying to prepare his

1057
01:11:20.851 --> 01:11:22.170
soul for meeting God.

1058
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1059
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.040
<v 0>The execution and burying him immediately.</v>

1060
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.460
The shadow was just hanging over me when I wrote the last letter,

1061
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.930
but I tried to keep it out Monday night I was with him Tuesday morning at three

1062
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:41.190
30 he was shot.
He laid beside me for hours with his hand in mind.

1063
01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:43.410
Poor fellow.
It was a bad case,

1064
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:47.640
but he met his end bravely and drinking all I could teach them about God,

1065
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:52.200
his father.
Jesus is savior and the reality of the forgiveness of sins.

1066
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:53.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1067
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:58.470
<v 0>I feel shaken by it all,
but my nerves,
thank God,
have not troubled me.</v>

1068
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.230
Everyone has been so kind who knew of the ordeal.

1069
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.300
I will tell you some more some other time.

1070
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.070
I want to get it off and away from the thought of it as much as I can.

1071
01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.180
Here's a few guys that deserted together in a group,
Lance,

1072
01:12:20.181 --> 01:12:22.070
Sergeant Joseph Stones,

1073
01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:26.540
Lance Corporal Peter Goggins and Lance Corporal John MacDonald.

1074
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.540
In the new year when Sir Douglas Haig came to review the sentences,

1075
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:36.390
he commuted the those imposed on the four private.

1076
01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:37.920
So there's a for privates with these guys.

1077
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:42.480
These guys were the leaders of this group that deserted,
which were suspended,

1078
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.520
but an eye witness account recorded the final moments of the three condemned and

1079
01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:50.910
CEO's shot on 18 January.
Come out.

1080
01:12:50.911 --> 01:12:54.570
You ordered the corporal of the guard to me.
I crawled fourth.

1081
01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:58.200
It was snowing heavily.
Stand here.
He said,
pushing me between two centuries.

1082
01:12:58.201 --> 01:12:59.034
Quick March.

1083
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.970
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1084
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:04.320
<v 0>and away we went.
Not as I dreaded to my first taste of pack drill,</v>

1085
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.520
but out and up along the Long Street to an r e dump

1086
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:14.720
there the police corporal handed in the chip where upon three posts,

1087
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.840
three rows ropes and a spade were given to me to carry back our return journey

1088
01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:24.440
took us past the guard room up a short hail until we reached a secluded spot

1089
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:25.940
surrounded by trees.

1090
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:31.260
Certain measurements were made in the snow after which I was ordered to dig

1091
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:34.650
three holes as stipulated distances apart.

1092
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:39.930
I began to wonder,
could it be,

1093
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:41.260
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1094
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:45.070
<v 0>no,
perhaps spies perhaps.
Oh,
perhaps only my fancy.</v>

1095
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:46.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1096
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.670
<v 0>The next scene of piercingly called dawn.</v>

1097
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:50.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1098
01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:54.340
<v 0>A crowd of brass hats,
the medical officer and three firing parties,</v>

1099
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:56.620
three steaks,
a few yards apart,

1100
01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:00.670
and a ring of centuries around the woodland to keep the curious away,

1101
01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.220
a motor ambulance arrives conveying the doomed men manacled and blindfolded.

1102
01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.160
They are helped out and tied to the stakes

1103
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.410
over each man's heart is placed in an envelope.

1104
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.230
At the sign of command,

1105
01:14:20.231 --> 01:14:24.760
the firing parties 12 each align their rifles on the envelopes.

1106
01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:31.900
The officer in charge holds his stick,
a loft.
It has,

1107
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:32.734
it falls.

1108
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:37.740
36 bullets usher the souls of three of Kitchener's men to the great unknown.

1109
01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.500
<v 0>As a military prisoner,
I helped clear the traces of the triple murder.</v>

1111
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1112
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.140
<v 0>I took the post down.</v>

1113
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.710
I helped carry those bodies toward their last resting place.

1114
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:56.770
I collected all the blood soaked Strawn,
burnt it,

1115
01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.690
acting upon instructions.
I took their belongings from the dead.

1116
01:15:02.691 --> 01:15:05.570
Men's tunics discarded before being shot.

1117
01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.790
A few letters,
a pipe,
some fags,
a photo.

1118
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.180
I could tell you of the silence of the military police.

1119
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:20.080
After reading one letter from a little girl too.

1120
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.220
Dear Daddy,

1121
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.850
<v 1>another [inaudible]</v>

1122
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:28.150
<v 0>private,
David Stevenson on sensing danger,</v>

1123
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:30.880
the soldier had run off when questioned the private that lied,

1124
01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:34.390
saying that he was working for another town mayor on.

1125
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.770
Unfortunately for Stevenson,

1126
01:15:35.771 --> 01:15:40.420
he was already under suspected suspended sentence for previous offense of

1127
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:41.254
desertion,

1128
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.690
the recollections of an x sergeant who had been in charge of the firing squad

1129
01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.290
who shot private Stevenson and were published after the war.

1130
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.940
It was a terrible scene.
Being that I knew him made it worse for me.

1131
01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:00.420
The 10 men were selected for the firing squad from a few details left out of the

1132
01:16:00.841 --> 01:16:01.674
line.

1133
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1134
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:07.120
<v 0>They were nervous wrecks themselves and two of them had not the nerve to fire.</v>

1135
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:10.390
Of course they were tried by court marshal,

1136
01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:14.020
but they were found to be medically unfit.
Their nerves had gone.

1137
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.970
The last words the lad said were,
what will my mother say?

1138
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.793
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1139
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.790
<v 0>you have one more.
And this was an interesting</v>

1140
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.900
writing.
There was a private name,

1141
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:36.050
private Frederick Butcher and the report that comes out was actually published

1142
01:16:38.941 --> 01:16:43.100
in a newspaper years after the execution.
But,
and,

1143
01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:47.190
and he calls the private Frederick butchery calls him Jim,

1144
01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:53.150
but this eye witness to his execution wrote about it in a paper.

1145
01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:57.400
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1146
01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.170
<v 0>I shall call him Jim.
He had been out three years.</v>

1147
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.400
He'd been wounded,

1148
01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:07.330
but he was wounded at a time when wounded were cared for in France and we're

1149
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.160
back in the line in six weeks.

1150
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.610
There was nothing about GM which attracted special attention.

1151
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.880
He was the average happy go lucky sorta lad who did the day's work on an average

1152
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:25.030
in the average way war had become normal to him and he had settled down to that

1153
01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:29.840
fatalism which characterizes so many of our men.
When they said,

1154
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:34.430
if it is to be,
it will and if it ain't,

1155
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.920
it won't.
As if he had suddenly been hit in the mind,

1156
01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:45.340
he stood stock still to still one night and point blank refused to go over with

1157
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:51.170
a raiding party.
In an instant,
he became a marked man.

1158
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.910
His comrades could not quite determine whether it was bravery or idiocy.

1159
01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:02.050
Perhaps some string had snapped some something somewhere had gone wrong,

1160
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:08.420
but Jim just refused.
He was exceedingly nervous.

1161
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.480
But such a breach of discipline was in itself sufficient to account for that.

1162
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.450
By the time he stood on the mat before the court,

1163
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.270
he had partly regained his normal composure,

1164
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.480
but the seriousness of the situation that had washed away the color from his

1165
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:26.600
face and there was a dull med and look in his blue eyes.

1166
01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.033
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1167
01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.720
<v 0>his record saved him.
It was good.</v>

1168
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.160
And his judges tempered judgment with mercy and consideration.

1169
01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:40.390
He had been many platoon he had,
he had had many platoon commanders,

1170
01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:44.050
many captains and all and with all he had done his bit.

1171
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:49.540
The court gave him a chance.
He made no excuse whatsoever,
but when question,

1172
01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:54.340
but when asked the question,
he promised that it would not occur again.

1173
01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:02.420
A week later it did occur again and the next court sentenced him to death.

1174
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.420
Blind folded with his hands tied behind him.

1175
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.880
He was to be shot at dawn the following day.

1176
01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:13.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1177
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:14.920
<v 0>From the death century,</v>

1178
01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.280
Jim learned the names of the officer and men who were to send him a west next

1179
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.873
morning.

1180
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1181
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.320
<v 0>They were all his friends,</v>

1182
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:28.250
two or three officers who had known him for years,

1183
01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:30.680
went into the deaf hut and said goodbye.

1184
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:34.220
Somehow none of them could quite catalog Jim as a coward,

1185
01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:37.443
<v 1>okay?</v>

1186
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.470
<v 0>Terrible things happen in war,</v>

1187
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.640
but nothing perhaps is more terrible than to send one of your own out of life

1188
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:50.450
when you,
you're not quite sure whether he is a coward or a martyr.

1189
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.030
The world will never know the real truth.

1190
01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:58.810
There was no psychologists there to give an opinion.
Even if there had been,

1191
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.150
it might not have altered the course of events.

1192
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.980
Discipline even then might have one,
an unfair victory over

1193
01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.540
in the mechanism of Gin Jim's mentality,

1194
01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.500
a cog slipped and the wheels revolved irregularly

1195
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.260
from what the CEO and Jim's pals told me.

1196
01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.910
I am fully persuaded that Jim died as a martyr to discipline.

1197
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:33.230
Jim was blind.
Folded,

1198
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.610
<v 1>okay?</v>

1199
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:39.020
<v 0>His hands were bound together behind him as he stood there,</v>

1200
01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.590
calm and steady as a rock.
The orders were given.

1201
01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:45.320
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1202
01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.840
<v 0>goodbye,
sir.
Goodbye boys.</v>

1203
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:54.390
He said,
just as if you were off on a 10 day furlough,

1204
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.090
<v 1>okay.</v>

1205
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:57.140
<v 0>There was no reply.</v>

1206
01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.420
The subaltern was choked with emotion and the firing squad as a part rent as he

1207
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.800
dared not reply.

1208
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:07.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1209
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:13.210
<v 0>The sharp crack of a volley smothered sighs of relief from the squad.</v>

1210
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:15.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1211
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.160
<v 0>And all was over
all save lane,</v>

1212
01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:23.290
been him beneath the soil of France

1213
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:30.830
and there where Jim lives there shall remain forever.

1214
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.290
<v 1>A little bit
of England.</v>

1215
01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:49.923
Well,

1216
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.040
<v 0>as I said,
this is a</v>

1217
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:03.870
awful thing and I'm sorry to have to bring it up and I'm sorry to have to talk

1218
01:22:04.121 --> 01:22:04.361
about it.

1219
01:22:04.361 --> 01:22:09.361
I'm sorry that that we human beings are capable of this

1220
01:22:14.150 --> 01:22:15.210
and at the same time

1221
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:22.390
it's good to know what we are capable of so that we can prevent it.

1222
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:29.290
And eventually in 2006

1223
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:37.450
after way too long and after a lot of effort and hard work by a lot of

1224
01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:41.890
compassionate people,
the British government admitted that it was wrong.

1225
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:46.240
And the story of that effort is retraced.

1226
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:49.060
In the first book I read from,

1227
01:22:49.061 --> 01:22:53.200
he was no coward and it resulted in the pardon.

1228
01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1229
01:22:55.110 --> 01:23:00.110
<v 0>Of Harry far and of 306 of the other soldiers</v>

1230
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.990
who were executed

1231
01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:10.490
who were shot at dawn for the crime of having

1232
01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:17.140
psychological breakdown under the immense mental and physical trauma of World

1233
01:23:17.781 --> 01:23:18.620
War One.

1234
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:25.660
And in 2006 Harry Fars daughter dirty,

1235
01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.700
who we started this story off with,
girdy was presented

1236
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.440
with a letter from the secretary of Defense,
Desmond Brown,

1237
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:42.450
which included the official pardon for Harry far and it reads this document

1238
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:49.170
records that private Harry far of the First Battalion of the West Yorkshire

1239
01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:55.111
Regiment who is executed for cowardice on 18 October,

1240
01:23:55.270 --> 01:24:00.270
1916 is pardoned under section 359 of the Armed Forces Act of 2006

1241
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.440
the pardon stands as recognition that he was one of many victims of the first

1242
01:24:11.081 --> 01:24:11.914
world war.

1243
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:17.070
And that execution was not a fate he deserved.

1244
01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:20.963
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1245
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.550
<v 0>Sign Dez Brown,
secretary of State</v>

1246
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.460
for defense.

1247
01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.660
And so he was pardoned.

1248
01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.710
And I would say that private Harry far,
we,

1249
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:46.290
we beg your pardon.
And

1250
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:48.750
I would say,

1251
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.860
let us learn something from this.

1252
01:24:52.861 --> 01:24:57.861
Something about leadership and something about our behavior as human beings.

1253
01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:02.730
Our nature as human beings.
Let us learn something

1254
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.570
from the fate of Harry farm.

1255
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:15.070
And that is that we as human beings are not infallible.

1256
01:25:15.321 --> 01:25:20.321
We are not perfect and we will fall short of the ideals that we aspire to will

1257
01:25:23.721 --> 01:25:24.800
fall short of those.

1258
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.390
And we may not always be as bold and we may not always be as heroic and we may

1259
01:25:32.391 --> 01:25:34.790
not always be as brave as we want,

1260
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.200
but while we may fall short on those traits,

1261
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.483
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1262
01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:45.260
<v 0>let us never fall short</v>

1263
01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:52.360
in compassion,
in sympathy

1264
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.690
and an understanding

1265
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:04.220
and let us,
when we look to others,

1266
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:12.510
let us remember and let us know that our judgment is as imperfect as we are.

1267
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.313
I remember

1268
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.300
that it is us who

1269
01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.930
in the words of Wilford Owens,

1270
01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:33.450
we are the ones that dealt them war and madness.

1271
01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:42.210
And so let us also be the ones who deal them mercy.

1272
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1273
01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:46.580
<v 0>Find forgiveness.</v>

1274
01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.500
And I think that's

1275
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:58.000
all I've got for tonight.

1276
01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.420
So Echo Charles,

1277
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.470
<v 2>kind of a rough one.
Yeah,
odd.</v>

1278
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.600
It's like an odd feeling,
right?

1279
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:15.120
Just that even though that final part of that last book,

1280
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:18.200
how you know,

1281
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:23.230
you got to essentially kill or witness both your friend.

1282
01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.480
And even until that,
it's not like you guys are friends,

1283
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:33.980
he'd be trays,
you know,
and you're mad at them and then you kill them.

1284
01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:37.790
It's not that.
It's like,
yeah,
some other thing kind of happened.

1285
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:42.820
Meanwhile you're still friends and then you got to be a part of in whatever way,

1286
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.050
like right in front of his face too.
Yeah.

1287
01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:49.970
Like him dying and the kind of where you're literally saying bye.

1288
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:54.980
Hey by,
and then next one dead.
And Yeah,
just kind of,
you know,

1289
01:27:54.981 --> 01:27:58.370
when you think he read these books,
you have this picture in your mind,
you know,

1290
01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.230
and it's just,

1291
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:05.120
it's so off putting just all the different facets that just come to play with

1292
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.200
the scenario like that.

1293
01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.040
<v 0>And there,
there's,
I mean obviously there's a,</v>

1294
01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.160
there's a huge dichotomy in this is the huge dichotomy in this is that there's

1295
01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:19.770
all these millions of brave soldiers that went,

1296
01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:24.850
that went over the top and they were killed.

1297
01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:30.190
And so how can you have any sympathy for the people that are like,

1298
01:28:30.191 --> 01:28:32.210
no,
I can't do it.
Yeah.
And,

1299
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.740
and the answer is you've got to recognize that different people are different.

1300
01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.140
And,
and you know,

1301
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:43.150
it's interesting that that last guy calls him a Marger and the perspective that

1302
01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:47.350
even someone that stood by him and someone that fought and took the same risks

1303
01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:49.930
and could have been killed himself and happened to live,

1304
01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.390
he recognizes like,
hey,
yeah,
this,
this happens.

1305
01:28:56.110 --> 01:29:00.790
And you know,
there's one part that kind of,
when you went to hear about this,

1306
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:05.610
the one guy gets rolled up or gets caught by some guy that's patrolling around

1307
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:09.870
the rear looking for deserters.
It's like when I hear about that guy,

1308
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:14.010
I can picture that guy can picture that guy.
He's in the rear saying,
Oh,

1309
01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:17.940
you need a more brief,
get,
get,
get up to the front.
You can picture that guy.

1310
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.590
And that,

1311
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:24.590
that kind of makes me angry because you got somebody that's in the rear policing

1312
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:27.900
up,
people sending them to the front.
Why don't you up on the front,

1313
01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:32.490
get up there yourself.
But yeah,

1314
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:37.080
so there's a dichotomy to it in that you know,
you,
you,
you,

1315
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:38.370
you,

1316
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:43.370
I mean obviously you uphold and have the utmost respect for the bravery of the

1317
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:50.520
people at step up and they're on,
put them on the,

1318
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:54.120
I put them on the highest pedestal and then you've got these people that

1319
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:55.100
contradict that,

1320
01:29:56.470 --> 01:30:01.470
that I think that the line gets drawn in the fact that these guys lose control.

1321
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:05.790
They can't do it.
They can't do it anymore.

1322
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:08.700
They mentally can't take it.
And again,
you know,

1323
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:11.400
this is the same thing that Dick Winters said.

1324
01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:14.970
The same thing that Hackworth said that the guys reach a limit and they're done.

1325
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.490
And only people that have been an extensive combat recognize that the people

1326
01:30:20.491 --> 01:30:21.990
reach a point.
And there's,

1327
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.810
there's that whole section in band of brothers where they,

1328
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:28.950
some of those guys that are total studs,
they,
they,
they can't go anymore.

1329
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.150
They break down and Dick winters was like,
okay,
we as a leader,

1330
01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:35.430
this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to do my best to take care of them if they,

1331
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:40.560
if we can get them recovered,
cool.
If not respect,
if not,
hey,
it's okay.

1332
01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:44.280
You did what you could.
Yeah,
it's,
it's a,

1333
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:49.281
it's a strange dichotomy and you can't help but try to imagine not necessarily

1334
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:52.890
the specific scenario,
but like what does,
what does it,

1335
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:58.070
how does it feel to literally like not be able to do something,

1336
01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.860
you know,
like,
yeah.
Well there's,

1337
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:03.390
there's a lot of shame for these guys that came home and there were ashamed that

1338
01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:06.000
they weren't wounded,
they weren't physically wounded and,
and,

1339
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.480
and the government treated them very badly.

1340
01:31:09.481 --> 01:31:14.010
In many cases they'll go,
oh,
you're cowards.
And so it's awful.

1341
01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:17.850
It's absolutely awful.
So I hate World War One.

1342
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:22.620
I Hate World War One.
And that's an shoot.
That's the thing too.

1343
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:25.020
It's not like,
you know,

1344
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:29.190
they're taking a spin class and they quit halfway through because they were too

1345
01:31:29.191 --> 01:31:32.330
tired or something like that.
This is no echo.
You are correct.

1346
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:35.850
And not the spin classes,
world war one,
by the way,

1347
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.130
like super treacherous.
Super.
Yeah.
And then you're like,
Oh yeah,

1348
01:31:41.131 --> 01:31:43.860
what?
You're,
you don't have the guts or you don't,

1349
01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:46.170
you're not brave enough for this.
And then people,

1350
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.820
people back in back in the safety of call,
call and judgment on,
on guys that,

1351
01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.690
and that's the other thing is these guys,
almost every one of those guys,

1352
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.550
they had fought for some certain amount of time.

1353
01:31:56.550 --> 01:32:01.270
They just have it for six months,
12 a year,
two years,
whatever.

1354
01:32:01.271 --> 01:32:06.010
They had fought and fought and they broke years.
So yeah,
man,

1355
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.830
it's awful.
It's awful.
Um,

1356
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:14.140
but you know,
I think it's something that if we can keep in perspective,

1357
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:16.480
because there's so much judging.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1358
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:19.870
People judge each other all the time.
It's like,
you know what?

1359
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.190
Take a wrap off your judgment that that was,
that was my,

1360
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:27.160
that was sort of what I was thinking through the whole time.

1361
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.880
I was thinking about how often am I judging someone?
You know,
it's like,
well,

1362
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:34.630
yeah,
you don't get to judge.
You look at the judge,
you just,
you just do,

1363
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:39.010
you worry about you and hey,
instead of trying to judge,

1364
01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:42.100
why don't you try and help someone?
There's a novel idea.

1365
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.280
Instead of placing judgment on someone that's having a hard time with something,

1366
01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.750
why don't you try and help them?

1367
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:48.610
Why don't you try and figure out how you can support them?

1368
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.950
Why don't you figure out what they need?

1369
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.720
They just think of anyone had that attitude on person would have stepped up and

1370
01:32:55.721 --> 01:32:59.170
said,
hey look,
I know this guy.
He was a good guy.

1371
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.330
Let me try and get him back in the game.

1372
01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:05.740
Let me try and figure out what's wrong instead of everyone jumping on board the

1373
01:33:05.741 --> 01:33:08.680
Judgment Bandwagon.
Yeah.

1374
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:12.190
It kind of seems like it's that feeling of like,
I'm over here,

1375
01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:16.720
you're over there like,
hey,
I don't need that kind of help,

1376
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:18.730
so why should you kind of thing,

1377
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.370
don't judge,
don't judge.
All right.
Instead of judging help.
How's that?

1378
01:33:27.371 --> 01:33:30.610
That's your,
that's my motto.
Instead of placing judgment,

1379
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:33.850
how would you help someone out support somebody's support.

1380
01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.900
I like what you just did there.
Speaking of which,

1381
01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.470
how about let's go into some support,
you know,

1382
01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.360
support yourself before you go to that.

1383
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.430
That opening poem by Wilfred Owen is freaking legit.

1384
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:53.020
Yeah.
Freaking legit.
And it's,
I should read it again.

1385
01:33:53.021 --> 01:33:54.670
I should have read it at the end or something,

1386
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.020
but go back and listen to it because it's,
it's,
it's,
it's uh,

1387
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.740
it's incredible tome from a guy that went through all that.

1388
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:07.630
He went into the psychological war.
If it was called that he went through the,

1389
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.690
what would be,
would have been called a psychological ward at the time.

1390
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:15.040
And then he went back to the front and then he was awarded for valor and then he

1391
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:19.780
got killed and he wrote that powerful,
powerful poem.

1392
01:34:19.781 --> 01:34:24.580
It's freaking awesome.
So I had to throw that out there.

1393
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:26.590
Go back and listen to it.
Yeah,
totally.

1394
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:31.420
Well support if you will,
back to support,

1395
01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.760
back to support,
back to sport.
All right.

1396
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:41.790
Here are some outstanding ways to support yourself and it's podcast if you're

1397
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:45.970
down for that first origin.
Okay.

1398
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.810
Origin is our company.
I feel like it's everybody's company.
We are,

1399
01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:55.690
well,
let's say maybe not,
we can't include our international listeners on that.

1400
01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.890
We can definitely include our American business.

1401
01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.420
<v 2>If you're an American listener,</v>

1402
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:03.200
if you're hearing the good old us of a origin is our company and you're

1403
01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:07.460
including that for sure.
But I have been,
you know,

1404
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.230
I've been hearing things that even people in the UK,

1405
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.220
they're waiting,
they're open arms when,

1406
01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.180
when are we getting milk in the UK,
when you know they're asking these questions.

1407
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.200
So open arms,
boom.
I think that it is,
it is.

1408
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:28.280
Or soon to become everyone's company checks.
Just the kind of company it is.

1409
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.730
Let's face it.
Just cause everything's made in America,
which I'll go into,

1410
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:35.450
doesn't mean you have to be American to be true.

1411
01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:41.710
It could be down for just good treatment of the workers know they're not in a

1412
01:35:42.531 --> 01:35:46.160
sweatshop.
No.
They're actually note in there actually on one,

1413
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.350
one 25 high street.

1414
01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:54.280
I don't know what at one 25 is,
but I dig.
I see.
Address.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1415
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:57.980
But I don't know,
maybe there was some sort of term,
no,

1416
01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.230
it wasn't some sort of like,
anyway,
yes.

1417
01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.770
Origin.
So what do we got at origin?
Okay.
If you're on the Jujitsu bad.

1418
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.060
If you're on the path and you do too,

1419
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:12.650
it's part of your specific situation.
Boom.

1420
01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:15.440
You're going to need a geek.
You're going to want a,
you don't need a g,

1421
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.700
don't need anything.

1422
01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:19.360
So this is what you're going to want big time actually kind of need.
Again,

1423
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.940
if you're going to train to denser with a g,
you're going to need a gate.
Well,

1424
01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.000
yes,
that's the show tonight.
All right,
well here you go.
So you do need to get,

1425
01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:32.120
you know,
you don't need to train.
No good you Jitsu,
but it is highly recommended.

1426
01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:36.290
In fact,
it is an affirmative.
You should train g and okay.
Yes.

1427
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.090
So I would personally agree with that.
Geeky Nogi,
Jujitsu,

1428
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:45.710
both all everything.
So therefore we can conclude we do need Ughi.
Yes.

1429
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:49.940
And if you're wondering what g to get,
boom,
wonder.
No more origin.

1430
01:36:49.941 --> 01:36:51.950
Has Geese all made in America by the way.

1431
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.500
But these are quality geese made from scratch,
by the way.

1432
01:36:57.501 --> 01:37:01.340
By origin for Jujitsu specifically anyway.

1433
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:05.360
Best cookies in the world.
Oh yeah.

1434
01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.860
Kind of by far too.
Yeah.
There's not much competition out there anyway.

1435
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:13.730
Or domain.com that's where you get them keys,
rash guards,
uh,

1436
01:37:13.731 --> 01:37:17.990
also some other stuff,
you know,
some joggers,
some sweat suits,
some shirts,

1437
01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:19.070
you know,
that kind of stuff.
Apparel.

1438
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.970
Sweatsuits sweatsuits I think it's funny when you go,
what do you represent?

1439
01:37:22.971 --> 01:37:25.820
The full origin sweatsuit.

1440
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.810
Max Comfort Max Comfort.
Experience it for yourself.
But yes,

1441
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:36.080
all that stuff you got your cell phone wants to.
We've got supplements,
uh,

1442
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:40.760
origin and we got joint warfare for your joints.
We got Krill oil,

1443
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:45.320
which is for your joints and everything else.
And what else?
Discipline.

1444
01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:51.010
The discipline gives you a little,
we'll say a little edge edge.

1445
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:55.620
The maths of Jujitsu and on the maths of life of life.
Yes,
much so.

1446
01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:59.970
Mental Edge,
physical edge.
You know,
vitamins,

1447
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:01.920
vitamins are specific,

1448
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:05.910
but we'll say for lack of a better term of vitamins for your brain or your whole

1449
01:38:05.911 --> 01:38:10.440
situation actually.
And then you got milk,
which is,

1450
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:16.870
which is glorious.
It's a protein dessert fortified.

1451
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.070
Here's the thing about,
okay,
so here's the thing about milk,
which I found out.

1452
01:38:20.071 --> 01:38:23.250
If I keep finding these things out here,
I'm not the kind of hair,

1453
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.550
evidently I'm not the kind of person who's like doing all the research.

1454
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.820
What are the benefits of this thing?
Apparently I would,

1455
01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:32.970
I thought it was that kind of person who's just started drinking it and be,
yeah,

1456
01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:36.120
you're looking at,
yeah.
I'm like,
cool,
I'll taste it.
Boom.
I tasted it.

1457
01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:37.800
It tastes like super good.
So I'm like,
okay,

1458
01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:42.220
I met and then you 10 you start to become in the mood for some Shaytan,

1459
01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:47.110
a milkshake.
Milkshake.
Milkshake.
And so I'll be like,
yeah,
I'm kind of,

1460
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:51.540
here's what I did do.
I did this a bunch of times in a row.

1461
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:54.870
So I guess I do this.
I make a peanut butter jelly sandwich

1462
01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.940
and a milkshake and I put some of the peanut butter in the mall and that's the

1463
01:39:02.461 --> 01:39:05.910
chocolate mint one.
And that's a weird thing.

1464
01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:10.590
It tastes good.
Tastes really good.
Wait,
wait,
what?
What's weird?

1465
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:15.250
Peanut Butter Jelly Sandwich peanut.
Which Wayne at butter and meant oh yeah.

1466
01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:19.200
Went together.
Now see.
And you'd think,
yeah,
sure.
That is kind of odd.

1467
01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:20.160
It's not odd.
Okay,

1468
01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:24.490
well you want to do that for much longer because we've got peanut butter milk so

1469
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.010
he can,
you can just be cool.

1470
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:31.170
Just chill and all that peanut butter in the mint and to me it's all good.

1471
01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:32.340
Put it all in there.

1472
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:36.030
It's coming at you strong or you're just getting all up on the peanut butter and

1473
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:39.750
jelly sandwiches like you're like you're nine years old.
I remember old school.

1474
01:39:39.751 --> 01:39:42.900
That's the way to gain weight.
Those are,
remember that?
I just remember,
oh,

1475
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:47.500
what's for breakfast?
What's for lunch?
Pb and J.
Yeah,
we'll go on.

1476
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:49.410
Remember the little plastic zip lock bag?

1477
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:51.690
Actually we need to have Ziploc bags back in the day.

1478
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:53.520
They just had like a fold over flap.

1479
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:56.550
There'd be jelly smeared all over that thing.

1480
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.390
Mom never put enough jelly on the peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich.
I'll never,

1481
01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:03.570
it was all,
all,
all the bids.
You want your peanut butter in there.

1482
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:07.890
Why is it cheaper?
The cost,
the same thing.
I put more jelly on the sandwich.
Mom,

1483
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:11.580
come on.
Where are you at?
Good.
That sweetness.
Go it.

1484
01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:16.250
What makes it funny is that that is 100% sure.
It's a universal,
it's universal.

1485
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.060
What's up with the moms get taught at mom's school.
They offer,

1486
01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.390
hey me back on the jelly.
No,
you know what it was not.

1487
01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:23.670
Think about it when you buy it.

1488
01:40:23.671 --> 01:40:26.760
I mean I don't know how much peanut butter you buy at the store and Jelly,

1489
01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:30.930
but probably as smart.
I mean the jelly things are a little bit smaller.

1490
01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:33.980
Smaller and a little bit more expensive.
Yeah.

1491
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:36.690
And the peanut butter thing is huge.
Well,
potentially,
I mean,
you know,

1492
01:40:36.691 --> 01:40:41.430
you've got some kids who should ever
crunchy,
creamy,
whatever,

1493
01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:44.010
but you get the peanut,
the huge peanut butter.

1494
01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:47.250
You got the little jelly with jellies,
more expensive.
Mom's trying to,
you know,

1495
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:51.560
she's Jenny be economical,
but the whole deal went to that home depot course.

1496
01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:54.340
That home economics class.
Do you have home economics in high school?
Yep.

1497
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:59.680
Home Economics in high school too.
It's good.
My mind a shot.

1498
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.430
I think my little sister got kicked out of Home Mecca next.

1499
01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:09.820
Oh yeah,
that was funny.
Yeah,
I could see that.
You didn't get kicked,
kicked out.

1500
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:14.410
Ah,
I definitely got in trouble a couple of times in home economics,

1501
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.980
but I,
but I didn't get kicked out by my little sister.
Got kicked out for what?

1502
01:41:17.981 --> 01:41:21.630
Putting the butter knife in the toaster or something.
I forget what she did.
I'll,

1503
01:41:21.631 --> 01:41:25.150
I'll research that and get back with you.
She was a,
she's a character,

1504
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.950
so you know that home economics was a little tough on her.
She's a character.

1505
01:41:29.951 --> 01:41:34.020
For some reason that doesn't surprise me,
but you know,

1506
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.300
I know other members of your family check Moke you back.

1507
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:43.360
All right.
Yeah.
Hey,
I sold milk protein added protein.
Here's the thing.
Okay.

1508
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:46.390
So back to my point.
My point was I don't do all the research,
you know,

1509
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:48.820
so I started just pounding milk.
He hit on the mold,

1510
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:52.270
train hardcore and meanwhile I'm discovering all these new things

1511
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:58.120
I knew about the probiotics.
Um,
but now it's like,

1512
01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:02.320
I find out it's Kido friendly.
It's,
I mean,
unless you mix it with milk,

1513
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:05.870
because I mix it with milk.
I should make that clear.
I mix it with milk.
Yeah.

1514
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:09.520
Yeah.
But you go like,
what?
What,
like what's each you go?
Like I said,

1515
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.810
if you mix it without milk,

1516
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:14.380
if you mix it with water then you're talking ham sandwich level of goodness.

1517
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:17.560
Yeah.
But there's like,
it's like,
it's good.
Like

1518
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:22.480
that's true.
That's true.
I haven't tried it actually.
I will try it.

1519
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:24.490
And here's the thing too,
and this is,

1520
01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:29.200
if you Jocko don't know that much about this part,
it won't surprise me.

1521
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.880
There are so many milk like sub variance variance.

1522
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:38.290
We need lactose free.
All kinds.
There's like a lot.
Yeah,

1523
01:42:38.291 --> 01:42:41.860
there's a lot of options for that.
And when you're talking Kido,
that's a whole,

1524
01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:46.770
you know,
that's a,
that's a whole like dietary plan,
you know.

1525
01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.800
So there are a lot of options.
So nonetheless,
regardless of what you mix it with,

1526
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:55.720
have you mixed it with any other kind of milk,
milk,
almond milk,
almond milk,

1527
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:58.740
almond milk's not kido friendly.
Like I said,
I don't know,
well,

1528
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:00.760
I'm not unnecessarily go coconut milk.

1529
01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:04.930
You can go coconut milk and you could get there and actually you've got to get

1530
01:43:04.931 --> 01:43:07.540
the real coconut milk.
You can get that fake coconut,
you can get hurt.

1531
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.180
You can't get the,
the,
the,
the,
the milk.

1532
01:43:10.181 --> 01:43:13.120
That's the coconut milk that they're trying to sell you as like a health thing.

1533
01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:14.830
Well not,
yeah,
not Co.

1534
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.990
And they're dumping a bunch of sugar and they're on this side.
Wait,

1535
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.080
are you talking about coconut water?
Because there's coconut water.
No,

1536
01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.810
I've told him not talking about,
I'm talking about coconut milk

1537
01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.930
Bra in Hawaii.
We learned all about that at school.
The difference,

1538
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:33.700
we know coconut milk and coconut water.
Oh Man.
All right,
well there you go.

1539
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.740
You are right though.
You were right about the book in the milk.
If you get the,

1540
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.550
you know,
the unsweetened one,
the real kind.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1541
01:43:42.551 --> 01:43:45.790
They're real straight coconut men.
That's Quito,
you're saying?
Yes.
Okay.

1542
01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:47.950
So that's the one I mixed it with.

1543
01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.410
It's kind of like done hidden billion grams of fat.

1544
01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:55.820
So it's a 98 grams of fat and they can of coconut milk,

1545
01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:01.970
but as far as Quito goes,
that's dope.
Yeah.

1546
01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:06.140
But we're talking about the milk itself though.
The mall is the powder.
Yeah.

1547
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:09.740
So that's Kido.
So whatever you mix it with,
that's going to be,
you know,

1548
01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.500
in extreme ownership situation,
you know,
if you want to stick with the Kido kids,

1549
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:18.320
stick with the cute him.
MOCA is part of that,
that deal check.
Then the last good,

1550
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:23.060
good,
clean protein,
probiotics,
all these things and it tastes good.

1551
01:44:23.061 --> 01:44:24.850
And here's the thing,
it's not like,
oh yeah,

1552
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.750
all these benefits and then by the way it tastes good.

1553
01:44:26.751 --> 01:44:31.190
It's not that to me it tastes good.
Oh,
and by the way,
it has all this good.

1554
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:35.510
So now with me on the thing about the importance of things tasting good or I

1555
01:44:35.511 --> 01:44:40.350
should say the importance of things.
Tasting questions.
Yeah,

1556
01:44:40.570 --> 01:44:41.810
you're with me.
That that is,

1557
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.620
that is probably possibly the most important thing.

1558
01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:49.430
If you're going to bring something into your game like fully,
you know,

1559
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.340
if this is going to become part of your life,
if it doesn't taste good,

1560
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:54.190
it's not going to come part of your life.
And if,

1561
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.500
and if you bring something to it that's part of your life that tastes like crap,

1562
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:01.040
like how long are you going to sustain that for and why?

1563
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:03.380
When you can have something that you don't,

1564
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:09.010
you don't have to have that beef anymore.
I can go.
Right.
Yeah,

1565
01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:11.930
and that's the whole reason I like it.
Like I said,

1566
01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:14.390
peanut butter jelly sandwich with the all right,

1567
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:17.510
and I'll put a little bit of peanut butter in it.
Like I said,
and I'm like,

1568
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:22.270
it is literally like a dessert.
I'm like pounding it on the thing.

1569
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:24.260
It's really good.
No,
the last,
yeah.

1570
01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:28.220
Well very good origin main.com that's where you get these outstanding things.

1571
01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:30.500
Also,
Jujitsu immersion camp,

1572
01:45:30.501 --> 01:45:33.900
back to Jujitsu and origin in and of itself in a,

1573
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:38.630
of course a lot of it.
Yes.
There's also Jujitsu there.

1574
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:44.050
Strangely enough.
I know.
Best Way to learn Jujitsu.
Most of the A,

1575
01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:49.670
I'm sure there are exceptions,
but if you immerse yourself in any activity,

1576
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:53.030
that's a very,
very effective in good way to learn.

1577
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:57.590
And there's any Jujitsu immersion camp.
Yup.

1578
01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:02.130
August 26 through September 2nd this year.
But that's coming up.
Yeah.

1579
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:05.450
A bunch of us are going gluing some people that have never trained before.

1580
01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.171
Oh wait.
Okay.

1581
01:46:06.171 --> 01:46:10.700
So did we find out whether or not it's sold out cause we're all talking and just

1582
01:46:10.701 --> 01:46:15.380
check the website and it's not sold out.
Okay.
So it's not sold out.
I don't,

1583
01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.430
it might be close,
but go and sign up now.
Yeah.
And that way you can go and then,

1584
01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.340
yeah.
Well that's the best way to find out if it's sold out,
called sign up.

1585
01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:26.240
If it says cool,
you're signed up,
you're solid.
That means nurses days.

1586
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:30.320
Bring a tent.
Echo Lake Tent.

1587
01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:35.150
Get some as I say,
but yeah,
I got a lake.
Tent,
mosquitoes,
mosquitoes.

1588
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:38.190
Is there mosquitoes everywhere?
I guess main.

1589
01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:41.010
It's the state bird up there because we go

1590
01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:48.950
through my jeans at night.
Can you imagine a mosquito?
This is so psycho.

1591
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.100
It just like comes up jeans.
No factor,
right through those without Stinger.
Yeah,

1592
01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:57.720
the needle.
Yeah.
That's the main was,
yeah,
that's weird.

1593
01:46:57.721 --> 01:47:01.440
On quiet.
There's mosquitoes for sure.
They're not,
they're legit mosquitoes,

1594
01:47:01.441 --> 01:47:05.130
but I don't think maybe if you go in the mountains or something like that,

1595
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.930
well they only have to bite through that lightweight hoodies.

1596
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.530
They don't have to be so hardcore.
No,
that's true.
Nonetheless,

1597
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:16.470
immersion camp,
real good on a lot of people going,
man.
A lot of people,

1598
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.580
legitimate people going,
beginners,
advanced everywhere.

1599
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:23.010
Dean [inaudible] Dean list.
That's an advanced guy,

1600
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:26.940
obviously advanced on to say the least.
Nonetheless,

1601
01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.680
that's going to be for a second.
Can we get it all?
So Jocko has a store.

1602
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:37.320
It was called Jocko store.com so [inaudible] dot com this is where you can get

1603
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:41.220
shirts if you want to represent and to represent that,

1604
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:45.330
that the path that we're all on,
if you will.
Discipline equals freedom.

1605
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:49.920
Discipline equals freedom.
Is the path.
Really?
Yes.
Well,

1606
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:53.250
it's like fried.
It's like the path is discipline actually.

1607
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.210
I don't know if that's right.

1608
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.880
Discipline equals freedom is the sort of like the roadmap,

1609
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:03.820
the past.
Yeah,
the path,
the path.
That path is actually doing it.

1610
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.750
This one is the path and then freedom is,
it's like this dude,

1611
01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:11.760
the destination where you're continually trying to go.
Yeah,

1612
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.500
but you're the,

1613
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:18.120
you're just existing in this fabric freedom because of the discipline.

1614
01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.360
True.
However you want to assert it.

1615
01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.620
If you want to represent good chocolate,
store.com you can get shirts,

1616
01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:30.540
rash guards,
hoodies,
hats and beanies and whatnot.
Shirts.
Did you say t shirts?

1617
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:35.280
Tee shirts on there.
Trucker hats,
tank tops.
Even just getting warm man.
Wait,

1618
01:48:35.281 --> 01:48:39.390
it's been warm male tank tops.
Male tank.
Oh

1619
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:44.180
there you go.
Oh that's good.
Do it.
But yeah man,

1620
01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.650
if you want a representative are they,
are they uh,

1621
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.680
cause you know I'm not super uh,
fashion aware.
Yes.

1622
01:48:49.681 --> 01:48:54.681
I think our tank tops out in or out of style because tank tops or the reason

1623
01:48:56.941 --> 01:49:01.050
that I ask this is because first of all I wear the same clothes forever.
Yes.

1624
01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:04.080
I don't wear them until they're completely destroyed.
Well I had,

1625
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.760
when I met my wife I had a bunch of tank tops that was sort of like my go to,

1626
01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:10.710
I just warm all the time cause it's hot.
Right.

1627
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:13.410
Well I didn't wear them all the time but anytime the temperature,

1628
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.920
anytime in the summertime,
anytime I've walked past it one more time.
Functional.

1629
01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.950
And then one day when my wife,

1630
01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.150
cause they were all old and ratty and they had Guinness stains on them and they

1631
01:49:24.151 --> 01:49:27.030
were just all jacked up.
I didn't care because whatever.

1632
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:32.750
And my wife through every single one of them away.

1633
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:37.170
Yeah.
Every single one of what?
Like just,

1634
01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.560
and the thing is in her mind it wasn't spiteful.
Yeah.

1635
01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:44.730
She was actually like super stoked.
Like,
oh yeah,
I know.
Yeah.

1636
01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:48.690
You know how those old I the uh,
the dirty shirts,
I threw them away.

1637
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:51.820
So you just have clean shirts now you're welcome.
You know,

1638
01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.890
she's coming at me with your welcome,
Eh,

1639
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:57.000
and meanwhile these were all like my favorite.
They were all super,
you know,

1640
01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:01.210
you know,
wear a shirt that's like 14 years old.
It's super comfy.
Yeah.
I know.

1641
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:05.950
The idea that you're the comfort dude come on a tee shirt that's 20 years old.

1642
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:09.490
It's more comfortable than a teacher that's brand new.
Correct.
Yes.
Okay.

1643
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:12.520
So I had a whole series of tank tops like that.
All super comfortable.

1644
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:15.880
My wife threw them all away.
I've been complaining.

1645
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:21.250
The one thing is my wife complains about me is that when something happens like

1646
01:50:21.401 --> 01:50:25.560
this,
I hold it against her forever.
I still bring it up.
Like,

1647
01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.890
you know it's been hot lately.
Yes.
You know them all like,
oh,
she's like,

1648
01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:33.000
I can't believe how hot it is.
I mean,
I could have a nice fat,
some tank tops,
but

1649
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.420
so,
okay.
Tank tops,

1650
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:41.480
I need to go back in the game with a tank tops coming at you to,

1651
01:50:41.481 --> 01:50:45.220
to answer your question,
our tank tops,
what would you say in fashion?
Yeah,

1652
01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:49.480
because when I think tank tops,
I also think like eighties dude,
right?

1653
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:51.430
Which is pretty much what I was

1654
01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.640
and probably still am,

1655
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:58.330
but I'm just throwing a question out there to make sure I'm not out aligned with

1656
01:50:58.331 --> 01:51:01.920
the,
you know what though?
I think tank tops,

1657
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.390
remember them pants that,
I forget what they're called,

1658
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:05.500
but like the bodybuilders were,

1659
01:51:05.501 --> 01:51:09.550
those pants are kind of like an elastic waist were printed.

1660
01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:14.890
All wacky.
Like I don't know if that's the equivalent right now,

1661
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.630
may,
I don't know if we were to roll out like that,
but

1662
01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:22.630
those things were functional.
I mean if the pants were like fuck,

1663
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:27.230
but they were super not functional,
I mean functional for what?
What I want.

1664
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:30.250
Those pants were called,
what do you think they were actually called?

1665
01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:35.140
I think that a name?
Yeah,
I think so.
I don't know what they're called.
I know,

1666
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.710
and this is a different type of pants,
but you'll remember the MC hammer pants.

1667
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:40.870
Yeah.
Those are slightly different for it.
Similar,

1668
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:44.740
but yet the bodybuilding ones wouldn't imprint on them.
Yeah,

1669
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:46.680
they're kind of whack.
They're kind of low risk.
Yeah.

1670
01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:51.460
Balloony but tight at the ankles.
I actually never had a pair of those.

1671
01:51:51.630 --> 01:51:53.260
Thank God.
I could see that.

1672
01:51:53.261 --> 01:51:55.360
That's the kind of thing where it's like a picture of that surfaces on the

1673
01:51:55.361 --> 01:52:00.100
Internet and you're like,
damn yeah,
that's all it's,
it's retro actually.
You know,

1674
01:52:00.101 --> 01:52:04.980
they bring it up so maybe it's coming back.
Maybe the back maybe.
All right.

1675
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:08.150
Tank tops a live there in nail.
They'll never go out because

1676
01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.720
they're functional.
They're like cooler.
They're not as hot.
Yes.

1677
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:17.590
So we're down with them.
I agree.
So boom,
we got that.
Get on it.

1678
01:52:17.591 --> 01:52:20.920
If you want to represent chocolate store.com sweet.
Do it.

1679
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:23.530
Women's stuff on there too,
by the way,
actually,
I'm said that already,

1680
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:27.670
but can't overstate it.
Something that to me,
buddy,

1681
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.250
you actually can't overstate
for now.

1682
01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:34.540
That's sort of like part of your thing,

1683
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:38.020
I guess like tank tops and overstating stuff.

1684
01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.980
There you go.
What about subscriber?
How about subscribe about that?
Let's let you,

1685
01:52:45.981 --> 01:52:47.090
we'll shift gears here.

1686
01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:51.320
Great Way to support is just simply to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't

1687
01:52:51.321 --> 01:52:55.490
already,
and then lever of you so I can read your phone.
He Review,
Oh,

1688
01:52:55.491 --> 01:52:59.090
you're smart and intellectual review,
but you might want to leave a funny one.

1689
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:03.470
And also the warrior could podcast.
Yes.
Good one.
Regardless of who you are,

1690
01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:08.270
if you're,
if you have any relationship to kids on any,

1691
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:12.710
even send my continual basis where it get past podcasts,
very beneficial,

1692
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:17.910
I press record and listen to it and I personally bring the lessons home.

1693
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:22.180
I do too.
I'm digging on the and we're getting great feedback.
Yeah.

1694
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.340
People are digging it.
Yeah,
I'm digging it.
You're digging it.

1695
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:28.220
Good one for teachers too.
Yeah.
Uh,
which is,
you know,

1696
01:53:28.221 --> 01:53:30.850
obviously that fits the category of having strong relationships with kids.

1697
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:32.370
Also Youtube,
uh,

1698
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:37.820
you can get your warrior kid videos on Youtube and you can get the Jocko podcast

1699
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:42.620
videos on youtube and is actually been stepping up his game big time at my

1700
01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.170
active semi-active.

1701
01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:48.830
I guess that's a step up that you said I active on and he makes not only the

1702
01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:50.690
videos of this podcast,

1703
01:53:50.691 --> 01:53:55.100
but he also makes a enhanced ones with lots of graphics.

1704
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:57.350
You need to let them know sometimes.

1705
01:53:57.351 --> 01:54:01.390
Maybe he's brushing up against going to crazy.
Right.
It's,

1706
01:54:01.670 --> 01:54:06.200
we've been talking about it.
Yeah.
If,
if too many things explode.
I mean,

1707
01:54:06.201 --> 01:54:10.820
let's face it,
there's a lot of movies out there,
one of those movies.
Uh,
no,

1708
01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:15.050
but what's like the boost?
What's the most,
the best one?
Commando.
Okay.

1709
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:17.560
So they're commando has just,
no,

1710
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:20.030
you've got to go with a more modern one where there's more CGI and just

1711
01:54:20.031 --> 01:54:22.420
everything's blown up.
Dang.

1712
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.590
I watched one of the other day with my nine year old daughter,

1713
01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.500
everything blew up.
Everything was on fire,
everything.

1714
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:30.170
It was starting to seem like it was one of your videos.

1715
01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:38.090
There you go.
You got that new tool.
The only,

1716
01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.450
the only video that's I think is truly brushed up against that you've made,

1717
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:42.920
I don't think it across the line,

1718
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:47.450
but the warpath video you were brushing up against everything that I did.

1719
01:54:47.451 --> 01:54:50.390
Exploded.
Turn to dust.
It caught on fire.

1720
01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.990
You were on the warpath mediocre.

1721
01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:57.950
It was thematic and it happened to be Christmas time at the time for the

1722
01:54:57.951 --> 01:55:01.660
original one cake.
No bread still on.
There's that.

1723
01:55:01.690 --> 01:55:04.630
Nonetheless you can.
Those are all on youtube.
Yes.

1724
01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:07.820
Videos also when we're working out just got rings.

1725
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:11.090
I told you that they just came in.
Boom.
Really Nice ones too.

1726
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.060
You can't do muscle ups though.
Cause your arm.
Not right now.
No,

1727
01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:17.630
but here's the thing.
But I never got into muscle ups.
That's wrong.

1728
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.660
So I've attempted muscle ups and I've seen that there's a technique to muscle

1729
01:55:22.761 --> 01:55:24.040
ups like if certainly,
yeah.

1730
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:30.010
So I've never had the pleasure of doing a muscle up ever.

1731
01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.270
Never done a Muslim rings bar.
Nothing.

1732
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:41.210
So when my arm heals fully capable,
I'm doing muscle up.

1733
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:45.900
That's my whole,
I'm going to be one of things also a pistol squat.

1734
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.110
Okay.
So I've done pistol squats before.
It really hard,
really clunky,

1735
01:55:49.111 --> 01:55:53.100
really ugly even.
But then that call you out on that one day,

1736
01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.290
like while we're doing the podcast,
like after the podcast I was like,
Ooh,
pistol.

1737
01:55:59.190 --> 01:55:59.701
And then I was like,

1738
01:55:59.701 --> 01:56:03.360
well let's get [inaudible] or you're not as flexible are you?
No,
no,
no,
no.
I am.

1739
01:56:03.361 --> 01:56:05.390
I remember you were like,
you were like,
Dang it.

1740
01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.790
Mirror flexible in my knees and my ankle.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1741
01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.160
We got a lot of room to move around.

1742
01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:24.073
So

1743
01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:33.870
side splittingly funny.
Anyway,
very flexible.

1744
01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.860
I'm gonna do pistol squats and muscle ups watch and be really good at it.

1745
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:40.230
Nonetheless.
My point is,
I got my rings anyway.

1746
01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:43.110
My action point is we're talking about on it.

1747
01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:47.490
So you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko this is where I have been getting

1748
01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:52.940
outstanding work out gear that deviates from my normal dumbbells,

1749
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:57.150
you know,
whatever.
So that's how I got turned on to kettle bells.

1750
01:56:57.151 --> 01:57:01.150
All this good stuff.
They have some good stuff.
The bag,
you know,
like the,

1751
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.540
I don't think it's a Bulgarian bag.

1752
01:57:03.570 --> 01:57:05.610
You know what a bulk area in by himself guarantee back.

1753
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.820
And I have the big sand bag thing from it.
Okay.
So how big is your sandbag?

1754
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.980
Bigger than yours?
Oh No,
the one,

1755
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:17.390
there's just one size I think from on it.
Okay.
Well yeah,

1756
01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:22.670
but then you can you fill it up.
Okay.
How much does your shirt,

1757
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:27.000
I have no idea.
No,
no,
no.
Go ahead with,
tell me just so I can fill up more.

1758
01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:30.330
Put an extra pound in there.
Cool.
But I've been doing that.
Um,

1759
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:35.190
the farmer's scary thing been to,
I mean,
my arm can't sustain too much weight,

1760
01:57:35.191 --> 01:57:37.740
but bro,
it's solid.
It's a solid,

1761
01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.360
I went around the block through the day with my war.
No sixes,
two of them,

1762
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:45.720
one in each hand.
And like I just like,
okay.
You know,
it's,

1763
01:57:45.721 --> 01:57:48.930
it's definitely challenging as it takes and I have to set them down a couple

1764
01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:52.980
times during that lap.
But what I noticed was the next day,

1765
01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:57.570
like my entire,
my entire like traps,

1766
01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:01.000
neck,
shoulders,
everything and forums were all sore.
Yeah.

1767
01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:03.630
So I knew I had that in the routine.

1768
01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.730
I was doing it pretty regular cause I like to see how far I can get each time.

1769
01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:11.020
But anyways it's,
yeah,
it's really good just for your body.

1770
01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.620
How far is your block?
I don't know.
More than

1771
01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.080
well block is about what?
You can't cause a box around this.

1772
01:58:22.081 --> 01:58:25.080
I'm thinking like city blocks downtown San Diego specifically.

1773
01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:27.660
It's different with different nonetheless.
Anyway,

1774
01:58:27.710 --> 01:58:29.910
[inaudible] dot com slash chocolate really cool stuff on there.

1775
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:31.530
Cool Info as well.

1776
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.650
Don't you can get stuck on that website because it's a lot of cool stuff on

1777
01:58:34.651 --> 01:58:36.270
there.
Also psychological warfare,

1778
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:40.620
it's an album with tracks a lot of people ask for on the alarm system.

1779
01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:43.600
This is of an alarm that you can put in your phone and it's me talking about

1780
01:58:43.601 --> 01:58:46.570
times that you might want to slack off.

1781
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:51.100
This will not allow any slack,
psychological warfare.
It's on iTunes,
Google play,

1782
01:58:51.101 --> 01:58:52.330
et cetera.
Check.

1783
01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.310
That was pretty concise and effective cause that that is what it is.

1784
01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.390
Also Jocko white tea.
Yeah,

1785
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:07.450
I got the tea.
I'm into the cans,
not into the Bruins.
Jp,

1786
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:12.000
I think JP might have a problem
tape.

1787
01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:15.310
He's all about it actually.
Okay.
So let me ask you this.

1788
01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:19.360
It has a little bit of caffeine and what's good is that JP,
JP,

1789
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:24.390
my brother that boy can drink some dang energy drinks like crazy.

1790
01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.730
Like,
like where I should have as a friend been like,

1791
01:59:30.731 --> 01:59:35.440
hey JP talked to you,
send you to Rehab,
we need to get you off these things.

1792
01:59:35.441 --> 01:59:38.380
And it,
cause he would pound that stuff.
You know,
cause he's going hard man.
He's,

1793
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:42.730
he's,
you know,
jps getting after it.
And so it's like,
oh,
okay cool.

1794
01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:47.530
I'll just drink energy drinks.
And also now he's on,

1795
01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.980
he's drinking Jocko white tea and uh,
so that's a real positive.

1796
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:55.450
It's a good replacement for that crap.
He's just pounding them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1797
01:59:55.510 --> 02:00:00.290
I mean he's told me like a crack head,
like,
yeah,

1798
02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:05.210
I just got another two cases.
By the way,
can you give it to little kid?
Like,

1799
02:00:05.211 --> 02:00:07.930
but none babies.
There's caffeine in it,
bro.
Yeah.

1800
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:09.750
That's what I can give it to little kids.
Yeah.

1801
02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.900
Cause my son grabs what's the dead lift

1802
02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.810
lift?
The trying a little kid nonetheless.
Yes.
Very good.
Ooh.

1803
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:22.150
Another thing that happens to taste really,

1804
02:00:22.151 --> 02:00:24.610
really good from Jocko chocolates into the little tasting.

1805
02:00:24.611 --> 02:00:28.810
Good thing nonetheless.
Decoy really go down organic certified.

1806
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:30.950
By the way we get done with it.

1807
02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:35.920
You don't right now it's on Amazon and we're gonna expand that.

1808
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:40.180
We got it in Canada.
It's on Jocko store too,
by the way.
I want to say Australia,

1809
02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:43.780
getting some chocolate tea in Australia.
We're going to go England.
So anyways,

1810
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:47.080
well the store ships everywhere.
I looked,

1811
02:00:47.090 --> 02:00:50.080
I are the shipping from the store.
I hate when people,

1812
02:00:50.081 --> 02:00:54.520
I hate when people say like,
Ooh man,
what's up with your shipping?
Yeah,

1813
02:00:54.521 --> 02:00:57.430
I know I don't.
I'd rather you just don't buy it.

1814
02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:02.650
You know you are bike,
whatever.
Wait till we get it to your country.
Yeah,

1815
02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:04.660
we'll have it in your country.
We got in Canada,

1816
02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:08.770
we got it in England and we got an Australia.
Yeah,
Jocko white tea.
Well,

1817
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:13.360
here's the thing that she store can get challenging because we're paying what

1818
02:01:13.361 --> 02:01:15.790
they're kind of charging us for the,
it's like a whole thing.

1819
02:01:15.791 --> 02:01:20.791
Then we're working on just slowly and slowly shipping more and plus the,

1820
02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:24.250
the,
the,
the bigger we get,

1821
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:29.140
we get the economy of scales.
Yes.
And so that's can make stuff cheaper too.

1822
02:01:29.141 --> 02:01:32.800
So I appreciate that supports from why we're on our way because one day you're

1823
02:01:32.801 --> 02:01:36.220
gonna be able to buy Jocko white tea.
Everywhere you go.

1824
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:39.440
It might just be coming out of your drinking fountain to,
he's like,

1825
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:44.420
<v 0>oh yeah,
everyone's getting stronger.
Uh,</v>

1826
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:48.740
Yup.
I wrote some books.
One of them is called the way of the warrior kid.

1827
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:53.540
One of them is a followup of that book series called way of the warrior kid

1828
02:01:53.541 --> 02:01:58.250
marks mission.
Those books will help your kid,
I promise.
How's that?

1829
02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:02.920
Yeah.
Should I do that?
Yeah.
I think I should.
I think I came that yes,

1830
02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:06.050
I've got,
I've not had anyone say,
hey,

1831
02:02:06.051 --> 02:02:10.490
my kid read that book and didn't like it and has now said that they want to get

1832
02:02:10.491 --> 02:02:13.930
weaker.
That is not happening.
This does not help.
Yeah.

1833
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:18.020
So where the word kid books,
get them for whoever,

1834
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:20.300
whenever kid,
you know,

1835
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:23.480
whatever family getting free library get from whoever it's,
it's,
it's like,

1836
02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:27.560
it's like a good way to help man.
It's a good way to help.

1837
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.610
Also got a book called discipline equals freedom field man.

1838
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:34.850
So someone who just wrote on Twitter that that's the best book they've ever
read.

1839
02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.930
I have no frame of reference.
Might be the only book he ever read.

1840
02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:42.980
But I will say this,
the field manual,

1841
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:49.260
if you crack that thing open and you take a little look,
it'll,
it'll reset your,

1842
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:53.810
your,
your compass a little bit.
Really will,
it resets my,

1843
02:02:53.811 --> 02:02:56.380
I wrote the book and I still get my compass reset when I look at it.

1844
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:59.510
So it's a good book too,
to get for people that are sort of like,

1845
02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:04.090
maybe they're a little bit there,
there's somewhere,
right?
Yeah.

1846
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.970
They're not really going in the right direction or they're not going the right

1847
02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:11.060
direction.
As,
as hard as they should be.
Both.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

1848
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:15.380
You're someone that's like completely off the path,
like this slippery slope.

1849
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:18.740
You're in the,
in the,
was that place you called one time?

1850
02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:22.160
Like the weeds?
Yeah,
no,
no.

1851
02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:26.730
It was from a movie that you saw,
which is a lot of movies,

1852
02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:32.290
some place of misery,
swamps and feel sadness there in the swamp.

1853
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:33.890
Maybe some of the sauces or get them to book,

1854
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:35.540
but you get someone that's like not in the swamp,

1855
02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:37.760
but that's actually on the path.
They want to get further on the path,

1856
02:03:37.761 --> 02:03:40.940
get them that book right there.
I really like how you use swamped with sadness.

1857
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:45.440
It makes me feel very easy.
References Vau so that's discipline equals freedom.

1858
02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.220
The field manual.
It's not a normal book.
No,

1859
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:52.970
it's not a normal book.
Extreme ownership.

1860
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:57.680
That's the first book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and that book is about

1861
02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:58.071
leadership.

1862
02:03:58.071 --> 02:04:02.060
It's about the combat leadership principles we learned on the battlefield and

1863
02:04:02.061 --> 02:04:03.860
how you can apply them to everything that you do.

1864
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:06.980
Now we've got to follow up book to that called the dichotomy of leadership.

1865
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:11.720
The follow up book to that is actually chapter 12 of extreme ownership talks

1866
02:04:11.721 --> 02:04:15.590
about the dichotomy of leadership and that's balancing these opposing forces.

1867
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:18.770
And we realized through Asheville in front,

1868
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:23.510
our consulting company that the biggest problem people have is that they have a

1869
02:04:23.511 --> 02:04:25.190
hard time staying balanced as a leader.

1870
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:30.430
So we wrote a whole book about it so that people can dial in and get granular.

1871
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:35.060
And that's the dichotomy of leadership.
We're getting awesome feedback on it.

1872
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:39.750
We're better writers now than we order then.
I mean seriously,

1873
02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:45.020
it's been three years I've been reading and writing up nonstop and so we're

1874
02:04:46.531 --> 02:04:49.800
better.
And so yeah,
that's that.

1875
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.780
That comes out September 25th if you want the first dish,

1876
02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:57.000
you gots to order it now.

1877
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.240
Someone said that they're ordering it now so that they get the first a dish so

1878
02:05:03.241 --> 02:05:05.010
that when they meet me and I sign it,

1879
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:10.500
they're not like holding her head down in shame.
Someone else said,
hey,

1880
02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:15.330
oh I guess I'm a bad guy cause I gave away my first a dish of of extreme

1881
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:20.160
ownership.
You're not a bad guy.
He just made a mistake.
Get somebody else.

1882
02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.710
The third edition,
the fifth,
the dish.
You don't care about that.

1883
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:25.860
There's only one a desk.
You only get one crack at the title or they're very,

1884
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:29.960
very noble.
You me copies of extreme of,
of about face.
I have,
oh,

1885
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:32.610
I'm going to count them.
I don't know,
but I got a lot.
No kidding.

1886
02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:36.810
Always in the hunt for that first to dish,
a couple of them.
Gotcha.

1887
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.420
So anyways,

1888
02:05:39.450 --> 02:05:44.450
that's that also I just mentioned echelon front.

1889
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:49.410
That is our leadership and management consulting company.
It's me,
Leif Babin,

1890
02:05:49.410 --> 02:05:51.720
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran,

1891
02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.100
and also Mike Sorelli who's just on the podcast,
one 34 awesome podcast.

1892
02:05:56.101 --> 02:05:59.130
Awesome to talk to Mike.
Awesome.
Be working with Mike again.

1893
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.830
And what we do is we solve problems through leadership period.
That's what we do.

1894
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:09.840
Musters zero zero six in San Francisco,
California.
October 17th and 18th.

1895
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:16.860
It's gonna sell out.
We're getting close.
But
um,

1896
02:06:17.010 --> 02:06:21.240
yeah,
register and extreme ownership.com.
Every muster we've done has sold out.

1897
02:06:21.241 --> 02:06:24.000
This is the second one.
Also.

1898
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:28.080
This is an important one for current military law enforcement,
border patrol,

1899
02:06:28.081 --> 02:06:30.930
firefighters,
paramedics,
every,
all your first responders out there.

1900
02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:36.720
We've got a one day leadership seminar in Texas,
Dallas,
Texas,

1901
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:41.750
September 21st we did this because we want to do something shorter and focused

1902
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.610
so that more people in uniform could get to it and it's a cheaper price point

1903
02:06:47.611 --> 02:06:51.300
than the muster.
So if you're in one of those types of organizations,

1904
02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:55.890
come to the roll call and it,
but it is a mustard.
It's a mini muster.

1905
02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.150
Would you say?
It's not really a mini muster.
It's a lead.
It's,

1906
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.650
they're both leadership training,
right.

1907
02:07:01.651 --> 02:07:04.110
But this one is completely focused on these dynamic environments,

1908
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:08.130
whereas the musters talking about it talks about a broader leadership
leadership,

1909
02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:11.530
a little bit broader,
not so focused.
I shouldn't say not.
So folks,

1910
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:16.570
it's this one is specific to the dynamic environments and we can focus a little

1911
02:07:17.131 --> 02:07:17.610
bit more on it.

1912
02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:22.610
The challenges are we can address the challenges that those leaders have in

1913
02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:26.450
those dynamic environments as opposed to the muster where we address that one is

1914
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:29.490
definitely the muster is more focused on business leadership.

1915
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.800
Even though we get all types of leaders and we do get military and law

1916
02:07:31.801 --> 02:07:36.040
enforcement there,
it's focused on business more.

1917
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.940
This one we focused and like,
and I just got back,
I mean it's worked with uh,
uh,

1918
02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:44.470
the Arizona highway patrol and just being out there,
you know,
you just,

1919
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:48.340
you hear,
they,
its leadership and the better you are as a leader,

1920
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:49.540
the better your team's going to be,

1921
02:07:49.541 --> 02:07:51.820
the more prepared you're going to be for bad situations.

1922
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:55.420
And we Ashkelon Front does this,
we work with fire departments,

1923
02:07:55.421 --> 02:08:00.280
we work with police departments and we know that not every department can bring

1924
02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:01.870
us in.
So that's why we do this.

1925
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:05.680
Well that's why we decided to do this roll call so people could come to it and

1926
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:08.200
get the training concentrated one day.

1927
02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:12.760
So they were better prepared to do their jobs on the beat,
on the battlefield,

1928
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:15.580
wherever they are.
All right.

1929
02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.480
And lastly we have the Overwatch Efo Overwatch,

1930
02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:24.250
which is where we are connecting special operations.

1931
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.280
That's combat aviation vets with companies that need solid leaders.

1932
02:08:30.970 --> 02:08:31.803
You can go to,

1933
02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:37.260
you have overwatched.com to get in the game on that and if you want to spend

1934
02:08:38.411 --> 02:08:39.790
some time with us virtually

1935
02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:46.060
virtually in the virtual world until we see each other live at the muster in San

1936
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:49.240
Francisco or we see each other live at the roll call in Texas or live at the

1937
02:08:49.241 --> 02:08:54.130
immersion camp in Maine.
Then you can find us on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

1938
02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:58.310
on Instagram and of course on Dat Dat Phase I'll pull

1939
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:05.310
echo is at Echo Charles and I have bat Jocko Willink and as always to those you

1940
02:09:05.411 --> 02:09:09.040
out there in uniform that are protecting us here and abroad.

1941
02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:12.520
That's a military law enforcement,
firefighters,
border patrol,
paramedics,

1942
02:09:12.521 --> 02:09:14.920
other first responders.
Without you,

1943
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:19.750
the world falls apart so thank you for what you do and thanks to everyone for

1944
02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:21.970
listening.
Thanks to everyone for supporting.

1945
02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:25.840
I know that this podcast is not always

1946
02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:31.330
the most uplifting thing to listen to,
but I know it gets heavy.

1947
02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:33.970
I know it gets dark just like life does,

1948
02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:39.790
but I definitely don't want you to dwell in the darkness.
I don't dwell there,

1949
02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:43.120
but as I've said before,

1950
02:09:43.150 --> 02:09:48.150
I do think that we need to know the darkness so that we can steer our lives in

1951
02:09:50.441 --> 02:09:51.700
the right direction,

1952
02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:55.900
away from it toward the good and toward the light.

1953
02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.750
So go out there.

1954
02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:03.600
Don't be judgmental.

1955
02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:08.720
Go out there and fight against the darkness by doing what you should be doing,

1956
02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:13.890
what you know you should be doing by doing good,

1957
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.990
by being good.
And of course by getting after it.

1958
02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:21.600
Until next time,

1959
02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:25.530
this is echo and Jocko out.
