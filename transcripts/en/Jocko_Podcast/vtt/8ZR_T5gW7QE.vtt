00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.050
This is Jocko podcast number one 40 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.050
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.740
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on

4
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.394
you.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.820
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their

6
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:26.240
doubting too.

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.380
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about,

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.720
don't deal in lies or being hated.

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.930
Don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise

10
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.790
if you can dream and not make dreams your master.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.740
If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.250
<v 0>If you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the</v>

14
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:06.110
same.
If you can bear to hear the truth,

15
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:11.111
you've spoken twisted by Knaves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you

16
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:14.780
gave your life to broken

17
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.630
and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.310
If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch

19
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:33.281
and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word

20
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.870
about your loss.

21
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after

22
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.164
they are gone.

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
And so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them,

24
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.030
hold on.

25
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.530
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings nor lose the

26
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.820
common touch.

27
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.090
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you if all men count with you.

28
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.500
But none too much.

29
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.590
<v 0>If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run,</v>

31
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.940
yours is the earth and everything that's in it and which is more,

32
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.330
you'll be a man.
My son.

33
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.180
<v 1>Yeah,
and</v>

34
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.180
<v 0>that of course is the classic poem,</v>

35
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180
which is called if it's by Rudyard Kipling and of course we have covered some of

36
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.060
his less,

37
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.300
I guess famous has less famous poems on this podcast.

38
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.520
We covered infantry columns,

39
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.430
which a lot of people don't know the name,
infantry columns,
but that's the,

40
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.680
the the poem that talks about boots,
boots,
boots,

41
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.000
moving up and down.
Yeah,
that one we read the young British soldier,

42
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.650
which is about Afghanistan.
We wrote,

43
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.651
we read a bit of Tommy and of course Kipling was an incredible writer and he

44
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:32.440
talked a lot about war,
talked a lot about being a man and his own son.

45
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.090
His one son,
John,

46
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.320
was killed in world war one at the battle of Loos and

47
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.470
these are great poems and I recently read a poem called a mental cases by

48
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:56.680
Wilfred Owen.
And when we got done with that podcast,
I actually said,

49
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:59.800
I should have read it again.
Then I did and I said,
hey,

50
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.330
go back to the beginning and listened to it again,

51
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.410
but I should have actually picked it apart a little bit because it's kind of

52
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.910
like what I said about Shakespeare when we did Henry the fifth and I said,

53
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.790
you can't get frustrated with Shakespeare.

54
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.040
You can't think that you're just going to read Shakespeare and just get it.

55
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.390
It just doesn't,
it doesn't work that way.
There's more to it than that.

56
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.850
There's more depth there.
There's words you might not know.

57
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.430
There's references that might not be obvious.
There's,
it's,

58
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.940
it's the same thing when you look at poems like this,

59
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:32.941
there's more to them than you can get with just like reading it,

60
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.320
right.
There's,
there's layers lose what we're talking about.

61
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.910
So the,
the poem that I just read,
if is,

62
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.280
like I said,
it's a classic,
it's read often it should be red.
But there's,

63
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.160
and best part of the reason why I didn't cover it for a long time cause I kind

64
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:56.440
of thought everyone just knew it.
Not everyone ral yeah,
everyone knows that.

65
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.690
Everyone knows that poem.
Everyone's read that poem.
But it's actually not true.

66
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.410
And talk to a lot of people.
And I tell,
yeah,
it's like leaf and they say,

67
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.244
Oh what's that?

68
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.500
So in order to sort of solve that problem we covered on the podcast and now

69
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.890
people will hear this poem and learn from it.

70
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.990
And I want to spend a little bit of time breaking it down cause there's all

71
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:21.991
kinds of important lessons in it that are really solid,

72
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.700
really solid guidance.

73
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.920
And then when we understand it,

74
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:31.030
then I'll go back and read it again.

75
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.380
The way it's supposed to hit you when you know what's going on.

76
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.540
So breaking it down a little bit.
There's an end,

77
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.020
there's themes in this that we've heard I've talked about,

78
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.650
and they're just consistent through time.

79
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.020
So here it starts off.

80
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:53.350
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on

81
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.830
you,
there's this one's pretty self explanatory.
Keep your head,

82
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:57.890
don't lose your temper,

83
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.160
stifle your emotions as I want.

84
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:04.700
Sat on his podcast and it's saying,

85
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.260
especially when everyone else around you is not only losing their temper,

86
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.310
but on top of that,
they're blaming you.
Hmm.

87
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.090
This is a little bit of ownership here.

88
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:16.490
This is a little bit of extreme ownership and I've talked about that.

89
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.120
When someone blames you for something,
you know what you do,
what you say.
Yeah,

90
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:24.470
you're right.
It is my fault.
This is what I'm going to do to fix it.
You pathetic.

91
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.100
You don't say that part.
You keep that to yourself.
When,

92
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.510
when there's a problem and people I blame you,
don't under you own it,
own it.

93
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.110
And don't lose your temper.
Stifle your motions.
Next line,

94
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.680
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

95
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.540
but make allowance for their doubting too.
There's a little dichotomy here,
right?

96
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.110
So you gotta be confident,
of course,
right?
Trust yourself.

97
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:49.490
That's what it means to believe in yourself.

98
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.070
Even when other people are doubting you.

99
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.470
You got to trust that you're doing the right thing.

100
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.490
You've got to trust that you're capable.

101
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.440
You got to trust that you can make this happen.

102
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.770
That's what it means to trust yourself when all men value.

103
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.630
But there's a dichotomy here and this is so important cause that,
cause what?

104
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.150
That means,
what that one line alone could lead to is a,
Hey,

105
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.180
I'm just gonna be overconfident,
right?
I'm confident.
Hey,
I'm right.

106
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.690
Everyone else is wrong.
You don't get it.
That's not what's being said here.

107
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:18.560
Cause there's a,
but that's the dichotomy part.
The,

108
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.360
but is a dichotomy partner because while you got to believe in yourself,

109
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.194
yes,

110
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.210
and at the same time you also have to make allowance for their doubts.

111
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:32.660
That means you have to understand that you might have some issues,

112
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.750
you might not be perfect,
you might be wrong.

113
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.840
You might not be as smart or as talented or as squared away as you think you

114
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:45.590
are.
And your idea that you came up with might not be the best one.

115
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.170
So yes,
you've got to have confidence.
Even when people are down and you booked,

116
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:53.450
you kind of remember that they could be down in you for a good reason.

117
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.800
You could be wrong.
You should always have that in the back of your head.

118
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.360
That's the dichotomy.
Humble,
confident,
but humble.

119
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.000
That's what we're talking about.
Next line,

120
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.910
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting

121
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.520
patients,
it's about patients.

122
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.740
I think I've told this,

123
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.990
if I told the story about being on a ship and waiting for Chow,

124
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.860
not that I can remember.
Okay.

125
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:27.861
So I was on my first deployment as a seal on a ship in the navy were overseas

126
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:35.150
where we're spending a lot of time at sea and to eat food,

127
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.610
which was,
I'm not going to say it was scarce,

128
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.220
but they feed you three times a day and,
and all that type of ship.

129
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.200
I was on an amphibious ship.
There's uh,
several hundred marines on board.

130
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.490
Obviously there's the sailors that run the ship,
their seals.
We're,
you know,

131
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.920
an 18 man seal platoon on there,
but everyone's gotta be fed.

132
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.390
What does child time and so everyone would go line up for chow.

133
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.540
You get in line in the line would be long and depending on how hungry you are,

134
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:07.500
maybe you want to get up there a little early anyways to make a long story short

135
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.040
so we get in line and whatever,

136
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.060
whatever reason they got this rule that you're not allowed to lean on the

137
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:19.320
bulkhead.
The bulkhead is in a plane.
I do,
you know,
playing,
what is it?

138
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.980
That front part,
yeah,
that's a fun on,

139
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.980
it's a wall basically on a ship or an aircraft.
It's a wall to bulkhead.

140
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.750
So for whatever reason in the navy is standing in the chow line,

141
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.380
you're not supposed to lean on the bulkhead.
So imagine this,

142
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.500
you're going to be standing there for your standing three inches from a wall,

143
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.970
but you're not supposed to lean on it.
Yeah.
Now this isn't a three minute stand.

144
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.320
This is half an hour.

145
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.860
This is 40 minutes waiting for the chow to open up and then serve everybody.

146
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.910
And I remember I learned something about patients because then you get these

147
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.020
guys that

148
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.820
you know the people that they have a little bit of authority and they're going

149
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:04.560
to use it and if given the opportunity they will abuse it,

150
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.790
they're going to take it to the next level.
So there'd be some guys,

151
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.803
not all of them.

152
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.800
I was always my goal to make friends with anybody that had anything to do with

153
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.660
feeding us on a ship.
I wanted to be there bro.

154
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.020
Because then you get in a couple of extra chicken nuggets,
you know,

155
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.040
so you get an extra scoop full of Ravioli,
which is,
which is,

156
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.130
which is important,
important,
big time.

157
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.350
Especially when you're trying to pack on the mass.
Right.

158
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.230
So I tried to be friends with all those people,
but some of those guys,

159
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.860
they didn't care about friends.
Right.
They had that authority.
And one,

160
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.610
there's one guy,
I remember he had the authority,
it was,

161
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:41.460
he was in charge of making sure that line was,
you know,

162
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.830
maintained discipline in the line.
That was his deal.

163
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.600
He has a badge of some kind.
I want to say he was a master at arms,
which is a,
uh,

164
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.340
a job in the navy.
I think he,

165
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:56.970
this guy was actually a master at arms [inaudible] we had some kind of badge.

166
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.410
Right?
So that takes that authority attitude up.
One maybe two notches.

167
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.510
He's coming at you.
So,

168
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:10.130
so I'm standing in line one day and I'm leaning on the bulkhead.

169
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.060
Am I being a little bit lazy?
Sure.
Um,
I'm telling you,
it's a long deployment,

170
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.320
right?
I've laid it on the bolt kit.
He comes over.
Hey,
no leaning on the bulkhead.

171
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.480
Hmm.
You know what I did?
What?
Got Off the bulkhead?
I just stood up straight,

172
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.660
didn't get mad,
didn't get angry.
He's doing his job.

173
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.690
Not supposed to leave on the bulkhead.
Just normal face.

174
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.990
Was I a broken man?
Once I broken Matt did my,
did my will break.

175
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.750
I don't think so.
What I did was I accepted.

176
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.520
I was able to wait and not be tired by waiting.

177
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.100
So be patient.
This,
this,

178
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:51.600
the moral of that line will technically you weren't able to eat without getting

179
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:54.910
tired cause he leaned on the bulkhead.
Right?
You got corrected,

180
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.210
corrected and then I got an tired.

181
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.270
All right.
Next line or being lied about.
Don't deal in lies.

182
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.780
People are going to lie about you.
Tell the truth.

183
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.300
Tell the truth about what's going on.
Getting caught in the web of lies.

184
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.860
Not Fun.
No,
not fun.
Then you see,
she had happened with people.

185
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.641
I'm trying to think.

186
00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:22.530
Do you remember when you're a little kid and you'd think you'd get away with

187
00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:27.330
some little web of lies?
Oh yeah.
Like or you see your kids do it.
Yeah.

188
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.470
They just tell a little lie about something and the web encapsulates him.

189
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.190
But adults do that too.
You know?
Let me see that happen.

190
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.060
You see that happen with uh,
in politics?
Yeah.
You know,
I never did this.

191
00:12:39.061 --> 00:12:41.550
You know what I mean?
And then they have video,
they have audio,

192
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.090
and it's just if that person would have said,
hey,
this is what I did,

193
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.390
this is what I did.
I'm sorry.
It's a bad mistake.
I,

194
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.680
I throw myself to the judgment of the people.
Right.
Okay,
fair enough.
Yeah.

195
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.870
But instead they make up some lie about,
I'm trying to remember,
I mean,

196
00:12:57.871 --> 00:13:00.810
I've never seen that woman before in my life.
Oh really?

197
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.220
We have a video of you apparently quite acquainted with as a woman or whatever.

198
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.800
So yeah,
don't get into the web of lies.

199
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.850
It is not going to help you next line or being hated.

200
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.250
Don't give way to hating.

201
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.940
Now what's interesting about this is we actually have a name for these people

202
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:24.510
now.
Right?
Haters.
Right.

203
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.310
That's a new word.

204
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.190
I don't think there was such a thing as haters when I was a kid.

205
00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:32.700
There was no such thing as haters.
Yeah.
Was someone that didn't like you,

206
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:36.210
you wouldn't say that's person's a hater.
Yeah.
No,
it wasn't a thing.
Well,

207
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:39.990
there's the added,
like sprinkled in element.
When you say hate hater haters,

208
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.060
typically it's like someone that hates everybody.

209
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.940
Know someone who hates everything.
No.

210
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.880
It's when there's an element of jealousy in there.
That's what,

211
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.510
that's what a hater.
Okay.
So I actually nailed this then.
I actually,

212
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.670
so as I was thinking about this,
that's kind of what I thought.

213
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.090
Some people aren't gonna like you for whatever reason,

214
00:13:57.091 --> 00:14:01.500
but oftentimes the reason isn't you.
It's actually them.

215
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:07.290
Yeah.
That's,
it hits them.
It's there.
They hate your success.

216
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.820
They hate your happiness.
They hate their day,

217
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.580
hate the fact that you've got whatever it is that they want.

218
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.290
Right.
That's jealousy.
So yeah,
some people are going to get,

219
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.180
you know,
if they're going to be haters.
Yeah.

220
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.440
And so the recommendation here is don't,
don't,

221
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.370
don't,
don't give it back to him.
Yeah.

222
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:30.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.270
<v 0>There's a,
you ever heard that the opposite of love isn't hate.</v>

224
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:37.810
The opposite of love is indifference.
Yeah.
So the opposite of hate,

225
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.950
it's indifference to,
right.
Yeah.
Whatever.

226
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.390
That's sort of my recommended recommended course of action.

227
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.470
Someone that hates the fact that you're winning.
I kind of feel sorry for him.

228
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:52.304
Right.

229
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.010
<v 2>But yeah,
everyone kind of in the past that I guess,
yeah,</v>

230
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.100
if you get by the emotional part when someone's hating on you,

231
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.880
um,
yeah,
you do kind of fee.
I mean you can,
depends on who you are I guess.

232
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:11.870
But you can kind of feel sorry for him cause it's like,
it's kind of a lonely,

233
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.460
like actually I think,
I think when I say I feel sorry for him,

234
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.050
I think that's almost like a little bit of a,

235
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.260
that's a little bit of ego of mine to have like a little dig.
Like,

236
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.090
like I feel sorry for that defense mechanism of my own.
I think,

237
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.760
you know what I mean?
It's kind of a,
it's kind of a back,

238
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.310
it's a backhanded insult.
You don't,
Oh,
oh,
you know,
Echo said this about you.

239
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.880
You know,
I actually feel sorry for him.
It's almost like that guy is so low.

240
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.590
So there's,
I think there's a little bit of ego there,

241
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.480
but from the airport when I say something like that,

242
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.900
so that's why I think in differences might maybe the better step.
Like,
Hey,

243
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:47.620
whatever,
man,
hey,
some people are going to like me,
some people on this,

244
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.930
I'm good with it.
Or bring it on over here.
Work to do.

245
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.970
There's a culture of embracing that to,
you know,
help people be like,
hey,

246
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.220
if you're,
if you don't have haters,
you're doing something wrong,

247
00:15:55.221 --> 00:16:00.200
or something like that.
Like don't say that kind of stuff
to me.

248
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.900
You know how you talk about how someone says,
Hey,
that's just the way I am.

249
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:07.090
That's my personality.
To me,
that is brushing up against it.
Right?

250
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.350
Some people,
groups,
when people gonna hate me,
that's the way it is.
It's like,
no,

251
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:16.400
actually,
yeah.
Let's think about at least let's account for it a little bit.

252
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.640
Let's,
let's figure out maybe why.
Yeah,
yeah.

253
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.370
Actually sometimes,
I mean,

254
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.760
this is kind of a smaller deal than even warrants me talking about it,

255
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:29.420
but something tells me you're going to do it anyway anyway.
I mean,

256
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:33.800
in the spirit of trying to understand the nature of haters,

257
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.270
and we're actually talking on a podcast right now about the nature of haters.

258
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.460
Well,
some would say,
hey,
if you don't have haters,
you're doing something wrong.

259
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:47.540
Meaning you're not doing something big enough for the jealous people in the

260
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.480
world to be jealous.
This is a whole,

261
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.820
this is a whole area that we just don't want it.
Right.
I mean seriously.
Right.

262
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.010
This is like,
it's true.
This is like the area that we're just not that,

263
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.640
that's why I think that's what's good.
What the statement here.
Don't being hated.

264
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:09.590
Don't give way to hating.
Move on.
Let's not worry about it.
Yeah.

265
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.780
And next line,
cause that's analyze it

266
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.890
all right next and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.

267
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.390
Don't look too good nor talk too wise.

268
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.620
So this is,

269
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:27.290
this is important because this is a little bit of a dichotomy too of hey,

270
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:29.540
don't give way to hating,
don't deal in lies,

271
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.920
but at the same time saying don't look too good or talk too.
Why?
So

272
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.190
you gotta keep it real basically.
And you don't want to be a know it all.

273
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.900
You don't want to talk down to people.
You don't want to be the,
the,

274
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.850
the person that comes across like,
oh,
I would,
um,
virtuous,

275
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:49.620
I'm more virtuous than you.
That's what that line is,
right.

276
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.090
Don't try and look too good.
Like,
you would never do anything wrong.
It's like,
oh,

277
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:57.600
that guy got in trouble.
That guy got caught in a web of lies instead of,

278
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.570
you know,
jump.
It's like,
okay,
you know what?
He made a mistake.
Hope.

279
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.760
Good luck to him.
I hope he can figure it out.
It'll be,

280
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:07.761
finds the right path out of his situation instead of talking like,

281
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.820
Oh,
I'm,
I,
that would never happen to me because I am virtuous.
Yeah.

282
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.580
Or talk too wise,
which is,
you know,
I know everything,
right?
Yeah.

283
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.270
I think that's,
yeah.
People that are trying to come across,

284
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.050
you know what?

285
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:30.050
Remember when we were on with Captain Charlie Plumb and Jim Kunkel and they were

286
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:34.820
trying to drag me into the being like them.
They're,

287
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.590
you know,
they're like,
hey,
you know what?
We're warrior warriors like you,
Jocko.

288
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.680
And I was like,
no,
guys don't know.

289
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.610
You guys are totally like,
not just,

290
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:47.460
not just like more heroic than me,

291
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.890
but on top of that better people.

292
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.350
Like I'm like a rat running around compared to those guys and,

293
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.190
and so,
yeah,
I'm not ever trying to be,

294
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.000
you know,
a guy that's saying,
oh yeah,
well I'm,
I'm,
I'm virtuous in year,
not,

295
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.700
no.
Hey Man,
we're all struggling.
Yeah.

296
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.070
Could this mean to,
you know,

297
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.960
it don't look too good nor to Wa like,
um,
you know how,
okay,

298
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:19.140
this is the concept where you don't want people make speeches or they'll sit,

299
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:23.250
they'll have some sales pitch or something and they'll want every word to be

300
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.720
perfect.
But then when a,
when a sales pitch is like super perfect,

301
00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:31.290
it doesn't connect as well as if it's just a person talking normal to you.

302
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.550
You know what I'm saying?
And all this,
uh,
just that idea,
you know,
like,

303
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:39.450
so if someone's focusing so hard and being like perfect in every way and like

304
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.350
knowing every single possible thing and just not showing any flaws,

305
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:44.490
like focusing on it,

306
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.880
maybe that's a mistake because they kind of created a disconnect.
I actually,

307
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.000
I don't think that's what this is talking about,
but I think it is correct.

308
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.520
So I'm going to give you an example from my perspective.

309
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.560
One of the reasons that podcasts right now do really well is because they're

310
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:03.360
normal people talking like normal people.
And I think that if,
if pot,

311
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.420
and there are podcasts out there that are way polished and everything,

312
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.110
and I don't like to listen to those podcasts that are all polished,
right.

313
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.190
I don't,
there's very few actually,
I can't think of any,

314
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.890
any of the podcasts that I actually like our,
the,

315
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:21.030
our polished to that nth degree.
Right.
Cause that's when you're talking about,

316
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.550
you know,
a highly produced with the background music and the,
all that stuff,

317
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.800
like those podcasts,
I don't,
I don't like those as much.
Yeah.
I like those.

318
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.920
But,
and even when you talk about the produced pocket,
like hardcore history,

319
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.940
he's still talking.
He know he's,
he's still talking.
I mean obviously Joe Rogan,

320
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.220
obviously Tim Ferris,
even martyrmade,
right.
Martyrmade he's,

321
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.040
he's,
he's talking,
right.
He's not just making things happen.
So

322
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.290
<v 0>I think there's something to that.</v>

323
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.920
There's something to the fact that we're not talking about doing everything

324
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:58.160
perfect.
For sure.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

325
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.840
Agree.
Yeah.
I think if if this podcast,
well this podcast would be sound like,

326
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.950
it'd be like welcome to welcome to the Jocko podcast.

327
00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:11.480
This is episode 140 we're here to talk to you today about,
or Richard Kipling.

328
00:21:11.481 --> 00:21:16.100
He was born in pop by and just one of those who wants to listen to that.
Yeah,

329
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.940
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
If it sounds like,
well,
cause,

330
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.140
because I think anyway,
and it has a lot to do with like what you're used to,

331
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.650
you know,

332
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.550
where like if you're used to like a polished presentation and then all of a

333
00:21:28.551 --> 00:21:31.520
sudden it's not polished,
it's like,
oh,
he kind of fumbled through that.
Well,

334
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.330
there's a difference between not polished and I've also heard podcasts that are

335
00:21:35.331 --> 00:21:39.980
not prepared or not professional.
Right.
That's another,
the other end of spectrum.

336
00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:42.740
And you can,
there's a dichotomy because you can go too far.

337
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.950
Sometimes I think people just,
they think,
well Joe Rogan,

338
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.170
he just presses record and talks.
Yeah.

339
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.780
And they think that that's just what that is.
Oh,
I can do that.

340
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.140
I'll just press record and I'll talk with this other guy.
And then you,

341
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.800
then you listen to them and you think there's a reason why Joe Rogan is so

342
00:21:57.801 --> 00:21:58.760
popular?
Yes sir.

343
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.180
The reason that Joe Rogan so popular is because even when he's just conversing,

344
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.680
he's got a skillset that he was probably born with and then he honed it as a

345
00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:09.290
comedian and then he honed it as an actor.
Then he owned it as a,

346
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.570
as an announcer for the UFC.

347
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.450
And then he started this podcast and so he was already good at it.

348
00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:19.250
And then he's done 1500 pound casts that are two,
three and four hours long.

349
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.820
So guess what?
You get good at figuring out.
You listened to yourself and go,
oh,

350
00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:26.210
that didn't sound good.
And so,
so there's a big difference.
Yes,

351
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.700
there's podcasts that people just think they're going to hit record and just

352
00:22:28.701 --> 00:22:33.200
talk and then it's going to be super cool dichotomy,
not cool.

353
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.150
It's hard to listen to.
Some of those are hard to listen to.

354
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.280
Got To gut through them.
So check.
All right,

355
00:22:43.281 --> 00:22:44.114
next line.

356
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.500
If you can dream and not make dreams your master,

357
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.793
<v 1>that one's</v>

358
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.190
<v 0>pretty pretty.
That's a pretty awesome line,
right?
That's a pretty awesome line.</v>

359
00:22:55.191 --> 00:22:58.220
And there's,
it's a dichotomy.
Yes.
Dream,
but don't make them your master.

360
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.800
Don't make dreams your living reality,
right?
Live in reality,

361
00:23:03.801 --> 00:23:06.500
not in the world to dreams.
If your dreams are your master,

362
00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:09.460
what are you actually doing?
Daydreaming,
daydream,

363
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:13.790
and all day you gotta make something happen.
That's what's got to go down next.

364
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.820
Very similar if you can think and not make thoughts,

365
00:23:19.161 --> 00:23:22.580
your aim.
So yes,
of course thing.

366
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.350
<v 1>Okay?</v>

367
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.770
<v 0>But don't make your goal to sit around and think,</v>

368
00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:31.840
and I think in my mind when I hear this and maybe I'm my own personal biases

369
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.570
coming into it,

370
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:37.570
this seems like a little shot at philosophers and academics,

371
00:23:38.301 --> 00:23:38.541
right?

372
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:42.140
That sit around all day and what they're doing is they're thinking that's what

373
00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:44.990
they do.
A little shot at those

374
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.240
<v 2>cause don't make thoughts your aim.
You want to actually go and do things.</v>

375
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:53.840
You want to make things happen.
You want to live.
Hmm.
There's a difference there.

376
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.780
Yeah.
And that's actually,

377
00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:01.781
that's like a cause you know how like I feel like you're kind of the example of

378
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:05.810
that.
Like when I start saying eat,
whether it be on this thing or,

379
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.830
or even in real life where I'll start explaining something cause I'll be super

380
00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:12.900
interested in like how this thing works and hey,
did you see what happened?

381
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.390
Explain it.
And then your attitude is always been like,
yeah,
okay.
Like,
okay,

382
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.450
give me an example.
Who um,
what do you mean by real life?

383
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.280
The outside of recording all like analyze.
Like if someone's,

384
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:27.880
like if I were to talk about haters,
like I could analyze that.

385
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.170
Like it's a separate podcast,

386
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.380
Charles podcasts of like,

387
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.150
you know what people have dynamics of haters to episode one.

388
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.860
How people might be a whole series bro maybe.
But you'll be like,

389
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.640
all right,
you know,
okay,
we understand is you,
you do it for more like,
hey,

390
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:49.980
we're going to understand so we can take action or you know,
whatever.
I'll,

391
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.940
I'll just explain the understanding because it's fun to explain the

392
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:54.020
understanding and see what I'm saying.

393
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:58.460
I'm looking for application of that knowledge to usually leadership situations.

394
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.580
Yes.
Yes,
exactly.
Right.
And then you'll,
it seems like,

395
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:05.660
like you'll dig into like understanding it like as deep as you have to take

396
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:09.650
action and that's it.
No deeper,
Yo,
I'm not going to sit around and meditate.

397
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:14.160
That's what it seems like you're trying to avoid.
Yeah.
And also I think that the,

398
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.470
the understanding of the broad concept is more important than the then the

399
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.230
minutiae.
Yeah.
You got to understand the details.
Yes.

400
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:24.200
But you won't understand the broad concept and then you can move forward and you

401
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:28.460
know what you're dealing with.
Yeah.
And then an academic type,
as we,

402
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.170
as the example,
as your example talks about,
like they'll,

403
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:38.040
they're kind of goal is,
is the thought has to analyzing it.

404
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.950
We'll see how this works.
And that's the whole goal.

405
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:43.070
Their goal is never really to take action.
Someone else can take action,

406
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.870
but there their goal is the thought of it.
That's what it seems.

407
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.320
I think that's one thing that Dan Carlin from hardcore history does is he,

408
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.870
so he like a lot of times I'm comparing what I'm reading about in his historical

409
00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:01.871
situations to what I've either been through myself or,

410
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.130
or other books that I've read,

411
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.880
other situations I know about Dan Carlin does one book to another book or one

412
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:15.170
time to another time.
But then the other thing that he does is he takes it to us.

413
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.110
Like he'll,
he'll say,
imagine if you were,

414
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.070
imagine if America right now elected a person to keep,

415
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.570
so he brings it into like real time.
Yeah.
That's his,
that's his,
to me,

416
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:27.404
that's what makes,

417
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.560
that's part of what makes as long things that make his podcast excellent.

418
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.830
But that's one of the things that makes it very engaging as he brings it to

419
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.860
imagine if this happened today,

420
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.940
imagine if the Germans attacked,
you know,
he just brings it to today.

421
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:44.190
So it makes you think about it.
Andy compares it to other time periods.

422
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.630
So there's some similarities there,
but his thoughts aren't as ames.
Yeah,

423
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.490
I don't think.
Yeah.
And I wouldn't even,
well I think,

424
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.920
I think when I just said that I think he takes the thoughts and applies them to

425
00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.420
current times.
Right.
That's what makes it interesting.
Or one of,
again,

426
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.910
one of the things that makes an interesting.
Yeah.

427
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:07.320
And I wouldn't even say be the thoughts being your aims is necessarily a bad

428
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:11.520
thing across the board.
Um,
I think,
you know,
obviously his approach it is,

429
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:12.780
but you know,

430
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.520
you know the person who's just kind of get the huge payoff in figuring out how

431
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:22.230
things work.
And that's Sorta it,
you know,
like kind of like,
hey,

432
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:24.900
if I,
I'm a,
you know,
I'm going to figure out how this,

433
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:26.430
I don't know this engine motor works,

434
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.380
it's up to the engine builder to build more engines or to build a better and

435
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.280
yeah,
they're just really interested in how things work,
you know?
Yeah.

436
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.470
Is it possible to be super,

437
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.130
you don't like people that want to understand Jujitsu,

438
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:45.000
but they don't want to do it?
The moves,
but they don't want to roll.
We'll there.

439
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:49.020
Is that for sure?
Oh yeah.
Is that,
and I mean depending on who you are,

440
00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:53.910
obviously that philosophy won't kind of Jive with you with your whole thing.
Um,

441
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.290
but yeah,
I could see how that could be if someone's like,
yeah.
Like I don't know,

442
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.490
someone who's not into necessarily the physical part of it is much as the mental

443
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:04.250
part in maybe like the watch it.

444
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.760
And I suppose some guys that can't train hard anymore because of whatever they

445
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:12.150
got injured or whatever and they still are into it.
Well yeah.

446
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.030
Or these coaches that like maybe weren't getting good at something,

447
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:15.841
but they like,

448
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:18.780
they know then they're like the best coach and you know that kind of person.

449
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.140
Yeah.
John Danaher,
he doesn't have any world championships under his belt,

450
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.660
I don't think.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
But they would group Greg Jackson.

451
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.200
I don't think Greg Jackson,
you get Greg Jackson's never even fought MMA,

452
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:33.180
I don't think.
Not one time.
Yeah.
One of the best coaches,
coaches ever.
So yeah.

453
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.570
So you get that kind of person,
but would it be saying that he made his thoughts,

454
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:40.950
his aims?
No,
cause he put those,
he,
he applied them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well then again,

455
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.950
swinging a mess as academics though.
See what I'm saying?

456
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.870
Likely an academic type person,

457
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:48.900
maybe they're a professor or something they teach about business or sales.

458
00:28:48.901 --> 00:28:51.900
They don't own a business,
their professor,
but they teach about business,

459
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:54.690
all this stuff.
So that's kind of,
it's kind of their,
their thoughts are,

460
00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:57.020
their aims is kind of like that's their action.
That's,

461
00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.870
that's they're putting their thoughts into action and if that's less of a shot

462
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:06.230
than maybe I read it as originally philosophers now.
All right,

463
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.960
well I think you're right.
I think you're right.
All right.
Next.

464
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:15.170
If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the

465
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:17.040
same,
what align that is

466
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.250
triumph and disasters and he calls them both imposters.

467
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.930
He calls both triumph and disaster calls them both imposters.

468
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.620
Why is that?
Because they are.
Because they are,

469
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.800
because neither triumph or disaster is an end all or be all neither of them.

470
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.040
They feel like it at the time.
When did you raise

471
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.960
<v 0>your hands and you get the victory?</v>

472
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.940
You feel like that is a be all end all.

473
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:53.630
But as patents said,
all glory is fleeting,
right.

474
00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.670
That triumph is gonna fade.
Triumph is an eternal victory.

475
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:01.340
It's an imposter of one.
And this is what's important.
Does that,

476
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.120
and this is the one that's harder for people to overcome,

477
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.560
is that disasters the same way.

478
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.260
Some things happen to us and it seems like it's the end of the world.
Yeah.

479
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

480
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.600
<v 0>But it's not,
disaster is also an imposter.</v>

481
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.090
This how you know what if this happens to,

482
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.020
this happens to teenage kids in their little relationships,

483
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.870
right?
Right.
Yeah.

484
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.240
Teenage kids and their love and the relationships.

485
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.800
They break off and they think it's the end of the world.

486
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.560
And if they only knew that in three years,

487
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:37.750
they wouldn't even remember that person's name.

488
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.860
You wouldn't even remember that person's name.
But you could never tell him that.

489
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.820
No,
you can't ever do.
Could you like that?

490
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.080
You couldn't convince them in a million years that,
that,

491
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:51.280
that in three years they will not remember that person's name?
No,

492
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.520
not even close.
Not even close.
You Care Doc.
Is it the mind?
The crazy thing,

493
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.700
you would have both know this factually.
Yeah.

494
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.380
The girlfriend that you had when you were 14 years old at that time,

495
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.640
there was no way that you were ever going to think about another girl.

496
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.840
That was the warning.
You don't eat right now.
You don't know what her name was.

497
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.200
You barely remember what she looks like.
Come on.
Yeah,

498
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.100
but that's what he's saying.
Yeah.

499
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.530
That when that girl breaks up with your guy,
if you're a,

500
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:23.020
if you're a girl and that good guy that broke your heart,

501
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:27.790
you're not even gonna remember this
and you know what he's doing now.
Not much.

502
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.800
Not much.
Don't worry about that dude.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Yeah,

503
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:35.830
I guess that's a good point.
Maybe me.
Maybe it doesn't go

504
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.860
well.
It's the light point.
Most likely.
Yeah.

505
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.490
These disasters that you have and then you know UTC,
that's an easy one.

506
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.050
But you know your business has a big issue.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's going to man this.

507
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.120
Within six months of opening victory MMA,
the roof collapsed.

508
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:59.800
You remember that the drunk driver hit a fire hydrant out in front of the

509
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.723
building.

510
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.470
The fire hydrant actually broke off and the pipes just started squirting.

511
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.630
I mean how big around is up is a fire hydrant.

512
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.740
It's up eight 12 inches of water or something.

513
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.540
Oh what 12 inch waterline started spraying up and onto the top roof of the

514
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:20.500
building,
which is no big deal cause you know roofs are meant to take water.

515
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.260
Well what happened was the little drains cause it's a flat roof,

516
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:27.370
the little drains up there since it doesn't rain a lot in California they had

517
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:31.240
debris and they filled up the drains filled up and then the next thing you
don't,

518
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.390
the roof just filled with water inside the parapet wall and the roof collapsed.

519
00:32:35.391 --> 00:32:37.300
That was in the six months of opening up.

520
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.480
I think we had just started making money.
Boom.
We got no,

521
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:46.480
we got half the building is gone.
The air conditioners from the second floor,

522
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.210
from the roof,

523
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.050
or on the bottom floor of the building in the mixed martial arts area that I

524
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.670
knew it was bad,
but you don't want to seem like a big disaster.
Guess what?

525
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.790
Get it.
Get it taken care of.
It's like,
move on.
Guess what?

526
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:01.450
The gym still 10 years old.
Still going strong.
Yeah.

527
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.750
So these bad things are gonna happen.
These disasters are going to happen,

528
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.460
but they're not permanent.
They're not the be all end all.

529
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.450
They're not the end of the world.

530
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.530
And the victories that triumphs are the same thing.
They're not going to last.

531
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.010
Don't rest on your laurels.
Stay centered.

532
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.410
Stay balanced.
It's the,
did you guys end up clearing out the drains are or what?

533
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.840
The drains.
Yeah,
we cleared them out.

534
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.020
Could I do a day late and a dollar short next?

535
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.650
If you can bear to hear the truth.

536
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:37.790
You've spoken twisted by Knaves to make a trap for fools.

537
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.730
So you're go out and you tell the truth.
Right?

538
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.120
And then the truth that you tell it gets

539
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.440
twisted around by some

540
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.710
nave,
which is an unscrupulous purse.
It's a to z dishonest first,
right?

541
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.720
Let's bring that word back.
It's bringing it,

542
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.330
they're going to twist your words and you're going to have to bear it.

543
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.930
And the reason that,
this is what I think is interesting,

544
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.600
the reason that you have to bear it is because if you get drawn into it,

545
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:09.560
it's a trap.

546
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.990
It's a trap that you're going to get drawn into if you start dealing with what

547
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.420
if you start going in and trying to,

548
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.830
trying to untwist this,

549
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.290
this lies that have been told about you and to trap.
That's what he's saying.
Hmm.

550
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.700
You,
it's almost like a battle you can't win.

551
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:30.800
And by entering the battlefield you're going to get one.

552
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.660
<v 2>Yeah.
So what is this like some,</v>

553
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:38.650
you know how like someone will say something Outta now and it'll like involve

554
00:34:38.651 --> 00:34:43.330
race won't be racist but like involve race because that's how the explanation

555
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.540
pans out,
you know,
on TV or something.

556
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.970
And then someone else will come in and go,
oh my gosh,

557
00:34:48.971 --> 00:34:51.940
this person's racist because look what he said.
And maybe they'll play like,

558
00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:52.151
you know,

559
00:34:52.151 --> 00:34:55.390
the end part of the tape only or the beginning only or something like that.

560
00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.670
And then they'll,
someone else will be like,
hey,
you know this interview,
uh,

561
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.280
you know,
they'll ask this question,
hey did you say this?
And they'll be like,

562
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.010
well yeah,
I said that.
Oh it's,
and then someone else will come and be like,
look,

563
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:09.280
he even admitted he said this thing.
But then you know,

564
00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:12.040
and then so that it just keeps getting twisted and twisted and twisted.

565
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.040
It's like that.
And then the more you explain it,
the mornings or,
wait,
wait,

566
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:17.020
you're saying you didn't say this and when no idea.
Okay,

567
00:35:17.021 --> 00:35:19.050
well you did or you didn't kind of,
you know,
it's like that.

568
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.210
<v 0>I think that's definitely part of it.
And probably
that's it.
I mean that,</v>

569
00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:26.210
that's it.
When you go and try and unwind these things,

570
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.670
you're probably going to dig yourself a bigger hole.
I think that's the,

571
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.010
the overall,
yeah.
Yeah.
Could now,

572
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.360
are there times where people say something that's so horrible against you that

573
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:39.240
you have to defend yourself?
Sure.
That can happen.
I think when you do that,

574
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.050
you keep it simple.
You keep it direct and then you walk away,
right?
Yeah.

575
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.580
Did you look,

576
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.330
I would never have done that or I would never have said that or whatever.

577
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.750
And that's all I'm going to say.
Walk away.
Yeah,
break the wrist.
Walk away.

578
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.790
All right next.

579
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.320
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build 'em up with

580
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:11.970
worn out tools.
So you gave your life to whatever your life's work's.

581
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:16.740
You gave it all and it,
and that thing is broken.
It's destroyed.

582
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.460
And what you do is you stoop.
I like that word because what does that mean?

583
00:36:22.461 --> 00:36:25.710
It means you're bending down.
That means you're bowing down,
right?

584
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.530
You're having to get down if to stoop down,

585
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:33.531
you go to the ground and begin to rebuild what has been destroyed and you do it

586
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:36.480
with worn out tools.

587
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.940
Now we're not just talking about worn out physical tools like a hammer and a
saw.

588
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.020
We're talking about,

589
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:47.400
you were talking about a worn out broken down.

590
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.443
You,

591
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.000
you are broken down and you're worn out,

592
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.060
but you go any way and you start from the beginning and you rebuild again.

593
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.060
That's legit.
Yeah,

594
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.370
<v 2>the Game Contra,
no.
Okay.
There's this game on,</v>

595
00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:14.070
I don't even know what that Tyndale called.
Common Ground Nintendo won't.

596
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:15.240
Dang Bro,
that's too bad.

597
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:19.260
But there's this game named Contra and he knew who played Nintendo knows this

598
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:23.250
game cause freaking awesome.
It's this code is basically these two guys.

599
00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:24.870
If you go one player,
you got one player to player,

600
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:26.850
two players play on the same screen and you just go,

601
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:31.470
it's like the basic side angle game.
These commando rambles guys side angle,

602
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.770
side angle.
Yeah.
It's not like,
you know,
you know,

603
00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.330
instead of a first person shooter from it,
it's just a sighting.

604
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.170
And it's these Rambo guys,
he'd go to player,
they both play on the same screen,

605
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:44.520
boom against each other.
No with each other.
Okay,
so boom,
they kill bad guys.

606
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.910
Right?
So through the game you can get different weapons.
Okay.

607
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.710
So,
and each weapon is like more and more effective,
right?

608
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.230
So you can get the basic shooters.

609
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.820
What you start with and you have a machine gun,
you just hold the button down.

610
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:58.350
It goes any just machine gun.

611
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.490
Then there's like a laser that just geeking go and it can just kill like five

612
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:07.080
people in a row and there's,
then there's the spreader.
It's a spread gun.

613
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.740
So at a side,
a side angle,
game,
multilevel kind of thing.

614
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:13.800
The spread or he just kills everybody.
Boom,
boom.
So one,
if you kill,

615
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:17.890
can you kill your own personal accident?
No.
No.
Google your bullets.
No,
no.

616
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.380
It's not realistic,
right?
This game is awful.
There are some unrealistic game.

617
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:25.320
There'd be some situations you get into bed,
teach you about combat.

618
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.490
Wouldn't teach you about the spreader.
Yeah.
What did he teach you about?

619
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:33.090
Blue on blue teach about fratricide.
All right.
Yeah,
it's about human loss.

620
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.820
Dig It in the,
probably be a heavy game,
but Tantra,
it's not like that.

621
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.820
So when you get to the point is the point is following me here.

622
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:44.650
The point is when you get to spread or you can make it super far because you're

623
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:47.770
just killing die.
If you have this infinite weapon,

624
00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.100
well someone can still kill you.
If you mess,
you know,
someone shoots you.

625
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.070
It just like any other way you can die.

626
00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.410
But since you have the spreader that's just killing everyone so easily,

627
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.020
you make it to high levels.
You see what I'm saying?

628
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.600
But here's the thing about concho.
When you get killed,

629
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:06.430
you get like you get three men,
right?
I know.
Unrealistic.

630
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:10.020
But still,
that's the most video games anyway.
You get three minutes.

631
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.980
If you get killed,
you lose the spreader.

632
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.470
You Start and you start again where you were,
but you still,

633
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.990
you get that pea shooter again,
the one you first started with.

634
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.860
So it's that same thing.
So you go through all the levels,

635
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:24.100
you work so hard to get.
The spreader we know is this,
you have three men,

636
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.730
three lives.
Here's the thing.
Yeah,
here's the,
okay.
The,

637
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.490
which is another thing about contrast,
which is so awesome.
You have three lives,

638
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:34.870
but if you know the code in the beginning of the game,
you can get 30 lives.

639
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.930
And here's the code up,
up,
down,
down,
left,
right,
left,
right,

640
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.440
B a then press start.
That's the code.

641
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:44.650
It gives you 30 lives.
Everyone knows that I'll,

642
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.370
I will 100% guarantee that every single person,

643
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.340
every single person that has played contract and knows that code,

644
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.850
not even like 99% 100% cause you get 10 times the amount of effectiveness.

645
00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.530
Yeah.
But it's a secret code.

646
00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:01.910
It's not like it comes with a game like you got from any number of 100% of

647
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.660
people like 88 or 89 whenever that game was out.

648
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.110
Interwebs pre.
Yeah.

649
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.880
It'd be interesting to track how that information spread.
Yeah.
Back then,

650
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.490
back then,
how did it spread up?
Up,
down,
down,
left,
left a,
B.

651
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.890
How did that spread on it?
You know there was no,
you wouldn't have got it.

652
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:25.780
There was no internet.
Yeah,
that's true.
No viable Internet.
Yeah,
that's true.

653
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:27.570
The kids for them sure were in on it.
I don't know.

654
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.930
But your point is that this taught you once yet.

655
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.210
We will use those worn out tools and he'll still try and go back and rebuild.

656
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:35.050
Contrast dye

657
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.850
is dead to not hear this.
I apologize if he understood the concept,
he'd be like,

658
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:44.950
you are exactly right because here's the thing,

659
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.730
here's the listen to the practicality of this over there

660
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.230
because with a spread,
okay,
if you just had the pea shooter,
right,

661
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:56.050
we'll call it the pea shooter.
That's the gun that you start with.

662
00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.820
If you start with that,

663
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.750
it's really hard to make it to a high level because it's like the levels get

664
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.530
harder and harder and you just got that pea shooter but those guys are going to

665
00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:07.600
kill you.
But if you get the spreader,
it's the exact opposite.

666
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:12.310
You can smash through levels and some of the levels at the end you got to have a

667
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:14.560
powerful weapon to beat the boss.
You see what I'm saying?

668
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.400
So if you have the spread or you can get pretty far what's,

669
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.110
I've heard people use the term boss is there,

670
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.220
is there a term called king boss or main boss or end boss?

671
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.470
Main bus and bus F for sure.

672
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:31.180
And this is a universal term maybe with video games.
Video Games.
Right.

673
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:35.080
And that's what my question bosses,
but we do,
we know where the,
the,

674
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.680
the term originated from the who is the original and boss.

675
00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.080
There's a video that someone made that's really,
really funny.
It's called,

676
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.100
it's something about,
it's about me and it's,

677
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.910
it's a German guy and it's like how did Jocko Willink gets up massive.

678
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.030
I've used in that video.
What was it?

679
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.200
He just makes a video where he breaks down how I got so massive.

680
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.230
It's hilarious.
Yeah.
But one thing he goes,

681
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:07.550
this is the Ad Taco was the end boss to kill on them and I didn't really know

682
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:08.570
what to end boss was.

683
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.760
So I googled it and I figured out that it's when the video game,

684
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:15.490
world war in the boss,
do you remember the date of that?

685
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.230
Is it like an old school game?
Like a target or something?
No,
no,
no,
no.

686
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.900
It's the video game world.
No,
no,
no.
The video games.
The video games.
Yeah.
Got You.

687
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.320
Okay.
Do you are a little taken aback anyway.

688
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.550
Was this man world play that give him a spreader.
I'll go get some levels.

689
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.760
Cause they're called Kung Fu in original Nintendo is called come through five

690
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:37.870
levels but then they repeat and they get harder and hard.

691
00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:41.750
But there's five levels and they'd I think in the game they called them the
boss.

692
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.230
Like the first level,
the second level blah.
I'm sure.

693
00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:49.910
I'm sure there's cause there's other older game Boston on him nonetheless.

694
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.810
Well keep Linwood say because oh the point is when you get the spreader Kipling

695
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.790
you'll encounter when you get the spreader,

696
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.120
if you'll make it to a high level you will.
But here's the thing,

697
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:00.560
that high level is super hard.

698
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:05.450
So you need that spreader and if you get hit and you die when you know when you

699
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:07.400
come back to life or whatever,
you got the pea shooter,

700
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.750
you find yourself like this with worn out tools.

701
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.220
That's where you find yourself and it's hard and if you put your mind to it,

702
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.800
you can get that spread again.
But it's really hard.
Super hard.

703
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.960
Anyone who played concert hall will attest to that.

704
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.260
I think that right there is this,
we'll leave it at that man.
You know,

705
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.570
that's my recommendation.
All right.
Next.

706
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:32.170
If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on a one turn of pitch

707
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:37.901
and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word

708
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:39.470
about your loss.

709
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:42.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

710
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.350
<v 2>Never breathe a word about your loss,
isn't it?</v>

711
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.560
When you meet someone and you,

712
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.830
you've talked to him and you deal with them for awhile and they don't tell you

713
00:43:51.831 --> 00:43:53.030
anything about their background,

714
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.160
and then you find out later that they'd been through some big struggle,

715
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.110
so much more impactful and impressive.
Yeah.
Then when they're like,
Hey,

716
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:05.530
I did this and I went through at night,
you know,
just,

717
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.920
I got a good idea just to be quiet.
Don't breathe a word about your loss.
Yeah,

718
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.560
just move.
Just just perform.
Yeah,

719
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.920
and this is awesome about being willing to take risk,
willing to take risks.

720
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.180
This seems like an inappropriate risk to risk everything that you have on a

721
00:44:24.181 --> 00:44:27.600
single turn of pitch and toss.
It doesn't seem like a smart risk.

722
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.950
Rudyard Kipling.
I don't know about that one.
Yeah,
take it.
I'm going to say

723
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.700
<v 0>let's,
let's,</v>

724
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.680
let's dial the dichotomy back of the extreme bedding situation.

725
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:42.480
Yeah.
Oh look at that being said,
you absolutely have to take risks in life,

726
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.070
right?
Like you gotta be something like a teeny tiny thing.

727
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:48.450
Gotta be a real risk,
no reward.

728
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.140
Well let's not risk everything in one turn of pitch and toss.

729
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.150
Let's not do that next.

730
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.450
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after

731
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:03.540
they're gone.
And that's just awesome,
right?

732
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:07.470
We're talking about forcing your heart and your nerve and your one senior

733
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.650
basically means your tendons and your ligaments and the things that hold your

734
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:15.090
muscles and your bones together.

735
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:19.740
And you know who used Shakespeare used say knew quite a bit cause it just like

736
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:24.510
the core element.
But this is like saying you will get,

737
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:29.190
you will force your body and your mind to do what you need them to do.

738
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.400
Even when they're done,
they're done.
I'm going to force them to do more.

739
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.020
When they have nothing left to give,
you're going to force them to give anyways.

740
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.660
And then it rolls right into the next night,
the next night.
And so hold on.

741
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:46.380
When there is nothing in you except the will,

742
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.090
which says to them,
hold on,
got nothing left,

743
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:54.870
but we'll
force of will

744
00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.280
to make it

745
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.113
<v 3>okay.</v>

746
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.720
<v 0>Make them make,
make your heart a,
make your nerve,</v>

747
00:46:02.721 --> 00:46:04.430
make them hold the line.

748
00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.660
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings,

749
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.440
nor lose the common touch.
So this is,
again,
this is staying balanced,

750
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.610
is the dichotomy.
No matter if you're involved with the masses,

751
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:26.500
right?
Even if you're involved with the masses,
you don't lose your virtue.

752
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.430
Or if you're rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful with the kings,

753
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.760
you don't lose that common touch.
You stay grounded.

754
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.860
You don't lose the ability to communicate with people up and down the chain of

755
00:46:39.861 --> 00:46:41.300
command.
From a leadership perspective,

756
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.780
no matter what station someone is in life.
You remember,

757
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.450
remember episode five of this podcast,

758
00:46:50.451 --> 00:46:55.220
I read a counseling letter to a good guy and I was like,
hey,

759
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.330
treat everyone respect.

760
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.860
Oh one or [inaudible] two o 10 like it doesn't matter what ranks and when does

761
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:04.670
he treat them with respect.
No matter what,
don't lose that

762
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.660
next if neither friends nor loving,
if either,

763
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.900
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you.

764
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.420
This is what's interesting.

765
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:21.940
It isn't always your enemies that hurts you.
Right?
In fact,

766
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:22.810
it's quite the opposite.

767
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:27.130
Usually the people that hurt you the most are the people that are closest to
you.

768
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:31.240
Those are the ones that really put the dagger in and twist it.

769
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.030
So you gotta be above that.
You got to,

770
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.700
you got to kind of insulate yourself from that.

771
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:44.440
You can't leave that last little bit of exposure,
in my opinion.

772
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:49.330
You gotta you gotta keep a little bit,
right?
You got to keep a little bit.

773
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:50.164
You got to keep up.

774
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.740
You gotta put yourself in a situation where you're not going to get crushed by

775
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:58.690
your foes or by the people that you're close to.
Yeah,

776
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.990
that's a hard,
I don't keep it inches.
It is hard.
It is hard.

777
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.110
Guys get jammed up.
Right?

778
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.830
The Echo Charles terminology that jams people up.
I'll find the,
the,

779
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.540
the enemy doesn't jam people up as bad as the,
the friends right.

780
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.220
Yet because the enemy expect that.
He expect,
I'm trying to jam you up,

781
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.840
but this goes back to the original,
uh,
what we talked about earlier,
the person,

782
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.640
and we've talked about this on the podcast,
the person that hurts you really bad,

783
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:32.620
that was your friend.
They weren't your friend.
Yeah.
They didn't exist.

784
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.470
Yeah.
The PR they,
you thought you knew them.

785
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.640
You thought you understood them,
you thought they were trustworthy.
They weren't.

786
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.130
So just we have to just look at it and say,
look,

787
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.300
that person that I was in love with or that person that I thought was going to

788
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:47.650
be with me all the time,
guess what?

789
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:51.280
That person doesn't exist so we got to move on.
So you've got to keep,

790
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:54.370
I think a little bit,
and this might sound cold blooded,
right?

791
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.880
It sounds a little bit cold blood.
It'd be like,
look man,

792
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.300
you got to keep it some stuff you gotta you gotta keep perspective.

793
00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.530
You've got to keep people in check.

794
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:06.300
And if you let them get in to the point where they can grip you apart,

795
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.740
you're going to be careful.
Yeah.
Gotta be careful.

796
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.060
You decide you're going to do that with real careful.
Yeah.
Yeah.

797
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:17.560
Or you or this is,
I think what I do is more like this.

798
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.700
If that happens,
I recognize it.
Okay.
This,
this is what happened.
Boom.

799
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.890
That person wasn't who I thought they were.
We're moving on,

800
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:29.110
we're moving on next quest.
You know what I mean?
We'll move on on.
Yeah.

801
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:31.240
So I guess it may be,
I have the ability,

802
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:37.390
I shouldn't say that I have the ability,
I think I learned along the way.
Hey,

803
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.570
once someone exposes themselves,

804
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:42.790
reveals themselves as a,

805
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:48.130
as a nave
nave,

806
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:53.350
once they reveal themselves as a nave,
I'm over it.
I'm moving on cause I,

807
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.850
they've exposed,
they've revealed great.

808
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.600
I'm actually happy that now I don't have to invest any more time,

809
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.990
effort into this person.
That's a nave,

810
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.470
wretched nave nave.
Yeah.
And then you,
you have a kind of,

811
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.990
how should I say,
overdeveloped control of your emotions.

812
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:17.230
We'll call it where like the average person is like,

813
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.030
it's kind of like if you built a house right?

814
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.440
He built a house on coy and it was a nice house.
He lived there for 10 years,

815
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:28.040
15 years.
Even.
A lot of memories in that house.
Maybe even had some kids,

816
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.480
<v 2>whatever,
first dog,
all that stuff,
and then a hurricane comes,</v>

817
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:37.250
blows it down.
Right.
There's really nothing you could have done.
You know,

818
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:40.520
like if you had a girlfriend and then she doesn't have the signs of being a
nave,

819
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.540
but then maybe she changed.
Maybe she was that all along?
I don't know.
She'd be,

820
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:49.040
as it turns out,
Naif the house gets blown down.
Okay.

821
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.860
Girlfriend's gone.
You can easily say,
hey,
that was,

822
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.430
that wasn't the girl that I loved.
All this stuff.
Okay,
we're moving on.

823
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.440
Obviously you got to move on,
right?
She's an eighth yep.

824
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.930
If you're squared away in your head,
you got to move on.
You know that already,

825
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.690
but you can't just be like,
you're just move on.
What about all those memories?

826
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.610
The hurricane you talking about?
Both.
So yeah,
I'll go back to the hurricanes.

827
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.270
Memories.
Realize the mammoth nave.
The memories realize.
Yeah,
but yeah,

828
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.930
but emotionally it doesn't feel like you're free.
Okay,

829
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:22.250
so you got away Cape.
Okay,
that's escaped the names.
That's good.

830
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:25.700
That's good.
But you're talking about like how much you learned,

831
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.670
you learned that you gotta be careful.
Let's see what I'm saying though.

832
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:32.840
Like your sense of like emotional control allows you to go boom,
right.

833
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:37.050
Do that one.
Right.
And especially when it's fresh,
like you can't just,
Oh yeah,

834
00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:40.660
I look how much I learned.
Yay,
let's get moving on that.

835
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.100
That's not the normal worse than norm poster person is.

836
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:45.110
It has still has opened wounds from,

837
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:49.280
because yesterday that house was intact and all the members to rebuild that

838
00:51:49.281 --> 00:51:53.550
kitchen again.
I see what you're doing,
we'll see you doing it again.

839
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.390
You're just going straight to the positive thing,
which is a good thing to do,

840
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.120
which is the right thing to do.
But by the it capability wise,

841
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:02.600
the average person can't do that.
So no,
it's good.
Might be a little bit tricky,

842
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:07.080
but what are the options?
It will be a little more option.
There's no option.

843
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.830
Option is,
oh,
I'm going to be distressed and,

844
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.000
and mourn the loss of my house more than the loss of your house.
Do it for,

845
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.620
you know,
four days.
Yeah.
There should be a limitation.
Yeah,
that's a good idea,

846
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:20.330
huh?
Be like,
Hey,
one week.

847
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:23.720
Right now I'm going to just let my emotions just be my emotions.

848
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.670
Try not to like a week too long for a house for sure.
No,
that's,
that's,

849
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:32.690
that's one of the things that are for the girlfriend or for a girlfriend.

850
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.770
Yeah.
That's a bit rough.
People go months.
No.
People go years.

851
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:40.490
People talk about it for years.
That's not good.
That's what I'm saying.
That's,

852
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.660
that's too,
that's my point.

853
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:45.340
C instead of making me sound like I'm all cold blooded over here.
Well,

854
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.030
what you should say is like,
Hey,

855
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:51.320
I wish that some of the people that I know that wreck their lives over a

856
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.810
girlfriend,
boyfriend,
husband,
wife,

857
00:52:53.811 --> 00:52:57.440
that broke up with him and they let it ruin their lives.
I wish you'd say,
Hey,

858
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.880
I wish that they would've had enough to emotional control to say,
you know what?

859
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.590
All right,
it's day three,
they're not coming back.

860
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.500
I have two choices.
Dig a hole.
Climate,

861
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.270
never come out or step up.
Make things happen.

862
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.680
You move forward.

863
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:21.010
The choice is obvious and once you step up and you start moving forward in three

864
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:25.190
years,
you don't remember that person's name anymore.
There are no factor.
Yeah,

865
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:25.980
you're no

866
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.520
<v 0>factor.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
So what's the,</v>

867
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.550
I mean obviously it's going to be depending on what kind of person it is.

868
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:35.220
So I've talked about this like we don't have a good,

869
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.470
a good system.
When someone dies in America,

870
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:43.290
we don't really know what to do because in other countries,
in other,

871
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.890
in other cultures,
they have a specific ritual that they go through.

872
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.180
And in America,

873
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:52.620
our rituals are kind of all jammed together and then we don't really know what

874
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:56.550
the right ritual is,
right?
We don't even know how to dispose the body.
Do we?

875
00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:01.050
Do we burn it?
Do we bury it?
Do we buried at sea?
Like there's all these options.

876
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.220
Do you donate your organs?
Do you not either.
There's this like,

877
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.380
do you donate to your body to science?
Well,
what do we,

878
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:08.730
what are you supposed to do?
What's the right thing to do?

879
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.850
We don't even know that we would know what to do with someone's body.

880
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.970
So how are we supposed to know what we're supposed to do emotionally when

881
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:18.660
someone dies?
What are we supposed to do?
We don't have a physical ritual to do.

882
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:23.970
So now what do we do?
And so this is the same thing.
Like there should be rules.

883
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.280
Hey,
like a protocol.
It's a protocol broke up with significant other.

884
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.750
Here's the protocol.
Yeah.
One day.
Morning one pizza,

885
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.310
extra cheese.
Pepperoni sausage,
right.

886
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.550
Mint chocolate chip milkshake.
Sure.
Cool.
Next Day.

887
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.780
But no,
no,
no,

888
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.700
but I don't recommend it.

889
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.230
I don't either because it'll go even more direction.
Yeah.

890
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.700
The next day I was like,
what I was going to say is like,

891
00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:58.130
I was going to say eight mile run,
eight mile run.
That's just what you got here.

892
00:54:58.131 --> 00:54:59.940
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh,
I bet.
Yeah.
What are you doing today?
Oh yeah.

893
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:01.350
I would have broke up my girlfriend two days ago.

894
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.970
I got rid of the miles tomorrow.
That's part of the protocol.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,
you,

895
00:55:04.971 --> 00:55:07.170
oh you,
oh.
And there can be different levels.
Oh,

896
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:08.910
I was going out with her for every,

897
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:11.850
let's say for every three months that you were with her.

898
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.090
That's one mile and mile.
Okay.
Yeah.
Good.

899
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.080
And so then you do that and we get done with that.

900
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:20.070
Guess what you gotta do you gotta do you gotta do what?
A contrast baths.

901
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.230
Ice Hot ice.
Hot New.
You got to do that four times,
right?
Yeah.
No.

902
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:28.890
What you do is this a good protocol for,
for a contrast baths,
five minutes,
ice,

903
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.740
five minutes,
four minutes,
ice form.
He go back and forth.

904
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:33.450
When you get done with that,
boom,
you come out,
you're cleansed.

905
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.640
And then guess what?
24 hour fast,
right?

906
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.530
24 hour fitness that he actually kind of sounds weird like for a breakup,

907
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.410
but boat,
so many cultures do that.
Oh yeah,
you've got to fast.

908
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.830
You can get a fast for this.
So and so.
Then we could go on and on,

909
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:53.910
but you make a protocol.
It's a three day protocol generally.
And then boom,

910
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:57.240
now we come out of that protocol and then there's one last,

911
00:55:57.241 --> 00:56:02.090
the last thing on the protocol is like go to work or you know,

912
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.480
begin normal routine.
Back to normal routine.
You go to bed,
back to,

913
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.550
oh I know the final protocols.
Wake up.

914
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:11.370
Whatever time it is you get up in the morning.
Third,
fourth day.

915
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:16.170
Now the protocol has been completed.
Fourth Day,
boom,
wake up,
get,
get busy,

916
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:20.910
get on with it,
get after it.
That's what I'm talking about.
So we don't have that.

917
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.290
So if you,
if you put in your mind,

918
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.910
<v 2>I think for me,
I recognize when something is dragging me,</v>

919
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.800
this is dragging me in the wrong direction.

920
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.600
As soon as I see something dragging me in the wrong direction,

921
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:33.670
I know like a internal protocol.
It's like,
okay,

922
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:37.180
I'm emotionally attached to this situation.
It's not beneficial to me.

923
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.970
It's not beneficial to me.
It's not going to help me.

924
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.490
It's not gonna help you understand the nature of the world's not gonna help me

925
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:45.190
move forward with my life is not gonna help me in any way.
Guess I'm gonna do,

926
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.030
I'm gonna Detach when I'm going to take a little step away from that thing.
Yeah.

927
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:51.190
Because I'm not saying emotions are bad,
emotions are great.

928
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:55.420
That's what makes us human beings.
Right.
I get emotional on this podcast.
Right?

929
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.740
Sure.
That's not bad.
No,
that's actually good.

930
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.700
Makes me understand myself and other things in the world better.

931
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.330
But that's a positive effect of emotions.

932
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:10.720
But if I start having negative emotions and they start dragging me down,

933
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:15.040
protocol,
execute the protocol,
boom.
That's what we need to do.

934
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.743
Yeah.

935
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.990
Like what if like part of the protocol was like to shave your head or something,

936
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:24.040
right?
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Like that could be right.
And then let's say like you,

937
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:27.960
you break up with your girlfriend or something and then like,
you know,

938
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.030
a few days later you see her at the post office.
I'm,
she has a shaved head.

939
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.250
You're like,
aw man,
she's getting over me quick.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

940
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.780
but that would help though.
That would totally would because it's like,

941
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:41.740
it's like the,
it's like the process and it gives you something else to focus on.

942
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:43.570
See what I'm saying?
So it's like,
okay,

943
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.750
I know I'm talking about the protocol and Joe to call it a protocol.

944
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:50.470
Especially if it expands like,
you know,
three,
four days,
boom,
boom,
boom.
It's like,

945
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:50.890
you know,

946
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:54.940
it doesn't Aa have something like that to where you do the steps and protocols,

947
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.433
all kinds of things.

948
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.470
There's a reason protocols exist because it gives you something to follow.

949
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.730
You don't have to think about it and it moves you in the right direction.
Yeah.

950
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:06.670
Yeah.
So think about that for your life.
Pay attention to it.

951
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.400
Cause the scary part about this,
and we've talked about this too,

952
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:10.091
it's like the storm,

953
00:58:10.091 --> 00:58:12.910
your head's in a storm and you can't get out and doing only person.

954
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.370
Everyone else can see that.
Your head has a,
has a,

955
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.970
has a two foot cloud around it and everybody can see if you just moving to a

956
00:58:19.971 --> 00:58:22.600
direction,
you'll get away from that cloud.
But everywhere you look,

957
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.240
you just see storm is cloud and thunder and lightning.

958
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.990
So you don't think there's any way out.
But there is try to execute the protocol.

959
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:33.250
The protocol is you go do north 1800 meters,
you're going to be out,
right?

960
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.020
That's what's gonna happen.
Shave your head,
run eight miles,
eat a pizza,

961
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:42.040
eat a mint chocolate chip mug.
Milkshake.
That's day one.
That's a little comfort.

962
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.710
Little luxury.
Theo von luxury style.

963
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:51.160
All right,
next

964
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.610
we went way off on that one Bruh.
That was good.
That was actually really good.

965
00:58:57.611 --> 00:58:59.290
That kind of gets you thinking.
Cause if you,

966
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:03.010
you could even do this right now if you're in,
even if you're in a relief,

967
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.210
even if you're not even in a relationship yet,
cause those are the call just yet.

968
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:10.870
Prepare a protocol like hey if this,
cause it's Kinda like a natural disaster.

969
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:13.030
You do that.
You know what?
There's also,

970
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:17.020
there's also something you could do that would be helpful and I hate to use this

971
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:19.180
word because it gets used in a different sense these days,

972
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:22.040
but you could have trigger points,
right?
Things that

973
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.600
<v 0>happen where if you see,
if you identify things happening,
you go,
okay,</v>

974
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.980
if I get involved in this situation and this happens,
that's a trigger.

975
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:33.800
That means I need to walk.
Right.
For instance,

976
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.500
let's say you have someone that has,
let's say,

977
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:40.610
let's say you meet someone that was an addict of some kind on alcoholic and

978
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:43.130
you're like,
okay,
if this person starts drinking,
that's my trigger,

979
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:47.270
I'm going to walk because you don't want to go down that spiral with them,
right.

980
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:52.310
Or whatever the case may be.
You have someone that used to date some other guy

981
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.443
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

982
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:57.870
<v 0>like,
hey,
if I see that there's whatever,
a Facebook connection,
again,</v>

983
00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.460
some walking,
whatever,
like you gotta yeah,

984
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:02.940
you figure out these things and that way you predetermine them when you're in a

985
01:00:02.941 --> 01:00:05.910
nonemotional state.
When you get to the emotional state,

986
01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.360
hopefully you can overcome your emotions.
Cause there's people who are like,

987
01:00:09.361 --> 01:00:13.860
I don't care.
I love,
I love her.
I'm just going to keep going.

988
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:18.660
There's only this one time.
Right.
That's how she friended me.

989
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.850
Right.
And then they stick around.
But if you have your protocol in place,

990
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.390
if you have the triggers to execute upon,
it's going to make it easier for you.

991
01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.740
It should make it easy for you.

992
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.763
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

993
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:35.220
<v 0>All right.
Next one.
This is a good one if all men count with you,</v>

994
01:00:35.221 --> 01:00:36.900
but none too much.
And think about this.

995
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:40.920
When we actually got wrapped around this one a little bit in the podcast one

996
01:00:40.921 --> 01:00:41.754
time.

997
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

998
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.160
<v 0>Because this is a dichotomy of the fact that I personally,</v>

999
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.160
<v 1>okay,</v>

1000
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.050
<v 0>there's part of me that doesn't care what anyone thinks.</v>

1001
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.490
And then there's part of me that completely cares about what people,

1002
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.110
specifically people that I have a lot of respect for.

1003
01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.300
I care what they think of a lot and people that I don't respect,

1004
01:01:00.301 --> 01:01:01.890
I don't care what they think.
So there's a dichotomy there.

1005
01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:06.540
And that's similar to what is being said here.
If all men count with you.

1006
01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:11.250
So you take their opinions,
you understand,
but at the same time,
none too much.

1007
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.960
Yeah.
To sway you from the path.

1008
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:14.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:20.740
<v 0>And here next line,
I think he's one of the greatest minds.
Debit,</v>

1010
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.150
if you can kill,

1011
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:27.210
if you can feel the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run.

1012
01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:32.740
So
the unforgiving minute,

1013
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.280
that's a great,
that's the way you should think of every minute,

1014
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:41.310
every minute that exists for you is unforgiving because it does not stop.

1015
01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.240
It does not forgive and you can't have it back.

1016
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:51.270
That's the unforgiving minute time has no mercy on anyone.

1017
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:52.510
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1018
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:57.490
<v 0>And what he's saying here is if you can feel every one of those unforgiving</v>

1019
01:01:57.491 --> 01:01:58.570
minutes of your life,

1020
01:01:58.571 --> 01:02:03.571
every single one of them with a full 60 seconds of you running and moving

1021
01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:09.160
forward and getting after it,
if you can push that hard,

1022
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.250
you can push that hard.
Then he closes out.

1023
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.640
Yours is the earth and everything that's in it and which is

1024
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.370
you'll be a man,
my son.

1025
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:29.850
So there it is.
If you can do all those things,
and that's the name of the poem.

1026
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.530
If,
if you can do those things,
those things that are simple but not easy,

1027
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.560
easy,
simple,
but definitely not easy,

1028
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:42.950
then the world will be yours and you will be a man meant in the most positive

1029
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:47.580
<v 1>possible way.</v>

1030
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.930
So now we go back.
This is what we do.

1031
01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.750
Now that we understand it fully,
we go through it fully.

1032
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.100
Here it goes.
If,

1033
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:09.630
if you can keep your head

1034
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:15.070
<v 0>when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</v>

1035
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.720
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their

1036
01:03:23.141 --> 01:03:24.040
doubting too.

1037
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:30.520
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about,

1038
01:03:30.521 --> 01:03:33.250
don't deal in lies or being hated.

1039
01:03:33.251 --> 01:03:38.251
Don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise

1040
01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.650
if you can dream and not make dreams your master.

1041
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.320
If you can think and not make thoughts,
your aim.

1042
01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:57.790
If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the

1043
01:03:59.241 --> 01:04:00.074
same.

1044
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.740
If you can bear to hear the truth,

1045
01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:10.741
you've spoken twisted by Knaves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you

1046
01:04:12.101 --> 01:04:14.110
gave your life to broken

1047
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:19.730
and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.

1048
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.840
If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch

1049
01:04:27.661 --> 01:04:32.661
and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word

1050
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:34.290
about your loss.

1051
01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:35.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1052
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.560
<v 0>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after</v>

1053
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:48.450
they are gone.
And so hold on.

1054
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.770
When there is nothing in you except the will,
which says to them,

1055
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.233
hold on.

1056
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.910
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue.

1057
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.510
<v 0>Or Walk with kings,
nor lose the common touch.</v>

1059
01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.020
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

1060
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:13.160
if all men count with you,
but none too much.

1061
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:20.900
If you can feel the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run,

1062
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.960
yours is the earth and everything that's in it

1063
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:32.350
and which is more,
you'll be a man,

1064
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.230
my son.
And there you have it.

1065
01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.580
Some pretty straightforward instructions from Kipling on how to live.

1066
01:05:43.791 --> 01:05:48.440
And I looked at it and his son died in world war one.

1067
01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:51.530
He wrote this poem just before the turn of the century.

1068
01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:55.790
So he wrote this poem before his son was killed before his son went to warm,

1069
01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:59.960
perhaps just after his son was born in that timeframe.

1070
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:06.370
Ah.
So I'm sure his son grew up with these thoughts

1071
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.920
and I think it's thoughts that we can all use.

1072
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.360
<v 1>So [inaudible] thank you.</v>

1073
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:23.410
<v 0>And now we are going to go through some Q and a dig into a little bit of Q and.</v>

1074
01:06:25.071 --> 01:06:29.070
A.
Okay.
Echo Charles [inaudible].

1075
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.190
First question.
First question,
Dave.
Jocko,

1076
01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:38.270
many times he said that liking a fight or liking to fight should be a part of

1077
01:06:38.271 --> 01:06:41.450
every man's personality.
Could you expand on that?

1078
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.580
I've always been interested in martial arts,

1079
01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:48.290
but I've always been reluctant to fight and I would do anything not to.

1080
01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.990
Does that make me less of a man?

1081
01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:55.330
So obviously this is a pretty fitting question for the situation.
Yeah.

1082
01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.710
So this is obviously a good question.
Uh,
and a fitting question.

1083
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:04.740
Talking about being a man.
Uh,

1084
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:09.870
I don't know if I said liking to fight should be a part of everybody's every

1085
01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:15.071
man's personality or if I said that it is part of every man's personality edit I

1086
01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:20.600
think I said is part of their personality.
And if I said that,
what I,

1087
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:23.000
I think I should've said is most right,

1088
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:28.270
most men have in their personality some level of interest of fighting,

1089
01:07:30.771 --> 01:07:34.640
right?
We wrestle,
we box,
we scrapped his kids.
Look at the UFC.

1090
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.280
Breck,
why is the UFC so popular right now?

1091
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.230
Because it's fighting and we have that.
That's a,

1092
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:46.060
I read the other,
that's a $7 billion organization.
That's a,

1093
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.840
there's a lot of people watching those fights.

1094
01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.760
A lot of people want to watch those fights.
We have boxing,
we have wrestling,

1095
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:53.630
we have Jiu Jitsu,
we have judo,
we have moy,
Tai.

1096
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.670
We had all kinds of martial arts schools.

1097
01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:01.370
So while I don't think the desire to fight is inherent in all men,
right?

1098
01:08:01.371 --> 01:08:04.490
I'm sure there's men out there that are not into it at all.

1099
01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:09.410
But I think it's definitely a pretty strong part of many men.

1100
01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.000
Now for this individual,
particular,
um,

1101
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:17.360
I do,
do I that being reluctant to fight makes you less women?
No,

1102
01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:21.620
actually I think it's fine.
The,
you should be reluctant to fight.

1103
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:22.850
I think everyone should be reluctant.

1104
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:25.400
There's a lot of bad things that can happen in a fight.
A lot of bad things.

1105
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.520
You know,
first of all,
you can get hurt,
right?
That's bad.

1106
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.140
You can get seriously hurt.
You can get killed,
you can get killed,

1107
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:35.240
you can get punched one time,
fall down,
hit a curb and die.

1108
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.670
You can think you're going to get in a fair fight with someone.

1109
01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:40.970
They can stab you in the neck and kill you.
Right?
These things can happen.

1110
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:46.210
Even if it's not that bad,
you can hurt someone else.
Now you're getting lawsuit,

1111
01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:49.520
now you're getting put in prison.
Right?
So there's all kinds of bad things.

1112
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:53.030
So being reluctant to fight is actually a good thing.

1113
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:54.920
And it's something that men should have.

1114
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.060
And actually the more you know about fighting,
the more reluctant you will be.

1115
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.100
I was way the less I knew in my life about fighting the more,
or sorry,

1116
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:06.290
the more I actually knew about fighting,

1117
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.070
the more reluctant I became to fight cause I realized all the risks that are

1118
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:12.410
involved.
Part of that was maturity.
Sure.

1119
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.440
But the reality is you look at someone and you go,
Ha,

1120
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:19.430
I don't know who that person is.
A they,
they might be training.

1121
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:22.220
I'm over here thinking I betrayed him Jujitsu for eight months.

1122
01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:24.320
I'm ready to kick this guy's ass.
Meanwhile,

1123
01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:26.870
you don't know that guy as a purple belt.
Guess what's going to happen to you?

1124
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.660
You're getting crushed.
Or that guy wrestled in high school,

1125
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:33.620
he's about to double leg.
You can slam you on a curb,
you're going to die.

1126
01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:37.970
So you should be reluctant to fight.
That's a good thing.

1127
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:41.000
Now that being said,

1128
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.940
I do recommend that you are prepared to fight.

1129
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.170
I definitely recommend that and there's going to be a big dichotomy here.

1130
01:09:51.171 --> 01:09:52.880
I'm going to get to,
but you should know some basics,
right?

1131
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:55.730
You should understand threats.
You should know how to contend with other people.

1132
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.870
You should.
You know you should know some boxing.
You should know some rescue.

1133
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:02.240
You should know some words.
I should know some Jujitsu for sure

1134
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:06.710
because here's the dichotomy.
This is the,

1135
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.370
this is a big dichotomy and think about it.
It's 100% true.
This,

1136
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.940
this individual says he would do anything not to fight,

1137
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.180
would do anything not to fight.

1138
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.190
Let me tell you the best thing you can do as a human so that you don't have to

1139
01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:25.460
fight is actually learned how to fight.

1140
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.880
That is the best way to not have to fight as if you know how to fight.

1141
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.920
If you know how to fight,
people aren't going to want to fight you.

1142
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.080
You don't even have to say anything.
They can tell.

1143
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.520
You can tell when you meet somebody.
You can tell if that person,
oh,
if you,

1144
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:40.580
if you're ready to fight,
people don't want to fight you.

1145
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.610
The more eager you are to fight,
the less people want to fight you.

1146
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.480
If you don't know how to fight and and bullies,

1147
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.560
because that's what we're talking about.

1148
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:51.380
Bullies see that you don't want to fight.
Guess who they're coming after.

1149
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:54.290
You now guess what?
Now you have to fight,

1150
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.500
but if you know how to fight and you have that confidence and you have that

1151
01:10:57.501 --> 01:11:01.000
understanding and you learn simple things like avoidance and you learned,

1152
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:02.780
you have better situational awareness,

1153
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.380
you become a threat to the people that want to fight you.

1154
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.590
You become a threat to them just by just by your knowledge alone.

1155
01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.520
So no,
not less of a man

1156
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:18.150
<v 2>because you were elected to fight.
You actually should be reluctant to fight,</v>

1157
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.740
but you should learn how to fight because the best way to avoid fighting,

1158
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:25.740
the more equipped and prepared to fight you are,

1159
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.290
the less you will have to fight,

1160
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:33.420
the less you will be put in positions where you have to fight and the better the

1161
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:37.440
outcome will be if it does happen to occur.

1162
01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.520
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interestingly,

1163
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:45.590
like a lot of the people that you meet in Jujitsu or just like this where I'm

1164
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.370
interested in martial arts,
but I'm not interested in fighting.
No,
but for sure,

1165
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.340
for sure,
and then they learn it.
Then I get all of,

1166
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:55.080
there's a strong component of nerds in Jujitsu,

1167
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:59.420
right.
Strong component.
Really strong of of,

1168
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.130
you know I'm saying it jokingly,

1169
01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:05.760
but there's just a studious type students per type people that aren't super

1170
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:07.980
physical.
They're more cerebral than they are physical.

1171
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:11.680
There's a ton of people like that.
And you know what,
they'll do choke you out.

1172
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.260
They wind up being real good.
Yeah.

1173
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:17.220
They wind up being real good cause they like Oh I I understand this.
There's a,

1174
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.660
this is a game that I can learn and I can crush and that's good and now I have

1175
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:23.730
more conference on her for worry about it anymore.
Again.

1176
01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:25.590
It's interesting how that third or that,

1177
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:29.580
that additional element that they're not really used to like how you say nerds

1178
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:33.480
and you know,
we'll just say like people who are more cerebral within physical,

1179
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:36.830
it's that maybe they didn't play high school sports.
Right?
Yeah.

1180
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:41.580
Cause they were working on a computer.
Right.
Cool.
Right on.
Yeah.

1181
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.940
They were playing music,
right?
Yeah.
Whatever.
Yeah.

1182
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.750
And then now they get into this highly physical situation cause just to,

1183
01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:50.880
let's face it,
it's physical.
That's your whole body.

1184
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:55.910
It is physical as can be and but you get in it and you're just finding success

1185
01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.790
just by learning it.
It's not like football where it's like,
sure,

1186
01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:02.820
I know how to catch.
I can't run fast though and I can't.

1187
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:06.900
I'm not big and strong or whatever,
so I'm just getting smashed.
But this,

1188
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:09.990
it's kind of like the more you know,
the better you are kind of thing and sure.

1189
01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:13.210
Physical attributes help you.
For sure buddy.
That is,
there's,

1190
01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:17.150
there's you being stronger is great.
Yeah.
You know,

1191
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.750
Dean was talking about the city on the map.

1192
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.120
The stronger guys not always going to win.

1193
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.640
The more athletic guys not always going to win.
Sometimes they do.

1194
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:26.430
There's various categories that will bring you a victory.

1195
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
One of the strongest categories that you can have.
Well,
this strong,

1196
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:33.150
the strongest category is your technique is knowing what to do because no one

1197
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:36.270
wants to do.
And so you're smart people,

1198
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.960
your cerebral people that come in and go,
oh,
I can apply.

1199
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:44.760
I can apply this knowledge.
The same way I applied my skills in accounting.

1200
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.350
James Nielsen,
world's toughest accountant.
He's an accountant,

1201
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.240
he's a backs.
So that's just the reality.
And yet,

1202
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:57.270
and that's why,
so now they're,
that's why people get addicted to,

1203
01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.380
because it's like this element of physicality,
like a physical fighting,

1204
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:03.810
more fighting sport by the way,
combat sport.

1205
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:05.820
And now they're in the Ed and they're good at,

1206
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.270
they're good at something physical for the first time and they're still smart as

1207
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:12.100
smart can be,
you know,
like they always were.
So now they got that and that

1208
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.110
<v 0>additional,
um,
like pay off,
you know,
that's where they get it to district power.</v>

1209
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.410
Yeah.
I recognize that with kids that come to Jujitsu,

1210
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.690
the oftentimes,
and it's not an always,

1211
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:27.780
oftentimes the kids that get really into Jujitsu are kids that are smart and,

1212
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.570
but they haven't done a lot of other sports yet.

1213
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.720
And it's exactly what you're saying you'd,
it's very noticeable with kids.

1214
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.390
The kid that played baseball his whole life and he comes in there,

1215
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:41.470
he actually doesn't like it at first and maybe doesn't even want to do it

1216
01:14:41.471 --> 01:14:45.750
because he's getting choked by someone that seems all nerdy to him.
Yeah.

1217
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.160
And he knows I could throw a baseball farther than this guy.

1218
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.920
And so it makes him mad and he doesn't want to train.
Yeah.

1219
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:55.150
But oftentimes it's the kids that come in that really haven't done too much

1220
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.840
athletically and you know,
they're,
they got picked on.
We got,
we've,

1221
01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:01.600
I've had a lot of bullies come to my Jujitsu kids program.

1222
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.540
The reason they're there is because they got bullied and once they started

1223
01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:06.460
training six months,
they're not getting bullied anymore.

1224
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.230
And a year later they're a different person.
There are different kid,
confident,

1225
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.130
assured themselves not backing down,
not being jerks,

1226
01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:20.050
not being bullies themselves,
but just confident.
Hmm.
So yeah,

1227
01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.170
transferred.
You get to dot.
All right.

1228
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:28.420
Next question Jocko and echo question.

1229
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.590
How important is personal intelligence in the military,

1230
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:38.260
particularly in,
in more dangerous roles as compared to physical strength?

1231
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:42.760
I'm a college student who will probably go to ocs,
ocs,

1232
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:46.930
officer candidate school.
Yeah.
So this has been on my mind.
Well,
okay,

1233
01:15:46.931 --> 01:15:49.510
so intelligence is paramount,
right?
Of course.

1234
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.860
If you aren't smart that you're going to do dumb things and dumb things can

1235
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:57.880
definitely get you killed.
This is not to say that if you do dumb things,

1236
01:15:57.881 --> 01:16:02.230
you will get killed.
Cause I did some really dumb things,
aid,

1237
01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:04.210
combat and I didn't get killed.

1238
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.660
And it certainly isn't to say that if you get killed,

1239
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:12.870
you did something dumb because to combat it has no mercy and you can be the best

1240
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:16.570
trained,
the smartest,
the most tactful sound person in the world.

1241
01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:22.030
And those people can still get killed.
Combat doesn't care about any of that.

1242
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:24.730
That bullet has no one's name on it.

1243
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.250
It the bomb has no one's name on it.

1244
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.120
It's going to go off and it's going to take out who it takes out and that's
that.

1245
01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.520
But as far as weighing,
you know,

1246
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:39.730
intelligence and cognitive power versus strength,

1247
01:16:39.731 --> 01:16:41.470
I mean you have to be,

1248
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:46.730
I mean I would rather be smart and being smart is very important because if

1249
01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:49.370
you're smart,
if you aren't smart,
I should say you,

1250
01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:52.270
you increase your chance of doing something that isn't smart and then you're

1251
01:16:52.271 --> 01:16:56.230
going to make some kind of mistake that will negatively impact you.
So yes,

1252
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:58.630
being smart is very important.
Now

1253
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.120
there are some cases without question where physical strength and stamina is at

1254
01:17:07.841 --> 01:17:11.780
least as important and sometimes more important.
Hm.

1255
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:17.180
That's just the way it is.
You might have to climb a cliff to escape the enemy.

1256
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.630
That's just the way it is.
You might have to Mike Thornton,

1257
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:25.490
Mike Borton swam for what,
five hours dragging two people.

1258
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:31.210
Now he could be the smartest guy in the world and which he did a damn good job

1259
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:35.270
of,
you know,
getting the life jackets and getting him a self,

1260
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.450
organizing a situation where it'd be the easiest possible way for him to swim.

1261
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.740
Even with that,

1262
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:44.300
you still got to swim for five hours dragging to people while you're wounded,

1263
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:45.134
by the way.

1264
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:50.150
So if he didn't have that physical strength at that point,

1265
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:54.170
that brain Borden matter,
it wouldn't matter.

1266
01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.340
So what's interesting about this is guess what a really smart person will get

1267
01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:06.560
himself or herself,
the physical capabilities,
that's what you'll do.

1268
01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.760
The smart person,

1269
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:11.660
they're really smart person will work their ass off to get in shape and in to

1270
01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:12.494
stay in shape.

1271
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:16.720
Because you can be smarter to come up with the most brilliant plan in the world.

1272
01:18:16.721 --> 01:18:19.960
But if you don't have the physical where we fall to execute that plan and that,

1273
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:24.130
that brilliant plan doesn't matter.
So yes,

1274
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.500
you want to be smart and yes,
you want to be fiscally strong.

1275
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.550
You want to exercise your brain and your body as much as possible and get them

1276
01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:35.050
both as mentally strong,
physically.
Get yourself as mentally strong,

1277
01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.190
as physically strong as you possibly can.
And that's not just in the,

1278
01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.330
not just in the military,
that's in life

1279
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:45.953
<v 1>life.</v>

1280
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.140
<v 0>Somebody quoted on Twitter the other day,
you,
you to,
you can't,
you don't know.</v>

1281
01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:55.140
Two plus two if you're dead,
you can't add two plus two.
So if you're,

1282
01:18:55.290 --> 01:19:00.060
if you're investing all your time in being smart or you're investing all your

1283
01:19:00.061 --> 01:19:03.030
time and in that intellectual aspect of your life,

1284
01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:07.140
and then you let your physical aspect go,
yeah,
well guess what?

1285
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:10.900
Now you're now you're unhealthy.
Now you die because you didn't take care of you.

1286
01:19:10.901 --> 01:19:13.270
Now what good is your brain now?
Zero.
Zero.
Good,

1287
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:16.950
good check.

1288
01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:20.553
<v 1>Next question.</v>

1289
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.370
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

1290
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:25.760
How do you give feedback to someone without everyone taking it personal?

1291
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:30.500
I tried to give criticism regarding their work or actions while not attacking

1292
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:35.240
their character,
but unfortunately many feel that it's personal.

1293
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.070
Yeah,
welcome to the world.

1294
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.920
People don't like Chrisholm criticism and I almost put eight,

1295
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.860
no one in the world likes crypsis.
Okay,

1296
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:53.890
so there might be 1e-05% of the world that's really like open and ready for

1297
01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:59.140
feedback.
Right?
But most people,
even when they say,

1298
01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.930
even when they tell you they want feedback,
they don't want it.

1299
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.920
They don't want it.
Like,
let me,
let me give an example.
If you echo Charles,
yes,

1300
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.180
we're like you,
you made a video and it took you hours.

1301
01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:12.180
Don't even don't even right.
You know what I'm saying?

1302
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.420
Like you could come to me and say,
Hey,
what do you think?
You know?
And I was like,

1303
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.660
well,
you know,
I think you framed this up wrong.
How?
What's your reaction to that?

1304
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:23.220
I mean there's no possible way that you're stoked on that.
Now,
luckily,

1305
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:26.660
you know,
we know each other.
You can detach and be like,
all right,
I need to,
he's,

1306
01:20:26.661 --> 01:20:29.460
he doesn't,
he's not pointing this out to me for no reason,
whatever.

1307
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.850
But what I'm saying is even when you're saying,
Hey,
what do you think of this?

1308
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:35.340
And I criticize something that you work so hard on,

1309
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.600
there's no one in the world that's happy about that even when they ask for it.

1310
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.690
So you have to flank people.
That's what you have to do.

1311
01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.280
Now he's asking specifically,
how do you do this?
So here's some things.

1312
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.660
What one of the things that I do when I want to give someone criticism,

1313
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:52.650
I don't give him criticism.

1314
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:56.580
What I do is I ask them questions about whatever it is.

1315
01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:59.880
Now this is interesting.
I'm not even talking about pointed questions.

1316
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:02.790
I'm not even talking about like hard questions.
I'm talking.
I'm not saying like,

1317
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:07.620
why did you do that?
I'm talking about,
hey,
why did you do it that way?

1318
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.710
There's a big difference between like,
hey,
why did you do it that way?

1319
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.880
I mean like instead of saying,
Hey,
echo,
that frame is doesn't look good.
Hey,

1320
01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:17.280
why'd you frame that up like that?
Right?

1321
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:20.610
So now I'm getting you to think about it,
right?
But I'm not going to say,

1322
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:26.340
how are you going to make that work?
You know,
I'm going to say,
well,
hey dude,

1323
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.810
do you think are going be able to make that work?

1324
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:35.130
If you did something and it doesn't go well,
I'm not going to say,
you know,

1325
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:40.020
did you actually think that was a good idea?
Instead,
I'm going to say it's,

1326
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:43.560
again,
it's not pointed question.
I'm going to say,
well,
hey,

1327
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:48.300
did that unfold the way you thought it was going to unfold and now you're going

1328
01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:50.160
to get to answer the question.
Now you're going to be,

1329
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:54.900
you're going to be the person that uncovers the fault.
It's going to be you,

1330
01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:55.321
not me.

1331
01:21:55.321 --> 01:21:59.490
And that makes it so much more palatable to everyone when they're able to say,

1332
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.500
oh yeah,
you know,
I saw this over here,

1333
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.830
and most of the time the person knows the truth.

1334
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:07.890
Most of the time the person knows that that thing's not framed up right.

1335
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:08.970
They know that their idea wasn't not great.

1336
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.470
So you don't need to punch them in the face with it cause that's actually going

1337
01:22:11.471 --> 01:22:14.280
to make them get defensive.
So you flank them,
you ask them the questions,

1338
01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:18.660
you talk about it,
you discuss this subject and what you do is you guide them,

1339
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:23.310
you guide them to a mirror,
you guide them to a mirror and then,

1340
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.490
and then you just have a look in that mirror.
You set them up.

1341
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:29.820
So they have to look in that mirror so that they can see the problems
themselves.

1342
01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:33.300
And once they see the problems themselves,
they can start to correct them.

1343
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:39.870
Now sometimes you,
sometimes it's your ego
that wants,

1344
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:41.790
even once they see the problem themselves,

1345
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.030
do people want them to take credit for showing that and this leads and so you

1346
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.170
gotta,
you gotta check your ego.

1347
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:47.700
You've got to make sure that your ego isn't saying,

1348
01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:51.630
I want to prove to this person that I know how to frame this up better than

1349
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:53.580
you've got to put that all in check.

1350
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:57.570
And you've got to just let you gotta let them have it.

1351
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.720
So,
and now,
are there situations where you can give really good frank feedback?

1352
01:23:03.721 --> 01:23:04.554
Yes there is,

1353
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.720
but you have to have a good relationship with that person or really good,

1354
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.630
really good relationship with that person.
And the,

1355
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.480
usually one of the best ways to,

1356
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:16.270
to make this happen is that the feedback,

1357
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.030
the negative feedback is going both ways.

1358
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:22.990
Meaning I want to get negative feedback about my performance from that person so

1359
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:27.520
that there's some equity nymity and what's being said amongst us.

1360
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.600
Right.
So I might be low,
you know,
I might say,
hey echo,

1361
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:36.720
hey man,
I,
you know,
I did this,
uh,
I answered this question on Qa.

1362
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.770
Did you think that was a good answer?
Because I think,
you know,

1363
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.110
I think could have been better.
And then you say,
yeah,
you know,

1364
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:42.880
you dragged on and he talked too long and whatever,

1365
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:45.520
you give me some critique and then I go,
oh yeah,
hey.
And by the way,

1366
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.440
the lighting on that didn't look good.
Right?

1367
01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:49.810
And so now we have a little mutual criticism and it's all good.

1368
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:52.480
It makes a little bit more palatable to you cause I made the thing.

1369
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.240
And so that's sometimes works.

1370
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.270
But what's interesting is even when you do that,

1371
01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:02.140
some people just don't even freaking care and they even after they just tear you

1372
01:24:02.141 --> 01:24:07.141
apart and then you throw a little little like a little nick on their shoulder,

1373
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:10.660
on their arm,
you give him a little nick about something that wasn't right.

1374
01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:15.550
They still get.
So you have to be really,

1375
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.720
you have to have a really great relationship with that person to be able to have

1376
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:24.010
just that straight,
straight feedback.
But build relationships,

1377
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:28.360
ask them questions,
let them find their own fault if you can,

1378
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:30.760
and be their guide.
Let them,
guide them to that mirror,

1379
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:35.440
guide them to their faults.
Now of course,

1380
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:40.500
there are some people that won't even find their own faults,

1381
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:44.170
no matter how you guide them in how hard you try and twist them to look in the

1382
01:24:44.171 --> 01:24:44.650
mirror.

1383
01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:49.210
You have to let them know you actually have to come out and say,

1384
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:52.240
what's going on?
You have to be more direct.
Now,
luckily,

1385
01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.850
if a person is the type of person that fails to see their own faults,

1386
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.940
they begin to fail,
right?
Because they're making mistakes.

1387
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:03.880
That's why their faults,
right?
They're making mistakes.
And when they see that,

1388
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.050
when you see that and you see that their project is failing,

1389
01:25:08.051 --> 01:25:10.330
or you see that there are people are revolting against them or you see that

1390
01:25:10.331 --> 01:25:12.940
they're missing deadline after deadline,
they know that too.

1391
01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:16.960
And then what you're doing is you're coming to them basically as like a

1392
01:25:16.961 --> 01:25:21.580
concerned friend that really wants to help them win.

1393
01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:22.750
And,

1394
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.750
and pointing out some of these obvious failures that they might not be aware of

1395
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:32.470
and you still gotta be gentle about this.
But when you come to them,

1396
01:25:32.471 --> 01:25:37.060
you can come to them as a friend,
as a,
as a person that really wants them to win.

1397
01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:41.740
And you can come out out of there looking like the good guy trying to help them

1398
01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:45.730
get there,
their self back on track.

1399
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.460
So those are some of the,
some of the basic strategies.

1400
01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:55.540
And I used to help people do a little course correction if people need a little

1401
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:59.860
criticism.
So that they can,
uh,
improve their game for themselves,
for the team,

1402
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.473
et Cetera.

1403
01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.510
<v 2>Good
businessman.
My input.</v>

1404
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:13.540
People aren't be part people don't like criticism.
Yeah.
Here to tell you.
Yeah.

1405
01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:16.520
They like praise.
You know how,

1406
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:20.720
and you know the other side of this coin,
if you're a person,

1407
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:23.060
which you are and you don't like criticism,
which you don't,

1408
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:27.080
if you can open your mind to the criticism,
man,
you're already going to be.

1409
01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:29.750
So you're going to get so much better about everything that you do.

1410
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.790
If you can just listen to people without getting ego crazy and thinking about

1411
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:39.500
this
and just listen,
just listen.

1412
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:43.040
Nod your head less than what they have to say.
They're trying to help you.
Right.

1413
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.720
We assume that they're trying to help us.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1414
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.870
Are there times when they're not?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Cause you know,

1415
01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:52.340
you can go in with the assumption that this person just tried to cut me down.

1416
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.240
Well then that's not going to get you anywhere.
But if you're,

1417
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.310
if you make the assumption,
you know what,

1418
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.950
I'm going to listen to what this person has to say,
what's wrong with that?
Yeah.

1419
01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.070
Even if it's an assumption and we're not supposed to assume,
if I assume anyone,

1420
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.770
I'm going assume that echo has given me criticism right now because he wants me

1421
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:08.771
to do better and I'm going to take them as as face value as I can that he is

1422
01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:14.810
trying to help me get better.
Yeah,
boom.
Yeah.
And yeah,

1423
01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:19.400
that's actually really correct.
If you start at that point,

1424
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.520
that's your default,
right?
Hey,
this is to help.

1425
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:27.140
Now I might look at your criticism and I analyze it from a detached perspective

1426
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:27.440
and I go,

1427
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.530
I think actually echo is just trying to drag me in the wrong direction because

1428
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:32.150
he's jealous and I might get to that point.
Yeah.

1429
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.710
And it'll be more way more obvious.

1430
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:37.340
It'd be way more often if you started at that other points where it's like,
okay,

1431
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:37.850
it's here,

1432
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:41.270
but if you're just default all he just wants to try to look like he knows

1433
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:44.640
everything or he just wants to,
you know,
make it,
you started their place to be.

1434
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.590
Yeah,
you can't even kind of discern,
you know,
if that really is happening or not.

1435
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.570
Not the place to be.
Not the place to be.
Next question,

1436
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:54.860
Choco.

1437
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:59.510
What's the best way to combine striking and grappling with self defense in mind?

1438
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:04.040
Never heard you mentioned MMA in this context,
only Jujitsu with gloves on.

1439
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:05.180
Consequently,

1440
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:09.620
how the team's adept MMA based training to real situations.

1441
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.910
What's your take on armies?
Modern Army combat.
It's okay,

1442
01:28:13.911 --> 01:28:15.230
so a few questions there.

1443
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.220
How do you best learn to combine striking and grappling?
Well,

1444
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:22.190
what you do is you combine striking and grappling.
That's how you get good at it.

1445
01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.190
You put on the big gloves,
we used to call it shoot boxing.

1446
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:28.190
That was like a block of training that we doing with with guys that were

1447
01:28:28.191 --> 01:28:28.701
fighting MMA.

1448
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:33.410
You put on the big relatively big boxing gloves and then you put,

1449
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:37.970
you mix and take downs with them.
So that's great.
You should do that.

1450
01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.260
You can do that with kids too.

1451
01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:42.440
You can do that with kids where you put the big boxing gloves on kids and you

1452
01:28:42.441 --> 01:28:44.900
have him shoot those double legs all day long so that when somebody takes a

1453
01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:46.910
swing at them,
they know how to set up,
they know the timing,

1454
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:49.760
they start to get familiar with it because in a way,

1455
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:55.480
well it takedowns are easier in MMA because the person is not solely defending

1456
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:58.490
against a takedown.
They're defending against punches,

1457
01:28:58.491 --> 01:29:01.290
they're defending against kicks.
So they have to be in a different

1458
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.330
<v 0>stance.
Yeah.
And so that's the way it works.
Um,</v>

1459
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.090
if you want to train to get combined striking grappling,

1460
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:13.050
you have to combine them together.
And you know,

1461
01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.790
if I've only mentioned it with do you do to scrubs on,
man,

1462
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.520
I've done a ton of MMA sparring with fighters,

1463
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.510
like a ton with gloves,
with big gloves,
shoot boxing,
little gloves,
everything.

1464
01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.690
And I don't know why.
I haven't talked about it much,
but yeah,

1465
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:28.680
I've done a ton of it.

1466
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:32.340
And that's how I know like taking someone down with that's trying to punch you

1467
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:36.110
is easier.
Uh,
now it sucks when you get punched.
No,

1468
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.230
but it is easier than going against someone that's just trying to wrestle you

1469
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.850
and has a different stance on lower stance and all that.
So yeah.
Um,

1470
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:45.330
that's how you do it.
You put,
you put,

1471
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.750
you put big gloves on and then also you can do,

1472
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:52.320
you can drill with big gloves on where someone was trying to punch you while

1473
01:29:52.321 --> 01:29:53.820
they're in your guard oil while you're punching,

1474
01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:56.220
while someone's trying to punch you while they're mounted.

1475
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:58.950
You can do that with slaps too,
right?

1476
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:00.900
Like I mount you and I'm just start slapping you.

1477
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:03.760
Cause then you realize if these were punches you'd be in serious trouble.
Yeah.

1478
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:08.370
So yeah,
you can mix those things in and mix them together.
Don't get hurt.

1479
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.790
Be careful.
But yeah,
you can definitely make some.

1480
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.430
So now the next question was how do the teams adapt to MMA back based trainings

1481
01:30:15.431 --> 01:30:19.320
as well.
The big concepts are the same.
The big concepts are exactly the same.

1482
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.580
You're going to have to close the distance.

1483
01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.650
Like if you've got someone that's unarmed that you're gonna need to get control

1484
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:24.780
of,
well you got to close the distance.
You've got to take him down,

1485
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:25.680
you've got to get control of them.

1486
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:29.130
You've got to submit him or subdue him somehow that that can happen.

1487
01:30:29.131 --> 01:30:30.960
You've got to be able to break away.
If somebody grabs you,

1488
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.670
you've got to be able to break away.

1489
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:33.900
You've got to be able to get up off the ground.

1490
01:30:33.901 --> 01:30:36.480
There's some large muscle movements that are exactly the same.

1491
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.060
The striking parts are exactly the same.
Someone's,
you know,

1492
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:42.480
you want to clear someone or or,
or you want to punch someone to get them,

1493
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:47.270
you know,
a little bit dis disoriented before you get controlling.
Yeah,
that's,

1494
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.310
that's,
that's what you're doing.
That's what,
that's what boxing is,
you know,

1495
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:53.690
and so those things aren't the,

1496
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:58.680
there's so much of it that overlaps that the adaption doesn't have to be barely

1497
01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:02.730
anything.
The adaption comes in and we have to do some additional training,

1498
01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:04.860
some additional concepts.
Is that you're moving with Iran,

1499
01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.680
that you have to be able to protect your weapons and your weapon systems.
So you,

1500
01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:13.710
you know,
you want to be aware of where your rifle is,
where your pistol is,

1501
01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:18.270
where your knife is,
so that people can't get ahold of it.
Mm.
Weapons retention.

1502
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:20.700
So that becomes part of it.
The,
the,

1503
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:24.510
the fact that you're working with another person,
usually a partner,

1504
01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:27.510
a shooting buddy that's [inaudible],
that's gonna cover move for you.

1505
01:31:27.511 --> 01:31:28.710
So if I go to take a guy down,

1506
01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:32.100
I got to be aware of where my partner is in case that person that I'm trying to

1507
01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:35.640
take down gets the upper hand or has a weapon that I didn't see so that my

1508
01:31:35.641 --> 01:31:36.840
partner can get a clear shot.

1509
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.080
So there are tactical things that you do have to add in,

1510
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:44.320
but the fundamental concepts,
there's,
there,
there are so transferable,

1511
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:49.140
there's so transferable that it's,
it's,
it's like,
you know,
I,

1512
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:54.540
it's a Gi and no GI,
right?
It's like,
Gee,
you know,
if someone is awesome at Ge,

1513
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:57.630
they're going to be good at Nogi and will.

1514
01:31:57.631 --> 01:32:00.640
Are there some concepts that you need to learn?
Yeah,
there's some little things,

1515
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.760
but there's an overlap is huge.
Baseball and softball,
right?
The,

1516
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.650
if someone played college baseball and now they're playing on their local

1517
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:11.440
restaurant softball team,
they're going to crush it,
right?

1518
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:15.220
It's not the exact same sport.
Longboard Surfing Versus Short Board Surfing.

1519
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.740
Right?
If someone's a great surfer on a short board,

1520
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:20.290
they're going to be decent on a longboard.
They might,
they're not good.

1521
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.330
They might not win the world champion.

1522
01:32:21.331 --> 01:32:25.960
Like if someone's awesome Nogi and they don't really train d,

1523
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.700
they're not going to win the worlds,
but there'll be,
there'll be damn good.

1524
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:35.650
One of the things that I used to,
well,
okay,

1525
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:37.840
shooting,
shooting,
you've got combat shooting,

1526
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:40.120
but then you just have competitive target shooter.
Right?

1527
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:44.200
Is competitive target shooting the same as combat shooting?
No.

1528
01:32:44.230 --> 01:32:47.130
There's no explosions.
There's no movement.
Or oftentimes,
I know there's,

1529
01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.960
there's competitions where they do a movement too,
and the more close it is,

1530
01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:50.620
the better it's going to be.

1531
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:55.620
But if you're a competitive rifle shooter and you and then you do combat

1532
01:32:56.630 --> 01:32:59.050
shooting,
it is definitely,
there's a ton of crossover.

1533
01:32:59.470 --> 01:33:02.800
One of the things that I used to talk about a lot when people would question,

1534
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:04.680
hey,
well MMA fighting as an ad,

1535
01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.610
it's not good for the seal teams cause you don't have any gear on.

1536
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:11.680
One of the examples that I used a lot was guys that were really into
parachuting.

1537
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:16.240
And you know when you,
when you jump in the civilian world,

1538
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:18.370
you don't have a rucksack,
you don't have a weapon,

1539
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:21.310
you don't have night vision goggles,
you don't have any of that stuff.

1540
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:26.950
And yet if you have a thousand jumps as a civilian with a slick Reagan,

1541
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:32.290
you're going to be infinitely better at the military.
Skydive with the,

1542
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:35.530
with the weapon and the rucksack and the night vision and all that,

1543
01:33:35.531 --> 01:33:38.980
you're going to be infinitely better.
It's the same exact thing.

1544
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:41.410
Are there some little things that you're gonna have to figure out some details

1545
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.760
where that,
where they don't completely overlap?
Yes,
absolutely.
Um,

1546
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.560
so there you go.
So I guess when you train Jujitsu,
wrestling,
boxing,

1547
01:33:50.561 --> 01:33:54.310
Muay Thai there,
if,
if you're in the military,

1548
01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:57.970
you know you also have to make sure that you carve out time where you think

1549
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:01.540
about the other components,
right?
About beer having gear on and what that,

1550
01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:04.210
what changes when you have your gear on and how to protect your weapons.

1551
01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:06.550
All that stuff that I talked about and I would go about working with other

1552
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:09.460
people about the tactical situations that you're in because there can be some

1553
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:11.530
tackles situations that you're in.
If you're not thinking right,

1554
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:14.100
you're going to have a problem you ever do you ever had somebody that goes well

1555
01:34:14.101 --> 01:34:16.050
did you do to smell good for self defense?
Cause what do you do?

1556
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.280
Pull Garden the street.
It's like,
no,

1557
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:22.210
you're never going to pull guard in the street or you shouldn't as if pulling

1558
01:34:22.211 --> 01:34:24.440
guard is like the only stuff.

1559
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.750
But here's the be well the fact is if someone takes you down in the street and

1560
01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:30.190
you don't know the guard,
what are you going to do?

1561
01:34:30.191 --> 01:34:32.380
You're going to get your face smashed.
Yes sir.

1562
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.100
So you got to cover both angles,

1563
01:34:36.101 --> 01:34:41.101
but there's so much overlap that if you get good at the fundamentals of MMA,

1564
01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.540
you will be really good at the what you need to know with the additional

1565
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:50.110
concepts on military tactical takes type situations.

1566
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.090
As far as modern army combatives,

1567
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:57.010
it's a great solid foundational program and created by,
uh,

1568
01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:57.973
some great,

1569
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.740
<v 2>great,
uh,
martial artists that were in ground floor.
I think Matt Larson,</v>

1570
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:07.340
he's the guy that did kind of,
is the grandfather of forefather of,

1571
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:10.010
I don't know if he's old enough to be grandfather.
He might even be my age still.

1572
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:12.410
I Dunno.
It's not really bad.
But yeah,

1573
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.360
I mean he put together a great system and it's a great fundamental system is

1574
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:20.540
could someone pick apart some aspect of the army because I'm sure you could.

1575
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:23.390
Yeah.
But you look at the whole system.
It's a great solid system.

1576
01:35:23.391 --> 01:35:26.870
Get people started out on,
so props,
I mean,

1577
01:35:26.871 --> 01:35:30.700
any system you can kind of say that for.
Yeah,
you can't,
you can't.

1578
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.030
And that's why it's important to,
that's why I said foundational system,
right?

1579
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.910
Because it's a great foundational system because once you learn it,
you don't,

1580
01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.940
you don't learn the Army combat the modern army combatives and then say,
okay,

1581
01:35:40.941 --> 01:35:43.790
well good,
now you don't need to train anymore.
That's not the right answer.

1582
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:46.970
The right answer is you have a good foundation now keep building on it.
Yeah,

1583
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:51.820
that's the answer.
Yeah.

1584
01:35:51.821 --> 01:35:56.580
I remember you train for MMA and pankration that

1585
01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:02.810
train for a while and the sparring element of it,
you know,

1586
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:05.500
the three feet,
cause there's,
you know,
even if you're training MMA,

1587
01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.770
you're going to change striking one day and maybe even specialized striking

1588
01:36:09.771 --> 01:36:10.910
stuff one day.
And then you know,

1589
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:15.290
wrestling and grappling and you do it through one day,
but you have MMA sparring,

1590
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.560
which is a full MMA fight with big gloves and you know,

1591
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:21.620
may or may not have shin pads or whatever,
but it's essentially MMA fight.

1592
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:25.810
And that is 100% incorporating grappling and striking and take that.

1593
01:36:25.811 --> 01:36:26.690
It's everything,
you know.

1594
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:31.070
So it was kinda like one of those things where you get to train to fill in those

1595
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:33.860
gaps between,
okay,
one moment I'm striking.
One moment.

1596
01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:37.910
I'm grappling and the strikes while you grappling and there's,
and there's some,

1597
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.890
there's some inconsistencies.

1598
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:44.000
Cause if you were striking with big gloves then you can't grab someone's hands

1599
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:47.210
the way you would with the little gloves on.
But you,
like you said,

1600
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:51.070
what it does is it fills in the gaps.
Yeah.
So yeah,
the training,

1601
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.950
that training is forced.
So like,
um,
you know,
if you're,
you know,

1602
01:36:54.951 --> 01:36:57.830
if you'd like to play guard or you have a slick game from garden or whatever,

1603
01:36:57.831 --> 01:37:01.370
if you train like an MMA training or training with strikes and stuff like that,

1604
01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.200
it'll really expose where you're in danger in a real fight because that guy's

1605
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:10.370
gonna you know,
that guy's going to punch you in the face down a lot.
So it us,

1606
01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:13.340
it's a faster pace thing.
So it just builds your awareness of it.

1607
01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:16.550
So I remember that,
that even when I just go back to regular digits or whatever,

1608
01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:19.670
it's like,
man,
I feel super aware of it.
Like almost like you're anticipating,

1609
01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:22.130
okay,
I can get punched from you.
Actually think about that all the time.

1610
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:27.260
Like I'll be rolling with Taylor and Chris Taylor is an like Andy,

1611
01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:30.050
I don't think about it as much because the Andes more of a Jujitsu fighter.

1612
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:33.200
But you know,
Taylor,
he's an MMA fighter.

1613
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:36.110
And so if he's on top of me for all round,

1614
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:39.590
like he's in my top half guard and when we get done I'll be like,

1615
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:43.390
I'm glad that wasn't him.
May cause you would pulverized in my head,
you know?

1616
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.360
And now do some gaps open up when people start punching.
Yeah,
they do.
Yeah.

1617
01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:52.280
Is there an opportunity?
Yeah there is.
But you're going to take some shots.
Yeah.

1618
01:37:52.281 --> 01:37:56.220
Well,
and then at the end of the day,
all that is part of it,
you know?

1619
01:37:56.221 --> 01:37:58.050
So it's like if you're,
if you're,
okay,

1620
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.380
so here's the scenario I'd find myself in where the guy I'm going to get to is a

1621
01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:04.980
way better striker than me.
Like way more experienced in just better,

1622
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.460
but my Jujitsu is way better.
So it's like,
Dang,

1623
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:12.600
I could get this guy to the ground.
So if we don't,
when we train this it,

1624
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.520
I get that practice to be okay,

1625
01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:17.760
I'm gonna use this guys striking to like get around them or something like that.

1626
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.490
I'm not going to like shine her and strike to strike with him and he'd beat up

1627
01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:21.261
this training session.

1628
01:38:21.261 --> 01:38:23.970
But you do have to stand there long enough to get them to think,

1629
01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.940
to get them to forget about you taking them down.
But yeah,
fully.

1630
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:29.350
That's what I always,
and you'd see that in MMA fights too,
right?

1631
01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:32.640
You can't just go in there and start shooting on the guy because they know that

1632
01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:34.790
you're gonna try and take them down because they know their ground game is
worse.

1633
01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:37.210
And so they're going to defend that tech down.
Exactly right.
And get,

1634
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:38.100
I'm thinking about,

1635
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.320
you've got to get them thinking about that knockout that they're going to knock

1636
01:38:40.321 --> 01:38:42.930
you out.
And sometimes it takes two minutes,
sometimes it takes three minutes.

1637
01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:46.080
Sometimes it takes a round and a half before you take your first shot yet.

1638
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:50.280
And really to be real with you,
it's,
that's what this training is for us.

1639
01:38:50.281 --> 01:38:53.250
So in the beginning you might not even be able to take that guy down because

1640
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:54.330
he's like,
oh I know this guy.

1641
01:38:54.331 --> 01:38:57.270
He's that Jujitsu guy now he's going to train with us.
He was right.

1642
01:38:57.271 --> 01:38:59.910
Take me down and he's just going to beat you up from the outside.
And actually,

1643
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:02.280
yeah,
what he'll do is he won't even beat you up.
He'll,

1644
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:05.460
he won't even commit to his punches cause he doesn't want to overstep and,

1645
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.290
and give you any advantage on your takedown.
Yeah.

1646
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.620
So he'll just sounded like you said Sam,
the outsides of attacking you.

1647
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.410
And I say that cause that's kind of what happened to me.

1648
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:17.010
So I'd go in and then of course they just stay away or sprawl cause they know

1649
01:39:17.011 --> 01:39:20.010
it's coming kind of thing.
And then you know,
as you reset from the straw sprawl,

1650
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:22.320
he'd put the one to kind of on the,
on the separation.

1651
01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.840
I don't read all that kind of stuff.
Yeah,
no big deal.

1652
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:27.100
One to crack just all around.
No,

1653
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:31.770
I'm saying it's funny because when you say,
you know,
you take a one,

1654
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:36.730
two is you're getting away,
but that punches big boy.
Big Boy real.
Yeah.

1655
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:38.280
But after a while,
that's what I'm saying.

1656
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:42.180
You get that training just through the genie and like,
okay,
I know how this is.

1657
01:39:42.181 --> 01:39:44.910
No,
I can't.
It's not like Jujitsu where I can kind of,
you know,

1658
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.940
just go and lock up and if I don't get to take the whole pull guard kind of

1659
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:50.430
thing,
these guys,
they're not trying to grapple with you.

1660
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:53.160
They're trying to send back up.
You get that training,
you know,

1661
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.650
so when you wind up,
you know,

1662
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.940
being able to take them down and all this stuff you can like,

1663
01:39:56.941 --> 01:40:00.420
you'll have just way more fun an advantage because you're aware of all these

1664
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:03.750
different elements that you,
you might not get in just Jujitsu class.

1665
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:05.580
You might get them,
but you probably probably don't.

1666
01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:09.270
You get a guy who always wants to stand up and Jujitsu class short.

1667
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:11.610
We'll roll with a guy in Jujitsu just straight you just to,

1668
01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.620
who only wants to stand up who just would rather die than be in the bottom?

1669
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:18.120
Hilstadt it's so annoying.
You know what I mean?
It's challenging.

1670
01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:20.160
It's something you need to learn to contend with because they are,

1671
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.430
there are tactics that you can use as the guy on top to keep them down there.

1672
01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:25.650
Exactly right,
and you get MMA guys,

1673
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:29.490
especially if you're better than them at like the Jujitsu element of it.

1674
01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:32.730
That's what they're going to do.
So that's the training you're going to get.

1675
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.600
Chuck Jocko,

1676
01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:43.350
as a leader of a team or business has decided to,

1677
01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:45.480
okay,
as a leader of a team,

1678
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:49.320
our business has decided to terminate one of my people.

1679
01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:53.160
I disagree with their logic,
but I'm not in a position to change the decision.

1680
01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.010
What should I do to

1681
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.960
<v 0>retain my influence to support the rest of my team yet not compromise my values?</v>

1682
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:03.880
That's a good question.
That's a solid question.
That's a tough question.

1683
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:08.700
It's a little bit tricky without the details of the situation.
But you know,
I,

1684
01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:13.240
I wonder what kind of relationship that did the person that asks a question,

1685
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:16.360
I wonder what kind of relationship you have with the senior leadership that

1686
01:41:16.361 --> 01:41:17.320
makes those decisions.

1687
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.500
Cause you got to remember that our goal is to always have the relationships up

1688
01:41:20.501 --> 01:41:23.530
the chain of command so that you can influence those decisions.

1689
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.920
And if you have that kind of relationship then you can find out why that

1690
01:41:26.921 --> 01:41:28.030
decision got made.

1691
01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:32.380
And there might be things that you didn't know about,

1692
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:36.120
some kind of strategic outcome that the decision,
you know,

1693
01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.520
has had an outback don't an impact on,
right.
So if you didn't know it,

1694
01:41:39.521 --> 01:41:43.690
but this guy had some kind of criminal situation going on and you didn't know it

1695
01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.380
and they can't talk about it cause it's in legal case.
Okay.
If you don't know,

1696
01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:48.790
don't speculate,

1697
01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:52.150
just go and ask and then you can take whatever those reasons aren't.

1698
01:41:52.151 --> 01:41:56.470
You can articulate them,
you know,
down the chain of command.
And again,

1699
01:41:56.471 --> 01:42:00.010
you want to,
you want to ask this question in a smart way.
You don't say,

1700
01:42:00.011 --> 01:42:03.820
what did bill get fired?
Hey,
why did bill get fired?
No,
you said,
hey,
you know,

1701
01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:06.220
from my perspective it seemed like bill was doing a good job.

1702
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:09.460
I want to kind of understand what you were seeing so that I can lead people

1703
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:11.710
better.
If there's anything that I could make up for,

1704
01:42:11.711 --> 01:42:14.230
I want to make sure I'm leading.
You know,
like all of those things you want to,

1705
01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:17.740
you want to help their ego and make them feel good and make them feel like

1706
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:19.840
you're on board with the program and not make them feel like you're going in

1707
01:42:19.841 --> 01:42:22.600
there questioning their call because that's just an attack on their ego.

1708
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.810
So this is the,
all these things.
It's a basic things,
right?
The Fun of it.

1709
01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.960
He called it basic.
These are the fundamental things,
right?
This is the,

1710
01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:32.530
this is the way it is standard.
I should just say standard.

1711
01:42:32.531 --> 01:42:34.910
That's what I should say.
Standard stuff.
You,

1712
01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.360
you're trying to build a relationship.
You don't want to go in,

1713
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:38.920
but your head up against their ego.

1714
01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:41.500
Then they get more defensive and next to know they're going to fire.

1715
01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:43.540
Another one of your guys on your team,
just to prove a point.

1716
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:47.980
You can get yourself,
you can dig yourself that hole,
but if you make your goal,

1717
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:49.870
hey,
I'm going to build the relationship with my boss,

1718
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.990
that's what you are trying to do.
Now,

1719
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.380
if you find out why,
then you can articulate that to the rest of the team and,

1720
01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.450
and the way that you maintain your values is by maintaining your values.
Okay.

1721
01:43:04.451 --> 01:43:08.530
So just because there's a situation that are decision that gets made that you

1722
01:43:08.531 --> 01:43:11.680
don't agree with,
doesn't mean that you compromise your values.

1723
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.820
Like your boss can make a decision and that does that,
that you don't agree with.

1724
01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:19.120
That doesn't mean that your values are compromised unless it's like an illegal

1725
01:43:19.121 --> 01:43:23.830
or it's an immoral or it's an unethical situation,
which by the way,

1726
01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:26.230
a firing could be one of those things,
right?

1727
01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:30.870
The guy could be firing because he wasn't,
you know what wouldn't hae,

1728
01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:35.140
he wouldn't give me the keys to the vehicle for the weekend so I could use it on

1729
01:43:35.141 --> 01:43:39.790
my private time and I'm going to fire him now.
Like that's unethical,
right?

1730
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:40.391
There's a problem there.

1731
01:43:40.391 --> 01:43:44.220
So now your values definitely if you just remained silently,

1732
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.480
you're kind of compromising your values.

1733
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.110
So there are times when you may have to stand up,
but bosses make decisions.

1734
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:53.210
That's what they do and we do our best to influence them.

1735
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.210
Now if they decide something we don't like,
then yes,

1736
01:43:56.211 --> 01:43:58.940
we ask why and if we don't like it,
their explanation,

1737
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:01.100
then we try and explain our case.

1738
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:06.101
We try and explain why we thought bill should have been not been fired.

1739
01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:10.640
Now you're not always going to be right.
You're not always going to be right.

1740
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.660
And let me tell you something else.
Don't argue about six in one half dozen.

1741
01:44:14.661 --> 01:44:17.450
The other bill might've been on the fence and Nate decided,
you know what?

1742
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.040
We've had enough trouble with bill.
We're getting rid of them.

1743
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:21.950
And maybe there's valid reasons why bill should have said,

1744
01:44:21.951 --> 01:44:25.730
but it's like it could have gone at 60 40 are you going to put your reputation

1745
01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:29.390
and your relationship with your boss on the line for over that little thing?

1746
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:33.740
Now again,
I understand firing people is a big deal.
It's not small.

1747
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:36.980
It's not a little thing.
Hmm.
Especially you have a good relationship.

1748
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:40.100
He's on your team.
He's got kids.
You know,
I like all these things are there.

1749
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:44.990
So what are you going to do about it?
Are you going to break down and,

1750
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:50.020
and negatively impact your relationship with your boss over this so that in the

1751
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:52.250
future you have even less influence.

1752
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.060
What happens when they go to fire Mike and you haven't and all you did was go,

1753
01:44:56.061 --> 01:44:57.320
hey,
why'd you do this?
This was stupid.

1754
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:59.030
Taking a fire Mike and they're not gonna listen to a damn thing.

1755
01:44:59.031 --> 01:45:03.020
You said you want to build a relationship with him.
Um,

1756
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:05.180
<v 3>okay.</v>

1757
01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:05.780
<v 0>You can,</v>

1758
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:10.280
you can explain what your viewpoint is and what you would have done.

1759
01:45:10.281 --> 01:45:12.560
Now this is like down,
this is talking to your team.

1760
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:15.620
You can explain what your viewpoint was and what you would have done,

1761
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:20.510
but you also,
you don't want to,
you don't want to,
you want to be gentle,
right?

1762
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:22.340
As long as you explain,
if you explain the,
Hey,

1763
01:45:22.341 --> 01:45:24.770
I would have done something different.
And you,
you also explained that the boss,

1764
01:45:24.771 --> 01:45:25.880
it was a tough decision.

1765
01:45:25.881 --> 01:45:29.390
And the boss made the call and that the best thing that we can do as a team is

1766
01:45:29.391 --> 01:45:33.590
support the boss so we can garner more influence over these situations in the

1767
01:45:33.591 --> 01:45:35.030
future.
That's good.

1768
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1769
01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.531
<v 0>And you know what?</v>

1770
01:45:38.531 --> 01:45:42.430
One of the best things you could do here with your team is you can even explain

1771
01:45:42.431 --> 01:45:46.660
that it's your fault.
That decision got made,
right?
You say,
look,

1772
01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:49.180
I haven't built a good enough relationship with the boss.

1773
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:53.050
That's why he fired bill.
I am working on it.
I'm going to do it better.

1774
01:45:53.710 --> 01:45:56.140
We're going to give them the support that he needs so we can stop this thing

1775
01:45:56.141 --> 01:45:58.180
from having this type of thing from happening in the future.

1776
01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:01.840
So you don't want to throw your boss under the bus.
It's much,

1777
01:46:01.841 --> 01:46:05.530
much better to take ownership of it all day,
all day.

1778
01:46:05.770 --> 01:46:08.800
If you throw your boss under the bus and you create an antagonistic
relationship,

1779
01:46:08.801 --> 01:46:11.800
it's bad for you.
It's bad for your boss and it's bad for your team.

1780
01:46:11.801 --> 01:46:13.150
It's bad for your whole organization.

1781
01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.710
I get it.

1782
01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:22.860
And there's a dichotomy here because if your boss totally fired someone with not

1783
01:46:23.681 --> 01:46:27.460
good reason and it was a great guy,
and if you just jump on board at the boss,

1784
01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:32.290
you're going to look weak.
So do you have to balance that?
Yes.

1785
01:46:32.291 --> 01:46:34.870
You have to be honest with your people.
You have to explain what's going on.

1786
01:46:34.871 --> 01:46:36.940
That's why I think taking ownership is one of the best things to do.

1787
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:39.970
Your boss does something that's totally out of line.
Hey look,

1788
01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.940
here's what the boss did.
This is my fault and here's what we do to fix it.

1789
01:46:42.941 --> 01:46:44.870
I'm gonna build a better relationship.
I'm going to get more influence.

1790
01:46:44.871 --> 01:46:46.660
That's what I need to do.
I obviously let you guys down.

1791
01:46:46.661 --> 01:46:48.470
I'm not gonna let it happen again.
Hmm.

1792
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.940
That brings your team closer to you rather than saying,

1793
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:58.310
Hey,
the boss was Boston idiot.
He doesn't get it.
You gotta be a,

1794
01:46:58.311 --> 01:47:00.330
people don't actually even respect that,
by the way.

1795
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.070
They don't actually even respect that.
Yeah.
I'm not saying they say,
hey,

1796
01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:07.800
that's a boss's decision and that's,
you know what?
We just support the boss.

1797
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:11.250
I'm not saying that it's a dichotomy.
It's a balance that you have to,

1798
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:16.140
you have to carefully walk,
compromise,

1799
01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:20.970
compromise on decisions and directions and plants doesn't hurt.
You know,

1800
01:47:20.971 --> 01:47:24.210
he's talking about compromising.
It's like he compromises.
Okay.

1801
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:28.800
That's what it is.
It's compromise.
Okay.
Again,

1802
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:33.270
as long as you're not compromising your personal values,
your ethics,

1803
01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:36.510
but compromising about a decision.
That's the way the world works.

1804
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:41.730
Don't let your ego get into it.
Don't let your ego.
So keep building,

1805
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.960
keep building relationships,

1806
01:47:42.961 --> 01:47:45.870
take ownership in the decisions and support the team.

1807
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:47.160
Keep building relationships,

1808
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.690
not just up the chain of command but down so that you can bring it all to
gather.

1809
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:57.360
Next question.
Go question frog man.

1810
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:04.670
Do you think it's always a bad thing to be thought of as slightly unapproachable

1811
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:07.430
as a leader?
Yeah.

1812
01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.860
So this is another question about the dichotomy of leadership is another

1813
01:48:10.861 --> 01:48:13.860
question about balance.
And it's a strangely worded question by the way,

1814
01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:14.370
from this,

1815
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:19.370
this a Scotsman who I know it's he cause he uses the question,

1816
01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:25.650
he used the word always and usually always is always a never.
Right.

1817
01:48:25.651 --> 01:48:30.270
When you use those,
they usually don't hold up as a,
it always a bad thing,

1818
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:32.160
but then he kind of,

1819
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:36.540
he kind of softens the always by by saying slightly on a project also.

1820
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:41.100
So we give him a,
a fairly low grade on his question.

1821
01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:48.300
Uh,
but luckily that the concept of the question,
we give him a high grade,

1822
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:52.890
which is,
is it,
is it,
is it,

1823
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:55.920
should you be unapproachable,
slightly unapproachable?
Should you be,

1824
01:48:55.921 --> 01:48:59.700
that's the real question.
Should you be slightly unapproachable as a leader?
Well,

1825
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.640
there's,
this is,
this is a question about dichotomy.

1826
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.010
The question is about balance.

1827
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:08.280
Do you want to have people approach you about every little problem or issue as a

1828
01:49:08.281 --> 01:49:11.760
boss?
Do you want to have that happen?
No.
You don't know,
right?

1829
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.110
Do you want to be the easy button where you have to answer every single question

1830
01:49:16.111 --> 01:49:18.930
and make every decision?
If you're too approachable,

1831
01:49:18.931 --> 01:49:22.410
that's where you're going to find yourself.
Now,
at the same time,

1832
01:49:22.411 --> 01:49:23.730
at the other end of the spectrum,

1833
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.300
do you want your team to never approach you ever because you're on approachable?

1834
01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.390
Yeah.
No,
you don't want that.
Do you want them to,

1835
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:35.100
to be scared or intimidated from giving you good,

1836
01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:38.460
honest feedback or good suggestions about the way you're doing things?
Do you,

1837
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.540
do you not want that to happen because you're too unapproachable?
Of course not.

1838
01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:46.290
So those are the dichotomies.
You can be too,

1839
01:49:46.630 --> 01:49:48.490
too approachable and be the easy button.

1840
01:49:48.491 --> 01:49:52.060
Or you can be too aloof and too distant and too unapproachable that you don't

1841
01:49:52.061 --> 01:49:54.160
even know what's happening on the front lines and you don't get any input from

1842
01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:56.080
them.
The extremes are bad.

1843
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:59.140
So what you want to do is you want to bounce those two dichotomies,

1844
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:02.740
<v 1>be in the middle,
be approachable,</v>

1845
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.920
but not overly approachable and you'll be good.

1846
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.620
Pretty straight forward.
I think we got time for one more.
Sure.

1847
01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.093
Jocko,

1848
01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.100
<v 0>what do you do when you're broken?</v>

1849
01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.490
<v 1>What do I do when I'm broken?</v>

1850
01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:29.963
I'm broken.

1851
01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:38.770
I relish it.
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to use it

1852
01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.653
because

1853
01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.030
<v 0>if I'm broken,
then I just found my limitations.</v>

1854
01:50:48.170 --> 01:50:51.860
And until I know what my limitations are,

1855
01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:56.890
how can I push me?
How can I get better?

1856
01:50:59.390 --> 01:51:03.830
But once,
once I see it,

1857
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:09.050
once I feel it,
once I see where I was broken,

1858
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:12.020
then I can attack that weakness.

1859
01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.780
I can fill in that gap.

1860
01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:19.010
I can reinforce that breach.

1861
01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.460
If you break,

1862
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:30.870
it means it's time to fortify your wheel to make it stronger.

1863
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:40.160
They look,
there's,
there's all kinds of different ways to break.

1864
01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:45.040
You can break physically,
you can break mentally,

1865
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:47.110
you can break your heart,

1866
01:51:47.111 --> 01:51:52.111
you can break your spirit and none of those are fun and all of those are going

1867
01:51:52.191 --> 01:51:53.650
to leave a mark.

1868
01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:03.290
But the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory.

1869
01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.300
Or it can be the mark of defeat

1870
01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:14.200
because every time you break in,
in every way that you break,

1871
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.930
while it's a chance,

1872
01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.960
it's definitely a chance for you to give up and for you to just to fall apart.

1873
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:29.620
But there's also opportunity,

1874
01:52:31.730 --> 01:52:36.730
there's opportunity to get stronger and get smarter and get faster and get

1875
01:52:38.631 --> 01:52:43.610
tougher and get more stable and get more resilient and get

1876
01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.340
<v 1>okay</v>

1877
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.173
<v 0>better.</v>

1878
01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:55.150
When you break,

1879
01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:03.060
you have the opportunity to show the world the whole world what you are really

1880
01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.750
made off.

1881
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:17.430
So,
so if you break,
if you break,

1882
01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:21.360
the fight isn't over.

1883
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:30.200
In fact,
if you break,
the fight is just beginning

1884
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:37.450
and as you are all up and out of that dismal and wretched place covered and

1885
01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:46.691
you're covered in blood and sweat and dirt and filth as you rise above what you

1886
01:53:49.041 --> 01:53:49.874
were

1887
01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:58.020
and as you take the form of of who you are supposed to be,

1888
01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:07.980
you will see that in the very act of standing up in the very act of fighting on

1889
01:54:09.730 --> 01:54:13.000
you will become a and you will remain

1890
01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.313
unbroken.

1891
01:54:24.250 --> 01:54:28.780
<v 2>And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
So</v>

1892
01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.630
Echo Charles,

1893
01:54:31.690 --> 01:54:36.690
speaking of getting stronger and faster and tougher and better.

1894
01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:39.580
Sure.
Better.

1895
01:54:40.150 --> 01:54:45.150
Maybe you got some ways we could support ourselves with those goals.

1896
01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:50.860
Facilitate getting better and stronger.
I like it.

1897
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:54.100
Pushed the breaking point.
I'll tell you that.
That'll push a breaking point.

1898
01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:57.970
Especially the,
the joint warfare part,
the whole thing coming,
right?

1899
01:54:57.971 --> 01:55:01.540
They're coming in hot.
No,
that's okay.

1900
01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.600
So we'll start with the origin,
right?
Origin American made.
Yeah,

1901
01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.010
we're,
we're at the origin immersion camp right now.

1902
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:10.420
We're sorry that you're not here.

1903
01:55:11.730 --> 01:55:15.460
Actually we're up here in Maine or we're happy that you are here or yeah,

1904
01:55:15.461 --> 01:55:17.140
if you're here,
we're happy you're here.
Yeah,
definitely.

1905
01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:19.870
There's a lot of people in the game.
There's a lot of people in the game.

1906
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.150
A lot of people heard us say on the podcast,

1907
01:55:22.151 --> 01:55:25.330
come to the origin camp and they're here and guess what?
In the forums it.
Yep.

1908
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:29.080
Yeah.
And for us it's awesome.
Yeah.
Every level.
How many black belts are here?

1909
01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.320
Dang,
I don't know.
A lot.
Yeah.
And how many white belts are here?
A lot.
Yeah.

1910
01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:35.920
How many people have never trained you to a lot?

1911
01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:39.920
A decent number to put into context.
This is the,

1912
01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:44.280
I think we had to do this right or,
or we just nonetheless,
this is what we did.

1913
01:55:44.281 --> 01:55:45.750
We're breaking up.
Yeah.
So we're,

1914
01:55:45.751 --> 01:55:49.290
everyone convenes in the morning right before on the big mats and they're like,

1915
01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:53.610
hey,
who hasn't had any experience at all?

1916
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.330
Or you know,
under a however a month or a month or something like that.

1917
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:00.690
Go with Jocko guys over here to this other Matt.

1918
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:05.880
The other Matt was full.
It was full.
So
the point is,

1919
01:56:05.881 --> 01:56:08.430
it's not just like people who want to just,
you know,

1920
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:11.700
get after their Jujitsu game and they'd been in it for,
you know,

1921
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:15.750
years and years and they want to camp out and do Jujitsu.
It's not that.
Yeah.

1922
01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:18.660
And it's cool.
There's a lot of different instruments.
Like,
yes.

1923
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.670
Like yesterday the deco and I taught the top the new Jujitsu people.

1924
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:28.110
Yeah.
Today.
Yeah.
I think it was the deco and Hoffa and I stayed down with the,

1925
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:32.370
the,
the colored belts.
Right.
I think there's,

1926
01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:37.460
I think there's probably the same number of black belts here as people that

1927
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:43.140
their first day ever on the mats was here.

1928
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:46.890
Yeah.
I think it's about the same number.
What,
like 2020 of each,

1929
01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:50.340
20 people that have never trained you just to move forward and 20 people to have

1930
01:56:50.341 --> 01:56:52.500
their black belts in Jiu Jitsu.
There's like those two.

1931
01:56:52.501 --> 01:56:55.740
And then there's everyone in between this guy.
Um,
I was talking to this guy,

1932
01:56:55.770 --> 01:56:59.250
he's like,
he goes,
yeah,
today's my second day.
I was like,
Oh yeah.
Right on.

1933
01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:02.160
Where were,
you know,
when was your first day where it was?
He goes,
Oh yeah,
here.

1934
01:57:02.161 --> 01:57:06.870
Yesterday.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
I forgot.
I came one day after.
He is sweet.
Crazy.

1935
01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:10.560
But that's where we are right now.
Or if everyone did the factory.
Yeah.

1936
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:15.420
The orange factory in Farmington,
Maine saw where everything is made.

1937
01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:20.160
Yeah.
Big Time.
So what do we have?
GIES rash guard.
There's a new,

1938
01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:25.110
you guys were extra fired up about extra,
extra fired.
Oh,
was that,

1939
01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:29.860
is that a deal thing?
It's,
well,
we can't show anybody,
but we do have a,

1940
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.330
a new g coming.
Yeah.
And we'll say it's,

1941
01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:37.170
it's very awesome.
Legit.
Yeah.
Nonetheless.

1942
01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.660
Have origin.
The best gs.
The best geese.
Hands down.
Everyone knows already.

1943
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:45.120
It's like,
what do you call it is common knowledge anyway.
Made in America.

1944
01:57:45.810 --> 01:57:50.310
100% made in America.
Also rash guards,
all kinds of stuff.
Those shorts,

1945
01:57:50.311 --> 01:57:54.490
those new shorts,
they came out with approved big time.
Yeah.

1946
01:57:54.970 --> 01:57:59.160
But yeah,
they got some,
some sweat suits to joggers,
shirts and whatnot.
Oh,

1947
01:57:59.161 --> 01:58:03.570
good stuff.
Supplements.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,
the supplements,

1948
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:06.940
these are supplements that,
well,

1949
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.240
how do I pick what supplements I'm going to make?

1950
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:13.980
It's supplements that I've taken and dial them in the protein,

1951
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:18.390
the milk tastes good is good.

1952
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.740
No sugar.
What's it got one carb to carbs,
something like that.
Yeah,

1953
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:27.150
something like that.
I think just a little tasty dessert.

1954
01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:31.990
What is really where you were talking about joint warfare.

1955
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.420
[inaudible] drone warfare.
We got Krill oil.
All good.
We got discipline.

1956
01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.410
You're pre,
I saw a lot of people drinking discipline,
like heading to the maps.

1957
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:42.370
A lot of people that day as I plan.
Yeah man,

1958
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.340
someone said it was in that big cooler.
I didn't go over there and check.

1959
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:49.480
That would make sense.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
so as we get that,

1960
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:54.130
that's origin main.
What'd you mean?
Dot Com.
You get all that.
That's our company.

1961
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:57.370
We're making all this stuff and we're gonna keep making stuff until,

1962
01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.800
until we make everything that we use.
That's the goal.
Yeah.

1963
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:05.800
Yeah.
And these are especially the joint stuff man,
that the joint stuff,

1964
01:59:05.801 --> 01:59:10.801
one is the one that it's like an everyday go to in my case it that's monk to

1965
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:15.450
where I every day and pounding Moca on the mulching.
And and you,

1966
01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.820
you surprised me earlier cause I asked you because you always say you're on the

1967
01:59:18.821 --> 01:59:22.780
milk train fully,
fully or you say you're fully on the milk train usually.
Yeah.

1968
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:24.790
Usually you say you're on the milk train fully

1969
01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:31.000
and I asked you could someone be partially on the milk train and you said that

1970
01:59:31.001 --> 01:59:32.380
that was in fact possible.

1971
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:37.060
I don't know how that's possible but well you know how many milk,

1972
01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:41.710
how many moke a de certifies you as being on the milk train?

1973
01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:45.970
At least one a day.
Okay.
That's pretty,
that's doable model.
That's not crazy.

1974
01:59:46.090 --> 01:59:48.670
But if you're pounding the milk every day,

1975
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:52.990
that's the monk train regardless when you're mostly on the mall.
Okay.

1976
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:57.220
That's a Mocha is fully on the mock trip.
That's like two,
sometimes three.

1977
01:59:58.350 --> 02:00:00.010
Imagine.
So basically with every meal,

1978
02:00:00.011 --> 02:00:04.990
two scoops not to hit two situations.
To me,

1979
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:09.670
two scoops is minerals.
That's one drink middle school.

1980
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:12.700
See that's the thing is I've got this new thing where I do these little hitters

1981
02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.650
situation.
Theo von,
we're hanging out.

1982
02:00:16.651 --> 02:00:18.670
We were talking about to hit us but he doesn't even know about more.

1983
02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:22.180
I got to send him some milk so we can have a hit her.
I hit her is one scoop,

1984
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:25.060
one scoop.
It doesn't,
that's a thing is it doesn't make,

1985
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:30.040
cause when I have a double shot of milk,
I'm full bright.
There's no,

1986
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:33.880
there's no room.
I,
you know,
I'm not an animal.

1987
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:37.330
Take some time to digest.
Right.
If that's a meal,

1988
02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:40.780
basically you just day to stake a big one.
That's how I feel.

1989
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:46.440
Well now if I have a one scoop hitter just to get one of those hit us,

1990
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:50.830
they hit her then then you can go.
Yeah,
you can keep moving.

1991
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:53.200
You can work out like 45 minutes later you can be in the gym.

1992
02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:56.410
Could be on the map.
That makes sense.
Actually.
Now that I'm thinking about it,

1993
02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:00.190
I don't take it like I'll do it for every time.
Like if I work out,

1994
02:01:00.191 --> 02:01:05.050
that's all eat after.
I work out well most of the time,
but okay.

1995
02:01:05.051 --> 02:01:07.090
So here's the situation.
Got Home the other day,

1996
02:01:07.091 --> 02:01:10.210
woke up at old crappy hotel somewhere early in the morning,
early morning flight.

1997
02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:11.163
Woke up,

1998
02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:14.230
didn't work out at the hotel early morning cause I knew I was heading back to my

1999
02:01:14.231 --> 02:01:17.740
house where I could be in my home gym.
So wait,
it got homeless hungry.

2000
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.900
Did a hitter did it.
Okay.
Yeah cause I was hung cause the neck the night before,

2001
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:26.760
guess what didn't eat,
why didn't it was working,
so got home,
it was,
I don't know,

2002
02:01:26.761 --> 02:01:28.840
it was like Tan got home,

2003
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:34.350
wanted to wanting to eat something but still wanted to work out before lunch

2004
02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.010
hitter.
Okay,
makes sense.
Yeah.
And then boom,

2005
02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:39.950
still got work to do.

2006
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:44.120
I think that's why I come on time payment wasn't that hungry?
Yeah.
The header.

2007
02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:49.070
So you just sort of fit it in your whole thing but yeah.

2008
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:52.370
And then consider the joint warfare and the Krill oil boom every day.

2009
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:56.600
Joint squared away.
Yeah.
I didn't mean for that to rhyme,
but it does.

2010
02:01:56.750 --> 02:02:00.950
So all good skills.
Also good way to support.
We have a store.

2011
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.590
Technically Jocko has a store.

2012
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:07.670
I helped make it so we have a store affirmative.
Either way.

2013
02:02:07.671 --> 02:02:12.170
It's called chocolate store rash guards are available.

2014
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:16.720
Rash guards under Aggie?
Yes or no?
What's your opinion?
Well yeah,

2015
02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:19.540
whatever you like.
First of all.
Some people mandate it.
Oh,

2016
02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:21.110
there's some schools that it is mandatory.

2017
02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:23.600
You will wear a rash guard under your gay.
Okay.

2018
02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.130
There are some schools where you're not allowed to are you lot can you where I'm

2019
02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.480
an attorney at some tournaments you're allowed to,

2020
02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:31.760
some tournaments are not allowed to.
There's some rules out there.

2021
02:02:32.210 --> 02:02:35.660
So find that out and then you can get one of these rash guards that say

2022
02:02:35.661 --> 02:02:39.070
something on,
I'm like God after it or something like that.
Yup.

2023
02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.460
And Yeah,
rash guards,
tee shirts.

2024
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:45.000
You can get hats.
Yeah,

2025
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:49.430
I'm good to have on their flex fit if you're into it.
Okay.

2026
02:02:49.431 --> 02:02:52.180
Jackals not into flex fit.
Okay.
I Degas did it.

2027
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:55.760
We figured out the numbers yet to figure out what's more popular.
No.
Which one?

2028
02:02:55.761 --> 02:02:58.850
Which one do people like more?
We don't know yet.
We don't know yet.
I don't know.

2029
02:02:58.851 --> 02:03:02.540
I remember the family member,
the flex fit phase,
but I think we're out of it,
man.

2030
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.270
I think we're back to,
I think everyone in Americans back to truckers.

2031
02:03:05.690 --> 02:03:08.210
That's kind of what we're doing now.
I think that's what America,

2032
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:10.530
I think America is on board with trucker hats.
I could be wrong though.

2033
02:03:10.531 --> 02:03:15.050
Cause we know my fashion sense is completely in the doughnut.
Yeah,

2034
02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.730
you're right.
You said about that.
So yeah,
I dunno.
I'll find out and report back.

2035
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:21.200
But if you want a shirt,

2036
02:03:21.201 --> 02:03:24.650
you know these shirts then the ones that say discipline equals freedom.
Boom.

2037
02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:29.450
That's where you can get them chocolate store.
Also the one with jock head on it.

2038
02:03:30.170 --> 02:03:35.090
This is good.
More than a few people have said,

2039
02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:36.800
hey man,
I really like you know your stuff,

2040
02:03:36.801 --> 02:03:39.120
but I'm not wearing to share with your giant head on it and I'm not.

2041
02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.410
It's not for everybody,
for everyone,
not for everybody.
Somebody said,
hey,

2042
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:45.740
is there a shirt with your head on it?
To me?

2043
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.550
Oh and it reminded me a while.
Yes it is.

2044
02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:54.280
John designed the Dang.
Sure.
Yeah.

2045
02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:58.960
So that's one little factoid.
What's a factoid?
Small fast,

2046
02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:01.550
small factor that many people don't know.

2047
02:04:01.551 --> 02:04:04.900
A lot of the designs that we're part of like,
you know,

2048
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:09.490
echelon front and you know some of these designs,
jock,
jock,

2049
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:12.230
you made the designs.
You didn't make the official one,

2050
02:04:12.231 --> 02:04:16.940
but you with your left hand or whatever.
Drew the design concept is mine.

2051
02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.960
Yeah.
Your concept is mine.
But you physically drew it though.
That's the thing.

2052
02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:24.980
Like you said,
hey,
I want it to do this and no,
you know,
you like drew it out.

2053
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:26.240
A picture's worth a thousand words.

2054
02:04:26.241 --> 02:04:27.700
I'm not writing you a thousand word paragraph.

2055
02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:28.990
And what that echelon front segment,

2056
02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:33.260
what's the Jocko podcast thing is going to look like or what the Jocko white
tea,

2057
02:04:33.261 --> 02:04:36.680
whatever.
Couldn't draw it.
There it is.
Do it.
Yeah.

2058
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:41.190
So you're technically a designer.
You're the idea guy,
eh?
Yeah.

2059
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:44.820
People don't know that.
Now they do.
And then the last is called Jocko store.com.

2060
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.480
Yeah.
Men Get something represent big time.
Big Time.

2061
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:53.810
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes and stitcher.

2062
02:04:54.181 --> 02:04:57.680
If you have android,
that's the big one for android.
Okay.
Yes,

2063
02:04:58.130 --> 02:05:00.330
I think the iTunes or for Android,
I dunno,
either way,

2064
02:05:00.331 --> 02:05:03.870
whatever you use to stream podcasts,

2065
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:05.640
subscribe if you haven't already.

2066
02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:08.850
Don't forget about the warrior kid podcast working on,

2067
02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:13.910
we've got 16 out right now,
I think maybe 17 out right now.
But anyways,

2068
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.000
more common on that and a lot of the good feedback I'm getting is that the kids

2069
02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:20.250
want to listen to them over and over and over again,
which is Kinda cool.

2070
02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:25.410
So I'll make more so kids can listen to more of them.
And there's stuff in there.

2071
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:27.540
It's uncle Jake answering questions.

2072
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:31.470
You might think it's like questions up for a little tiny kids that you don't get

2073
02:05:31.471 --> 02:05:35.400
anything out of.
I think was just talking to some people at Camp,

2074
02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.390
the shocking this one,
one girl and she was saying,
yeah,
she's like,

2075
02:05:39.391 --> 02:05:42.750
I'm totally into the warrior kid podcasts.
Yeah,
a,
come on.
Amen.

2076
02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:46.080
Number 10 right now it's really good.
So those questions are for everybody.

2077
02:05:46.081 --> 02:05:47.580
I'm like,
Hey,
right on it.
So yeah,

2078
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.010
Uncle Jake has a little something to teach everybody,
you know.

2079
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:53.700
And that's the way it is.
Also Youtube.
We've got youtube,
youtube channel.

2080
02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:57.000
If you want to see echoes,
legit videos.
We also,
oh,

2081
02:05:57.001 --> 02:05:59.610
the videos we spoke of so we'll get,
we need to get those done.

2082
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:04.230
Maybe when we get back to San Diego.
Yeah,
the two um,
life chance column.

2083
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:09.030
Yeah.
I want to say life changing but they two instructional life videos.

2084
02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:13.260
Yeah.
About tips.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
Yeah,
that's,
that's much more appropriate.

2085
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.290
That's good.
So you can also see echoes,

2086
02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:21.520
legit videos,
enhanced enhanced videos too.

2087
02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.470
Yeah,
youtube is good.

2088
02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:29.480
A good way to support also on it on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko by the way,

2089
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:32.070
that's where you can get good workout gear.

2090
02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:35.040
Legit work up here when a very up your workout.

2091
02:06:35.070 --> 02:06:37.650
Also they have a lot of cool other stuff.

2092
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:42.900
There's this tribe blend peanut butter,
not peanut butter.
It's peanut butter,

2093
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:45.960
almond butter and I think cashew.

2094
02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:50.790
So it's like an enhanced peanut butter scenario.
That's what you use it for.

2095
02:06:50.791 --> 02:06:53.730
It's good.
Anyway,
they got a lot of cool stuff on there like that,

2096
02:06:53.731 --> 02:06:57.090
like warrior bars and whatnot.
Where at bars can be.
It's like a

2097
02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:03.180
beef jerky but not jerky.
It's like a look at it.
It's good.

2098
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:04.130
Super um,

2099
02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:09.560
dance in like protein and nutrient scenario anyway on it.com/joe.

2100
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:10.980
Good spot.

2101
02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:15.090
Don't forget we've got the psychological psychological warfare album that you

2102
02:07:15.091 --> 02:07:17.580
can get that has discussions,

2103
02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:22.980
tracks if you will about how to overcome some moments of weakness that you might

2104
02:07:22.981 --> 02:07:25.710
hit.
And we are working on the next one.

2105
02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:30.870
We're not quite there yet so we're working on it.

2106
02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:35.070
But yeah,
psychological warfare,
it's,
you can get that anywhere.
Itunes,
Google,

2107
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:39.340
whatever MP3 platforms are out there.
Yeah,
to get them all.

2108
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:43.420
So Jocko white tea.
Yes,
they'll phenomenon.

2109
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.720
It's funny like I know and people know Randy.

2110
02:07:46.721 --> 02:07:50.530
I know it never really was into tea actually.
Even when the,
the,

2111
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:53.960
what do you call it,
the dry to dry him.
I was like cool.
Cause I was,
you know,

2112
02:07:53.970 --> 02:07:55.990
I'm on the bus.
You were just,
you were just playing,

2113
02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:58.750
you're just going along with it,
which it to away game.
They,

2114
02:07:58.751 --> 02:08:01.750
here's the thing though,
I was going along with it.
I was giving,
I was like,

2115
02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:04.840
what do you call him to come back and listen to those podcasts and see if you

2116
02:08:04.841 --> 02:08:06.340
are trying to act like you in the game.

2117
02:08:06.341 --> 02:08:09.970
Even though that we now know you weren't going to make you whole your whole
deal.

2118
02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:13.240
Suspect foot put it this way.
I was in the game,
but it was like,

2119
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:14.800
because I was like on the hype train.

2120
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:17.140
You know how you know how like when I was like,
hey man,
everybody,
hey,

2121
02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:19.930
everyone's doing this new thing and you're like,
oh you,
I'm down there.

2122
02:08:19.931 --> 02:08:22.480
That just made you sound worse.
Well,
hey man,

2123
02:08:22.481 --> 02:08:24.940
that's the truth and everyone's going to be higher.

2124
02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:27.340
We even know what you're saying right now.
It's true about it.

2125
02:08:27.450 --> 02:08:30.820
Well maybe it's all hype.
Maybe,
maybe not.
You've got to find out for yourself.

2126
02:08:30.821 --> 02:08:34.270
That's the thing.
That's the question.

2127
02:08:36.450 --> 02:08:41.410
So I take it,
I'm like,
hey,
cool,
cool.
But it kind of,
you know,
kind of wore off.

2128
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:44.530
I don't drink tea that much,
but they cans came out and then what am I doing?

2129
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:47.770
Pounding,
tricking tea all day.
Is that height?
No,

2130
02:08:47.771 --> 02:08:50.410
because I wouldn't be pounding it in every day.
See what I'm saying?

2131
02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:55.980
You wouldn't be texting me for more boxes to be delivered to your home if you

2132
02:08:56.291 --> 02:09:00.130
weren't in the actual teacher in.
Yeah,
we wouldn't be running out.

2133
02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:03.010
I'll tell you that.
That wouldn't be the case.
Jp.

2134
02:09:03.011 --> 02:09:07.780
Jp sends me pictures of just Jocko white tea.
He asked me to do today.
How much,

2135
02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:10.960
how much is there any amount of Jocko white tea that's not,

2136
02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.500
he got to see her.

2137
02:09:14.501 --> 02:09:18.340
You got to find is like fully on the train and he might be one level over the

2138
02:09:18.341 --> 02:09:22.930
train and into like the zone of whatever addiction.
Uh,
yeah.

2139
02:09:22.931 --> 02:09:26.680
So Jocko books got some out there way.
The Warrior kid marks mission.

2140
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:30.040
Those two books,
man.
That's one thing being up here.
How many,

2141
02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:32.620
how many people have come up to me and said,
my kid's doing Jujitsu.

2142
02:09:32.650 --> 02:09:34.660
My kids do an awesome school.
My kids doing pull ups.
Good.

2143
02:09:34.661 --> 02:09:36.490
Thank you so much for writing.
The warrior could books.

2144
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:41.230
So if you want your kid to work out to train hard to eat,

2145
02:09:41.231 --> 02:09:43.570
right,
to study,
to do good in school.
Hey,

2146
02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:46.030
those sound like they might be good things.
Yes.
Get your book,

2147
02:09:46.090 --> 02:09:46.990
get the way of the warrior kit.

2148
02:09:47.410 --> 02:09:51.430
You kid is not going to listen to you as much as they're going to listen to an

2149
02:09:51.431 --> 02:09:52.570
outside source.

2150
02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.070
Make the outside source something that you agree with something that's telling

2151
02:09:57.071 --> 02:10:01.930
them to work hard.
Study hard,
train hard
way.

2152
02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:05.920
The warrior kid in Mark's mission also got the discipline equals freedom field

2153
02:10:05.921 --> 02:10:06.754
manual.

2154
02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.260
I like seeing how many people give this as a gift to people you know.

2155
02:10:11.290 --> 02:10:12.250
Just got this as a gift.

2156
02:10:12.251 --> 02:10:16.570
I see that on social media and then they get off stoked on it,

2157
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:21.220
so that's a little instruction manual on how to get after it,
period.

2158
02:10:22.210 --> 02:10:25.660
If you want the audio version,
it is not on audible.

2159
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:31.390
It is on iTunes,
Amazon music,
Google play as an album.

2160
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.130
Extreme ownership.
That's

2161
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.130
<v 0>the book of life and I wrote combat leadership lessons that you can apply to</v>

2162
02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:42.560
your business,
to your life dichotomy of leadership.

2163
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:46.370
Listen to podcast one 38 we read a couple excerpts from it that's coming out

2164
02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:50.810
September 25th if you want to get a copy of first a dish,

2165
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.730
order it now.
If you want third a dish,
fourth,
a dish.

2166
02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.650
If you want to be walking around with a big flag that says,
Hey,
I procrastinated,

2167
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:05.720
I'm a procrastinator.
I waited,
I didn't execute,

2168
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:09.050
I didn't prioritize and execute.
I didn't keep things simple.

2169
02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.040
If you want to have that flag,
you want to support that flag,
hold off,

2170
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:13.760
don't order it.

2171
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.710
Get the fourth of dish visit dishes are going to go out quick because here's the

2172
02:11:18.711 --> 02:11:22.720
deal.
The the publishers that are conservative,

2173
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:27.140
younger.
Yeah,
I know your first books,
your first few books have sold well,

2174
02:11:27.141 --> 02:11:28.820
but you know,
that's no guarantee for the next one.

2175
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:32.120
We might just mean know we probably should only run this many and we don't know.

2176
02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:34.660
You know,
just to see anyone and we can run more tape.

2177
02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:36.440
Take it takes in a little bit more time for people to get them.

2178
02:11:36.441 --> 02:11:40.340
It's okay and they'll live like,
no,
actually they won't.
They'll actually die.

2179
02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.640
We'll get it in time.
So,
uh,

2180
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
get that first a dish going make now this is cool if we as a group order enough

2181
02:11:49.851 --> 02:11:54.851
now the everyone in that first group we'll get first to dish cause they'll print

2182
02:11:55.251 --> 02:11:56.450
it more first additions,

2183
02:11:56.870 --> 02:12:01.870
which is the goal that way more people don't have to bear the shame.

2184
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:06.350
And,
and some people say,
Oh I,
you know,
I'm,

2185
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:10.340
I had first the dish but I gave it away and now I have a new one.
Don't do that.

2186
02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:14.900
Keep the first a dish that's of like when you,
somebody sent me the British,

2187
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:17.060
a dish of about face first.

2188
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:20.360
Ocdish British or dish is different cover of about face.

2189
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.600
So somebody sent me from England,
uh,

2190
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:29.150
about face the book England copy British one.

2191
02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:33.740
So I got that in my bookshelf.
That's different.
Then one day I want to,

2192
02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:37.940
I want to take pictures.
So I like have things that are the same.

2193
02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:41.780
Like when I like I have flip flops,
I wear flip flops around.
Sure.

2194
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:45.500
I have nine pairs.
All the same I have about face.
I got 10,

2195
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:49.280
12 copies of it just racked up.
Cool.
I got my same watch.

2196
02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.470
You want me to these watches I got,
I think I got six.

2197
02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:54.230
One of them might be broken.
No,
a couple of them are broken,

2198
02:12:54.231 --> 02:12:57.350
but I keep them for spare parts.
[inaudible]

2199
02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:00.320
what kind of running shoes do I have with all the same workout shoes there?

2200
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:02.290
My workout shoes,
my running shoes,
all the same.
Boom.

2201
02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:06.770
The what about my workout clothing?
We're all the same.

2202
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:08.780
Never think about it.
What about that?
Sure.

2203
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:11.330
That victory should shares the same thing.
How many of these I've got?

2204
02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:12.173
I got a lot of them.

2205
02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:16.190
We could go in my house and just like take a picture of watches,
flip flops,

2206
02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:19.940
sneakers,
uh,
shorts.

2207
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:23.450

So where does,
where does doing it?

2208
02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.600
But uh,

2209
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:30.770
for sending me and I'm going to send the person that sent me the British a dish.

2210
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:33.180
I'm gonna send him some signed copies of

2211
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:38.010
some books of mine.
Um,
a on top of that,

2212
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.480
we've got a leadership consulting company.

2213
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:41.813
<v 1>Me,</v>

2214
02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:46.010
<v 0>Leif,
Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran,
Mike Cirelli.</v>

2215
02:13:47.690 --> 02:13:51.440
We solve problems through leadership.
That's what we do now.

2216
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:56.420
If you want us to come in as consultants and look at what your situation is and

2217
02:13:56.421 --> 02:13:58.190
help you align your leadership,

2218
02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:04.100
go to Asheville on front.com if you want one of us to come and speak to your

2219
02:14:04.101 --> 02:14:04.934
company,

2220
02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.080
go to Asheville on front.com that's where you don't call a speaking agency.

2221
02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:16.230
Just go to Asheville on front.com we have the muster real close to sold out.

2222
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:20.650
I'm not sure if it's sold out yet,
but monster zero zero six San Francisco,

2223
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:25.770
October 17th and 18th registered extreme ownership.com that's the premier

2224
02:14:28.090 --> 02:14:31.090
leadership conference in the world.

2225
02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:35.320
I think actually knowing the universe.
Sure.

2226
02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:38.800
Because I don't think they have any good leadership conferences on Mars.

2227
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:42.910
I think ours is better if they do have one.
It's probably all hot

2228
02:14:44.970 --> 02:14:49.390
cold,
so yeah.
Monster occasionally still get questions like,
Hey,

2229
02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.200
I'm 58 years old and I have a bad knee.

2230
02:14:53.590 --> 02:14:55.990
Would I be able to do the monster of the answer is yes.

2231
02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.610
The muster is anyone can do the physical demands at the muster are very,

2232
02:15:00.611 --> 02:15:04.780
very little,
if any.
If you don't,
you don't have to come and do the morning pts,

2233
02:15:04.781 --> 02:15:09.130
the morning physical training.
You can completely not come to that.
You can,

2234
02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:12.400
you're more than welcome to come and if you come you can just watch or you could

2235
02:15:12.401 --> 02:15:14.320
come or you could do the minimum that you can do and that's fine.

2236
02:15:14.530 --> 02:15:18.790
So there's no minimum physical standards for participation at the muster if you

2237
02:15:18.791 --> 02:15:23.791
feel like you need to Com com and also on top of the muster we have another

2238
02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:28.600
event that we're doing for the uniform personnel.

2239
02:15:28.630 --> 02:15:33.460
So military law enforcement,
border patrol,
firefighters,
corrections officers.

2240
02:15:33.490 --> 02:15:36.400
I've been adding that one in paramedics,

2241
02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:41.050
other first responders roll call zero zero one September 21st in Dallas,
Texas.

2242
02:15:41.710 --> 02:15:46.710
It's a one day leadership seminar for those folks in those dynamic leadership

2243
02:15:48.281 --> 02:15:53.080
environments.
Registration is gonna close,
so register.

2244
02:15:53.081 --> 02:15:57.670
You can also register for that and the muster@extremeownership.com and of course

2245
02:15:57.671 --> 02:16:00.130
we also now have EFO Overwatch.

2246
02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:05.160
We are connecting SPEC ops veterans and the companies that want to hire spec

2247
02:16:06.851 --> 02:16:08.980
ops,
veterans and Combat Aviation,

2248
02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:14.260
combat aviation and SPEC ops companies need leaders out there and we are,

2249
02:16:14.290 --> 02:16:18.140
we have leaders that were connected with,
so we're trying to place them,
uh,

2250
02:16:18.190 --> 02:16:18.850
that's Efo,

2251
02:16:18.850 --> 02:16:23.680
overwatch.com and right now we've got an awesome response from all of our other

2252
02:16:23.681 --> 02:16:25.810
brothers and sisters in the military.

2253
02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:30.640
So we're working on something right now to open up this everyone

2254
02:16:32.430 --> 02:16:37.260
and until we see you at the monster or at the roll call or maybe we won't even

2255
02:16:37.261 --> 02:16:40.350
see you until another year from now at the immersion camp next time in Maine.

2256
02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:41.970
But until then,

2257
02:16:42.390 --> 02:16:45.930
if you want to continue hanging out with us virtually,

2258
02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:50.310
we are all up on the interwebs,
on Instagram,

2259
02:16:50.311 --> 02:16:54.870
Twitter and on daisy.
Oh I

2260
02:16:56.850 --> 02:17:00.300
echo is add echo Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2261
02:17:00.301 --> 02:17:05.301
And finally thanks to the military people around the world holding the line

2262
02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.910
world wide a thank you for your service and in America,
police,
law enforcement,

2263
02:17:11.911 --> 02:17:14.100
correctional officers,
firefighters,

2264
02:17:14.101 --> 02:17:16.860
border patrol paramedics are the first responders.

2265
02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.650
Thank you for holding the line here at home

2266
02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:25.700
and to everyone else.
Remember

2267
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:32.240
that life is not easy,
but it's not supposed to be easy.

2268
02:17:32.241 --> 02:17:34.490
Life is a test and it's a hard test.

2269
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:37.580
And sometimes you might do great on that test

2270
02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:40.860
and that's super,

2271
02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.090
but sometimes that test doesn't go so well

2272
02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:52.310
that sometimes you might falter and sometimes you might fail and sometimes you

2273
02:17:52.311 --> 02:17:55.730
might even break in.
When that happens,
use it.

2274
02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:03.620
Use it to make yourself faster and stronger and smarter and better.

2275
02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:10.220
And take a look at how and why you broke a so edit does not happen again.

2276
02:18:11.250 --> 02:18:13.350
Identify your weaknesses.

2277
02:18:13.590 --> 02:18:18.570
Come up with a plan of attack and get after it.

2278
02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:22.090
And until next time,

2279
02:18:22.690 --> 02:18:26.200
this is echo and Jocko out.
