Hey Jocko.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.620
I'm a 35 year old and have a physically demanding job.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.930
I've been a dry Waller for about 14 years.
Work about eight to 10 hours a day.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.340
When it comes to working out,

5
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:16.630
I'm finding it really hard to maintain discipline to continue as it seen as it

6
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:20.860
seems.
I burnout also have two boys under the age of four,

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.200
so I sleep like you do.
I can relate men.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.410
I'm wondering if I'm just being a pussy and need to push through the burnout or

9
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.530
take a different approach to working out when I burned out,

10
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.800
my body just feels weird as well as my head.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.130
I tend to get depressed and find it hard to even go to work.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.250
Just throwing this out there for maybe some tips to get over this so I can stay

13
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:47.320
focused and consistent.
Thanks.

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.920
<v 1>Okay,
so hang in drywall or you ever hung drywall before?
No.
Yes.
No.</v>

15
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.710
Yes.
Okay.
I better know what the answer means.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.030
I've been in a drywall hanging scenario scenario.
Yes,

17
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:03.350
but I didn't do the hanging of the drywall.
Okay.
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.220
That does not qualify as a little bit
wrong.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.130
You do not get called.
I get it for drywall.
If you've seen it being hard.

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.410
I appreciate what you're trying to say,

21
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.960
but that doesn't work then you can dry wall is hard work.
Yes sir.

22
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
It uses a bunch of different muscles in your body and of course when you get

23
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.220
better at it,
because I'm not good at it.
When I,
when I hung dry,

24
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:27.970
when I hang drywall,
if I'm doing a project,
I'm not good at it.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.960
If you see someone that's good at,

26
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.820
like this guy that's been hanging drywall for 14 years,
he's a master.
He's,

27
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.760
he's holding one hand slapping nails him.

28
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.200
He's your dry wall screws on stilts.
Guys work on stilts.

29
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.370
You ever seen that before?
No.
No.
So good.

30
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.250
Drywallers they're on stilts because they don't,
they're just boom,

31
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.700
slap it up there.
So,
but it's hard.
You're doing,

32
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080
you're basically doing a clean,
kind of pulled the drywall up,

33
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.780
you're pushing it up or you're using your grip strength in the drywall.

34
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.430
Then you're doing overhead presses cause you dry wall ceilings sometimes.

35
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.150
So,
and it's eight to 10 hours plus,
not to mention you're,

36
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:05.560
you're bending down picking stuff up all day.

37
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:07.240
So it's eight to 10 hours of squats,

38
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.460
cleans and overhead presses with grip work.

39
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.350
So you're doing that eight to 10 hours a day.

40
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.580
So you're getting good physical work throughout the day.

41
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.100
Now look man,

42
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.330
if you're that drained then first of all let's check the Diet.

43
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.770
Let's make sure that we're not on the job site and the donut truck arrives and

44
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:30.240
you're,

45
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.600
you're going belly up to the donut truck with a monster for monster energy

46
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.660
drinks.
Like to keep you going through day,
that's going to hurt you.

47
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.460
So check the Diet.

48
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.290
It's the good thing is check a diet and then if you have to just bring your

49
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:44.770
food,

50
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.770
don't let you know your bro that's going to run down to Mickey D's to grab lunch

51
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.570
cause you didn't pack anything that's going to jack you up.

52
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.190
So all that stuff will make you feel weak and out of sorts and all that.

53
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.930
That being said,
it's still,
you're working hard all day.

54
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.440
You're doing hard physical labor all day.
You also,

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.880
I mean you can see construction workers were dry walls.

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.440
You can see people that are due that hard labor all day and they don't look like

57
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.400
they're in shape,
right?
There may be their fat,
maybe they're just,

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.090
they don't look like they're in shape.
Let's cause their diet sucks.

59
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.950
Generally they're coming home and they're getting on their,

60
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.510
their 12 pack of beer and pizza.

61
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.230
So get your Diet,
make sure your dad's good to go.

62
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.750
And then what I would do is,

63
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.520
and I've worked construction before and we'll even big projects on my house

64
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:41.170
where I'm working all day long.
Remodelling pulling down drywall,

65
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.790
putting up drywall,
demo in rooms,
whatever.
Uh,

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.330
I still do a workout.

67
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.640
Now what you're going to do though is do something that is going to compliment

68
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.460
what you've done during the day.

69
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.050
So you're getting some pretty good strength work at this point.
You're getting,

70
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.940
you're getting cleaned,
your grip work,

71
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.250
you're doing all this hard work all throughout the day.

72
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:08.251
So maybe what you'd need to do is do some more cardiovascular at night or maybe

73
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:13.060
it's just like a really good stretching routine cause you got your strength and

74
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.560
you got your cardio do during the day.

75
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.880
Like if I think about how much I sweat when I'm working on a house project,

76
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.410
I'm going to fall off,
let it sweat.
So that means I'm working hard.

77
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.280
So find what can you do that's going to compliment the conditioning that you're

78
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:31.390
getting from your actual labor.

79
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.010
And maybe in your case it might just be like straight up mobility.

80
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.870
It might be straight up mobility.
Like,
Hey,

81
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.530
you're just doing some good stretching,
you're doing some MobilityWOD.
Uh,

82
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.870
that's mobility workout of the day.
You can go to that website.

83
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.020
They got really good stuff on there to to loosen up and make sure you're staying

84
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.213
limber.

85
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.300
Because another thing you find with construction guys is they end up with some,

86
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.420
you know,
with a bad back with a bad,

87
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.950
they get tendinitis from swinging a hammer all day or holding.

88
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.290
So you can get those kind of use overuse injuries.
And Yeah.

89
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.140
So I would look at what you can do that's going to compliment that.
Also,

90
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.850
maybe you feel like maybe you just need to do some heavy lifting because you're

91
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.930
lifting something little all day.

92
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.020
You know you're lifting drywall all day so you're getting some good endurance,

93
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.380
muscular endurance,
but maybe just come home and do,

94
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.050
do a couple sets of heavy dead lifts are a couple of sets of heavy squats.

95
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.230
And the other thing here is like when we're on deployment,

96
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.130
when I was back in the,
when I was in the military,
when we're on deployment,

97
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.900
we wouldn't be doing workouts that are going to give you the,

98
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.030
the four days of delayed onset,
muscular soreness,
right?

99
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.030
You're not going to hurt locker is you're not going to put you in the pain

100
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.170
locker where,
hey I did squats yesterday.
Oh Echo just got shot.

101
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.800
I can't help him too tired to sword broken.

102
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.920
Someone grab echo cause my legs were super sore.

103
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.090
My quads are hurting from front squats yesterday.

104
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.560
So that's not what I'm talking about.

105
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.080
I'm talking about doing some something that's heavy,

106
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.010
but it's quick and you're not,
you know,

107
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.850
you're not going crazy and doing so many sets that you're going to build up all

108
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.090
kinds of lactic acid and make your legs all sore.
So maybe it's something that,

109
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:09.110
but I would say explore all that.
Look what you can find that's gonna make you,

110
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.820
that's going to compliment you and what you do at work.

111
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.630
And also you could look at some Jujitsu,
you know,
look at some Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,

112
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.160
although at first it's a crazy muscular workout,

113
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.810
a full body workout like you've never had before because you're resisting every

114
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:28.190
part of your movement and you'll be sore your entire body.

115
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.840
But then as you get better at it,
you can relax more.
That takes like a year,

116
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:36.410
year and a half,
maybe even two years before you can really start to relax.

117
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.890
The thing that's cool about that for you is you've got two kids under the age of

118
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:40.101
four,

119
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.700
so maybe in two or three years they're ready to start training to now you've got

120
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.890
to have something to share with them a little bit.
In the Jujitsu,
so yeah.

121
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.130
Don't kill yourself.
Find something that compliments your work.

122
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.850
And if that's just stretching,
man,
just stretch.
Yeah.

123
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.180
And maybe you don't.
I used to do it,
uh,

124
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.490
when I was at team to team Tiwi soon do,
we used to run all the time.

125
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.200
It was every day.
It was like,
oh,
Monday,
PT in Iran,

126
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.800
Tuesday swimming or run Wednesday,

127
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.150
obstacle course and Iran,
Thursday,
I forget what it was.

128
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.620
And then Friday was a long run.
It was like a 12 mile runner,

129
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.010
10 mile run on Fridays.

130
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.990
So what I would do is I would get done with work on Friday or get done with a PT

131
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:28.250
on Friday,
and usually we'd be like half,
half day frogman Friday.
Sure.

132
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.430
Strongly on Friday.
Get some prewar,
no war going on.

133
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:35.950
Guess what you do on Friday afternoon and the trims you're gonna go,
you know,

134
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.460
get after with your boys
in the bar and the bar.
Sure.
Well,
yeah,

135
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.840
frontline Friday frogman Friday,

136
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.190
then frogman Friday kind of went away once September 11th happened,
so,

137
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.080
but this is pre September 11th frogman Fridays.

138
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:52.880
So we get done with work at noon and I would just Friday go down and hit my

139
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:57.881
squats and then so Friday I'd heal up Saturday and Sunday back to work on

140
00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:59.940
Sunday.
Ready to rock and roll.
Yeah.

141
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.590
So maybe you hit just do a good workout on Friday.
Yeah.

142
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.900
Good hard workout on Friday.
He'll up over the weekend.

143
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.460
You're feeling good Monday back in the game.
But yeah,
hard labor.

144
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.420
Yeah.

145
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.410
Requires something a little bit different than those of you that are sitting at

146
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:20.320
a desk looking at a computer screen like Echo Charles.
Yes sir.
Yeah.

147
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.870
You can do different kinds of workout when you do that all day for sure.

148
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.300
You mentioned the Diet.

149
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.690
I would say with 99% certainty,
I would say I don't know everybody.
Right.

150
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.670
I understand that 99% certainty that

151
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:41.170
if you have a good day and not even have immaculate good diet and you're working

152
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.580
drywall construction moving,
as you know,
I used to be a mover for a little bit.

153
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.880
Yeah.
If you have a good diet,
I mean you watched moving

154
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.680
cause apparently in your mind that qualifies for you know it just total victory.

155
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.553
Yeah.

156
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.580
<v 0>Anyway.
Oh yeah.</v>

157
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.650
I know you were an actual yeah but I wasn't the best mover.

158
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.650
I was one on one anyway.
That's a,
that's a whole nother thing anyway.

159
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.010
If you have a good diet and you're doing this kind of work,

160
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.070
that is your workout essentially and it's a long one.

161
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.420
It's probably a hard to work out than most people's normal workouts you do.

162
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.390
And that's the thing.
You're so right because when you're working eight,

163
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.750
10 hours a day,
there's a lot of work to be done.
So your lunch break is like,

164
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.050
Dang this is,
I'm going to go to get some delicious,
you know,

165
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.920
to this food truck right here or this,
you know,
Mcdonald's or wherever,
wherever.

166
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.400
It's not,
you know,
you,
but you get a good diet with this kind of stuff.

167
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.930
You essentially have a great workout along with a good diet.

168
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.730
You're going to get results.
Just that.

169
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.750
And in a way you won't even really have to do these supplemental work house

170
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.740
unless you have different goals.
So if you're like,
um,

171
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.490
okay I'm just going to do my work,

172
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.710
I'm going to have a good diet and then I stretch afterwards,

173
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:52.480
which is such a good idea when you call day,

174
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.490
same motion all day stretch,
you know,
get all that probably you'll be way better.

175
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.660
You'll feel way better to him.

176
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.170
You'd be surprised how much easier the work becomes with that diet.

177
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.390
And also maybe there's,
like I said,

178
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.120
you need to look for what compliments it with dry wall.
I don't,
I don't know.

179
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:10.920
You know,
it's probably not dead lifting cause you're left lifting stuff all day.

180
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:15.921
But maybe it's just like some hardcore like Ab core strength that you're going

181
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.160
to work,
you're going to,
you know,
and that's going to strengthen your lower back.

182
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.130
It's going to offset all the pressure that you put it on your back all day.

183
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.090
So maybe it's that,
maybe it's,
you know,

184
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.860
pull ups cause you're not really pulling yourself up.
So,

185
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.740
so maybe you're doing two workouts,

186
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:36.741
maybe you're doing like one workout on Fridays you do an abs and pull ups and

187
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.550
then during the week you're doing a 20 minute stretch session to really make

188
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:46.530
sure your hips are opened up.
Right.
Of course,

189
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:50.250
like them guys from 10th Plan as your Shit's got to be flexible.

190
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.130
They're flexible.
That's the,
you have to be,

191
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.800
you have to be able to do Lotus to get your black belt from Eddie Bravo.

192
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.020
There you go.
I can't do the Lotus.
I can't get my black belt from Eddie Bravo.
No,

193
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:03.260
no,
no.
You can't.
No,
sorry bro.

194
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.920
I should be able to do that at some point.
Depends on what you mean by should,

195
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.270
but yeah,
man.
Cool.
Do the Lotus and then work on that and you know,
report back.

196
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.531
But yeah,
the Diet thing,

197
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:18.531
I think the Diet thing that's going to be 75 if not more percent issue.

198
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.700
They say,
Oh,
you don't sleep enough and how can,
how do you not say,

199
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.190
don't eat crap.
You don't need as much sleep.
Yeah.
Check that out.

200
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.150
Give that one a try.
Yeah.
And,
and lists,
let's face it,

201
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.770
there's people can be different with the requirements.

202
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:39.420
You're obviously,
you know,
like if I said,
Hey Jocko,
you're in prison for,

203
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.800
I dunno,
whatever.
And you have eight hours of sleep sleep for eight hours,

204
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.270
which basically,
I don't know if you can do that.

205
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.560
Deployed on a ship multiple times,
three shipboard deployments as a seal.

206
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.070
And when you're a seal on a ship,
you have no job.
You don't like the,

207
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.800
that are the guys that are in the regular navy that are driving the ship and

208
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.460
maintaining the ship and steering the ship and all that.
They have a job.

209
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.570
We have no job.
And so what we,
we could either sleep,

210
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.280
eat or Lyft and that's a raised seal,
stood for sleep,

211
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.320
eat and lift.
But some guys would sleep a lot.

212
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.250
I wouldn't sleep a lot.
He had some guys that had like sleep disorders.

213
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.460
There was a guy that slept for like 29 hours,

214
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.750
but they need to wake up and stay awake for 32 hours and then he'd go back to

215
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:30.580
bed.
So yeah,
it was kind of weird.
Circadian Rhythm was whale.
Yeah.

216
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:33.910
And then that happens too on a ship because you can stay inside the ship with no

217
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.150
song for forever if you want to.
We used to,

218
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.160
we used to go out as much as we could on the deck of the ship.
Yeah.

219
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.760
Get a Sun Tan and then do PT.
Sure.
That too.
But yeah,
I think you,

220
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.910
yeah,
you sleep different and you know,
some eight hour in,

221
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.490
actually I've done the thing where I got used to only getting like six,

222
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.230
six and a half,
and it,
it started to work.
Like I said,
I need them,
you know,

223
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:03.520
I didn't like that.
I tried to go back to,
actually I only get six,

224
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.580
maybe seven now anyway,
because the kids think anyway,

225
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.190
the Diet I think will I for real thing.
I believe this a fact,

226
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:15.490
75% or more solution to the whole problem,

227
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.800
the Diet clean up the is good.
When your lunch stay away from the Mickey D's.

228
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.300
Yeah.
Stay away from all that stuff.
