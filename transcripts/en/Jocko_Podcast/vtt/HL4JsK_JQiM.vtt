00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
This is Jocko podcast number 70 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.350
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo,
good evening.

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Now it's going to start off tonight with a warning that tonight's episode is

4
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:25.991
going to contain things that are not appropriate for children.

5
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.340
Then as I,
as I put together the notes,

6
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.550
I realized that maybe the opposite is true

7
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.230
and that maybe this is an important episode that children do need to listen to,

8
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.600
but I would say listen to it alone by yourself first without your children and

9
00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:02.341
then decide if and when they are ready to listen to this.

10
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.020
And unfortunately I will tell you that I think the time is likely sooner than

11
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:17.401
you think and it is most definitely sooner than it should be.

12
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.080
Now,
normally

13
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.530
I am talking about war

14
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.153
<v 1>and</v>

15
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380
<v 0>in that light I have covered some of the most heinous</v>

16
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.870
and horrible things that have happened in the world.

17
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.600
Evil things,

18
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.830
evil people,

19
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.650
and the things that I'm talking about

20
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.240
are things that happen on a large scale and in a war.

21
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.630
Battles between nations and armies of versus armies and men

22
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.910
against men.
And

23
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.530
in those situations on that global stage

24
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.520
of war,
as I always say,

25
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.670
we see
the best of human nature

26
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.590
and we often see the worst,

27
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.570
but sometimes the worst of human behavior,

28
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350
the most evil of human behavior does not occur on the battlefield.

29
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.510
And it is not driven by war.

30
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.560
It's not brought on by the madness of combat.

31
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.110
It's not the result of men trying to kill other men.

32
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.770
Sometimes the most evil side of human beings

33
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.310
sneaks around in the dark,

34
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.460
lurking,
waiting,

35
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.670
preying on the weak.

36
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.820
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

37
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.090
<v 0>scared
and the defenseless,</v>

38
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.400
preying on
children.

39
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.200
And often it isn't some arc type of evil.

40
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.160
<v 2>Okay?</v>

41
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.160
<v 0>Like the picture you have in your head of some sneering Predator with a sadistic</v>

42
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.783
look.

43
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.410
It can often be
a trusted neighbor

44
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.890
from our frame we friend

45
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.570
or even a relative.

46
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.570
And to talk through some of this with me tonight,

47
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.600
I'm honored to have a special guest on an amazing person

48
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.600
that I admire

49
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.930
for her toughness and courage,

50
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.920
incredibly strong woman,
loving mother,

51
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
and extremely hard working in a highly productive farmer.

52
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.600
And last,
but certainly not least,

53
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.540
an incredible wife to one of my very close friends who has done multiple combat

54
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.170
tours overseas,

55
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.350
leaving this wonderful woman back on the home front to handle the business at

56
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:25.414
home.

57
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.950
And her name is Iris.

58
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.220
And my first solid memory of Iris,

59
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.050
and I had met her before this,
but you know,

60
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.270
I didn't really think too much about it,

61
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:45.271
but I was driving out to see her husband out on a farm out on their farm that

62
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:51.820
they live on.
And I,
I pulled up my vehicle,

63
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.760
my minivan,
I'm quite sure,

64
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.420
and I'm looking across the spance of land and out there in the field,

65
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.570
fully nine months pregnant,

66
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.440
guiding a horse drawn plow.
Right.
I'm talking,

67
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.440
it looks like it's 1729 out there,

68
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.520
horse-drawn plow in the field in the summertime and in the valley in the,

69
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.490
in the inland of southern California.

70
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.491
So it's hot and dusty and she sees me and she like ties off the horse and then

71
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:37.211
she comes walking over to me and she's wearing the actual spurs like you see in

72
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.800
a western movie that Jingle Jangle.
No kidding.

73
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.840
And she's a small frame,
a woman,
you know,
and she took off,

74
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.830
she had a pair of leather gloves on that looked like they were passed down from

75
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.850
the Marlboro man.

76
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.130
It just all worked and she took one of those off and it gave me a handshake and

77
00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.031
her,

78
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:04.031
her skin was basically as tough as the leather gloves she was wearing and she,

79
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:05.980
you know,
said Hey,

80
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.200
and pointed me towards her house where I'd find her husband who was in there

81
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.560
like watching TV or something in the air condition.

82
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.540
And then she turned around and walked back and headed back out to field again.

83
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.190
She was nine months straight up,

84
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:23.960
nine months pregnant and I thought to myself,
damn

85
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.440
breath,
what a,
what an awesome woman.
So

86
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.540
<v 1>okay,</v>

87
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.410
<v 0>years later,</v>

88
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.450
I would say maybe five,
four or five years later,

89
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.670
I was

90
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.620
extremely moved and angered and disturbed and thankful and odd all at the same

91
00:07:55.111 --> 00:08:00.111
time when she posted an article online about something she had experienced as a

92
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:06.534
child.

93
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.993
<v 1>And</v>

94
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.410
<v 0>here is an excerpt of what she wrote.</v>

95
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.210
I was only five years old.
The first time it happened

96
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.250
I wasn't feeling well,

97
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.840
so while everyone else went down the hill to cut firewood,

98
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.990
I stayed back at the cabin in bed.

99
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.370
I remember him coming back,

100
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.760
coming through the door and telling me he needed to get a chainsaw file.

101
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.060
He then came over to the bed,

102
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.310
told me to lay still and pulled my pants down.

103
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.080
I was a shy child,

104
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.730
had would never ever have questioned and adult at that age.

105
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.840
He inserted his fingers into my vagina and I remember it hurting and I was just

106
00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:15.674
petrified.

107
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.330
I had no idea what to do.

108
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.220
You said things to me like,

109
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.350
doesn't that feel good and you like this right?

110
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.730
I was unable to say anything or I don't know.

111
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.110
I may have even mumbled agreement with him because that's what I thought I was

112
00:09:44.111 --> 00:09:44.980
supposed to do.

113
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.863
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.430
<v 0>I just remember that it hurt and I was scared and I was confused.</v>

115
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.630
The sound of my parents' truck pulling up the driveway stopped him and he

116
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:07.631
carefully pulled my pants back up and went over to the sink and washed his hands

117
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.050
as if washing away the evidence.

118
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.810
He then pulled me close and told me that this was a secret just between us.

119
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

120
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.790
<v 0>It was so cliche.</v>

121
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:31.791
It amazes me now that that's what he said and

122
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.220
how well it worked.

123
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.540
<v 1>Now
I</v>

125
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.220
<v 0>have faced fear,</v>

126
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.350
top faced horror.
I've faced evil,

127
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.390
but I faced it as a full grown man

128
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.900
who spent pretty much my entire life being trained to fight and to kill and

129
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.340
prepared to die.

130
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.293
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.650
<v 0>And furthermore,
when I was in those situations,</v>

132
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.950
not only was I a full grown man,

133
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.470
I was with my brothers in arms to my left and to my right,

134
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.943
<v 2>okay?</v>

135
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.980
<v 0>But to face this kind of evil as a child,</v>

136
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.770
as a little girl,
and I have three daughters

137
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.780
as a little girl,
scared,
defenseless,

138
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.370
and Oh alone,

139
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.070
this is almost impossible for me to comprehend.

140
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.790
<v 3>And I know that I can learn a lot</v>

141
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.170
from the type of person that can survive this kind of abuse.

142
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.000
I know we can all learn a lot,

143
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.390
especially from a person with the strength to confront this evil and overcome it

144
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.360
and then put together an amazing

145
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.460
<v 0>and beautiful life with an amazing and beautiful family.</v>

146
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.160
We can all learn from this.

147
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.950
<v 3>And with that mind,</v>

148
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.060
<v 0>iris,
welcome to the show.
Hey,</v>

149
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.490
thank you so much for coming on.

150
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.340
<v 4>Wow.
Thank you,
Jocko.
Yes.
Uh,
it's really an honor to be here</v>

151
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.570
<v 0>and like all of our guests now</v>

152
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.410
<v 3>you have to tell us about the beginning where you came from,</v>

153
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.210
what was going on in your life and your,

154
00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:01.350
your life is very internet.

155
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.400
I remember when your husband first met you and he was kind of telling me about

156
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:09.990
this girl he had met and I was sick.
You know,

157
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:12.480
when you hear your story,
you just think,
damn,
that's awesome.

158
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.230
And so tell us a little bit about that,
about your childhood.

159
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.840
You had a lot of very cool experiences in your,

160
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.250
in your childhood and grew up in a,

161
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.820
in a almost completely unique way that I don't think I've ever met anyone else.

162
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:24.654
I grew up like you did.

163
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.550
<v 4>Yeah.
I,
um,</v>

164
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.310
I never realized it was really unique until I wasn't an adult.

165
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.670
Got Out in the world a little bit more and realize that most people,
um,

166
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.730
anywhere near my age did not grow up the way that I did.

167
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.750
So we lived in,
um,

168
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.000
the mountains in northern California.
My Dad was,
uh,
initially a minor,

169
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:48.840
a gold miner,

170
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.220
and he would go into old mine shafts and bring out,

171
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.250
or that they would crush in a,

172
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.530
in a small mill and then refine the gold down into bars that they would sell.

173
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.680
And eventually he became a timber faller and a lager.
Um,

174
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.700
back in 1987,
I was seven years old.

175
00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:17.820
There's a huge forest fire that burned through northern California.

176
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.880
And I remember it vividly because one night there was just this wall of fire

177
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.260
rolling down on our house.
And Luckily our house was spared,

178
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.950
but a lot of our neighbors lost their homes.
And after that,

179
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.100
a lot of logging came into the area because there was so much

180
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.200
<v 0>burned.
But I remember,</v>

181
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 3>so a lot of people have parents that might be working in mines.</v>

182
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:48.030
They might have parents that are working as you know,
loggers or lumberjacks,

183
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.720
but they still might have things in their house like power and heat and

184
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.120
electricity.
So you guys were like off the grid,
right?

185
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.630
<v 4>Yeah,
that the whole area.
So,</v>

186
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.660
so this place is probably one of the most rural places in this country still,

187
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:12.650
unless maybe you get up into Alaska.
Um,
it's in northern California,

188
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:13.191
in the mountains.

189
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:18.191
There's this gorgeous river valley there and it still doesn't have electricity.

190
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.793
Um,

191
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.040
the people that live there still just use some solar now or generators,

192
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:32.870
but no one had that back when I was a kid.
So yeah,
we grew up with,
um,

193
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.900
no power,
no telephones,
no television.

194
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.560
We used the old school,
um,

195
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.590
kerosene lanterns with the little thin glass globes and you would carry those

196
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:47.600
from room to room if you needed light.

197
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.470
We would take them to bed with us at night and read by kerosene lantern.

198
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.170
And we had a wood cook stove that we cooked on,
um,

199
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.120
just to get hot water.

200
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.770
Our Wood Cook Stove had coils that ran through it that the water would run

201
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:05.720
through and warm it.

202
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:10.721
So you would have to start a fire in the stove to have any hot water to warm it.

203
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.240
So yeah,
it was,
it was,
it was interesting.
I,

204
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.080
I take power and things like that for granted now,

205
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.870
but back then it was just normal.

206
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.830
<v 3>Yeah.
That was going to say it becomes normal for kids.
I know that for instance,</v>

207
00:16:28.831 --> 00:16:31.230
when my kids were little,
they just thought that everyone did.

208
00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:35.320
You did Jitsu cause we did Jujitsu.
Oh yeah.
Do you know,
doesn't everyone do dude,

209
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.010
you did sue all the time,
but just know no power and that's Kinda there.

210
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.000
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

211
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
<v 3>It's hard for people to even imagine that nowadays when you're a kid and you</v>

212
00:16:48.061 --> 00:16:51.960
don't have an iPad to entertain you,

213
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.240
you don't have a TV to entertain you.

214
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.470
The creativity has to be there.
Right.

215
00:16:57.471 --> 00:17:01.950
It has to develop because what did you do for fun?
Well,

216
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.780
we had rocks.
I know what we're seeing.
When I was a kid,
I,
when I was a kid,

217
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.330
it was like everything,

218
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.330
every stick you could find turned it into a machine gun and every rock you found

219
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:15.690
turned into a grenade and that's where we did.
Did you even,

220
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.850
how would you even know what a grenade was or,
you know,

221
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.700
how would you know what a doll was?

222
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.520
<v 4>Yeah,
we had,
we had a few toys,
but you know,</v>

223
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:30.521
I see the toys that kids have now and it definitely isn't it different is very

224
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:35.960
different.
Uh,
we had a few,
a few old toys,
but mostly we just lived outside.

225
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.780
We just outside was our,

226
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.690
that was our playground or toys.

227
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.080
<v 3>And then where were you guys getting food from?</v>

228
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:49.010
<v 4>We always had a big garden.
My mom,
um,
grew,
it grew.</v>

229
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:54.020
He grew a huge garden and canned and froze or Weldon freeze.

230
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.880
We didn't have electricity for a freezer,

231
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:01.881
but cad and dried food and we had our own milk cows.

232
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.090
Um,
we raised pigs,

233
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.980
which that,
that was kind of interesting to my,

234
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.750
we had a lot of pigs.
My sister and I used to sleep outside in this,

235
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.180
um,
in the summers when the weather was nice,

236
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:23.130
there was this old stone root cellar with like a loft that had open ends and we

237
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:27.090
would sleep up there whenever the weather was a little bit iffy and it was right

238
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:31.080
over top of the pig pen.
So we essentially grew up in a barn.

239
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.850
Um,
we would wake up in the middle of night with pigs squealing and turn our

240
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:39.480
flashlights on and shine the lights down there and watch like litters of piglets

241
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.660
being born.
And these weren't even normal pigs.

242
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:47.340
They were like wild boars that we'd caught and bread.

243
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.470
And so they were all hairy and long snouts and they weren't like your fat pink

244
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:57.050
pigs that you get that most people race.
And did you,

245
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.320
was there any kind of school up there?

246
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.980
There was a tiny little school that we went to when I lived there.

247
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:06.360
It was sort of the height of the population.
There's less people there now,

248
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.660
but there was the mining and the logging had brought in a few more people.

249
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:14.661
And so the school that I went to had about 25 kids from k through eight.

250
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.870
So there's maybe a couple of kids per grade and we were all in the same.

251
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.040
It was,
there was like two rooms,
the big kids' room and the little kids room.

252
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.280
And we were so close because there were just a few of us and we were s every,

253
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:38.871
all of the kids that I grew up with had very similar upbringing to the way I

254
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.241
did.

255
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:44.040
So there are at least 25 other kids out there in the world who grew up exactly

256
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:44.910
the same as I did,

257
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:49.170
but we were this pack of just feral children really,

258
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:54.270
um,
that just lived in the woods and swam in the river and,
and,

259
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.810
um,
did everything.
And I have wonderful memories of that,

260
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.140
which offset a lot of the not so pleasant things that happened in that same

261
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:04.644
time.

262
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.800
<v 0>Did you,
uh,
what about books?
Did you guys have a ton of books?
Did you read,</v>

263
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.690
was that sort of your one escape from the reality that was around you?

264
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.980
<v 4>Yeah,
we didn't have television.</v>

265
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.390
And in the summers we were mostly outside and the river,
um,

266
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:23.950
and the woods,

267
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.880
we would go down to the river in the evening and watch the bears catch salmon

268
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:31.450
and

269
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.620
<v 0>sounds like a pretty normal after that five year old.</v>

270
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.830
<v 4>But in the winter when it was cold and rainy,</v>

271
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.510
we read a ton and I've got the best big sister in the world.

272
00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:48.040
She's a couple years older than me and she

273
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.570
<v 5>was reading these just ridiculously age inappropriate books.</v>

274
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:58.050
I remember her reading these huge novels when she was like 10 years old because

275
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.670
we didn't have any money.

276
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.310
And it wasn't like our parents went out and bought us the,

277
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.340
the newest children's books or anything to read.

278
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:10.260
We just read whatever happened to be laying around.
And,
um,

279
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.350
oftentimes that was not what you would typically give a 10 year old to read.

280
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.920
But so she would,
she,

281
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.860
she started reading to herself and then she would read to me before I was,
eh,

282
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:25.360
you know,
and eventually I became an very avid reader too.
Um,

283
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.290
but yeah,
that was,
that was a big part of her life.
In fact.
Um,

284
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.850
Cormac McCarthy is also one of my very favorite authors,

285
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.850
if not my favorite author.
I think I,
I read,
um,

286
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.100
all the pretty horses in the crossing when I was like 15,

287
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.740
I had red blood meridian by the time I was 16.

288
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.740
I've read them all numerous times,

289
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.420
but I remember,
uh,

290
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:57.130
this wonderful old neighbor lady that lived down the road from us gave me this

291
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.310
box of a big cardboard box full of old Louis L'amour and Zane grey novels,

292
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.660
which for anyone who's not familiar with those,
they're,
they're westerns.

293
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:12.070
They're all westerns.
And that was,
you know,

294
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:17.071
the way you talk about being a kid and sort of wanting to be a soldier,

295
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.350
wanting to be in the military so bad.
And that was like,

296
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.490
you are focused on that and that's all you are going to do.
That was me.

297
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.230
But with horses,

298
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.270
that was the only thing I cared about.
And so I,

299
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.330
I just gobbled up all of these old westerns and lived in that world of imagining

300
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:42.190
myself being like a cowboy riding across the plains with my bedroll and,

301
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.080
but I didn't have a horse.
So,
um,
you know,

302
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:50.920
I lived in the woods as much as I could.
I,
I,
we,

303
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.800
we foraged,
we found,
um,

304
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.200
we hunted for wild mushrooms all the time,

305
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:59.830
which is still one of my very favorite things to do.
Um,

306
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.060
and I used to read mushroom and plant field guides,

307
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:07.630
like other kids might read,
you know,

308
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.310
fantasy novels or something.

309
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:15.390
<v 0>So it's,
uh,
it's a definitely unique and a lot of really,
I mean,</v>

310
00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:17.700
that's just an unbelievable experience.
And it sounds like you,

311
00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:21.360
you definitely a lot of positivity,
you know,

312
00:23:21.361 --> 00:23:23.820
there's so much positivity to that,
the way you grew up.

313
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.390
<v 5>It was a very idyllic childhood.</v>

314
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.780
I would say that I have a lot of darkness in that same time,

315
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:37.970
but I wouldn't trade the way that I grew up for anything.
Dang.

316
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.830
<v 0>So let me talk a little bit about that.</v>

317
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.400
That
and I kinda talked about in that,

318
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.430
in that opening of of how it started and and the first time it happened to you,

319
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.430
this,
this abuse that you suffered.

320
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.210
Now I'm going to go back to this article that you wrote

321
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.850
<v 1>and here we go</v>

322
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.060
<v 0>again.
This is,
this is the,
this is from a five year old.</v>

323
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.990
I was confused mostly.

324
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.860
I don't think it ever crossed my mind to tell my parents.

325
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.250
I just knew that I had been instructed not to tell anyone,
so that's what I did.

326
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.330
I really didn't understand what he had done or why,

327
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.430
but I definitely knew that what had been done was wrong and it might be

328
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:39.740
something that I would be punished for.

329
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.720
From that moment on my life became one big game of cat and mouse.

330
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.980
I tried to avoid him and he pursued me and took every opportunity to get his

331
00:24:55.321 --> 00:24:56.280
hands on me.

332
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.870
He had plenty of opportunities because he was a beloved and trusted family

333
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.663
friend.

334
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.600
Even right in front of my parents and other people.

335
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.740
He would regularly slap my butt and pull me onto his lap.

336
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.390
I would always scorm away as quickly as I could.

337
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.820
I remember being left home with him.

338
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.370
I remember throwing fits and begging to go along with my mom and my sister,

339
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.541
my mom,

340
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:34.541
just thinking I was acting out and being a brat and would tell me to stay with

341
00:25:35.741 --> 00:25:37.360
him until they got back.

342
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.370
The fact that no one realized what was happening by simply observing the

343
00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:48.770
situation still be wielders me.

344
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.850
So this guy,
like you said here,

345
00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.400
<v 1>okay,</v>

346
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.050
<v 0>this guy had full access to your house,
full trust of your parents.</v>

347
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.990
Why is it that you think or expand,
you kind of talk about it a little bit,

348
00:26:12.991 --> 00:26:17.991
but what is it that that makes a kid hold that information in when something bad

349
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:21.360
is happening like this?

350
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.580
<v 5>So I think it started happening with me when I was so young that I just,</v>

351
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.240
I didn't understand it.
I did not understand what was even going on.

352
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:35.660
No one had ever told me that something like that might happen.

353
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:41.230
And I was told not to say anything by an adult.

354
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.830
And I didn't.

355
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.750
And I think I definitely had a feeling that I knew something was wrong and that

356
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:51.180
this was not what should be happening,

357
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.640
but I was a lot of,
it was probably just my personality type.

358
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.920
I was a shy,
quiet kid and

359
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.930
I wasn't inclined to express my emotions that much anyways.

360
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.780
Um,
and I,
you know,

361
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:16.470
I think people who do this sort of thing,

362
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.000
they look for a specific type of kid.

363
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.640
They're not stupid.

364
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.770
They know how to single out just the right kid.

365
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.940
And that was me in,
in the time and

366
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:40.110
I just had,
I had a lack of understanding of what was even going on.
Um,

367
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.410
I didn't really know that it was definitely something that I should tell other

368
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.053
adults.

369
00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:53.300
<v 3>And I'm thinking that in your,
in your situation,
in your upbringing,</v>

370
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.940
you're seeing,
you're seeing nature,
right?

371
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.030
You're understanding that pigs are having babies.
I mean,

372
00:27:59.031 --> 00:28:01.280
you're seeing this kind of thing take place,

373
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.490
but it wasn't something that your family talked about,

374
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.270
the birds and the bees or anything like that just didn't come up.

375
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.230
<v 5>Yeah,
not really.
And definitely not in.</v>

376
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:17.710
I think that it's hard for people to believe that their best friend or close

377
00:28:20.871 --> 00:28:24.350
family members would ever harm their children.

378
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.240
And so I don't,

379
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:31.750
I suspect that my parents felt like they kept a pretty good eye on me and that I

380
00:28:31.761 --> 00:28:36.380
was fine because they didn't look where they needed to look.

381
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.600
<v 3>I think that's,
and I'm sure echo has some kind of bias,</v>

382
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.390
psychological bias for this,
but you know,

383
00:28:43.391 --> 00:28:47.020
anytime you're in a situation where there's something that you simply could

384
00:28:47.021 --> 00:28:50.710
never imagine,
it couldn't believe it,
and if that's,
if that's,

385
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.210
if something that you could never imagine and couldn't believe happening and

386
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:58.690
you're not being told about it,
what would plant that in your mind do you know,

387
00:28:58.691 --> 00:29:02.860
to make you think that it's going on from your parents perspective?
You know,

388
00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:06.580
it's like,
it's like me looking at one of my close friends,

389
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.920
<v 5>I would never have that thought.
And so where would it come from?
Well,</v>

390
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.940
kind of see how it would not probably think that your kid would let you know if

391
00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:20.850
there was a problem.
Right?
You would be like,
well,

392
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.650
I would be able to tell if something was wrong because my kid would let me know

393
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:30.420
somehow and that's not necessarily the case.

394
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.760
<v 3>I'm going to go back as you continue this back to your writing here.</v>

395
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.700
<v 3>We moved into our own house</v>

397
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.650
<v 0>and I would have moments of peace,
but he was always around,</v>

398
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.390
always visiting and even parked a trailer on our property to live in for periods

399
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:53.800
of time.
He stalked me like I was his prey.

400
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

401
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.390
<v 0>I never ever felt safe from him.</v>

402
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.810
He would watch me constantly.

403
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.740
I would look up from playing with toys and see him standing in the doorway of my

404
00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:08.390
bedroom staring at me.

405
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.560
I would wake up to him watching me

406
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.890
when I would have friends over,

407
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.920
I would suddenly jump up and announced that we needed to go outside and play

408
00:30:18.921 --> 00:30:19.754
right now

409
00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:25.850
because I would notice him watching us through a doorway or a window.

410
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.980
<v 0>Again,
I can't even,</v>

412
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.820
I can't even imagine what that had to feel like for a five year old,

413
00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:40.260
a six year old,
a seven year old.
And again,

414
00:30:40.261 --> 00:30:45.261
I picture my own children and they're pure in the sense that they live in,

415
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.740
thankfully,
and I can't,
I can't,
I mean this is like a horror movie.

416
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.020
You know,
you're a kid and you're looking up and,

417
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.510
and you're playing with your toys and your reading your book or whatever,

418
00:30:57.511 --> 00:31:02.500
and you look up and you see this Predator,
you know,
just,

419
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.550
just stalking you all the time and,

420
00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:09.160
and the discomfort that you had to just feel constantly

421
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.420
and,
and no way to escape it.
Do you think there's,

422
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.070
was there anything else that you,

423
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:22.100
that you can think of that you tried to do or tried to send them a signal or was

424
00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:24.300
it just,

425
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.300
or you just so sort of envelops by the situation that you didn't,

426
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:29.641
you know,

427
00:31:29.641 --> 00:31:34.320
just like I was talking about maybe your parents couldn't imagine what would be

428
00:31:34.321 --> 00:31:36.970
happening.
Is it,

429
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.710
was it like you just couldn't imagine this not happening?

430
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.420
<v 5>Yeah,
pretty much.
I think because it started when I was so young,</v>

431
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:50.740
it just was part of my life and it was so consistent.

432
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:53.940
It wasn't like something that happened and then didn't happen for,

433
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.060
it was just like a daily part of my life.

434
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.750
And so I don't think I really ever tried to signal.

435
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:06.940
I remember one time there was a couple girls,

436
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:11.320
some friends of my parents came and visited and they had a couple of girls a

437
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:13.000
little bit older than me.
They came.

438
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.080
And I remember the one girl who was probably 12 at the time telling me they

439
00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:23.560
spent the night,
they slept outside.
And she told me that,
um,

440
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.730
when she woke up in the morning,
this,
my abuser had

441
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.960
like crawled up on to her bed and started touching her leg and she like jumped

442
00:32:35.061 --> 00:32:39.950
up and told them no and ran away.
And she also didn't go a grown up.

443
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.500
She came and told me that this had happened.

444
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:46.340
And I remember telling her what happened to me.

445
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.200
And that's the only time as a child that I ever told anyone.

446
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.150
And I remember us sitting there kind of discussing this.

447
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:59.120
I was probably eight maybe at the time.

448
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.170
And we're like,
wow,
that's,
yeah,
I don't know why he does this.
That's,

449
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.090
that's weird.
I am,
I don't know.
You know?

450
00:33:07.091 --> 00:33:11.560
And we just kind of disgusted and then never told anyone.

451
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.790
Even though she was even older and hadn't grown up with it.

452
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.160
And I don't know if later on she told someone,

453
00:33:18.161 --> 00:33:21.730
but at the time she definitely didn't go tell her parents or my parents or

454
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.051
anyone,

455
00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:28.051
which reaffirms the fact that your kids aren't necessarily going to tell you.

456
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.243
<v 2>Hmm,</v>

457
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.730
<v 3>I know.
I know with my kids,
you know,</v>

458
00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:35.250
if they do something that they think is going to get him in trouble,

459
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.300
especially in that five,
six year year old,
seven year old,

460
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.510
they're not going to tell you.
They don't fall into your,

461
00:33:42.511 --> 00:33:46.790
that information if they think it's something that they did wrong or think so.

462
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.990
So that's another little trap.

463
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:50.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

464
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.553
<v 3>That occurs</v>

465
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.300
back to your writing here.

466
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.090
He was old and was missing all of his teeth.

467
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.100
He wore dentures sometimes and sometimes he didn't.

468
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.140
I remember him pinning me up against the walls and counters and kissing me with

469
00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:18.160
his soft toothless mouth and fingering me with his dirty hands.

470
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.790
I wanted to vomit.

471
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.630
I would never tell him know though.
Never tell him to get away from me.

472
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.390
Never acknowledged that he was doing anything to me.

473
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.510
I would just slip away from him.

474
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:39.950
As soon as an opportunity presented itself and mumbled that I was going outside

475
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:42.230
to play or down to the rock piles,

476
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.310
my secret labyrinth of tangled blackberry brambles and boulders,

477
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.450
you'd follow me to the top of the trail saying things like,
come back.

478
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.740
You like what I'm doing?
Or,

479
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.220
I don't think your mom wants you to go down there while she's gone.

480
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.850
But he never followed me down into the rock piles.
It was my safe zone.

481
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.750
It was the place I could cry with no one seeing me.

482
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.830
I remember someone accusing him of molesting another little girl.

483
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.580
I heard my parents talking about it and then my dad pulling me aside and asking

484
00:35:23.581 --> 00:35:25.470
me if Mike had ever touched me.

485
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.310
I was caught off guard and totally unprepared to deal with what saying yes would

486
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:35.680
mean
so I said no,

487
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.800
<v 0>as soon as it was out of my mouth,
I wanted so badly to change my answer,</v>

488
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.110
but no one ever asked me again.

489
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:52.690
I'm convinced that if I had had a little time to think and had been asked again,

490
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.430
I would have spilled it all.

491
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.200
Remember that it's important.

492
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.600
But at the time I said No.

493
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.780
And the woman who made the accusation was discredited as being crazy or a drug

494
00:36:10.941 --> 00:36:13.730
addict and having ulterior motives.

495
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.240
<v 1>And that was that.
Okay.</v>

496
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.510
<v 0>So there is a clear example and I could,</v>

497
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.660
I could see now going from the perspective of a parent who is all uncomfortable

498
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:39.690
to go up and ask this question in the first place.
You know,

499
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.950
it was probably the weakest form of questioning too,
you know,
like,

500
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:49.200
has Mike ever made you feel weird and you,
you know,
uh,
no.

501
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.920
Okay.
But he's good now.
Dad's like,
okay,
see,
I told you this is no issue.

502
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.320
She's a liar.
She's a drug addict

503
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.360
<v 4>and they want that answer.
They want to hear no.
Yeah.</v>

504
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.150
Any parent wants to hear?
No.
When they asked that.

505
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

506
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.370
<v 0>It and,
and yet you got to ask again.</v>

507
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.700
You got to put it probably in multiple different ways of asking the question,

508
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.220
not just as he make you on,
keep,
feel comfortable.
Does he touch you?

509
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.140
Do you got to ask that in so many different ways to get to open up the mind to

510
00:37:23.141 --> 00:37:24.730
the kid,
you know,

511
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:29.020
obviously without asking leading questions.
Right.
You know,

512
00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:31.630
that's gonna that's gonna make put somebody,
you know,

513
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.630
in another weird situation.

514
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.470
Yeah.
How do you ask your own kids?

515
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.733
<v 4>So,</v>

516
00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.210
<v 1>okay.</v>

517
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.670
<v 4>I think that
you have to,</v>

518
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.950
you have to talk about it casually,
hopefully before something happens.

519
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.993
Um,

520
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.130
make them aware of the fact that this does happen.
And

521
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:02.570
<v 1>yeah,</v>

522
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:07.430
<v 4>people think that they're protecting their kids by not telling them that</v>

523
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.450
horrible stuff happens.
They,

524
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.620
they feel like they're protecting them by shielding them from this.

525
00:38:15.621 --> 00:38:20.621
And meanwhile their kids are being molested and don't know how to tell anyone

526
00:38:21.471 --> 00:38:23.390
because no one's talked to them about it.

527
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:24.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

528
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.360
<v 4>And so you can start talking to them when they're really young.</v>

529
00:38:31.401 --> 00:38:36.401
Use simple terms and express that sometimes people do bad things and there's

530
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:43.381
something I tell my kids that there's something broken in some people's brains

531
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:50.110
that makes them do something that normal people don't do,

532
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.520
but that they're out there.
And when you,

533
00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.310
I think when you question a kid about this,
you have to ask it once

534
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.280
and then give the top the,

535
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:08.281
give the kid time to think about it and then bring it up casually again a couple

536
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.980
days later.
Hey you remember that thing we talked about the other day?

537
00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:16.330
I was thinking about it some more.
Um,
do you have,
you know,

538
00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:20.920
is there anything else you want to talk to me about with that and do that a few

539
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:23.560
times,
especially if you have any,

540
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.470
if you suspect anything for sure,

541
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:29.920
but even if you don't bring it up once,

542
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.880
bring it up again a couple of days later.
Bring it up again a couple days later.

543
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.120
Give their little brains time to process what my and then make sure to tell them

544
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:43.960
that if anything happened,
even if they're not telling me anything,
did

545
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:50.710
they are not going to be in trouble if they feel like they want to tell me

546
00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:55.961
something now some kids are just vocal and we'll talk fine,

547
00:39:56.151 --> 00:40:00.960
but other kids won't.
And that's the kind of kid that you have to eat,

548
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:01.930
get out of.

549
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.460
<v 3>If you think about this,</v>

550
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:08.461
you could actually develop a pattern with your kids where they're not talking

551
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:14.320
about molestation,
but if when they tell you something,

552
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.620
you punish them because they told you the truth.
Yeah,

553
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.830
because they took a cookie drop the cookie jar,

554
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:23.290
spilled milk and they could have kept it a secret,

555
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:26.890
but they told you and now you punish them.
You're,
you're doing the same thing.

556
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.130
You're setting them up for to keep secrets and keep things in

557
00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.550
<v 4>[inaudible] I always tell my kids that they'll get in more trouble for telling</v>

558
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:35.080
me a lie then for whatever they do

559
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.080
<v 3>did in the first place.
My,
uh,</v>

560
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.050
my kids absolutely know that.
And,
and that's the same with [inaudible].

561
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.690
Nevermind kids when I was in the teams.
That's the standard.

562
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.260
You tell me what happened.
The don't lie to me.

563
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:52.770
What happened if you tell me something,
you did something wrong.

564
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.810
There was an incident,
something bad happened,
we'll handle it.

565
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.010
But one thing we can't do is if we try and cover something up and we get caught

566
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.290
now,
now there's going to be hell to pay.
So yeah,
that's a,

567
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.190
<v 4>another thing that I do with my kids is I got it.</v>

568
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.220
There's some great books out there about talking to your kids about abuse and

569
00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:17.590
stuff and um,

570
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.240
there's one that I read to him sometimes and it's not,

571
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.220
those books aren't meant to just read once and never pick up again.

572
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.750
They are a perfect opportunity to bring it up casually in conversation.

573
00:41:32.751 --> 00:41:34.130
There's a,
it's called,

574
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:39.140
<v 5>I said no and it's written by Zach and Kimberly King and Zach is a little boy</v>

575
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.260
and his mom,
Kimberly King,

576
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:47.030
and they wrote this book together and it's really great.

577
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:47.390
It taught,

578
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:52.390
it talks about people as being like red flag people and those people can be the

579
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:56.870
sort of people who just give you a strange feeling.
They,
they on subtle you,

580
00:41:56.871 --> 00:42:00.890
they make you feel a little bit odd and it doesn't necessarily mean that they've

581
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:02.060
done anything wrong to you,

582
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:07.061
but you should be able to pick out those red flag people and then talk to an

583
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:12.200
adult about what is making them uncomfortable.
No,
no.
Is that,

584
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.620
<v 3>is that because the,
this red flag person did something that,</v>

585
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.220
that gave them a regular black person.
And I told my kids,

586
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.910
especially now that my daughters are older,
you know,

587
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.050
one of my daughters was going on a trip somewhere and I,

588
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.700
and I was giving her the talk,
you know,
listen,
you need to watch out.

589
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.090
And my daughter said something to me like,

590
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.423
<v 5>Dad,</v>

591
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.830
<v 3>I'm not going to be,
do you know,
going and hanging around with some Weirdo.</v>

592
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.210
And I stopped her right in her tracks and I said,

593
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.600
it's not the Weirdo,
the guy that looks weird.

594
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:50.870
It's not the guy that looks like a Predator that you need to watch out for.

595
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:55.790
The guy that you need to watch out for is the guy that seems like a nice guy.

596
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:59.110
He's a guy that just,
you know,
helped you with your luggage,
is the guy,
uh,

597
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.180
not all of them.
Yeah.
But you need to watch out for that.

598
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:06.350
And if you look at some of those serial killers,
you know,
uh,
I think it was,

599
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.630
I think it was Ted Bundy,

600
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:12.440
but he had the whole thing where he had his arm in a cast and he would ask

601
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:15.140
someone to help him.
You'd ask her a woman to help,
hey,

602
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:18.830
I need to get my groceries in the car or whatever.
And they see this kind of,

603
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:19.940
and if you ever saw a picture of me,

604
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:24.770
it looks like a nerd and he has his arm in a cast and he's got a collared shirt

605
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:29.060
on,
he looks like a white collar guy and he's got a car and,
and you know,

606
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:32.360
next thing you know,
as soon as they don't help with the groceries,
boom,

607
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:35.870
the arms out of the cast.
And he's,
he's abducting them.
And so,

608
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.120
so what do,

609
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.460
how do they identify like the red flag people more about

610
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.750
<v 5>your,
your gut intuition.</v>

611
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.670
If there's something that just makes you feel a little bit weird if they say

612
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:50.850
something,
you know,
it's listening.

613
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:55.370
It's about listening to that internal voice that might be telling you

614
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:59.450
something's a little weird,
but he's a really nice guy,
you know,
he's,

615
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.280
and,
and learning how to identify that and listen to it.
Um,

616
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.160
because yeah,
that's like I said,
pedophile sexual predators,

617
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:13.790
they're not stupid people.
Most of them aren't stupid people.

618
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:18.560
They're very calculating and they look for the right opportunities.

619
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:19.790
So you've,
yeah,

620
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:23.980
you've got to teach your kid specifically that.

621
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.210
<v 3>Yeah.
It seems like you need to teach your kids specifically the,
the,</v>

622
00:44:27.211 --> 00:44:31.740
I said no part,
right?
Because even you as a kid,
you don't know how to say no.

623
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.800
You don't know how to scream.
You don't know how to tell someone to stop and,

624
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.720
and also how to identify what you know.
Kids don't know where the line is.

625
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:44.721
If you don't teach them what's right and what's wrong in terms of physical

626
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.180
contact with them,
then how,
how are they going to know?

627
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.530
How are they going to know?

628
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.790
<v 7>Exactly.
That's a good point.
Now you,</v>

629
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:59.330
you don't want to scold the kid for making a mistake and you know how you hold

630
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:02.880
lying is in higher regard as far as violations go.

631
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.240
Where if this environment is kind of created that what you say doesn't mean that

632
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:12.840
much.
So be careful with what you said,
you know,
but if the environment is,
hey,

633
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:15.180
you can come to me with anything and you demonstrate that,

634
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.580
don't just say like once a month,
say,
hey,

635
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.940
you can come to me with anything next day.
They come to you with something.

636
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:24.240
You're like,
Hey,
I'm busy.
Or Hey,
grown ups are talking,
you know,

637
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.390
so if you actually provide that environment consistently,

638
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.130
they'll come to you with anything.
Anything that's off.
They'll be like,
yeah,

639
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.710
hey mom,
what's this?
Hey,
there's a rabbit in the backyard,
you know,

640
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.150
so even something that small,

641
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:41.220
so some Weirdo or some red flag person comes and they're doing something strange

642
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.300
out of the ordinary,
they're going to come to you

643
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.100
<v 3>way more likely,
you know?
Yeah.
You know,</v>

644
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.960
we talk about inoculation when it comes to training for combat and you know,
you,

645
00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:55.660
you inoculate yourself distress and,

646
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.500
and one of the things I talk about like with self defense for especially for

647
00:45:59.501 --> 00:46:01.270
women is if you train Jujitsu,

648
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:03.880
you get inoculated to the fact that someone's going to be grabbing you,

649
00:46:03.881 --> 00:46:07.540
touching you,
grinding on you and it's,
and so you're over that,
you're over that.

650
00:46:07.541 --> 00:46:12.470
But it seems like this is the same situation you do with kids where you or knock

651
00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:15.100
you late them to the uncomfortable conversations.

652
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:19.780
So they're okay talking about stuff that,
let's face it,

653
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:20.770
you know,
there's,

654
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.000
your kid is not going to be comfortable talking about some things unless you

655
00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:28.330
inoculate them and you get them used to it and they understand what's right and

656
00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:29.030
what's wrong.

657
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.500
<v 7>I think it's correct what you said.</v>

658
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:35.540
It's the parents are typically the ones going to be more uncomfortable.

659
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.510
Like the key,
you'd be surprised with kids.
They'll just talk about,
yeah,

660
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.660
like weird.
Unless you made it uncomfortable for them.
Yeah.

661
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.640
We'll talk about some weird stuff,
especially five,
six.
But if the parents,

662
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.760
hey,
and you know in your scenario where they'll ask you something,

663
00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:52.070
you give the answer,
they say,
good,
that's the answer I want.

664
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.640
Let's don't talk anymore.
Because they're uncomfortable

665
00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.370
<v 5>and it's all on the parent to initiate these conversations.</v>

666
00:46:58.371 --> 00:47:02.030
It's not on the little kids to come to you and tell you something big has

667
00:47:02.031 --> 00:47:06.740
happened.
It's on you as a parent to initiate these conversations.
Yeah.

668
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.580
My daughter is,
um,
she's,

669
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:14.620
she's shy and she doesn't express her emotions very well.

670
00:47:15.171 --> 00:47:19.670
She's not the kind of kid who comes and just tells you stuff and I don't,

671
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.480
I don't want this to sound like I'm beating this stuff into my kids' heads every

672
00:47:23.481 --> 00:47:26.930
day and terrorizing them with the thought of scary things that might happen to

673
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:30.700
them because I'm not,
you know,
I talk it casually enough.

674
00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:34.390
I think that it gets through to them,
but she had,

675
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.420
she's in kindergarten and she had a little issue and she told me that a boy has

676
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.800
been coming up to her on the playground and she,

677
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:48.940
I always use correct terminology because that's another thing I want.

678
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.180
I feel like kids should be comfortable talking about their bodies and she told

679
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:58.690
me,
and it was hard for her to tell me she didn't want to tell me and I could

680
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.800
totally see it because of her personality.
She came up and she's,

681
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:06.810
she told me that a little boy was coming up every day on the playground and like

682
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.020
poking her in the vagina and then asking her to do the same to him and she's,

683
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.850
I think she's five.
She told me that and I was like,
okay,

684
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:22.120
what I'm doing is working,
because knowing her personality,

685
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:27.070
she didn't want to tell me that,
but she did.
And so as the NFL,

686
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:31.780
that was also the perfect experience to sort of teach like,
okay,

687
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.710
cool.
Not a big deal.
He's five years old,
you know,

688
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.200
they little kids do that and they don't know what they're doing.

689
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:40.990
But let's go talk to your teacher and make sure,
you know.

690
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:45.250
And I immediately took action and showed her that I wasn't gonna let anything

691
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:47.920
happen to her if she was uncomfortable with it,

692
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.020
without blowing it out of proportion.

693
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:51.941
<v 3>I was going to say,</v>

694
00:48:51.941 --> 00:48:55.690
cause a lot of times the what kids are embarrassed about from aged,

695
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:59.850
whatever it is,
they don't want to tell you,
cause you know my,

696
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.960
my 17 year old will do that as well.
My seven year old Dad Dad told,
you know,

697
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.350
so I think that's another thing is how do you make sure that they realize that

698
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:11.410
you're going to be,
you know,
without blowing it out of proportion,
which,

699
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.360
which I agree with you,
you know,
it's a five year old kid.

700
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:16.000
It's a five year old boy.
They're doing,
like you said,

701
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:19.120
they're talking about stupid stuff that they don't understand and they're doing

702
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:22.120
things that they don't understand yet.
That's like,
okay but,

703
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:27.280
<v 5>but let's now teach them,
let's let them learn at that.</v>

704
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.420
And that gave me a lot of confidence that if something,
because I,

705
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.910
because she dealt with that in a great way,

706
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.950
you have something bigger where to happen.

707
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.970
I now feel like she would be much more inclined to come to me.

708
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.550
But what you're saying about not wanting to make a scene,

709
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:47.551
I think as I got older and and understood what was happening to me a lot more

710
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.290
than I did when I was little.
Yeah,

711
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:58.130
I didn't want to make a scene.
This is somebody who was my parents' best friend,

712
00:49:58.131 --> 00:49:59.990
was deeply involved in our life,

713
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
had been with us for ever and imagine what

714
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.470
taling would look like.

715
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:15.430
And that wasn't something that I was prepared to handle even when I was a

716
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:19.790
teenager and I knew exactly what was going on and I knew exactly how wrong it

717
00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:20.091
was.

718
00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:25.070
The scene that would ensue if I said something was not something that I was

719
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:28.040
willing to deal with,
that's even hard for to do

720
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.070
<v 3>any kind of like confrontation that's going to cause these big ripples.</v>

721
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:34.430
It's like,
man,
I got to weigh all this out now.
You know,
like,

722
00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:39.200
can I strengthen myself up versus,
you know,
create this big scene.

723
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:41.550
I'd rather deal with strengthening myself up in DC.

724
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.540
You have no idea in your mind,

725
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.550
you probably made it even a bigger crazy.

726
00:50:47.551 --> 00:50:49.700
See you were probably thinking that they were going to have to make a choice

727
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:53.380
between you and this guy.
You know,
maybe in your mind that's your best friend.

728
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.700
You know,
now you've got to convince people,

729
00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.800
it just becomes easier to just not say anything.

730
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.370
<v 5>You don't know if they're going to believe you.</v>

731
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.150
You don't know if he's going to go to jail.
You,

732
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.780
you just don't know what the consequences are going to be.

733
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:12.320
And it's much easier to just be like,
all right,
I've dealt with this.

734
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:17.170
I can keep dealing with this.
I'm not gonna cause any ripples.

735
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.100
<v 3>So as you go along,
to go back to your writing here,</v>

736
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:23.740
<v 1>okay.</v>

737
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.830
<v 3>As I grew older,
I got better and better at avoiding him.</v>

738
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.050
His hounding of me did not decrease,
but I rarely let him get his hands on me.

739
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:37.990
I was incapable of just telling him to get away from me.
If he got me cornered,

740
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.420
I'm not sure how to explain what this is like.

741
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.520
This constant pursuit and hounding that you are unable to avoid when you are a

742
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:51.690
child.
When I was 12 years old,

743
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.680
we moved,

744
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:58.610
it was over seven years of stress and fear and pain finally replaced with an

745
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:02.640
empty discomfort.

746
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.830
A weight was lifted from my shoulders.

747
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.900
I got a horse and felt more freedom than I ever had

748
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:17.170
and then he followed

749
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.970
<v 1>okay.</v>

750
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.960
<v 3>He bought a piece of property just up the hill from us and that was the</v>

751
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:26.560
beginning of dealing with him.
As a teenager,

752
00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.990
I never let him touch me again.

753
00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:33.550
I tolerated as crude comments and ate dinner next to him at the dinner table.

754
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.160
I laughed at his jokes and I do to flee.

755
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:39.220
Rode my horse up the hill to check on him every couple of days.

756
00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.380
At the insistence of my parents,

757
00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:47.070
he would always come out of his trailer and lay a hand on my thigh,

758
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.890
invite me to tie up and come inside.

759
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.060
I still couldn't look them in the,
I still couldn't tell him to fuck off.

760
00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:58.810
Instead,

761
00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:03.810
I would just change the subject and ride off with a hollow pit in my stomach.

762
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.270
So you move away and then he follows you there.

763
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

764
00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:25.990
<v 3>You know,
you</v>

765
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.390
<v 6>talk about how hard it is to explain this,</v>

766
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.920
this hounding that you got and you're trapped.
You can't,

767
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.890
you don't feel like you can say anything to your family.

768
00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.420
You can't get away from him.
And this has just gotta be,
I mean,
you,

769
00:53:39.421 --> 00:53:43.180
you see a hollow pit in your stomach

770
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.900
<v 3>and this has just got to be eating at you.</v>

771
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:49.973
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

772
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:57.220
<v 3>And you find finally some comfort in horses,</v>

773
00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:01.100
which was already your dream.
And now you finally get,

774
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.250
you finally get your first horse.

775
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:06.920
<v 5>Yeah.
That was,
um,</v>

776
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:13.300
the best thing that ever happened to me up until that point.
At least maybe ever.

777
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.633
Um,

778
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.830
there was a neighbor lady that lived close to us who had this horse that she

779
00:54:20.831 --> 00:54:25.090
didn't have time for and she let me bring it home and start riding it.

780
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.290
And I didn't,
my family never had horses.

781
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:34.291
We knew nothing about horses other than my just insane desire to have one.

782
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:42.390
And so I just started riding it and this horse was half broke at best and I

783
00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:48.730
would fall off constantly.

784
00:54:48.731 --> 00:54:53.731
I just would smack my head on the ice and get back on and fall off again.

785
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:59.290
And I remember my dad one time standing there and just telling me,

786
00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:01.840
you got to stop.
You can't,
you can't eat.

787
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.440
I'm not going to let you sit here and kill yourself trying to ride this horse.

788
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:10.120
And you know,
of course
back then I didn't,

789
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:15.510
I didn't have a silly thing like a riding helmet or even a saddle.

790
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:18.700
I just,

791
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.700
I just had this desire to ride this horse and if it was going to kill me,

792
00:55:23.861 --> 00:55:28.210
it was gonna happen.
And so I did.

793
00:55:28.211 --> 00:55:31.980
I just kept after it and finally wore the poor horse down and he,

794
00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:35.170
he gave up and he ended up being,
you know,

795
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.680
the by my side for,
for many years.

796
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.940
And so that,

797
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.850
that gave me this whole different level of freedom.

798
00:55:45.851 --> 00:55:49.870
I wasn't constrained to my feet anymore.

799
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:54.850
I could go out and get just miles and miles away from it all.

800
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.220
And you know,
home wasn't,

801
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.690
it wasn't a comforting spot for me to be.

802
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.780
So I was much more comfortable being out in the mountains by myself with my

803
00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:07.654
horse.

804
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.300
And some people might have an issue with this.

805
00:56:13.301 --> 00:56:18.301
But by the time I was 12 I was carrying a 30 30 rifle on in a scabbard on my

806
00:56:22.481 --> 00:56:27.280
saddle and I had a little Ruker 22 that I carried with me,

807
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.020
you know,
one or the other.

808
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:33.820
Usually when I was out riding because my parents felt like I was safer with a

809
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:37.240
gun than without a gun,
even though I was 12 years old,

810
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:41.950
I had grown up around guns and was comfortable with them.
And

811
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.460
since I would head out in the mountains and I think the,

812
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:51.340
the only rule I had was that I had to be back by dark.
And you know,

813
00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.650
when you're on a horse and you leave first thing in the morning,

814
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:58.270
you can cover a lot of ground.
And if something had ever happened to me,

815
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:01.690
I,
I don't know how anyone would have even found me.
So I was,

816
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.740
I had to be responsible and self reliant to make sure that I was this safe as I

817
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:09.671
could be out there.

818
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:14.671
And I give my parents a ton of credit for allowing me that freedom.

819
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:23.550
They had a daughter who had this passion to be doing what I was doing and it was

820
00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:31.801
dangerous and they let me do it.

821
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:37.620
And that is a large part of what built me into who I am today.

822
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.850
And so,

823
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:42.270
<v 6>okay.</v>

824
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.930
<v 5>That,
you know,</v>

825
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.490
that's something that I also try to do for my own kids as much as I can,

826
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.140
you know,
you know,
I'm,
I'm pretty cautious with them,

827
00:57:52.141 --> 00:57:55.110
but I still try to always allow them a lot of freedom.

828
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.500
I remember one time I was,

829
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.560
I think I was 15 I was riding a way from home a little ways and I was down in

830
00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:09.660
this creek bottom and I heard this commotion down there,

831
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:12.720
this like barking and noise.

832
00:58:12.721 --> 00:58:15.690
And I thought there were neighborhood dogs who would chase deer.

833
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:19.560
And I thought that the dogs had a deer down down in the creek bottom.

834
00:58:19.561 --> 00:58:20.850
And that was what,

835
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.510
you know what through my went through my head and I ran my horse down through

836
00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:28.500
the brush into this creek bottom thinking I was going to scare the dogs off this

837
00:58:28.501 --> 00:58:33.501
deer and I came out of the brush literally from me to you like five feet away

838
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:35.370
from this mountain lion.

839
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:40.370
It was just in full snarling crouch attack mode and it was squared off with,

840
00:58:41.971 --> 00:58:45.600
I didn't,
I didn't know this when I was riding,

841
00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:50.601
but one of my dogs had followed me and I hadn't seen it and it was down in this

842
00:58:51.001 --> 00:58:55.260
creek bottom with this mountain lion and they were face to face just snarling

843
00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:57.890
and crouched down at each other.
And I,

844
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.470
I came out of the bushes right on top of them.
And

845
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:05.070
you know,
I didn't feel any fear at all.

846
00:59:05.071 --> 00:59:10.071
I just reacted and I just knew I had to get a little space between myself and

847
00:59:10.201 --> 00:59:14.520
the lion and I spun my horse around and got up the hill just a little ways and

848
00:59:14.521 --> 00:59:17.760
then stopped to watch the situation.

849
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.010
And the

850
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.520
dog was as big Wolf Chow Cross.

851
00:59:26.521 --> 00:59:30.990
It was a big dog.
But she,
she got scared and she cut and ran.

852
00:59:30.991 --> 00:59:35.220
She decided she'd had enough and she turned and to run from this cat.

853
00:59:35.221 --> 00:59:39.960
And the second she turned to run,
the cat had her,
it just throw an arm over back,

854
00:59:39.961 --> 00:59:43.020
reached under bid her throat and she just went limp.

855
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.230
And then the cat just picked her up and carried her away.

856
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.360
<v 3>Yeah.
That's cause you're not supposed to turn your back on the ais.
Don't ever,</v>

857
00:59:51.361 --> 00:59:53.130
even when you've kind of wrote away,
I was Kinda like,

858
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:58.250
<v 5>I am.
The reason I did that is because the cat was distracted,
right.</v>

859
00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:02.200
I wasn't the threat to the cat.
I was a side thing.
The threat was this dog.

860
01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:07.620
And thank goodness my horse was just a rock and didn't dump me right in front of

861
01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:09.160
this cat because had that happened,

862
01:00:09.161 --> 01:00:13.540
there's no doubt in my mind that I would have been attacked.
Um,

863
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.560
but you know,
things like that.
That was,
that was my life.

864
01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:22.540
Things like that happened and I was young and I had to be able to deal with

865
01:00:22.541 --> 01:00:23.440
those situations.

866
01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:28.340
<v 3>How old were you at that point?
15 and there's all,
there's also this really,</v>

867
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.400
really strong dichotomy here is that you're out in the wilderness on horseback

868
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.540
pack and heat,
you know,
confronting mountain lions.

869
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.630
And even with all that,

870
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:49.280
you didn't confront this

871
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.950
abuser and,
and that's another,
you know,

872
01:00:55.010 --> 01:01:00.010
sign an indication to people of how hard it is psychologically for someone

873
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:03.440
that's as strong as you were as a teenager that's out there on your own.

874
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.333
Like I said,

875
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:09.620
riding around the mountains with a pistol and a rifle ready to,
you know,

876
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:13.850
get after it.
And yet this by this point,

877
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:18.851
kind of an old man is still has this level of control over you in your own home.

878
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:25.590
Yeah.
That's just,
um,
it and,

879
01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:26.990
and I would say then

880
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:34.060
at this point maybe to fill that hole or to release some of that tension,

881
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.660
you start going down a path.

882
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:39.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

883
01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:44.110
<v 3>That's not a good path for you to be going down in life.</v>

884
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:48.410
<v 5>Yeah.
So when I was also 15,
I,</v>

885
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:53.780
um,
met someone that lived a few miles away from us,

886
01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.630
who was a,
I think he was in his thirties.

887
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:02.090
He was an Indian guy and he rode around the mountains on his horse as well.

888
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:03.000
And it was,
um,

889
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.283
<v 2>yeah,</v>

890
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.900
<v 5>I did,</v>

891
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.490
I developed a relationship with him and you know,

892
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.353
it was,

893
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.480
he was not the kind of person that you would want your 15 year old to be dating.

894
01:02:16.851 --> 01:02:18.530
But to me he was,

895
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.470
it was just this romantic thing and it was this escape.
It was,

896
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.330
it was something different.

897
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:28.170
And with someone that paid attention to me in a time when I was really

898
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:30.860
struggling with,
um,

899
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.140
my home life and who I was,
I think the,

900
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:40.550
the molestation abuse stuff got harder for me as a teenager,

901
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.114
as I,

902
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:46.770
even though it wasn't actively happening anymore really physically,

903
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:53.420
it was messing with my mind a lot more because I understood it better.

904
01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:00.020
And so I started dating this guy who,
um,

905
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:06.050
you know,
was

906
01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:11.570
a distraction to me from that.
And you know,

907
01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:14.870
in the way 15 year olds,
well,

908
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:18.290
I just became madly in love with him

909
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:23.330
and
you know,

910
01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:28.331
you can make your own conclusions about a 30 something year old man dating a 15

911
01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:31.100
year old.
Um,

912
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:35.210
I certainly feel a lot different about it now than I did then.

913
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:41.180
He Wa he told me that he wanted to marry me.
Like it was,

914
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.490
it was very serious in my mind.

915
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:49.990
And then one morning I was riding away from home down this dirt road and I

916
01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:58.121
remember a neighbor rancher pulled up alongside me and asked me if I'd heard

917
01:03:58.281 --> 01:03:59.114
what happened.

918
01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:05.260
And he told me that this man that I was in love with had been shot and killed.

919
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:11.720
What was the,
what was the genesis of him being shot and killed?

920
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.210
It was,
like I said,
he wasn't,

921
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:22.630
he wasn't the most upstanding person and it had to do with marijuana and guns

922
01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.320
and it,

923
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.710
it was just a mess.
And it was tragic.

924
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:39.800
Yeah,
he wasn't a drug addict,
but he led a life,

925
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:44.180
um,
of,
well,
I'll just say it,

926
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.240
he would steal people's marijuana plants from them and sell them and

927
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:55.420
that got him into trouble.
Um,

928
01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.320
and I look back now on

929
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:03.020
the road that that relationship could have taken me down.

930
01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:08.021
And while it was this horribly tragic event for me at the time that sent me into

931
01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:10.090
an even deeper tailspin

932
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.590
now as an adult the way I am,

933
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.740
I'm almost thankful that it happened because I think that had that not happened,

934
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:25.260
who knows where my life would have gone.

935
01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.300
<v 0>And so what,
you know,
there's,
there's first of all,</v>

936
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:37.910
I can see how 15 year old iris who's dealing with this stuff at home and meets

937
01:05:39.901 --> 01:05:43.740
this guy that's,
you know,
31 and 31 year old is,

938
01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.650
I don't care if he's a total idiot,

939
01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:50.730
he can manipulate the hell out of a 15 year old all day long.
Yeah.
Eh,
but,

940
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.620
but regardless,
you're ended up your,

941
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:58.350
and it's just a super vulnerable situation because of your mindset and you end

942
01:05:58.351 --> 01:06:01.200
up here,
you know,
in this relationship with this guy,

943
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:06.180
now he gets murdered and you go,

944
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:10.140
it's,
you,
you end up just going even worse at the time.

945
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:11.770
<v 5>Yeah.
That was,
uh,</v>

946
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.360
that was a hard thing for my 15 year old brain to process.

947
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.340
And shortly thereafter,
my parents separated,

948
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.180
not in an amiable fashion.

949
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.320
My sister went off to college so I was especially on my own because she was my

950
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:38.251
rock and I just really went into a cycle of depression and misery.

951
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:47.350
And um,
by the time I was 16,

952
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:52.360
I was dating a 32 year old cop,
which again,

953
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.280
you know,

954
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.810
I have very different feelings now on what a 32 year old cop is doing,

955
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:02.350
dating a 16 year old.
But

956
01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:09.160
he was this safety zone for me in a big way.
He was this,
you know,

957
01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:13.150
strong,
brave person who wasn't going to let anything bad happen to me.

958
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.733
And

959
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:21.410
I really latched on to that when I was just trying to find something in life to

960
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.130
hold onto.

961
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.000
And that ended up being a long on and off again relationship,

962
01:07:33.001 --> 01:07:36.510
which definitely was not healthy for me.

963
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:44.190
And then at that point in time I started self mutilating.

964
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.040
I started cutting and burning myself.

965
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.700
Um,
I was definitely very depressed

966
01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.400
and it was not something that I knew how to communicate to anyone.

967
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:06.130
I just was sucked into misery and self pity really.

968
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.510
<v 0>And when you start hurting yourself,
is that</v>

969
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:15.860
<v 3>at moment?</v>

970
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:20.890
Is it just so much anger and frustration that it somehow feels good to feel that

971
01:08:24.021 --> 01:08:28.550
pain and we're inflict pain on yourself,
or is it more of a,

972
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.220
hey,
everyone,
look here,
I'm doing this to myself.

973
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.400
Maybe you should pay some attention to me and help me.

974
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.700
Or is it a little bit of both or is there something that I don't know and

975
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:41.534
understand?

976
01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.580
<v 5>I would say it's definitely both.
It's definitely,</v>

977
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.740
it's a funny thing and it's hard to understand.

978
01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:53.650
It's sort of an addictive behavior

979
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:56.830
and you know,

980
01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:00.910
I've read about it some and they say there's chemicals released in your brain

981
01:09:00.911 --> 01:09:05.650
and stuff when you feel physical pain that makes the emotional,

982
01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:09.880
that Dole's emotional pain and things like that.
But it also,
for me,

983
01:09:09.881 --> 01:09:14.290
I will absolutely say that.
Yeah,
I think it was,
it was a cry for help.
It was like

984
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:21.200
somebody realize what you know.

985
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:24.500
And as all teenagers do,

986
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.110
you think that you're some rare,

987
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:32.111
exotic creature that's no one else has ever experienced anything you've gone

988
01:09:32.511 --> 01:09:34.970
through and nothing anyone says to you.

989
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

990
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.610
<v 5>Matters because they don't know what they're talking about.</v>

991
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:45.310
But
for me a lot,
if it was,

992
01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:49.960
was it a cry for attention to,
to have someone and I got it.

993
01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:53.440
The thing is is I got the attention,
um,
the,

994
01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.640
the cop that I was dating told my parents that I was doing this and people kind

995
01:10:01.691 --> 01:10:06.691
of freaked out and everybody thought that there was really something the matter

996
01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:09.760
with me and I was really depressed and I wouldn't,

997
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:13.810
even though I was getting the attention and people were actually asking me like,

998
01:10:13.811 --> 01:10:18.240
what's going on?
What's,
why are you doing this?
I wouldn't say,

999
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.700
I would not tell anybody.

1000
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:26.500
I just was shut off.
And it's like I wanted the attention,

1001
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.230
but then I still wouldn't say what.

1002
01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.690
And maybe part of it is that I didn't even know.

1003
01:10:31.691 --> 01:10:36.100
But I think what we talked about before of the not wanting to make a scene,

1004
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.760
I was not going to make a scene this at this point,

1005
01:10:39.761 --> 01:10:41.950
my abuser was pretty old,

1006
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.210
but he was still alive and he was still in our lives.
He still,
you know,

1007
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.010
all the time and people were asking me,
what are you doing?

1008
01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:55.120
Why are you doing this?
And I was not going to say

1009
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.860
<v 3>going back to your writing.</v>

1010
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.560
<v 3>By that time I was already damaged by so many years of abuse,</v>

1012
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:14.100
heartbreak and death,
painful and destructive relationships.

1013
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.390
<v 0>My parents were divorced in angry.
My sister had moved away.</v>

1014
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:26.220
I was in a spiritual,
oh,
I was in a spiral of self destruction in self pity.

1015
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.560
I had taken a cutting and burning myself.

1016
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:33.450
Scars that I still carry to this day to remind me of the way my life could have

1017
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:34.284
continued

1018
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.700
and that's what you just talked about and then at this point you're 17 or 18

1019
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:44.370
years old and your abuser,

1020
01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:47.040
who you just said it was now an old guy,

1021
01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.213
<v 4>he dies.</v>

1022
01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.620
<v 0>Then I'm going to continue.
I'm not sure exactly when I woke up,</v>

1023
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.380
when I shut off the Self Pity Fountain and realized that I was strong and

1024
01:12:02.691 --> 01:12:03.770
indestructable

1025
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:10.670
somewhere in my early twenties my twenties was a slow rebuilding of my life the

1026
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:13.860
way I wanted it.

1027
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:15.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1028
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.810
<v 0>I traveled,
wandered,
worked as a horse wrangler around the west,</v>

1029
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:24.880
had relationships with men who were kind and decent,
got married,
got divorced,

1030
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:25.870
made friends,

1031
01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:31.020
built up a reserve of strength and found myself little by little.

1032
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:39.000
So I,
you know,
one of the reasons that you're sitting here today,

1033
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:44.001
one of the reasons that I know you is that despite all that darkness that you

1034
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.050
got sucked into,

1035
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:50.810
<v 1>okay,</v>

1036
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:55.810
<v 0>you somehow in some way at some point realized that you were going in the wrong</v>

1037
01:12:56.121 --> 01:13:00.350
direction and you,
and you turned around and started to,

1038
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.450
and I know we,
I know we've talked about it before,

1039
01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:05.960
it wasn't like you woke up one day and said,
today I'm going to change my life.

1040
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:10.910
You,
you transitioned,
you transformed over a period of time.

1041
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:13.340
You can't put like,
you know,
you're not going to put a day on it.

1042
01:13:13.341 --> 01:13:15.680
You didn't have a Eureka moment,

1043
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:21.050
but you slowly started seeing yourself from a different perspective and

1044
01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:24.740
realizing that the path you were on wasn't a good one.

1045
01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:26.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1046
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.550
<v 4>So as soon as I graduated high school,</v>

1047
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.510
I left to start working on ranches.

1048
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.640
I went to Montana and I remember

1049
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:38.880
clearly I was

1050
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.330
18 I guess,

1051
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.020
and I was working on a ranch in Montana and someone had left laying around this

1052
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.240
dusty old copy of Dh Lawrence Book of poetry.

1053
01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.380
And I read this little poem and it just stuck with me and I'll read it here.

1054
01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:07.710
It's,
I never saw a wild thing,
sorry for itself.

1055
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.160
A small bird will drop frozen dead from without ever having felt sorry for

1056
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:14.884
itself.

1057
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.210
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:22.100
<v 4>And I read those words and they just,
they just hit me in the right place.</v>

1059
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.870
And I'm not saying that that in particular is what really started to make a

1060
01:14:26.871 --> 01:14:29.240
change.
But,
um,

1061
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.570
I read some more things and you know,

1062
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:39.571
I was growing older and I was thinking about things differently and my abuser

1063
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:45.931
had died and that was probably the biggest weight that I've ever felt lifted off

1064
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:53.101
of me because now what I realized is even if I did choose to tell someone it

1065
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:59.230
wasn't going to cause the kind of scene that it would have before.

1066
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.630
And I still didn't really choose to tell anyone.
But that in itself,

1067
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:07.810
not having him actually be present was,

1068
01:15:07.811 --> 01:15:12.811
it was a big thing for me and I realized that I had just been damaging myself

1069
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.620
and I'd really been hurting people in my life.
My,

1070
01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.830
my parents,
my sister,
they were just confused.

1071
01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:24.160
They didn't understand why I was where,

1072
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.920
why I was doing what I was doing to myself.

1073
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.120
And I realized that I was just in this,

1074
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:36.570
I was being selfish and self centered and just feeling sorry for myself

1075
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.410
and I stopped.

1076
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.900
I just gained a little bit of perspective and made myself stop

1077
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.200
<v 3>that that perspective piece is so important and what's crazy to know?</v>

1078
01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.260
We all have seen and everyone's seen people that are in the downward spiral.

1079
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.850
They're just caught in the downward spiral.
Whether it's a relationship,

1080
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:10.810
whether it's booze,
whether it's drugs,
whether it's behavior,

1081
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.990
you can see it and when you're on the outside of it,

1082
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:18.370
it's so obvious and you want to grab that person.

1083
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:19.330
And I'm sure everyone,

1084
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:24.520
I have literally grabbed my friends that I've seen in that downward spiral and

1085
01:16:24.521 --> 01:16:27.550
shaking them and saying,
get out.
Come out,
come here.

1086
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.430
All you have to do is come over here,
step over here with me,

1087
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:33.310
and look back and see what,
what situation you're getting.

1088
01:16:33.311 --> 01:16:35.710
You're in and you're the direction you're heading.

1089
01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.013
<v 6>Hm.</v>

1090
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.250
<v 3>And unfortunately you can't pull them out.</v>

1091
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:45.750
You can't pull their head out and let them look back at themselves.

1092
01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:50.070
They have to step out.
They have to come to that recognition themselves.

1093
01:16:50.071 --> 01:16:55.071
And that's one of the hardest things as a friend or as a family member to watch

1094
01:16:56.341 --> 01:17:00.890
that person.
It's like watching a train wreck and you know,
all you could do,

1095
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.810
you know,
you could press the brakes,
you,
you realize how easy it would be.

1096
01:17:03.811 --> 01:17:07.650
Just a hay,
press the brakes,
press the brake,
stop.
Yeah.

1097
01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.480
And yet we can't,
we can't do it.
We can't help people.

1098
01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:16.790
Can you,
you have to help yourself.
And,
and so,

1099
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:19.400
I mean obviously that poem,
you know,

1100
01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.610
seeing that was a form of you starting to take a look at it,

1101
01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.040
starting to take a look at yourself from a different perspective.

1102
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:29.630
Maybe your abuser dying helped you start to look at that from a different

1103
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:30.940
perspective.
Yup.

1104
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.860
<v 4>In La.
It was,
it was a long,
slow process for me though.</v>

1105
01:17:34.861 --> 01:17:37.200
It didn't just happen overnight.
I mean I,

1106
01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:42.300
I think I'm the made a very conscious decision not to hurt myself anymore,

1107
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.840
but you have to teach yourself how to think and feel and that takes time to

1108
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.080
teach yourself to have the right kind of thoughts and feelings about things.

1109
01:17:58.890 --> 01:17:59.723
And

1110
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.440
one thing that I wanted to say while I'm here talking about this is that just

1111
01:18:07.321 --> 01:18:10.020
because I'm sitting here saying that I did this,

1112
01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:13.470
that I s I woke up and stopped,

1113
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:18.950
doesn't mean that everyone who's experienced something like this should just get

1114
01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:24.570
over it.
Um,

1115
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:28.830
if you have listeners,
if you have a,

1116
01:18:28.831 --> 01:18:33.831
a girlfriend or a wife or a sister or someone who has been through something

1117
01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:34.501
like this,

1118
01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:38.820
or maybe after listening to this show will confess to you that they've been

1119
01:18:38.821 --> 01:18:41.520
through something like this.
Maybe they've never told you before

1120
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:47.351
and,

1121
01:18:47.351 --> 01:18:51.380
and maybe they'll tell you something that doesn't even seem like that big of a

1122
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:52.214
deal.

1123
01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:57.340
Maybe it's not years and years of abuse or

1124
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:00.920
violence.

1125
01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:06.140
Maybe it is something that you know,

1126
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:11.030
happen to them when they were young and it's a sucky situation,
but it's not,

1127
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:13.280
it's not horrible.
It's a horrific,

1128
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.240
but she still feels file lated and it's this personal process that you have to

1129
01:19:22.671 --> 01:19:26.930
go through and and friends and family and people that know someone is struggling

1130
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.040
with this.
Definitely need to support you in every way they can.

1131
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:35.950
But you also don't become a crutch

1132
01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.650
just because someone has gone through something like this,

1133
01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:46.651
doesn't give them the right to drag everyone else down with them into the,

1134
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:51.820
into their pit of depression and misery.

1135
01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:59.420
So you support the best you can without enabling

1136
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.910
the bad behavior because that's really what it is.
It's behavior.

1137
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.190
There's

1138
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:13.190
<v 3>people who've gone through much more horrific things than anything I have ever</v>

1139
01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:14.694
been through.

1140
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:20.030
They'd have come out fine and it's just getting your mind in the right place and

1141
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.660
taking control of your,
your thoughts.

1142
01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.760
And I know,

1143
01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:32.340
you know you have a obviously experience being being married to a military

1144
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:32.970
member.

1145
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:37.970
And I would say along the lines of what you just said is that people aren't

1146
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.470
going to handle things differently.

1147
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.460
Then you can have two guys that were on the same exact combat deployment and did

1148
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:47.820
you know pretty much the same things and they're just going to have to deal with

1149
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:48.654
it in a different way.

1150
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:52.500
And maybe one guy gets over it pretty quick or maybe one guy barely even reacts

1151
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:56.220
to it.
Maybe one guy,
it really hurts them and it takes them some time.

1152
01:20:56.221 --> 01:20:59.700
And it sounds like it's the same thing with,
with what you're saying,

1153
01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:04.320
we have to be
open to,
hey,

1154
01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:08.280
this may take some time and it may take a different course and at the exact,

1155
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:12.390
again to mirror what you just said,
there's,

1156
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:17.450
there's guys that just because they had some rough combat that doesn't give them

1157
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:21.300
the right to number one,
dragged them,

1158
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:23.610
drag themselves down the wrong path,

1159
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:26.890
a number to drag their family and their friends down the wrong path.
And,

1160
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:29.820
and I think definitely,
you know,
saying,
hey look,

1161
01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:34.350
I don't claim to understand what you've been through,

1162
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.390
but I do know this.
Your behavior is not going to get help.
It right the,
the,

1163
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.470
the bottle isn't going to help it.
The self abuse isn't going to help it.

1164
01:21:43.471 --> 01:21:47.340
The skipping work isn't going to help it.
So I think those are,
those are,

1165
01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:49.050
those are fairly similar.
Again,
I don't,

1166
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.870
I'm not trying to say that at the same thing.
I'm just saying that there's,

1167
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:55.020
that dealing with them has a lot of similarities.

1168
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:58.650
Both guys that have been in combat trauma and people that have suffered this

1169
01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:01.860
type of abuse.
It seems like there's some similarities in the way that,

1170
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:05.220
that there's varied ways that they can handle it.

1171
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:08.970
There always has to be accountability for your own actions.

1172
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:12.630
No matter what you've been through.
You can't just say,

1173
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:17.070
I've been through something horrible so I can act like this.
Well,
you know,

1174
01:22:17.071 --> 01:22:20.730
case in point before we pressed record today,
you and I were talking about,

1175
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:21.151
you know,

1176
01:22:21.151 --> 01:22:26.000
colonel reader who came on the show and who was a pow and it was amazing.

1177
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:30.240
And you just think that guy,
you know,

1178
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:35.130
just has been through,
he's been through hell.

1179
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:39.540
And then he sits there during the podcast and says the same thing that you just

1180
01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:41.370
said,
which is,
look,
I had a rough,

1181
01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:45.390
but there's plenty of guys that had it way worse than me.
And,
and you know,

1182
01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:46.530
I think,
I don't,

1183
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:51.800
I can't think of anything worse than a two foot tall bamboo cage in the middle

1184
01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:52.740
of the,

1185
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:57.740
of the jungle with rats eating my wounds with my feet shackled into a bamboo

1186
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:06.010
shackle.
You know,
that is just,
that's just unbelievable.

1187
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:11.140
And to your point,
he comes on and says,
you know,
number one,

1188
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:15.370
other people have had it rougher than me and number two,
I'm happy for it.

1189
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:17.440
I've got it,
let's move forward.

1190
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:24.430
<v 4>So it really wasn't until my kids were born that,</v>

1191
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:28.340
I mean,
this was,
this was in my mind all the time.
I probably,

1192
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:35.470
I would say into my mid twenties this is how prevalent it was.

1193
01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.960
I probably thought about the abuse at least once every single day.

1194
01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:44.270
It was always in my mind

1195
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:51.250
and eventually I learned that I didn't need to waste my thoughts on that and

1196
01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:59.150
learn to spend less time thinking about it.

1197
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:02.750
But it really wasn't until my kids were born,
I think.

1198
01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:06.740
And my daughter was five years old.

1199
01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.260
She was just this little girl,
this little girl,

1200
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:18.130
and she was the same age that I was when I was already dealing with abuse.

1201
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:20.623
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1202
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:25.760
<v 4>And that just made me burn with rage.</v>

1203
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:32.050
And I realized that I felt that I had an obligation to speak about this.

1204
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.910
Did it happens to so many kids,

1205
01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:41.960
it's so prevalent in not,
you know,

1206
01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:46.100
girls,
but also boys.
It's not just girls.

1207
01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:50.150
This is how it happens in higher number to girls.
But it happens to both.

1208
01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:53.023
And

1209
01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.140
I felt like what I had been through and what I had,

1210
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.041
you know,

1211
01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:06.041
I think I've come around and am a pretty well adjusted person now and that I had

1212
01:25:07.461 --> 01:25:11.150
an obligation to talk about this because it's something that doesn't get talked

1213
01:25:11.151 --> 01:25:11.331
about.

1214
01:25:11.331 --> 01:25:14.930
It gets swept under the rug and even people who have happened to get treated

1215
01:25:14.931 --> 01:25:19.040
like there's something wrong with them and theirs and they're embarrassed and

1216
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:22.910
they don't want to talk about it and it's time for that to stop.

1217
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.540
It's time for us to start talking about it.

1218
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.650
And I'm,
I feel like I'm resilient.

1219
01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.760
I grew up with this really close proximity to nature and I've seen animals

1220
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:43.800
suffer

1221
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:49.080
horrific wounds that should kill them.

1222
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:54.830
They don't have doctors,
they don't have medicine,

1223
01:25:56.030 --> 01:26:01.030
but they've got fire in their hearts and they don't feel sorry for themselves

1224
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:03.200
and they survive.

1225
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:10.750
<v 5>And I credit a lot of my resiliency to my upbringing in nature and observation</v>

1226
01:26:12.831 --> 01:26:17.831
of nature and how it's cruel and it's beautiful and creatures survive in the

1227
01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:30.191
most difficult and challenging service situations and they flourish.

1228
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:35.480
And if they can do that,
so can I.

1229
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:44.020
<v 3>That's awesome.
That is just awesome,
man.
You know,</v>

1230
01:26:44.021 --> 01:26:45.310
you kind of um,

1231
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:51.600
went right to talking about your kids,
right?
To talking about your daughter,
you,

1232
01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:55.230
you,
uh,
you know,
as you got out of that

1233
01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.970
bad time of your life,
you ended up meeting your,
your husband,
my friend,

1234
01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:01.661
your husband,

1235
01:27:01.661 --> 01:27:06.550
and my note here is that do you meeting your husband was the best thing that

1236
01:27:06.551 --> 01:27:10.990
ever happened to him.
And,
and now,

1237
01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:13.560
and that's another reason why I w you know,

1238
01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:18.340
I really wanted to bring you on and have you share some of your experiences.

1239
01:27:18.341 --> 01:27:21.040
Obviously the be the abuse and your,

1240
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.420
your survival and your attitude about all that,

1241
01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:30.190
but bringing also that strength to,
and you know,

1242
01:27:30.191 --> 01:27:33.890
people have always asked if I would bring my wife on and you know,
my wife,
yeah,

1243
01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:36.530
she's wonderful,
she's wonderful.
She's not coming on the pocket.

1244
01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.370
It's not her deal.
But you know,

1245
01:27:39.371 --> 01:27:43.090
people always want to know because there's a lot of young military families out

1246
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.400
there and you know,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna say this right now.

1247
01:27:45.401 --> 01:27:50.020
I'm going to talk about military families and in the background,

1248
01:27:50.021 --> 01:27:54.010
I just want everyone to think,
first of all,
that also applies to,
you know,

1249
01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:58.000
cops and first responders and firefighters.
Maybe not to this in fact,

1250
01:27:58.001 --> 01:28:01.660
not to the same degree,
but also just normal,
you know,

1251
01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:04.690
hardworking Americans,
men and women who,
you know,

1252
01:28:04.691 --> 01:28:08.000
you've got someone that's working hard and gone a lot and dedicating a lot to

1253
01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:12.550
their job.
So that applies across the board.
But that being said,

1254
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.970
you know,
you're a military wife.
Um,

1255
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:19.290
my wife's a military wife and you,

1256
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:24.040
you ended up in this situation.
Well you,
you met your current husband who's a,

1257
01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:27.880
you know,
like I said,
a good friend of mine and,
and we,
I was on my,

1258
01:28:27.881 --> 01:28:31.120
for my very first deployment ever back in the day,

1259
01:28:31.121 --> 01:28:35.260
had to fit that one in was he was on deployment as well and I think it was his

1260
01:28:35.261 --> 01:28:39.400
second deployment and you know,
we met and hit it off immediately.

1261
01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:43.090
He kind of grew up,
he grew up in California.
I grew up on the east coast,

1262
01:28:43.091 --> 01:28:46.090
but we grew up with a similar kind of background.

1263
01:28:46.091 --> 01:28:51.091
And that we were both kind of into hardcore music and metal and punk rock and we

1264
01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.460
were just into the same kind of stuff.

1265
01:28:54.461 --> 01:28:57.130
And we recognize that immediately about each other.

1266
01:28:57.131 --> 01:29:00.700
And so we became friends back then and with them we spent many years at

1267
01:29:00.701 --> 01:29:05.250
different and,
but we,
uh,
we ended up being together at seal team three.

1268
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:08.370
He was in different task unit than me.
But anyways,

1269
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:13.750
you got a guy,
you ended up being married to a great guy,

1270
01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:18.100
but who's a military guy deploying all the time.

1271
01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.290
You didn't come from a military background,

1272
01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:25.060
you didn't have military in your life.
What was that like?

1273
01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:29.890
How was it like being welcomed into the military family and the harsh realities

1274
01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:31.420
of a,

1275
01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:35.890
being married to a military member during a time of war?

1276
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.080
<v 4>Um,
yeah,
I,
I</v>

1277
01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.320
<v 5>definitely not from a military family,
I don't,</v>

1278
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.130
I barely knew what a navy seal was.
Um,

1279
01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:51.470
I wasn't impressed particularly with it

1280
01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:53.710
<v 3>the fact that he was a navy seal.</v>

1281
01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.573
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1282
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:59.780
<v 4>I think that I'm</v>

1283
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.720
<v 5>fairly well suited to the lifestyle because I'm pretty independent and I'm</v>

1284
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:10.243
<v 6>okay.</v>

1285
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.970
<v 5>I don't tend to be someone who frats a lot over what might happen.</v>

1286
01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.200
I know that he loves his job and he's well trained as he can possibly be to do

1287
01:30:22.691 --> 01:30:26.800
the job that he does.
And so you know,

1288
01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:31.390
that's really,
that's really all there is for me.

1289
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.381
And you know,

1290
01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:37.381
of course there's moments where you feel a little bit sorry for yourself and

1291
01:30:37.481 --> 01:30:39.820
think,
gosh,
what if something happens?

1292
01:30:39.821 --> 01:30:44.800
What if he comes home without his legs or with half his face trapping old or

1293
01:30:44.801 --> 01:30:48.250
something.
But you know,

1294
01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.080
I don't anymore.

1295
01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:55.110
That stuff doesn't get into my head much and so I don't,

1296
01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.610
I just don't really worry about it.

1297
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.270
<v 3>You don't want to,
one of the,</v>

1298
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:04.150
you talk about being independent and I know obviously you're independent person,

1299
01:31:04.151 --> 01:31:07.750
you could get a lot by herself and,
and my wife's the same way,

1300
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:11.020
very independent in terms of her day to day.
She doesn't,

1301
01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.420
she doesn't need me to actually do anything for her.
But I,

1302
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:17.890
I wrote down a note just to talk about another level of independence and that's

1303
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:21.130
emotional independence,
which I think is very important.

1304
01:31:21.131 --> 01:31:22.750
I think it's something that,
you know,

1305
01:31:22.751 --> 01:31:27.430
spouses need to find for each other because I think there's spouses that become

1306
01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.890
emotionally dependent on each other.

1307
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:33.160
And that works in a day to day relationship if you're seeing each other all the

1308
01:31:33.161 --> 01:31:37.060
time.
But if your husband or your wife goes on deployment and leaves you for six

1309
01:31:37.061 --> 01:31:42.040
months to 14 months to 18 months,
if you're in a long deployment cycle,

1310
01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:47.140
you are not going to have that emotional shoulder to lean on.

1311
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.420
It's not going to be there.

1312
01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:54.850
And so you have to learn how to be emotionally independent.

1313
01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.240
Now what's scary about this is that obviously if you get so much emotional

1314
01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:05.950
independence that you're no longer,
you could lose connection,
right?
Yeah.

1315
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:09.850
And so that's what you have to watch out for.
And I think what you see with,

1316
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.950
especially with younger married couples,

1317
01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:17.190
the emotional independence from one person leads up to leads to some kind of

1318
01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:20.020
emotional dependence on some of their person that they meet.
Next thing you know,

1319
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:21.400
we have a bad situation.

1320
01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.940
So I think that emotional independence is something if you talk about with each

1321
01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:26.380
other and you said,
you know,

1322
01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:30.790
my wife was one of the best things about my wife is I w I wouldn't even talk to

1323
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:35.080
my wife,
you know,
just not,
you know,
I wouldn't send her an email.
It'd be a week,

1324
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:39.670
two weeks,
three weeks,
no email,
nothing.
Because I'm over doing my job and,

1325
01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:44.380
and she wouldn't think to herself,
oh,
he's not talking and send me an email.

1326
01:32:44.381 --> 01:32:48.220
Why aren't you emailing me,
send me know,
like,
Hey,
he's busy.
You know,

1327
01:32:48.221 --> 01:32:50.520
she wasn't dependent on me for her emotions.

1328
01:32:50.521 --> 01:32:55.120
So I think that's another important piece that you need to talk about with your

1329
01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:56.980
spouse if you're in a military situation.

1330
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:59.330
<v 4>Yeah.
I,
uh,</v>

1331
01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:04.310
my husband's pretty good actually about staying in touch with me and

1332
01:33:04.311 --> 01:33:05.930
communication on deployments,

1333
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:11.500
but it's not because of a emotionally being dependent on each other.

1334
01:33:12.291 --> 01:33:13.610
That's just the way he is.

1335
01:33:13.611 --> 01:33:18.611
He values my opinion on things a lot and we talk about things and um,

1336
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:25.430
you know,
so,
so we do communicate quite a bit,
but I,
yeah,

1337
01:33:25.431 --> 01:33:30.050
I completely know what you mean about the,
and as,

1338
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:33.590
as being a wife sitting at home with your husband gone.

1339
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:38.570
Like you can't just sit there and pine over them being gone and wait for them to

1340
01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:42.800
come home.
You have to have your own life.
You have to

1341
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:49.390
carry on while they're gone and that's the best way you can support them.

1342
01:33:51.351 --> 01:33:54.470
I think if you're,
you know,

1343
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:58.700
making them feel bad for not calling you every opportunity you get.

1344
01:33:58.701 --> 01:34:01.820
And then laying a guilt trip on them about,
you know,

1345
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:06.770
the fact that they're not giving you enough attention and stuff when they've got

1346
01:34:06.771 --> 01:34:09.950
you.
Yeah.
You,
you can't do that.
You've got to,

1347
01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:13.400
you've got to just take charge of your own life and,

1348
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.430
and do that while they're away.

1349
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.980
<v 3>Now when they're away,</v>

1350
01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:24.100
obviously that's some things you deal with them there a way and then you have

1351
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:28.010
other things that you have to deal with when they come back home.

1352
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:31.670
Especially during a,

1353
01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.090
during a hard deployment.

1354
01:34:35.091 --> 01:34:38.630
Now I know a lot of civilians listen to this show as well.

1355
01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.920
And it's important to recognize that there's different types of deployments and

1356
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:45.830
even during the same time period,

1357
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:51.070
exact same deployment cycle with two groups of people or a hundred groups of

1358
01:34:51.381 --> 01:34:56.330
people,
there'll be some people that are in an area or in an area of operational.

1359
01:34:56.331 --> 01:35:01.000
And we'll have a mission that will allow them to completely coast and,
and,

1360
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.580
and enjoy themselves and have plenty of free time.
And,
and that can happen.

1361
01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:10.300
And then the other end of the spectrum is you can go on deployment and you can

1362
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:15.710
think,
you can end up in total violence and chaos and mayhem.

1363
01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:19.990
And I just thought of this,
my first deployment to Iraq,
you know,

1364
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.480
we did a lot of operations.
It was cool,
it was fun,

1365
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:27.740
they were really good operations.
And when I got back,
when I was there,

1366
01:35:27.741 --> 01:35:30.760
I was thinking,
man,
I wish I would've brought my guitar because you know,

1367
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:31.790
I had some time,
you know,
I'd be like,

1368
01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:35.030
maybe I could have probably played guitar for you know,
half hour day,

1369
01:35:35.031 --> 01:35:37.850
maybe 45 minutes to be for a couple of the guys would have brought their guitar,

1370
01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:42.010
we could add some little jam sessions.
Right.
And we were working a lot.
You don't,

1371
01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:44.090
our op tempo was high.
We were working,
we were probably,
you know,

1372
01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:48.020
we're doing probably a mission every one,
two or three days we were out.

1373
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:53.750
So my next appointment I said to myself,
cool,
you don't bring a guitar,
you know,

1374
01:35:53.751 --> 01:35:58.160
with time,
get work on the work,
on the rifts.
Sure.

1375
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.280
Go back in this deployment was to Ramadi and I think Lafe Lafe and I played

1376
01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:05.570
guitar so much time we played,

1377
01:36:05.571 --> 01:36:08.960
we played the tall one time when there was like three days left in deployment,

1378
01:36:08.961 --> 01:36:10.070
we broke out a guitar is good.

1379
01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.500
And there was another task unit there now and we were turning over.

1380
01:36:12.501 --> 01:36:15.160
But that shows you the difference.
And we,

1381
01:36:15.161 --> 01:36:18.350
we literally did not have any time to do any of that.

1382
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.330
And obviously the,

1383
01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:24.920
the pressure of combat on my second deployment to Iraq was a thousand times more

1384
01:36:24.921 --> 01:36:25.730
intense.

1385
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:29.930
And I know that your husband has done multiple deployments as well and they

1386
01:36:29.931 --> 01:36:34.931
varied in stress level and they varied in amount of combat and amount of direct

1387
01:36:35.091 --> 01:36:38.000
combat and his leadership,
uh,
situation.

1388
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:40.610
But I know that,
you know,

1389
01:36:40.611 --> 01:36:45.250
not too long ago he went on deployment that was definitely high stress and they

1390
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:50.290
saw a lot of hard combat and when he came home from that,

1391
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.780
you know,
what was that,
what was that like?

1392
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:57.050
What did you notice and what do you think other people should look for?

1393
01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.620
<v 4>So</v>

1394
01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.480
the very first night he was home from that deployment,

1395
01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:07.800
I woke up in the middle of the night and he was standing over the bed holding a

1396
01:37:07.801 --> 01:37:08.634
gun.

1397
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:15.020
And that sort of shocked me a little bit and made me realize that I was dealing

1398
01:37:15.481 --> 01:37:18.510
with something a little bit different.

1399
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:23.540
I talked to him on deployment and over the course of the deployment I could hear

1400
01:37:24.121 --> 01:37:25.320
his voice changing.

1401
01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:29.460
I could tell that he was,

1402
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.520
he was changing.
It was,

1403
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:36.930
it was strenuous than there was a lot of,
um,

1404
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.510
engagement.
And when he came back,

1405
01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:46.860
he just,
you know,
when he woke up in the middle of the night,

1406
01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.320
his immediate response,

1407
01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.800
he just heard a noise that dogs barked or something and he just jumped for a

1408
01:37:52.801 --> 01:37:56.700
weapon.
He just startled

1409
01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:01.100
<v 5>easily.
And that was his reaction.
Um,</v>

1410
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:03.930
he had a definitely a shorter temper,

1411
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.080
little things that he shouldn't have been getting mad about.

1412
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:10.950
We're setting him off,
you know,
just,
just dumb stuff.

1413
01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:14.820
Somebody would say something or do something and he would get so mad about it

1414
01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:18.900
and it was like,
you know,

1415
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:24.480
take it down a notch.
He started,
um,
you know,

1416
01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:27.780
I don't want to make it sound like he was doing this in a terrible way,

1417
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:31.560
but he definitely started some self medicating with alcohol.

1418
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.060
He was slate relying on sleeping pills to get to sleep.

1419
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:39.630
He has never been much of a drinker.
I'm not a drinker at all.

1420
01:38:39.631 --> 01:38:44.631
And so when I noticed him drinking more than he normally would every single

1421
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:49.440
night,
uh,
you know,
that immediately was a red flag to me.

1422
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:54.390
And then the sleeping pills,
you know,
this,
this,
um,

1423
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:59.540
ambien is powerful stuff and can really be a bad,

1424
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:04.340
a bad road to go down
and

1425
01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:07.500
<v 3>your guys definitely get on that Ambien road and uh,</v>

1426
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.140
I've seen guys go down that road and it's just like all of a sudden they can't

1427
01:39:11.141 --> 01:39:14.440
sleep without ambien and it messes up your sleep cycle and everything else.

1428
01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:19.180
So yeah,
definitely.
And I,
I guess that there's times when people need it,

1429
01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:20.673
but I think,

1430
01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:25.710
I think guys in the military slip real really easily from a guy that needs it to

1431
01:39:26.111 --> 01:39:29.890
a guy that's just doing it because they're starting to rely upon it for sure.

1432
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:34.240
And it's weird that you talk about,
I mean,
we just had,
you know,
Dave Burke,

1433
01:39:34.241 --> 01:39:36.190
who was an Anglico guy,

1434
01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:40.150
forward air controller on the ground with,
with my team,

1435
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:44.410
did a lot of work with my task unit in Ramadi and you know,
he was,

1436
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.840
he was in f 18 pilot.
He was,
you know,
top gun,
you know,
uh,

1437
01:39:49.690 --> 01:39:51.940
echo just thinks he was straight up Tom Cruise,

1438
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.060
but he was on the ground with us and Ramadi for a hell of a deployment and saw a

1439
01:39:55.061 --> 01:40:00.040
lot of stuff and in some very intense direct combat and exactly what you just

1440
01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:01.970
said,
like couple of things,
you know,
he said when he,

1441
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.860
what he was talking about when he got home and he'd gotten the car with his wife

1442
01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.840
and his mom,

1443
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.350
he was in there for 10 minutes and they were having a normal conversation.

1444
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:13.690
All of a sudden he yelled at him like his temper was just short.

1445
01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.650
So there's the temper,
the increased 10%.
That's one thing people definitely get.

1446
01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:20.410
And the other thing,
you know,
the startle response,
which was,

1447
01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.830
which Dave talked about as well,
was you know,
he heard a,
uh,

1448
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:27.850
air gun for putting the,
putting the working on a car.

1449
01:40:27.851 --> 01:40:32.851
He was walking by a garage and somebody fired off an air gun and he grabbed his

1450
01:40:33.131 --> 01:40:35.980
wife and through word of ground,
right.
And he was like,
he said,

1451
01:40:35.981 --> 01:40:39.250
while he was doing,
he already realized to,
what am I doing?
But it was too late.

1452
01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.600
So those are things to watch out for.
And then what about,
what about the,

1453
01:40:43.601 --> 01:40:45.550
I know you talk about the sleep pattern.

1454
01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.490
<v 5>Yeah.
He definitely wasn't sleeping.
Um,
normally.</v>

1455
01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:54.100
And so,
you know,
I started to,
to see stuff and I was like,

1456
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.850
<v 4>this isn't,
this isn't a road that we want to go down.</v>

1457
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:01.900
And so I told him that I thought he really needed to go see a psych.

1458
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.850
And Luckily in the seal teams there's good access to that.

1459
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.860
And also,

1460
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:12.970
fortunately my husband listens to me.

1461
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:18.760
He,
he,
he values my opinion.

1462
01:41:18.761 --> 01:41:23.530
And if I say something is amiss,
then he believes that something is a mess.

1463
01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.080
And so he went and saw the psych and I think,

1464
01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:32.440
um,
doc parsley,
I think you've talked about him before,
helped,

1465
01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.630
helped him to get on to,
um,
just a healthier sleep cycle,
cut out all the,

1466
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:41.430
the medication.
He doesn't take any medication at all anymore.
Never,

1467
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.300
never any sleep pills or anything.

1468
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:47.550
Started taking like some herbal supplements and stuff.
And,
um,

1469
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:49.330
he takes some Alpha brain now

1470
01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:55.720
and,
uh,
and,

1471
01:41:55.721 --> 01:41:58.540
and it didn't take long.
He,
you know,

1472
01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:03.541
he made a few appointments with the psych that definitely helped him to realize

1473
01:42:03.971 --> 01:42:07.600
that yeah,
he was,
wasn't acting normally because I don't think when these,

1474
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.910
when you guys come back,
you don't,

1475
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:15.400
you've already been used to war operating on the elevated level for a while and

1476
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:17.440
you don't realize that you're not,

1477
01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:22.420
you're now home with your wife and your kids and you're still trying to operate

1478
01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:22.780
on that.
Yeah.

1479
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:26.670
<v 3>Level intensity boil a frog thing.
Yeah.</v>

1480
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:31.450
That's normal to you.
It's normal.
You don't sense it when you're overseas.

1481
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.450
You just are getting ramped up and ramped up when you're staying in this

1482
01:42:34.451 --> 01:42:38.590
heightened state all the time and everything is intense all the time,

1483
01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:43.320
but you don't notice it.
And so when you come home,
you don't notice that it's,

1484
01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:45.040
it shouldn't be like that right now.

1485
01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.280
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1486
01:42:46.281 --> 01:42:51.281
And that's where it's really important for the family spouses and stuff to,

1487
01:42:52.690 --> 01:42:53.523
you know,

1488
01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:58.960
keep an eye on these guys and hopefully channel them in a good direction when

1489
01:42:59.121 --> 01:43:02.450
they get home as opposed to,
uh,
you know,
I had,

1490
01:43:02.451 --> 01:43:06.200
I not stepped in and I mean my husband's,
he's,

1491
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.320
he's been a sale for a long time.
He's,

1492
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:13.380
he's been through a lot of stuff but um,
you know,
he,

1493
01:43:13.381 --> 01:43:16.730
he definitely could have gone down a road that wouldn't have been healthy for

1494
01:43:16.731 --> 01:43:17.190
him more

1495
01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:20.310
<v 3>his career.
No doubt about that.</v>

1496
01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:26.190
I just remembered this when I think it was either right after you met here,

1497
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:28.320
met right after you moved down here.

1498
01:43:28.321 --> 01:43:31.710
I think I was talking to him cause I was talking about where you guys were

1499
01:43:31.711 --> 01:43:35.500
living,
you know,
out and you guys had proper,
you hadn't bought property yet,

1500
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:38.130
but you will rented a big property and you had horses and everything.
And I said,

1501
01:43:38.131 --> 01:43:40.860
Oh man,
well you know what,
what made you move out of here?
You know,
this is,

1502
01:43:40.861 --> 01:43:42.620
this is awesome.
And he's like,
yeah,

1503
01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.530
my wife told me she wouldn't come down here unless I got her a property with

1504
01:43:46.531 --> 01:43:51.150
horses on it
and here we are.
It's like awesome.

1505
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:55.310
That's killer.
Yeah.
And then you know,

1506
01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.620
you talked a little bit about your kids and how that,

1507
01:43:58.830 --> 01:43:59.170
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1508
01:43:59.170 --> 01:44:04.030
<v 3>How that helped you,
but you in the meantime,
as you were having kids,</v>

1509
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.030
when you got down here,
you started straight up farming.

1510
01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:09.700
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean I,</v>

1511
01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:14.820
that was a condition to him having me was that I was not going to put my horses

1512
01:44:17.021 --> 01:44:20.560
in a stable and go see them once in a while.

1513
01:44:20.561 --> 01:44:24.550
Like they were going to come with me and we needed land for them to be horses,

1514
01:44:24.610 --> 01:44:28.520
wild horses like they were used to being and so couldn't be seen.

1515
01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.020
He made that happen.
He made it.
He did.
He did.

1516
01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:37.021
He made it happen and we got a great 18 acre piece of property and we've got

1517
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.300
five fat horses now out in the field.

1518
01:44:40.301 --> 01:44:45.301
Every time I look out and I never farmed before I'd always been a horse wrangler

1519
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.820
and

1520
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.580
I started just growing a little garden.
I was like,
Oh,
I love this.

1521
01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.570
And I heard about a CSA program,

1522
01:44:58.571 --> 01:45:01.000
which is basically where you grow a,

1523
01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:06.220
like you grow a bunch of stuff and you sell a box of whatever your farm is

1524
01:45:06.221 --> 01:45:10.030
producing every week to people who pay,
you know,

1525
01:45:10.031 --> 01:45:13.300
they'll pay to get their box of fruits and vegetables.
And I was like,

1526
01:45:13.301 --> 01:45:17.800
oh I could do that.
I could get a few people and start to do that.
And so I did.

1527
01:45:17.801 --> 01:45:22.801
I started out with like 10 families that I'd do boxes four and realized that I

1528
01:45:23.141 --> 01:45:27.190
really liked it and it gave me a lot of focus when he was deployed.

1529
01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:31.420
It gave me a lot of something to really throw myself into and focus on.

1530
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:33.610
<v 3>She wasn't going to pick like knitting,</v>

1531
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:38.950
playing this and I'm going to run a farm.
I like that,

1532
01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:45.870
<v 4>you know,
we,
we had kids kind of write it right around that same time.</v>

1533
01:45:45.871 --> 01:45:46.680
And so that was,

1534
01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.370
that was a little challenging itself to be trying to like get this farm up and

1535
01:45:50.371 --> 01:45:51.660
going and being,
you know,

1536
01:45:51.661 --> 01:45:55.110
in the beginning you talked about me being like nine months pregnant out there

1537
01:45:55.111 --> 01:45:59.460
working and um,
yeah,
street,
that's what I did.

1538
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:04.480
But it was awesome.
You know,
I loved it and I've,

1539
01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:09.170
I've managed to build up a pretty decent little business and um,

1540
01:46:09.210 --> 01:46:14.210
there's nothing that I find more rewarding in life than growing good food.

1541
01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:19.170
There's something about it that's,
and,
and for my husband to like,

1542
01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:23.040
I do most of the technical farm work.

1543
01:46:23.041 --> 01:46:27.390
He's more of my farm boy.
Maybe labor.
Yeah.
But

1544
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:34.080
um,
it's very therapeutic for him.

1545
01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.610
I think when he comes back from deployments and stuff and he will,

1546
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.940
he can just kind of let all that go by being in this natural surrounding with

1547
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:47.880
physical labor to do every day.
You don't need,

1548
01:46:47.881 --> 01:46:50.400
I think you've talked about this before,
don't need sleeping pills.

1549
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:54.350
<v 0>When you work yourself hard all day long,</v>

1550
01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:59.040
you're married to iris
and go to sleep at night.

1551
01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:03.480
I've set my boy out.
Their husband's on deployment.

1552
01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:04.710
I'd send my boy out there just to,

1553
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:09.150
just to do slave labor out there now that after it let him learn about an honest

1554
01:47:09.151 --> 01:47:12.600
day's work.
Sleep outside.
It was legit.

1555
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:18.480
It's um,
you know,
I eat one of the things you,
you had written and this is,

1556
01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.090
you know,
different topic,
a different,

1557
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:24.570
the different article that you'd written and I'm just going to read a lit a

1558
01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:29.400
little okay.
A little chunk of it because I love it.
Here we go.

1559
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:35.100
This is about,
you know,
being on the farm with your,
with your now,
uh,

1560
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:39.090
this is when you just had your,
your one daughter.
Yeah.
Here we go.

1561
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.150
My garden helper turns one year old this week.

1562
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:45.060
I remember when life was simpler,

1563
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:49.170
when I could work in the garden all day uninterrupted,
when I could sleep,

1564
01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:51.990
when I wanted and be out of the house by the early morning.

1565
01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:57.960
But I didn't laugh nearly as much.
My heart wasn't as large.

1566
01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:04.160
I was more selfish.
These days are slow.

1567
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:08.510
This baby and I,
there are so many little breaks.

1568
01:48:08.511 --> 01:48:13.430
We take things,
we get distracted by things that must be learned.

1569
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:18.620
I feel lucky to accomplish one or two small tasks in a day.
Now

1570
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.190
that is enough though.
We manage.

1571
01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.610
There was nowhere she would rather be than in the garden.

1572
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.580
Makes me happy to see her dirt street face.
Smile.

1573
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:37.320
I've gotten past everything having to be clean.

1574
01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:38.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1575
01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:43.960
<v 0>Let a child be a little wild.
Let her experience the taste of dirt,</v>

1576
01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.170
the feel of leaves,
mud and water.

1577
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:53.820
Let her grow in the garden like an artichoke,
rambunctious and beautiful.

1578
01:48:56.270 --> 01:49:00.140
She laughs out loud,
throwing her head back to point at the birds.

1579
01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:05.260
She squeals with delight when she gets a hold of the cat and crawls like Matt to

1580
01:49:05.421 --> 01:49:06.890
get out of the way of the sprinkler.

1581
01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.630
This is nothing that can be replaced by toys.

1582
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:14.990
Nothing that can be learned from books or videos,

1583
01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:16.970
parks or playgrounds.

1584
01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.780
This is my sweet child.

1585
01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.380
Sweet has the honey suckle,
blossom,

1586
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:27.990
dirt and doll.

1587
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:38.390
Lots of good stuff.
Bringing those kids up on the,
on the farm.
Yeah,

1588
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.780
and you know,

1589
01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:47.180
continuing down that and kind of bringing it up to to the present,

1590
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.210
you wrapped up the article that you wrote about abuse and you kind of talked

1591
01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:56.470
about where you're at now and I'm going to,
I'm going to hit that.

1592
01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:59.380
The person that I am now,

1593
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:05.130
I'm fairly proud of considering I carry very few scars from my past other than

1594
01:50:05.771 --> 01:50:09.100
the physical ones that are carved into my skin.

1595
01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.280
I am comfortable talking about abuse.

1596
01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.730
I can look at pictures of my abuser and feel very little.

1597
01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:20.640
I am married to a kind of courageous hero of a man.

1598
01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:23.820
I've built up a beautiful farm.

1599
01:50:24.450 --> 01:50:28.320
I've got two amazing young children who I will protect with my life,

1600
01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.550
which is really where this story begins.
The children

1601
01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:38.360
look around you.

1602
01:50:38.361 --> 01:50:42.380
Please look at your own children and other children that you see.

1603
01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:48.310
Look at your friends and relatives and watch their interactions closely.

1604
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.900
We fear so many ridiculous things in life,

1605
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:58.150
but we don't fear the most common dangers to children.
Nearly enough.

1606
01:51:00.170 --> 01:51:02.720
We like to think of child molesters is strangers,

1607
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:06.230
not the people we know and let into our lives daily.

1608
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:12.230
Stay vigilant.
Trust your gut instinct.
If something seems off,

1609
01:51:13.670 --> 01:51:17.630
remember even very young children can keep tremendous secrets.

1610
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:21.040
This is uncomfortable,

1611
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:22.240
<v 2>okay?</v>

1612
01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.770
<v 0>But sometimes uncomfortable things need to be handled head on until they no</v>

1613
01:51:26.771 --> 01:51:30.700
longer have the power.
That secrecy and silence gives them.

1614
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.360
Thanks for listening.

1615
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:38.740
Please share and keep the children safe.

1616
01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:44.040
And then,
and we,

1617
01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:48.260
you know we've talked through some of this but I kind of want to just you,

1618
01:51:48.261 --> 01:51:50.730
you kind of laid out and you've talked about it already,

1619
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.580
you know just in what we've discussed so far.

1620
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:58.270
But I think it's worth covering again from your perspective,
your thoughts on it,

1621
01:51:58.271 --> 01:52:02.430
on how to keep children safe and some of the things to watch out for and some of

1622
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:04.170
the things to do.
Here we go.

1623
01:52:04.290 --> 01:52:08.640
I think the best answer is talk about uncomfortable topics early and often.

1624
01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:11.610
Don't just have the talk with kids,

1625
01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.620
talk to them on a regular basis about their bodies,
sex,
predators,

1626
01:52:16.710 --> 01:52:20.310
consent.
If they never hear you talk about it,

1627
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:22.620
it's going to be harder for them to bring it up to you.

1628
01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:25.980
I know communication is difficult.

1629
01:52:25.981 --> 01:52:30.480
Many families remember it's not up to the kids to do it.
As an adult,

1630
01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:33.750
you have to initiate hard conversations regularly.

1631
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:40.340
Don't ever assume your kid is too young for something to have happened to them.

1632
01:52:41.210 --> 01:52:45.430
It can literally happen in a few minutes with a friend or family member when you

1633
01:52:45.431 --> 01:52:46.264
are out of the room.

1634
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:51.880
<v 3>Ask them if they've ever been touched inappropriately and we're in a way that</v>

1635
01:52:51.881 --> 01:52:53.170
made them feel uncomfortable.

1636
01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:58.300
Then ask them again and again a few days later,
bring it up.

1637
01:52:58.301 --> 01:52:59.890
Casualty the second time.
Hey,

1638
01:52:59.891 --> 01:53:02.710
I was thinking some more about that conversation we had the other day.

1639
01:53:04.090 --> 01:53:07.180
Give them time to process and decide if they can handle telling you.

1640
01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:13.420
Do not push kids to hug and kiss people if they are resistant to it.

1641
01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:15.430
Even family members,

1642
01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:19.840
this is a topic that they should be familiar discussing with you.

1643
01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:24.190
Everyone treats it like it's this dark secret that we can't talk about,

1644
01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.580
that makes kids feel like they can't talk about it.
Either.

1645
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:31.390
Take every opportunity to bring it up in conversation,

1646
01:53:31.391 --> 01:53:35.080
a new story of Facebook posts,
a friend dealing with issues.

1647
01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.720
Talk about what's going on and why

1648
01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:43.590
we may think that we are doing our kids a favor by keeping this horrible stuff

1649
01:53:43.591 --> 01:53:44.424
from them.

1650
01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:49.610
But the statistics and the women who have spoken out here prove that most likely

1651
01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:54.150
your child or grandchild will have to deal with it alone.

1652
01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.860
If you aren't proactive,

1653
01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.360
if you have four female children or grandchildren or nieces,

1654
01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:05.550
chances are at least one has or will be molested.

1655
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:12.650
Some kids just will not talk no matter what.
Be Observant.

1656
01:54:13.190 --> 01:54:16.940
And if anything ever seems slightly off,
follow your gut instinct.

1657
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.200
If a child or teen tells you they haven't been touched her molested,

1658
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:22.970
don't take their word for it.

1659
01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.540
Kids can be amazingly good at keeping secrets.

1660
01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.473
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1661
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.113
<v 3>And that's,</v>

1662
01:54:34.050 --> 01:54:38.690
I think it's just a great list for people to think about,
to put,

1663
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.670
to put into action.
And
really a good,

1664
01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.270
a great example to live by.

1665
01:54:45.271 --> 01:54:48.900
So that you can be aware of this stuff ever happens.

1666
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:50.333
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:56.880
I want the subjects to be normalized a lot more than it is.

1668
01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:58.110
Um,
you know,
yeah,

1669
01:54:58.111 --> 01:55:01.920
it's a horrible thing to talk about and it's hard to talk to your kids about it,

1670
01:55:01.921 --> 01:55:06.600
but we have to make it more normal,

1671
01:55:06.601 --> 01:55:08.040
not only for kids,

1672
01:55:08.041 --> 01:55:13.041
but for the millions of adults that are out there who've been through it and

1673
01:55:14.401 --> 01:55:15.840
still don't talk about it.

1674
01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.570
When I first posted,
um,
what you've read,

1675
01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.960
I posted it on Facebook and I had a ton of people send me private messages

1676
01:55:28.531 --> 01:55:29.364
telling me

1677
01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:35.210
their own horrible stories.
People that I knew,

1678
01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:38.810
people that were friends of friends,
people that I didn't know at all.

1679
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:45.640
And I was shocked by a few of the people that I knew who had horrible stories,

1680
01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:52.320
um,
kids that I went to high school with that I knew during the time that their

1681
01:55:52.321 --> 01:55:54.210
abuse was also going on.

1682
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.470
Told me some things and

1683
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:06.810
everyone just deals with it and doesn't feel like they can talk about it.

1684
01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:12.410
And that's,
it's,
it's not right.
And so I hope that it,
my coming on here and,

1685
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:17.480
and bringing this to light and being the person that I am and saying,

1686
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:22.350
Hey,
let's have an honest conversation about this will help someone else.

1687
01:56:22.351 --> 01:56:24.540
Even if one or two other people

1688
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:32.090
decide that they can change their life for the better because they hear someone

1689
01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:37.500
addressing this honestly,
or one or two other people look at their

1690
01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:44.550
kids and the interaction that their neighbor or their friend or their

1691
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:49.520
GRANDPA,

1692
01:56:49.730 --> 01:56:54.730
uncle somebody has with their kids and realizes that there's something not quite

1693
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.793
right.

1694
01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:57.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1695
01:56:57.210 --> 01:57:02.210
<v 4>Then everything that I've been through is worth it because I will have used my</v>

1696
01:57:02.371 --> 01:57:05.950
experiences to help someone else.
Yeah.

1697
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.000
<v 0>Well definitely appreciate that.</v>

1698
01:57:09.001 --> 01:57:13.130
And I know we focused a lot on that today and again,
I,
I,
you know,

1699
01:57:13.131 --> 01:57:16.940
you as a,
as a military wife,

1700
01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.890
I also wanted to take up

1701
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:26.410
a moment to recognize all those military wives out there that hold the line.

1702
01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:30.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1703
01:57:32.090 --> 01:57:34.980
<v 0>While their husbands are,
as you know,</v>

1704
01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:38.690
deployed overseas in harm's way.
And

1705
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:45.550
I wrote something for one of my daughters and at this 0.1 of my daughters was

1706
01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:54.820
quite frankly not treating my wife with the kind of respect that my wife

1707
01:57:55.071 --> 01:57:59.360
deserves.
You know,
it was typical teenager stuff or roll the eyes,

1708
01:57:59.361 --> 01:58:00.740
a flipping comment.

1709
01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:06.040
Basically young adolescent girl with young adolescent attitude.

1710
01:58:06.981 --> 01:58:11.660
What you talked about earlier.
No,
no one can tell me anything.
I know everything.

1711
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.560
And in her mind,
you know,

1712
01:58:15.561 --> 01:58:20.550
my wife was just some lady that did the laundry.

1713
01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:25.130
He got the groceries and cook dinner
and that's how she treated her.

1714
01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:27.683
<v 1>And</v>

1715
01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:33.000
<v 0>so I wrote this for my daughter,
but I,</v>

1716
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:37.380
I wanted to read it for everyone and I,
and I want to

1717
01:58:39.610 --> 01:58:42.130
dedicated not just my wife,

1718
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:48.690
<v 3>but to all the military wives out there holding the line on the home front.</v>

1719
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:56.430
So this is what I wrote to my daughter.

1720
01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.680
Your mom.

1721
01:59:02.490 --> 01:59:04.950
I wanted you to know a little bit about your mom.

1722
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.120
Your mom was a champion horse rider.

1723
01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:14.520
She wrote cross country races,
show jumping,
and she did fox hunting.

1724
01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:20.430
She cared for horses every day,
clean them,
train them,
and took care of them.

1725
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.770
She won many victories.

1726
01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:30.980
Your mom worked since she was little starting in restaurants first peeling

1727
01:59:30.991 --> 01:59:34.440
potatoes than busing tables than cleaning,

1728
01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.420
than waitressing to make money.

1729
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:38.063
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1730
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:43.090
<v 3>Your mom went to an extremely good college.
Her parents didn't pay for it.</v>

1731
01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:47.440
She worked through college as a waitress to pay your own way.

1732
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.820
<v 3>When your mom got done with college,
she took the money.</v>

1734
01:59:52.821 --> 01:59:55.880
She saved and backpacked around the world.

1735
01:59:57.450 --> 02:00:01.590
She went to Thailand,
Malaysia,
Hawaii,
Australia,

1736
02:00:01.710 --> 02:00:04.410
New Zealand,
and a bunch of other places.

1737
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:07.660
While doing that,

1738
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:12.750
she worked as a waitress and other odd jobs so she could make money and pay your

1739
02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:14.074
own way.

1740
02:00:16.770 --> 02:00:17.603
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1741
02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.370
<v 3>When your mom got done traveling,</v>

1742
02:00:20.371 --> 02:00:23.220
the economy was bad and she couldn't find a job,

1743
02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:28.340
so she went overseas and worked at an airline as a flight attendant,

1744
02:00:31.530 --> 02:00:34.140
which is a hard,
thankless job,

1745
02:00:34.650 --> 02:00:39.240
serving on grateful passengers on planes.
She didn't like it,

1746
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:40.223
but she did it.

1747
02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:46.030
When I met your mom for the first time,

1748
02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:49.630
she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen

1749
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.320
and when I talked to her,
she was the nicest person I have ever met

1750
02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:01.900
and she was funny and Sassy and sweet,

1751
02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:04.420
and I knew immediately that I wanted to marry her.

1752
02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.530
So your mom picked up everything and left and came to be with me in America.

1753
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:17.080
She moved into a tiny one bedroom apartment with me.
She was wonderful.

1754
02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:18.490
She was adventurous.

1755
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:22.480
She surfed with me and she trained you Jitsu with me every day and worked out

1756
02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:26.520
with me every day.
She got her blue belt in Jujitsu.

1757
02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:30.300
She worked as an executive assistant in a real estate office and got her real

1758
02:01:30.301 --> 02:01:31.320
estate license.

1759
02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:37.730
We went skiing and hiked mountains and camped under the stars and the mountain

1760
02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:43.640
and we went dancing at night.
She was amazing.

1761
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.720
I got orders to move to Virginia.
She instant week,

1762
02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:51.910
packed up everything we had and quit her job and moved across country.

1763
02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.020
When we got to Virginia,
she got a tough job working for an insurance company.

1764
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:01.970
Of course I was in a seal platoon,

1765
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:06.470
so I traveled all the time and was gone all the time and she never complained.

1766
02:02:09.330 --> 02:02:12.330
One day she told me she was pregnant.
That was you.

1767
02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:16.260
She was so happy

1768
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:23.240
and then the day after you were born,
I left on deployment for seven months.

1769
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:25.910
She did everything by yourself.
I was gone.

1770
02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.110
She never complained and she sent me a picture every day of you.

1771
02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:32.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1772
02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.760
<v 3>When I got home from deployment,</v>

1773
02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:36.670
she was already back in shape and looked amazing.

1774
02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:42.680
The navy gave me orders back to California without a word.

1775
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:45.410
Your mom packed away.
All of our stuff quit her job.

1776
02:02:45.411 --> 02:02:49.570
When we moved back to California,
I worked and went to school.

1777
02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:54.040
I never got up in the night to help take care of you.
It was always your mom.

1778
02:02:54.190 --> 02:02:58.960
Every time she changed every diaper,
made,
every meal,

1779
02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.930
dried,
every tier.
Read every good night book.

1780
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:06.410
I worked,
went to school and trained Jujitsu.

1781
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.600
She never complained one single time.

1782
02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:12.870
Soon she told me she was pregnant again.

1783
02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:16.860
That was your first sister when your first sister came.
Now.

1784
02:03:16.861 --> 02:03:20.370
Everything that your mom did for you,
she had to do for your sister too.

1785
02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.320
Every diaper,
every meal,
every tear,
every little book read.

1786
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:29.960
I was working and going to school and training.

1787
02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:36.580
She walked you both and read to you and took you to parks and play groups and

1788
02:03:36.581 --> 02:03:40.720
dancing lessons and swimming lessons and craft fairs.
She did everything for you.

1789
02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:47.620
She didn't get to surf anymore or do Jujitsu anymore or work out or hike with me

1790
02:03:47.631 --> 02:03:52.220
anymore.
She devoted all that time to you.
Her kids who she cherished.

1791
02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:58.880
She never complained or wind or asked for anything.

1792
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.060
Then she got pregnant again.
This time it was your brother?

1793
02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:07.570
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1794
02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:11.830
<v 3>She kept doing everything for you.
When she got her morning sickness,</v>

1795
02:04:11.890 --> 02:04:15.700
throwing up dizzy and carrying around a baby in her belly.

1796
02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:17.500
She didn't complain ever.

1797
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:22.190
When she was in the bathroom sick and throwing up,

1798
02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:26.630
she would apologize to you and you said you and your sister that you girls had

1799
02:04:26.631 --> 02:04:27.650
to see her like that.

1800
02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:33.480
Then the war started.

1801
02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.010
I went back to the seal teams.

1802
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:40.800
<v 2>I went to Iraq for six months.</v>

1803
02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.830
I was working so much that I barely got time to write.

1804
02:04:46.130 --> 02:04:49.970
<v 3>Your mom always wrote me.
She never complained about anything.</v>

1805
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:52.910
She did everything and by herself,
everything.

1806
02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:57.350
I was taking care of my seal platoon and she took care of you.
Three little kids.

1807
02:04:57.470 --> 02:05:01.790
She cleaned everything,
made every meal,
changed every diaper,
dried,

1808
02:05:01.791 --> 02:05:02.624
every tier,

1809
02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:07.490
took you to lessons and parks and doctor's appointments and read to you every

1810
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:09.920
night and made your lunches and got groceries.

1811
02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:16.180
She did this all by herself.
No inlaws to help out,

1812
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:19.420
no grandparents around,
just her alone.

1813
02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:25.650
When I came home,
things didn't get any better.

1814
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:30.330
I just started getting ready to go back to Iraq again.
She didn't complain.

1815
02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:34.820
Some guys had to worry about their families.

1816
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:38.840
Their wives would complain and cry and file for divorce and fight over the kids.

1817
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:40.910
I never worried about that at all.

1818
02:05:43.050 --> 02:05:48.050
Your mom took care of everything and never made me have to worry about you kids

1819
02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.250
or her or anything else.

1820
02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:56.160
My last deployment to Iraq,
I was gone almost seven months.

1821
02:05:57.450 --> 02:06:00.690
I left your mom alone again with you.
Three kids.

1822
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1823
02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:05.480
<v 3>Some of my men were wounded and killed.</v>

1824
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:12.320
Your mom went to the hospital to visit the wounded men and went to the funerals

1825
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:13.430
of my friends.

1826
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:20.800
Your mom knew at any time it could be me that was wounded or killed,

1827
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.810
but she never complained.
She cried with the moms.
If my friends,

1828
02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:31.330
she gave support where she could,

1829
02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:36.540
but she never asked me to stop or come home or leave early or even be safe.

1830
02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.553
<v 2>Never.</v>

1831
02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:46.350
<v 3>She never asked me to give anything to her.</v>

1832
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:50.420
She knew I had men to take care of.

1833
02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:55.800
She told me not to worry about her or all you kids.

1834
02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:00.930
She only told me to do my best at my job and take care of my friends on the

1835
02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:01.764
battlefield.

1836
02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:08.960
Most seals get divorced almost 90%

1837
02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:16.190
there is too much pressure and separation and distance and too many challenges

1838
02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:19.500
and many women can't take it,
so they leave.

1839
02:07:22.930 --> 02:07:24.310
Your mom never wavered.

1840
02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:28.610
She never had an issue or a complaint.

1841
02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:33.680
No matter what happened or when I came home or when I left or what I did,

1842
02:07:35.410 --> 02:07:36.160
she supported

1843
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:40.600
<v 1>me always and she took care of you kids every day.
Every night.</v>

1844
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:43.210
Every moment.
Yeah.

1845
02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:47.410
<v 3>Every need you had was her responsibility.</v>

1846
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:54.120
She never asked for thanks or appreciation and when it was her birthday or our

1847
02:07:54.121 --> 02:07:58.770
anniversary,
she would tell me not to get her anything so we could save money.

1848
02:08:04.650 --> 02:08:08.970
When I got home from my last deployment to Iraq,
your mom got pregnant again.

1849
02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.560
That was your youngest sister and she did it all again.
Morning sickness,

1850
02:08:13.561 --> 02:08:18.450
diaper diapers,
sleepless nights,
Puke in the bed,
pee on the floor,

1851
02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.130
chicken pox,
lice,
tears,
scrapes,
bumps,
bruises,

1852
02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:26.280
teacher conferences,
school lunches,
everything.

1853
02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.470
She never complained about it.

1854
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.170
I was still working,

1855
02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:39.940
preparing men for war at traveling all the time and she continued to take care

1856
02:08:39.941 --> 02:08:42.460
of you kids so I could do my job.

1857
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.480
Your mom has stuck with me through hell.

1858
02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.430
It has been hard.

1859
02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:57.410
Your mom has been married to this hardheaded frogman for 17 years.

1860
02:08:57.890 --> 02:09:00.320
She's been through multiple war time deployments.

1861
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:05.030
She has helped me when I was sick or injured.
And she has done the same for you.

1862
02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:12.280
She has done it because she is strong and determined and she loves our family

1863
02:09:12.281 --> 02:09:13.930
more than anything in the world.

1864
02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:21.570
Your mom is an incredible person and amazing woman.
And I wore shipper.

1865
02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.020
She is everything I ever wanted.

1866
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:29.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1867
02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:34.050
<v 3>So
when you get the chance,</v>

1868
02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.210
you should tell your mom that you love her,

1869
02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:41.640
that you know how much she has done for you and for our family and that you

1870
02:09:41.641 --> 02:09:45.660
appreciate everything that she has done for us and for you.

1871
02:09:50.190 --> 02:09:50.880
Hi.

1872
02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:55.880
Hope you grow up and have some of the same qualities that she possesses.

1873
02:09:58.050 --> 02:10:02.370
Strength,
honor,
intelligence,

1874
02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:07.170
dignity,
selflessness,
respect,
determination,

1875
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:13.190
had kindness.
That's your mom.

1876
02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:19.470
And I hope you realize how blessed you are to have her.

1877
02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:32.870
And that's the note that I wrote to

1878
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.120
<v 0>daughter.
And</v>

1879
02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:41.830
you know,
there's some people

1880
02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:48.600
that say a woman can do anything that a man can do.

1881
02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:57.210
But I don't know if that's true or not.
But I can tell you this,

1882
02:10:57.211 --> 02:10:59.010
I don't know of too many men

1883
02:11:01.090 --> 02:11:02.740
that can do what my wife has done.

1884
02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:06.910
And what thousands of other military wives have done.

1885
02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:11.390
Right.
And I want to recognize

1886
02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.710
how blessed we are as a nation

1887
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:22.070
to have these women out there holding the line on the home front

1888
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:26.040
a job.
And yes,

1889
02:11:26.070 --> 02:11:31.070
it is a job that is underrecognized and overlook all the time.

1890
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:36.223
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1891
02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:41.900
<v 0>Iris,
like my own wife.
I think you are a</v>

1892
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:46.910
stellar example of this.

1893
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:48.763
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

1894
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:50.610
<v 0>No,</v>

1895
02:11:50.610 --> 02:11:55.290
thank you for what you've done for your family,

1896
02:11:55.291 --> 02:11:59.490
but also what you have done for our country.

1897
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:05.340
It's supporting your husband and your family
and

1898
02:12:08.070 --> 02:12:08.903
<v 1>thank you</v>

1899
02:12:10.130 --> 02:12:15.130
<v 0>and obviously thank you for coming on here today to to teach all of us about a</v>

1900
02:12:18.321 --> 02:12:21.470
subject that we all need to know more about.

1901
02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:26.650
Not just abuse but also determination and on top of that determination to

1902
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:30.770
overcome what you experienced in your life,

1903
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:34.190
but the determination to keep a family together

1904
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:36.183
<v 1>and</v>

1905
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:38.910
<v 0>protect the protectors.</v>

1906
02:12:40.810 --> 02:12:44.390
<v 4>Well,
it's been a,
it's been an incredible honor to be here and,</v>

1907
02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:49.560
and thank you guys for stepping out of box a little bit with me and getting this

1908
02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:54.790
out there and,
and talking about some of this stuff and I love,
you know,

1909
02:12:54.791 --> 02:12:59.791
what you wrote to your daughter and your wife is still stunningly beautiful and

1910
02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.040
very kind.
She is.
Yeah.
Is indeed.

1911
02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:10.220
<v 0>And it's,
you know,
having you on the podcast was a no brainer.
I,</v>

1912
02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:15.320
I probably waited three or four months to broach the subject with your husband.

1913
02:13:17.701 --> 02:13:21.810
I was waiting for the right moment and he said something to me about it and I

1914
02:13:21.811 --> 02:13:23.680
was like,
you know what,
hey,
if he,

1915
02:13:23.681 --> 02:13:27.470
if she ever just happens to want to come on let me know.
And I,
and,

1916
02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:30.960
and he answered me in 30 seconds and it wasn't his answer.

1917
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:33.930
Said I just talked her,
she's good to go.
I was like,
yes.

1918
02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:37.690
So it's been great having you on the podcast.
Thank you guys.

1919
02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:41.870
Well speaking of the podcast,
sure.

1920
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:46.860
Echo journals,
I mean if somebody wanted to support this podcast,

1921
02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:53.110
<v 7>is there any way they can do that?
Yeah,
there is actually kind of the,
you know,</v>

1922
02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.350
we talk about these heavy things is kind of the,

1923
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:58.700
the time to decompress a little bit.
Right.
A little bit.

1924
02:13:58.701 --> 02:14:00.410
We can talk about supporting the podcast.

1925
02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.970
That's a good way to decompress I think.
So most of the time.

1926
02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:11.070
Let's talk about supporting ourselves.
No,
no,

1927
02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:15.260
because actually a lot of it like being like a strong military wife and all this

1928
02:14:15.261 --> 02:14:17.330
stuff,
even even just a normal,

1929
02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.590
<v 0>no,
this,
I'm going to say this too.
I didn't say this.</v>

1930
02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.840
There's military husbands as well.
Yeah,
it definitely,
and,
and they're,

1931
02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.060
they're doing all that stuff that I talked about.

1932
02:14:28.810 --> 02:14:32.350
I was talking about wives because that's what I deal with.
I dealt with my wife,

1933
02:14:32.351 --> 02:14:34.390
you know,
and,
and you're a military wife,

1934
02:14:34.630 --> 02:14:37.210
but guys that are out there holding down the fort and also there's guys that are

1935
02:14:37.211 --> 02:14:38.980
married to police officers.
There was the,

1936
02:14:38.981 --> 02:14:43.720
I know that that gets flipped sometimes and,
and respect,

1937
02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:47.740
respect,
the equally challenging,
uh,
for,
for anybody that's,

1938
02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:49.480
that's holding down the fort at home.
So

1939
02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:54.980
<v 7>the concept,
yes.
You know,
a lot of times,</v>

1940
02:14:54.981 --> 02:14:58.500
especially when you're dealing with kids and the responsibility is on me or

1941
02:14:58.501 --> 02:15:00.090
whatever.
And I,
I mentioned this before,

1942
02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:04.680
where it's easy to fall into that kind of mindset where you're making it about

1943
02:15:04.681 --> 02:15:09.390
yourself.
Now you know,
where you have kids and it's like,
Hey,
I got a change.

1944
02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:12.180
I changed the diaper last time.
You know,

1945
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.970
but if you notice you're talking about yourself,

1946
02:15:14.971 --> 02:15:17.160
not the diaper got to get changed regardless,

1947
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:20.100
but you're like focusing on the fact that you had to do it,
you know,

1948
02:15:20.101 --> 02:15:24.240
kind of thing.
So not that you're wrong,
but you chose to make it about yourself.

1949
02:15:24.241 --> 02:15:27.300
So the less you make it about yourself and more about the mission,

1950
02:15:27.301 --> 02:15:29.940
the family that the,
whatever it is that you're doing,

1951
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:34.350
the stronger you're going to have the,
um,
like the capability to be,
you know,

1952
02:15:34.351 --> 02:15:37.770
you can like solve the problems,
you know,
accomplish the mission.
Anyway.

1953
02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:39.570
So that being said,

1954
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:44.880
let's make it about ourselves for a second,
by supporting ourselves.

1955
02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:47.460
So this is kind of a flip.
You know he's switching.
You know how like in the,

1956
02:15:47.461 --> 02:15:50.720
in the airplane they say support yourself.
Before you support the kit,

1957
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:53.310
you got to put the box,
you got a basket,
the oxygen,
you know what I mean?

1958
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:57.450
Because if you support yourself you have more capability of supporting others

1959
02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:01.370
to story.
Right.
That's why

1960
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:04.220
<v 0>the stronger he was all excited.
He's got iris over here.</v>

1961
02:16:04.221 --> 02:16:07.460
She's a green sheet is like blowing me off

1962
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:12.080
cause she knows.
She mentioned Alpha Alpha Brag,

1963
02:16:12.110 --> 02:16:15.260
all these things and I started taking more Alpha brain.
By the way,

1964
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:19.550
I think I noticed that today.
You are sharp or crisp with the thoughts.

1965
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:25.280
<v 7>Yeah.
I felt like I was a bit distracted.
Not necessarily here but just in life.</v>

1966
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.970
You know,

1967
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:29.980
I couldn't like focus on the thing that I needed to make videos or whatnot.

1968
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.790
I've been making videos.
I,
I've noticed that.
Yeah,
that's good.
We like that.

1969
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:39.670
Anyway,
if you're working out,
you want supplementation,

1970
02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.700
you want some support in the workout,
which actually I'm down for.
No,

1971
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:45.100
I wasn't a supplement person before,
as I said before.

1972
02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.470
But now I am because there's supplements like Krill oil,
you know,

1973
02:16:50.471 --> 02:16:52.480
strong bones.
Strong bone.
Yeah.

1974
02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.580
Is that for like bones to,
it might be,

1975
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:01.270
but I just,
I don't know.
My bones seemed strong.

1976
02:17:01.271 --> 02:17:05.380
I don't break them very often,
but my joints want help.
So I take it for the,

1977
02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:07.270
I take it for the joints.
Yeah.

1978
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:11.020
Cause he figure cause usually when like your tendon detached,

1979
02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:13.240
like you know how it ripped my bicep or whatever.

1980
02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:15.380
It's the tendon ripping off the boat.
Yeah.

1981
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:20.350
So you figured joints strong.
Maybe that's,
you know,

1982
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:24.940
the strong boom is that's the part of your homework.
Do some research,

1983
02:17:24.941 --> 02:17:29.770
get back to me anyway.
If you want the good supplements,

1984
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:33.910
Krill oil for your joints.
That's a big one in my opinion.
In [inaudible] opinion.

1985
02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:39.340
My opinion,
this is opinion man.
Essential.
So we,

1986
02:17:39.341 --> 02:17:43.240
whether you're working out or whether you're actually working on the farm.
Yes.

1987
02:17:43.241 --> 02:17:46.980
To krill oil,
all the pin.
Um,
that's a good one.
Um,

1988
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:50.230
but as far as supplements go,
you know,

1989
02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:53.710
you get the good ones when you get on at once anyway.

1990
02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.720
If you want 10% off on it.com/jocko my joints,
here's the thing,

1991
02:17:58.721 --> 02:18:03.220
like all,
all bus out krill oil whenever it's applicable in my mind.

1992
02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.100
And people be with who,
you're always talking about Krill oil.
No,

1993
02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:10.570
but I feel like it's kind of always on my mind because

1994
02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:15.750
you know,
like,
okay,
I'm talking to Greg the other day.
I don't,

1995
02:18:15.751 --> 02:18:17.880
I don't think Greg's on the Krill oils.
We're talking,

1996
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:21.370
it's after where he should be.
Yeah,
we're talking,

1997
02:18:21.371 --> 02:18:24.820
we talking for a while about stuff or whatever.
It's like,
oh,
it's time to go.

1998
02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:29.320
We get up Greg.
He goes,
oh,
like that.
Oh No,

1999
02:18:29.350 --> 02:18:31.720
I understand that.
He didn't have to make that noise,

2000
02:18:31.721 --> 02:18:34.380
but he making that noise is an indicator indicator.

2001
02:18:36.170 --> 02:18:39.070
Somebody ordered that man Krill oil.
Exactly.
That's exactly what I thought.

2002
02:18:39.071 --> 02:18:43.690
I didn't say nothing,
but that's what I thought.
That's kind of the place.
Maybe.

2003
02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:46.960
Maybe it was like it was too fresh.

2004
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:50.200
So let's just make this just for this whole advertisements.
For Greg Train.

2005
02:18:50.290 --> 02:18:52.630
Gretchen gets it on the Krill oil and you won't,

2006
02:18:52.810 --> 02:18:55.960
and it's less about making that kind of noise or not making the noise.

2007
02:18:55.961 --> 02:18:58.150
It's the feeling that compelled him to make the noise.

2008
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:02.920
That's the important part of Greg train wanted 10% off.
What would you do then?

2009
02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.560
I'm trying to help this along.

2010
02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:12.090
If he chose to get 10% on it.com/jocko the slash Jocko,

2011
02:19:12.431 --> 02:19:15.700
that's the part that gets,
it gives you the 10% off on all your stuff.

2012
02:19:15.730 --> 02:19:20.410
Even if you like protein powders and whatnot,
which,
which is good too by the way.

2013
02:19:22.430 --> 02:19:25.720
I look on there,
see what,
what you know,
cause it depends on your lifestyle.

2014
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:30.710
You see what I'm saying?
Anyway.
Does you get it?
You get my drift.

2015
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:31.890
Okay.
So we do,

2016
02:19:31.970 --> 02:19:36.970
that's a good way to support yourself and the podcast and ultimately everyone

2017
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:40.520
around you actually everyone in the world yeah.

2018
02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:45.590
In the world will be more supportive ultimately.
Yeah.
Like the butterfly effect,

2019
02:19:45.591 --> 02:19:46.940
you know,
like us talking,

2020
02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:51.620
it'll affect China later anyway.
Amazon click through.

2021
02:19:51.621 --> 02:19:56.420
That's a good way to support too,
by the way.
Um,
so what that does is,
you know,

2022
02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:59.150
before you do your shopping,
you click through the website,
Jocko,

2023
02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:04.300
podcast.com the tab on the top banner on the bottom thing is with the banner.

2024
02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:09.920
Oh,
I'm only saying this because people that keep me up about it and they'll say,

2025
02:20:09.921 --> 02:20:12.950
hey,
I don't see the banner.
Your banner is not there on the website.

2026
02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:15.500
If you have an ad blocker,
which is a smart thing to have,
by the way,

2027
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:17.870
just generally speaking,
if you have an ad blocker,

2028
02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:22.580
it'll block certain things and sometimes that banner will fall within the

2029
02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:27.510
confines of things that the ad blocker blocks.
Yeah.
See what I'm saying?
I,

2030
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:28.220
you know what?

2031
02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:32.450
We could also change our whole attitude here and make the full focus of the

2032
02:20:32.451 --> 02:20:35.780
podcast and the website and everything that we're doing to get people to get

2033
02:20:35.781 --> 02:20:39.080
into the give us money.
Yeah.
We're not going to do that.
Right.

2034
02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:42.830
So like now that I'm thinking and talking to you guys about it,
I'm like,
man,

2035
02:20:42.831 --> 02:20:47.540
I should really go change that.
But when I go home,
I want to go,
you know,

2036
02:20:47.541 --> 02:20:50.900
other places I'm thinking about getting after it.
I'm thinking about,

2037
02:20:50.901 --> 02:20:54.950
I'm making videos,
what have you.
So you know,
I get reminded of it.
So,

2038
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:58.010
and maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe that's a bad thing,
but nonetheless,

2039
02:20:58.011 --> 02:20:59.660
those are the facts as of right now.

2040
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:03.260
But it doesn't matter because there's a tab on the top.
Like I said,

2041
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:07.490
click on that one.
If you want to support it takes three seconds.
Small action.

2042
02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:11.960
And that support that,
that everyone's been given big reaction

2043
02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:20.330
and somehow this supports China.
You were saying eight Gen ultimately.
Yes.

2044
02:21:20.331 --> 02:21:24.260
It's the butterfly effect.
Look into it,
sir.
It's look it up.
It's real.
Yeah,

2045
02:21:24.261 --> 02:21:25.690
it's real.
Uh,

2046
02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:30.020
you can subscribe to the podcast and this is on any podcasting,

2047
02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:35.090
providing platform.
Google play,
iTunes of course,
stitcher.

2048
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:36.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2049
02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:41.670
<v 7>Yeah,
you can write a review too,
which I've done some,</v>

2050
02:21:41.730 --> 02:21:44.780
I've read some live reviews on here.
Yeah.

2051
02:21:46.890 --> 02:21:47.910
Of Jocko white tea.

2052
02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:51.490
But I might do that with the podcasts because there's some really good,

2053
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:52.343
good on there too.

2054
02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:56.970
I was actually thinking of doing a Facebook live and reading the comments on a

2055
02:21:56.971 --> 02:22:01.540
picture that Joe Rogan posted of me because there are some funny comments.
Yes.

2056
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:04.780
Pro comedians out there listening to Joe Rogan.

2057
02:22:04.781 --> 02:22:08.190
So they want to make fun of my head.
Yeah.
But they're worth reading.
You know,

2058
02:22:08.191 --> 02:22:13.050
there was,
um,
remember that video that we made actually clung to,

2059
02:22:13.051 --> 02:22:17.310
I don't even might've been before the first podcast even maybe after,

2060
02:22:17.311 --> 02:22:18.090
I don't know.
Anyway,

2061
02:22:18.090 --> 02:22:22.820
we made it and it was about martial arts training and you're,

2062
02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:26.410
you know,
what's the best martial arts and self,
all this stuff.
Right.
So it,

2063
02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:29.840
I revisited that and this was a while ago.
There's like millions of,

2064
02:22:29.850 --> 02:22:34.260
there's over a million views on that.
Right.
So with views come comments,
right.

2065
02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:37.170
So he's like that though.
Typically.
Yeah.
You know,

2066
02:22:37.171 --> 02:22:40.560
it's usually not very productive to spend much time in the comments section on

2067
02:22:40.561 --> 02:22:45.440
Youtube,
but
lot of views,
a lot of comments.
Let's see what the P,

2068
02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:48.380
and it's not like people who've necessarily follow Jocko podcast.

2069
02:22:48.381 --> 02:22:49.430
That's the thing is random.

2070
02:22:49.431 --> 02:22:53.750
So you get a cool little like variety of of people in there,

2071
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:56.030
so yeah,
there's some interesting ones in there.

2072
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:58.970
I didn't quote any or nothing or save any,

2073
02:22:58.971 --> 02:23:00.470
but I'm just saying generally speaking,

2074
02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:05.060
it's interesting nonetheless back to subscribing to the podcast.
Youtube.
Yeah.

2075
02:23:05.061 --> 02:23:06.110
We have a youtube channel.

2076
02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:11.450
If you like the video version of this podcast a

2077
02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:16.600
sometimes like people know what you look like.
Yeah,
and I there,

2078
02:23:16.601 --> 02:23:19.350
but a smaller percentage of people know what I look like.
Yeah,

2079
02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:22.300
and I'm not encouraging you to watch the video to see what I look.

2080
02:23:22.301 --> 02:23:25.090
I'm not saying that echo doesn't look like what it sounds like.

2081
02:23:25.091 --> 02:23:27.250
You definitely look different than you sound.
Did you,

2082
02:23:27.251 --> 02:23:28.480
have you ever seen him before today?

2083
02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:33.820
I've seen pictures of you online and I was surprised when I did because you

2084
02:23:33.821 --> 02:23:36.100
sounded sort of,
well no,

2085
02:23:36.101 --> 02:23:39.040
I'm not going to say what she sounded like the sound,

2086
02:23:39.041 --> 02:23:41.330
the way you look for now.

2087
02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:46.560
We'll assume that that's how he does something like that.

2088
02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:50.050
One Guy said a mixed white and Latino,

2089
02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:54.520
not hipster like skate,
not skater,
I don't know.
Something.
Anyway,

2090
02:23:54.730 --> 02:23:59.260
they got real specific,
which is good.
Which is cool.
Yeah,
I dig it well.
Yeah.

2091
02:23:59.261 --> 02:24:03.160
I guess it's because you have a weird background being up a Hawaiian.

2092
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.500
What are you half black,
half white guy?
Yeah.
I mean not to split hairs,

2093
02:24:09.501 --> 02:24:12.320
but there's some native American in their native both sides.

2094
02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:15.140
But see none of that has anything to do with the way you talk,

2095
02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.450
the way you target list,
the way you talk.
Yeah.

2096
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:19.700
I have something to do with the way you,
yeah,
yeah it does.

2097
02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.190
I don't know why I said that,
but yeah,
I mean yeah.

2098
02:24:22.191 --> 02:24:25.970
Growing up on Kauai and then living here and then,
I don't know.
Okay.

2099
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:30.470
You all the time.
All this stuff just jumbled me up,
you know.
Anyway,

2100
02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.810
back to the,
you want to see what he looks like.
You could check them.

2101
02:24:33.811 --> 02:24:36.440
You're interested in something like that.
If that interests you,

2102
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:39.530
subscribing to the youtube channel might facilitate.

2103
02:24:39.531 --> 02:24:42.940
Cause conversely I look like what?
You got to think.

2104
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:46.790
I'm going to look at exactly what I look like.
Yeah,
exactly.
True.
Exactly true.

2105
02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:51.830
So,
yeah,
the youtube also also,
my looks aside,

2106
02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:56.570
what we do now is,
and we've been doing this for a little bit,
is uh,

2107
02:24:58.040 --> 02:24:59.690
take a little excerpts of the podcast,

2108
02:24:59.750 --> 02:25:02.720
little lessons and we'll put them on there as well so you can share them.

2109
02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:03.733
You know,

2110
02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:07.760
it's easier than sharing the whole podcast and having people receive it,

2111
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:11.990
you know,
cause he can't just listen to two and a half hours on a whim,
you know?

2112
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:15.500
No.
But three minutes to kind of schedule that.
You got to schedule it.
Yes,

2113
02:25:15.501 --> 02:25:17.790
exactly right.
Three minutes.
So no schedule required.

2114
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:21.860
Let's schedule press play right now.
Yeah,
yeah.
Lesson learned.
Boom.
Yeah.

2115
02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:26.140
Individualistic,
improved.
Good to go.
Yep.
Rock and roll.
Yes,
exactly.

2116
02:25:26.141 --> 02:25:30.910
So that's really the goal there.
And you know,
I gotta be like,

2117
02:25:30.911 --> 02:25:35.350
people have said,
you know,
I always say this,
well people have been asking me,

2118
02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:39.340
it's one person,
knock in my case.
People have been saying like,

2119
02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:42.160
that's good to have those ones because some people,

2120
02:25:42.161 --> 02:25:44.530
they don't listen to the podcasts like the first day,
you know,

2121
02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:47.720
they're like how you said they kind of got a schedule.
Even somebody,

2122
02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:50.720
even we've got a lot of commuters and people listen to this car.
Yeah.

2123
02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:52.540
But you know,
half an hour commute.

2124
02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:55.570
It takes you a few days to hear the whole podcast,

2125
02:25:55.571 --> 02:25:59.500
but there might've been a little nugget.
You need it for work that Monday.
Yeah.

2126
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:03.460
Some people they'll say that helped me that day.

2127
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:07.600
Like the college one that you talk about,
like how to approach college.
Yeah.

2128
02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.650
Legit.
Anyway.
You wish you had that when you approached college.

2129
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:13.530
I wish I had all of this really and I,

2130
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:18.550
but when I approached anything in life really.
But yes,
the college yet.
So yeah,

2131
02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:20.680
subscribe to the Youtube Man.
That's,
that's a good one.

2132
02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:21.910
That's a good way to support.

2133
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.020
And that's another way to support yourself in a way.
It kind of indirectly.
Um,

2134
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:30.910
and then if you wear tee shirts at any point and you want to represent a little

2135
02:26:30.911 --> 02:26:34.760
bit,
but that's uncle t shirts,
you know,
I think you've,

2136
02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:38.020
I think they're pretty cool approved.
They're approved,

2137
02:26:38.470 --> 02:26:41.860
quite literally all approved stars,
a new tee shirt out,

2138
02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:45.280
which you are wearing at this time.
I like it.

2139
02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:48.780
It's real complex.
Yeah.

2140
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.170
It's black and it says get after it on it.
Amen.

2141
02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.970
Technically it's a charcoal Heather,
but fashion guy,

2142
02:26:58.540 --> 02:26:59.300
man,

2143
02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:03.730
you know it is what it is and there's usually more to them than kind of meets

2144
02:27:03.731 --> 02:27:06.190
the eye.
We call that layers

2145
02:27:08.410 --> 02:27:12.070
philosophical sense.
Um,
but yeah,
you know,
if you want to support that way,

2146
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:16.570
that's a good way,
you know,
and you get a shirt that you can wear.
Very wearable.

2147
02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:20.920
That's the thing.
They're not that cheap ballpark.
Give away shirts.

2148
02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:22.330
They're like good,
very wearable.

2149
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:25.810
Multiple occasions people say it's my favorite shirt to wear because of the fit.

2150
02:27:25.811 --> 02:27:29.530
People are telling you that people every single day.
All Day.
Yeah.
I'm telling you

2151
02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.640
women's on their women's stuff on their shirts,
patches,
rash guards.

2152
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:39.340
I'm going to put out a new rash guard here is pretty soon.

2153
02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:43.470
Not that that's like it's supposed to get everyone fired up or nothing like
that.

2154
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:48.640
Yeah,
it was good.
The hoodies are on there as well.
And you know,

2155
02:27:48.641 --> 02:27:51.010
if you like any of this stuff I'd say,
I'd say just look at it.

2156
02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:54.850
If you choose to support,
if you feel like supporting you feel like representing,

2157
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:59.620
go ahead and get something that's a good way to support.
Yup.
And also

2158
02:28:02.290 --> 02:28:03.130
this one I'm on.

2159
02:28:03.131 --> 02:28:06.580
What I'm about to tell you here could very well border on essential.

2160
02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:09.160
Now it's like one of those things where,
okay,

2161
02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:12.790
so psychological warfare we're going to talk about,
I'm gonna go into it.

2162
02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.370
So you know how like let's say you're getting after it,
IRS getting after it,

2163
02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.070
I'm getting after it.
I start taking krill oil.
Irs starts taking Krill.

2164
02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.320
Jocko is not taking Krill oil.
Maybe someone else comes in,

2165
02:28:24.350 --> 02:28:25.820
they start getting after it,
they start to,

2166
02:28:25.970 --> 02:28:30.350
meanwhile you're not taking the Krill oil.
We're kind of ahead of you.
You know,

2167
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:35.240
you see his ll soft.
Conceptually that's a big deal.

2168
02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:36.980
So psychological warfare,

2169
02:28:36.981 --> 02:28:41.981
what that does is case psychological warfare isn't album with tracks with Jocko

2170
02:28:43.391 --> 02:28:44.210
in there.

2171
02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:47.900
Put simply Jocko on there helping you through any moments of weakness that you

2172
02:28:47.901 --> 02:28:52.160
may have on your getting after it.
Journey.

2173
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:55.370
Waking up early in the morning,
every day,
sleeping on the Diet,

2174
02:28:56.930 --> 02:29:00.440
procrastinating all these things yet big deal.

2175
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:04.490
So if you think about just the procrastination one.
Yeah,

2176
02:29:05.390 --> 02:29:09.680
procrastination is one of those things.
It's a massive problem with people,
right?

2177
02:29:09.681 --> 02:29:12.680
People all over the world have a massive problem with procrastination.

2178
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:16.700
Think of how easy it is to,
to overcome that.
It's the easiest thing.

2179
02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:20.060
It's the easiest thing to overcome.
Psychological warfare.
Yeah.

2180
02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:24.680
You just do just to go do what you're procrastinating and it's already what you

2181
02:29:24.681 --> 02:29:28.610
want.
I have,
it's not like you have to work,
get over procrastination.

2182
02:29:28.611 --> 02:29:33.350
You just just crush it.
You just go back the other day or last week,
whatever,

2183
02:29:33.351 --> 02:29:38.120
when I said like,
you got to switch it to manual and procrastination.

2184
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:41.570
You just got to switch it to manual for like literally two seconds,
one,
two,
boom,

2185
02:29:41.571 --> 02:29:44.270
and then you do it.
Cause once you're starting,
right?
Yeah,
you're doing it.

2186
02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:45.930
You are no longer a procrastinator,

2187
02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:49.760
but I didn't initially see battled a win and what a,

2188
02:29:49.770 --> 02:29:54.320
what a battle that so many people face and lose and lose.
It's,
yeah.

2189
02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:57.590
It's one of those psychological things that you kind of got to declare war on,

2190
02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:01.730
and in that case,
you're engaging in psychological warfare.

2191
02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:05.810
Nonetheless,
this is a good way to,
so,
okay,

2192
02:30:05.811 --> 02:30:08.960
so back to my point about when everyone starts getting after it and you're not,

2193
02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:12.020
so I,
I don't want to feel that.
Like everyone's like Google.
I do.

2194
02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:15.230
Horford cause you can't listen to it and like,
Hey,
I don't want to wake up.

2195
02:30:15.231 --> 02:30:18.530
I want to press the snooze.
You can't listen to wake up,
you know,

2196
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:21.440
one of the first checks or whatever.
You can't listen to that.
And then not,

2197
02:30:21.441 --> 02:30:24.290
we got,
you can't,
you won't be able to face yourself.

2198
02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:26.360
It's like one of those things they said like that strong.

2199
02:30:26.810 --> 02:30:29.960
So let's say everyone's doing that.
You're kind of left behind.
If you're not,

2200
02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:34.010
that's how I feel.
Like if I'm not doing it,
you know,
I'll do it.

2201
02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:38.180
Even if I feel like working out,
I'll still listen to it.
Give you a little kick,

2202
02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:42.900
a little kick.
Anyway,
psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink.
Word.

2203
02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:45.950
I was looking at an audio book the other day.
It's still number one by the way,

2204
02:30:46.130 --> 02:30:50.690
man on spoken word.
Everyone's getting on it.
Yeah,
man,

2205
02:30:50.691 --> 02:30:51.950
it's been that way since it came out.

2206
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:55.770
That show everyone that you're telling to get after it,
they're getting after it.

2207
02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:58.370
That's part of my 0.8 they're like,

2208
02:30:58.371 --> 02:31:02.960
you got to do it also on clicking,

2209
02:31:02.961 --> 02:31:04.040
when you're clicking through Amazon,

2210
02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:08.570
you can also get Jocko white tea and here's the bottom line.
You know,

2211
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:12.410
we all need to deadlift more.
Yes.
Alright,
sure.
Don't play around.

2212
02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:14.090
If you order your Jocko white tea,

2213
02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:18.140
you're going to boost your dead lift two approximately 8,000 pounds.

2214
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:19.980
And I was thinking about this the other day.

2215
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.050
<v 0>You think 8,000 lbs is heavy.
It's in another,
you know,</v>

2216
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:29.520
unit of measurement is four tons.
Yeah,
Bro.
Yeah,
I think that's good,
man.

2217
02:31:29.610 --> 02:31:33.390
That's really good.
You want to do that way.
The warrior kid,

2218
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:34.883
by the way,

2219
02:31:35.610 --> 02:31:40.590
it's not even preorder anymore because it comes out May 2nd,
right?

2220
02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:43.980
So it's coming out soon.
Boom.

2221
02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:49.560
Order it now and save a child.

2222
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:55.070
Smash a bully,
save yourself smashed.
Pullups that's the,

2223
02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:59.300
<v 7>it's your role.
Messenger for,
I was at the [inaudible] game yesterday,
yesterday.</v>

2224
02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:04.730
And so there's a playground there and the kids are just kind of running a amuck,

2225
02:32:04.731 --> 02:32:04.971
you know,

2226
02:32:04.971 --> 02:32:09.350
and a lot of times this parents in there and there's this one kid he was,

2227
02:32:09.410 --> 02:32:13.400
he was big.
Oh.
And he had that look on his face.
I'm not saying he was a bully,

2228
02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:17.980
but you know,
walk around and he was like grabbing another cat enough.

2229
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:21.230
It was his brother.
I Dunno if he was bullying him or helping him or whatever.

2230
02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:24.920
But you could tell like all the little kids fit,

2231
02:32:24.921 --> 02:32:28.430
cause you know there's some people there like there's a line for this little

2232
02:32:28.431 --> 02:32:31.430
thing that the kids get on.
It's like a minute,
it's not a merry go round.

2233
02:32:31.431 --> 02:32:35.960
It's the thing you sit in.
And so some kids are real assertive,

2234
02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:38.150
there'll be like,
oh it's my turn cutting the line,

2235
02:32:38.151 --> 02:32:40.430
not even realizing there's a line in whatever.
And then there's some kids,

2236
02:32:40.431 --> 02:32:43.580
they'll stand in line and they'll just sort of let people write this cut.

2237
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:46.250
And then there's some kids who were like,
oh wait.

2238
02:32:46.251 --> 02:32:48.770
And they'll explain there's a line,
you know,

2239
02:32:48.771 --> 02:32:52.050
so you can see the different levels for people out there.
Yes.

2240
02:32:52.051 --> 02:32:55.130
So like something like this that's going to turn you into,
you know,

2241
02:32:55.131 --> 02:32:57.260
the person who's,
you know,
it's kind of like the leader

2242
02:32:57.290 --> 02:32:58.560
<v 0>can turn you into a leader.</v>

2243
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.900
It sounds like Kenny Williamson might've been out there.

2244
02:33:00.901 --> 02:33:05.080
Kenny Williams is a bully.
Now,
interestingly,
I'm doing the,

2245
02:33:05.470 --> 02:33:08.760
there was a lot of,
I ask questions.
Who should read the audio for this?
Right.

2246
02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:11.190
Cause it,
if I was thinking I would just read the whole thing.

2247
02:33:11.430 --> 02:33:13.410
Then some people said,
hey,
you know,
Jocko,

2248
02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:15.630
you're not a kid and it's a kid's voice.

2249
02:33:15.631 --> 02:33:18.780
It's in the first person of a kid's voice.
Kids named mark.

2250
02:33:19.170 --> 02:33:22.770
So I couldn't read the kids part.
I decided,
you know what,

2251
02:33:23.430 --> 02:33:25.440
I'm not gonna read the whole book.
I'm not going to eat the kid's park.

2252
02:33:25.890 --> 02:33:29.730
But there's a character in there named Uncle Jake.
Sure.
Now Uncle Jake,

2253
02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:34.830
he was a seal.
Sure.
And he's going to come and help out.
And I,

2254
02:33:34.831 --> 02:33:38.670
I decided maybe I could read uncle Jake parts.

2255
02:33:39.690 --> 02:33:41.330
So I did.
Seems like.

2256
02:33:41.850 --> 02:33:46.850
And then we got a kid reading the kids part and I think you all find out who

2257
02:33:47.731 --> 02:33:50.850
that is.
And I think there'll be some layers behind that,
that party.

2258
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:54.060
So yeah,
weigh the war.
Your kid,

2259
02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:58.520
you can order that now you can also get discipline equals freedom field manual

2260
02:33:58.521 --> 02:34:00.960
is coming out.
What's a field manual?

2261
02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:06.080
It's something that you allows you to take information and put it into action.

2262
02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.820
That's what the,
that's a discipline equals freedom field and was going to do,

2263
02:34:08.970 --> 02:34:12.510
it comes out October 17th might seem like that's a long ways away,

2264
02:34:12.511 --> 02:34:16.290
but so did May 2nd but this thing's coming out around the corner.

2265
02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:18.100
So the

2266
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:22.750
<v 3>field manual,
it's basically this podcast in a book.</v>

2267
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:25.360
You can't bring this podcast into the field with you.

2268
02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:28.670
I guess you can put it on your headphones.
I guess.
Maybe you can,

2269
02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.380
but sometimes you need visual cues.
Yeah.

2270
02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.860
So that's what it is.
The thoughts,

2271
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:39.490
the things from the podcast.

2272
02:34:39.491 --> 02:34:43.660
But then it also has very specific additional information like workouts,

2273
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:47.350
sleep strategies,
martial arts,
you know,

2274
02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:50.140
everything that's cool in the world.
It's all about luck,
you know?

2275
02:34:50.170 --> 02:34:53.410
So you can do that extreme ownership.
You can,
you know,
by the way,

2276
02:34:53.530 --> 02:34:58.530
why is extreme ownership is still one of the top books on Amazon and iTunes and

2277
02:34:59.381 --> 02:35:02.200
audible a year and a half after it came out.
Why is that?

2278
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:04.930
Is it because of the big advertising campaign that we did?
No,

2279
02:35:04.931 --> 02:35:07.810
it's not because that it's purely because of word of mouth.

2280
02:35:07.811 --> 02:35:10.030
So everyone that's listening this right now that's buying it for other people

2281
02:35:10.031 --> 02:35:13.270
and spreading the word,
it's because of you.
That's awesome.
Appreciate it.

2282
02:35:14.170 --> 02:35:18.610
Extreme ownership.
Amazon.
Why is it not out on paperback yet?

2283
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:21.490
Do you want to know why?
You know why?
Yeah,

2284
02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:24.480
it's not out on paperback because people ask me why has it been on paperback?

2285
02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:29.320
It's not an a paper back yet because books come out on paper back when they

2286
02:35:29.321 --> 02:35:33.820
aren't selling the hardcover anymore.
They release a cheaper version here.

2287
02:35:33.821 --> 02:35:37.270
Does in paperback now it's only 995 they haven't done that with our book yet.

2288
02:35:37.271 --> 02:35:39.970
Why?
People still want the hardcover.
It's still selling.

2289
02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:42.100
And the reason for that is because,

2290
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:45.400
because it works because people get a lot out of it.

2291
02:35:45.430 --> 02:35:49.780
So if you don't have extreme ownership or if someone that you know

2292
02:35:51.450 --> 02:35:53.880
doesn't have extreme ownership,
just like they don't have killer,

2293
02:35:53.881 --> 02:35:55.830
I'll tell Greg train he needs krill oil.

2294
02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.090
Tell your tell your subordinate leader or your superior leader or members of

2295
02:36:00.091 --> 02:36:02.430
your team tell him,
hey look man,

2296
02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.720
I'm going to get you a little something here for it to help you out shooting

2297
02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:07.020
ownership and if you need

2298
02:36:08.610 --> 02:36:11.880
some more extreme ownership at your team,

2299
02:36:11.881 --> 02:36:15.960
company contact or whatever your your your you can contact our company

We'll see you there.
And until we do get the monster,

2311
02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:08.800
if you want to communicate with us you can find us cruising on the interwebs.

2312
02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:14.720
Now.
First of all,
we're on Twitter,
we're on Instagram.

2313
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:16.070
You can also

2314
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:20.780
<v 7>find us on the Facebook.
You can find us there.
So Iris,
yes,</v>

2315
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:23.150
for Facebook.
Where you at?

2316
02:37:24.050 --> 02:37:27.380
<v 4>Uh,
you can follow my farm on Primeval.</v>

2317
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:30.890
It's primeval gardens on Facebook and Instagram.

2318
02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:35.150
And then I'm on Twitter at only IRS Gardner

2319
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:39.690
<v 7>and I just told Iris to sign up for that this morning.</v>

2320
02:37:40.470 --> 02:37:42.930
<v 4>Not a Twitter,
but I will,
I will.</v>

2321
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.690
<v 7>That's what you Ferris did to me too.
Yeah,
it's just sign up for Twitter.</v>

2322
02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:50.370
No big deal.
And then a bunch of people were like asking me questions.
Yeah,

2323
02:37:50.371 --> 02:37:51.660
what the cool thing is what the day,

2324
02:37:51.661 --> 02:37:54.430
that's what's makes it cool because you can communicate with all these different

2325
02:37:54.431 --> 02:37:56.650
people and they can give you good information.

2326
02:37:56.651 --> 02:37:58.790
They can tell you what books to read and they can tell you what speeches to

2327
02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:01.150
listened to and they can tell you what youtube he is checkout and they can tell

2328
02:38:01.151 --> 02:38:02.290
you what you did.
Just get this awesome.

2329
02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:05.140
It's a great way of communicating with a bunch of people.

2330
02:38:05.141 --> 02:38:06.400
So you don't have to quit or Twitter.

2331
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:12.030
I don't actually cause you know like can the day the sent messages with pigeons,

2332
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:17.350
right?
Yeah.
You know,
they send the message.

2333
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:21.970
So it's like when you send someone a message,
it's called the tweet.
Yeah.

2334
02:38:21.971 --> 02:38:25.780
But what does that have to do it don't tweet though.
They,
I don't know.

2335
02:38:25.781 --> 02:38:30.280
The detailed
birds tweeting messages.

2336
02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:34.700
That's what Twitter is
this related to birds?
Sure.

2337
02:38:34.750 --> 02:38:36.630
And Messaging Pigeons.
Exactly right.

2338
02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:40.150
Which now we have an animal expert in the room.
They don't

2339
02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:47.020
know they need to change the name of Twitter.
Well,
yeah.
Well No,

2340
02:38:47.021 --> 02:38:51.390
they have to change the name of tweet tweeting the act of tweeting to,

2341
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:55.120
to that noisy.
Yeah.
Tweeting.
But that's what it is.

2342
02:38:55.270 --> 02:39:00.250
A little less interesting.
Wheat.
Yes.
You got anything else for us today?

2343
02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:05.140
Yeah.
You said You,
um,
your dad made gold bars.
Yeah,

2344
02:39:05.350 --> 02:39:07.470
I'll beat with the bar because you know,
you get,
cause they could,

2345
02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:10.640
maybe that's a second
free.

2346
02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.800
It stuck with me the little like,
like,

2347
02:39:15.310 --> 02:39:17.770
like crop and gold kind of crumbs,
right?
First.

2348
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:20.450
<v 4>Yeah.
You get just little fragments.</v>

2349
02:39:20.451 --> 02:39:25.451
So x pieces when you crush up or if you're like going in those streams and

2350
02:39:26.331 --> 02:39:30.080
creeks,
you'll come out with golden nuggets,
which are naturally forming larger,

2351
02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:34.220
but when you're crushing it or you just get little tiny flecks of gold and then

2352
02:39:34.221 --> 02:39:38.510
you refine it down into a bar.
And I,
I don't remember.
I think,
you know,

2353
02:39:38.511 --> 02:39:43.460
they do them in a,
a few ounces to whatever size is,

2354
02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:45.020
makes sense to sell.

2355
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:48.300
<v 7>You're the word gold bar.
You're thinking,
you know,</v>

2356
02:39:48.301 --> 02:39:49.780
like on the movie you're watching it.

2357
02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:51.310
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
Not like a,</v>

2358
02:39:51.311 --> 02:39:55.150
not like a 10 pound crack or whatever it is,

2359
02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:57.640
but yeah,
smaller bars.

2360
02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:02.580
<v 7>That's pretty cool.
Is that your final question?
Awesome.
Awesome.</v>

2361
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:05.490
Iris,
anything else you want to close out with?

2362
02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:10.510
<v 4>Gosh,
no,
just thanks for,
thanks for doing this.
Thanks for getting me on here.
And,</v>

2363
02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:13.380
um,
love listening to the show.
I,
I

2364
02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:14.540
<v 1>okay</v>

2365
02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:17.000
<v 0>listened to it when I'm out working,
getting after it.</v>

2366
02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:21.330
I need to get after it shirt.
You know,

2367
02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:25.310
I always like going over your house cause you and you and your husband both want

2368
02:40:25.311 --> 02:40:29.840
to expand the conversation and port stuff out to me and ask about this science.

2369
02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.950
It's always awesome to have you guys listening,
but thank you.
Anything else?

2370
02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:36.620
I think we're good.
Well

2371
02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:42.730
obviously thank you for coming on.
Seriously.

2372
02:40:42.731 --> 02:40:43.564
I think it's awesome.

2373
02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.600
I think it's courageous and brave and really helpful for a lot of people.

2374
02:40:50.770 --> 02:40:54.850
I hope so.
And thank you for that.

2375
02:40:54.851 --> 02:40:59.260
Thank you for giving us a warning
that

2376
02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:04.550
that evil can hide anywhere

2377
02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:11.100
right under our noses and slink around and trying to corrupt those that are

2378
02:41:16.001 --> 02:41:18.520
closest to us.

2379
02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:22.480
So thanks for telling us

2380
02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:25.990
to hug our children,

2381
02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:30.970
to hold our children and to watch our children closely.

2382
02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:36.360
And also thank you for reminding us once again that in the end,

2383
02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:45.220
evil cannot win if we decide that we will not let it,

2384
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:53.410
because if we confront the darkness,

2385
02:41:53.620 --> 02:41:58.620
if we stand up with courage and we look upward

2386
02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:02.650
toward the sky,

2387
02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:11.020
the light will shine on our faces and wash out the darkness and bring us warmth

2388
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:18.210
and hope
it happiness.

2389
02:42:22.770 --> 02:42:27.770
And thank you for showing us once again that even with the evil,

2390
02:42:31.650 --> 02:42:31.970
<v 1>okay,</v>

2391
02:42:31.970 --> 02:42:34.370
<v 0>and the darkness of the world,</v>

2392
02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:41.900
and even with the scars that they can leave even still,

2393
02:42:46.210 --> 02:42:47.320
even with all that

2394
02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:54.730
this life,
his is sweet,

2395
02:42:56.970 --> 02:42:58.740
has the honey suckle,
blossom

2396
02:43:01.290 --> 02:43:03.050
dirt and all.

2397
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:08.700
So until next time,

2398
02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:14.310
this is iris and Deco and Jocko

2399
02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:16.530
<v 1>out.</v>
