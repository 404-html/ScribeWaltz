00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.990
This is Jocko podcast number 54 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.020
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.260
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

4
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
You got some Shakespeare right there,
got some Henry,

5
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:30.411
the fourth part two and that play is a play that came just prior to Henry the

6
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.810
fifth,
the hero.
The warrior.

7
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.750
<v 0>The leader of that few,
that happy few,</v>

9
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.810
that band of brothers.
Well,
his dad,
Henry,

10
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.811
the fourth was having a rough time in the kingdom facing rebellion and there's a

11
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:05.180
point in the play where he,
the old man had been the fourth,
he can't sleep,

12
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.210
can't sleep because the pressure,

13
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.520
the pressure and the weight of being a leader and it's a great,

14
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.010
it's a great joke of the play and it starts with that line.

15
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.890
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
It,

16
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
it actually doesn't start with that line.
That's the last line.

17
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.730
It starts off a little different.
It starts off here.

18
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.750
How many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep.

19
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.890
So he's saying,
hey,
out there,
you know,

20
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.230
there's thousands and thousands of my subjects.

21
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.180
They're out there sleeping right now.

22
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.300
Oh,
sleep,
oh,
gentle sleep,

23
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.570
natures soft nurse.

24
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.620
How have I frightened me that thou will watch that thou no more will weigh my

25
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.220
eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness.

26
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.770
So he's talking to sleep.
Sleep is like a,
like a god to him at this point.

27
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.830
And he said,
what did I do to scare you off what I do?

28
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:24.060
How come you won't bring me that goodness way down my eyes

29
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.090
going back.

30
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.090
Why rather sleep liased vow in smokey cribs upon uneasy pallets,

31
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.790
stretching v and hushed with buzzing night flies to the ice slumber.

32
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240
Then in perfumed chambers of the great onto the canopies of costly state and

33
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:53.520
load with sound of sweetest melody.

34
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.260
So he's asking sleep,
he's saying,
look,
sleep.
You're there.

35
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.570
You're there out in the smoky fill fee,

36
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.240
houses in all levels and people are sleeping on boards and,

37
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.700
and uh,
too low people asleep in those situations.

38
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.290
It's insects buzzing around their heads.
You sleeps all,

39
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.360
they're taking care of those people.

40
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.480
But sleep doesn't come to him.

41
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:24.481
And the most beautiful in the most luxurious est rooms where there's,

42
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.690
where there's little gentle music playing,
no bugs flying around.

43
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.160
It's a little gentle music play

44
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.010
back to the play.
Oh Thou [inaudible] God.

45
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.300
Why liased vow with the vial in loans,

46
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:46.301
some beds and [inaudible] fight king leak couch or watch case or a common larame

47
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.850
bell.
So same,
same subject.
He's saying,
look,

48
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.280
why do you Dole God?
So Dole meaning sleeping doll.

49
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.370
Why are you hanging around the nastiest beds?
But you,

50
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.160
you know this beautiful bed,
don't come near it.
You leave it vacant like a,

51
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.370
like a watch tower,
like a bell tower.

52
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.720
Wilt Thou upon the high and Giddy mast,
seal up the ship.

53
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.670
Boy's eyes.

54
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.090
So now he's talking and start talking about even a sailor at sea high up on a

55
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.730
mast,
right?
A giddy mast.

56
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.660
You seal up the ship,

57
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
boys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious search.

58
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.190
And in the visitation of wins who take the rough,

59
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:50.140
Ian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with

60
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:55.141
deafening clamor in the slippery clouds that with the early death itself awakes.

61
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.040
<v 2>Okay,</v>

62
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.630
<v 0>so he's saying this sailor,</v>

63
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.960
there's a sailor at sea who's getting punished by this storm and the,

64
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.210
the thunder is clapping and there's the ship is bounding back and forth.

65
00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:18.080
But guess what?
He gets to fall asleep.
He goes to sleep,
no problem.

66
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.700
Canst thou o partial sleep,

67
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.320
give die repos to the web.
See Boy in an hour.

68
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:34.321
So rude and in the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means

69
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:41.820
to boot,
deny it to a kink.

70
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.820
So he's saying again in an hour.

71
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:51.440
So root storms may him at sea,
he gives the,

72
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.970
he gives the sailor sleep,

73
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.750
but in this columnist and still list night with every available luxury to boot,

74
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.090
yet sleep is denied to the game.
And then he says,

75
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.380
then happy low lie down.

76
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.010
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

77
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.050
So then happy low lie down.
He's saying look low by low,
he means the peasants.

78
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.840
He's like,
all right,
then you happy,

79
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.340
happy Lo you peasants lie down,

80
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.850
lie down to sleep.
That's what you,
that's what you get.

81
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.050
But uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

82
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.200
The leader doesn't get to rest,

83
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.570
the leader doesn't get to sleep.

84
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:51.571
And that's another example of what we know when that is that leadership is hard.

85
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.450
It's a heavy burden,

86
00:06:55.451 --> 00:07:00.451
it's hard business and it's part science and part art

87
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.760
and part of it is natural ability and part of it is learned.

88
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.720
And the book that we're going to dive into today,
it isn't Shakespeare,

89
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.950
it's actually a military manual,

90
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.270
military manual written by SLA Marshall,

91
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.010
but guided by George General,
George C.

92
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.320
Marshall and Dwight d Eisenhower.

93
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.600
And this book was written just after World War II.
Now if you remember Hackworth,

94
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.540
if you've read about face Hackworth,
talks about Marshall Sla,
Marshall and any,

95
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.270
he did some writing in Vietnam that Hackworth was a little bit not impressed

96
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:43.601
with.

97
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:48.601
And there's certainly some controversy about SLA Marshall and some of the things

98
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:52.180
that he wrote.
And some of the things that he said that he lived through.

99
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.360
There's some controversy if not proven fact that he fabricated some stuff,

100
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.890
but I think you're gonna find as we dive into this book that from a leadership

101
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.010
perspective,
the experiences that he did bring back from World War One,

102
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:09.880
the experiences that he got from Eisenhower and from the other Marshall.

103
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.170
I think it's a really good reflection and a and a good look at some leadership

104
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:19.450
lessons learned that we can take something from now.

105
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.280
The book is actually called the Armed Forces officer.

106
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.680
Very simple title and the the,

107
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.640
the version that I'm going through because this book is still in publication,

108
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.910
the version that I'm going through is a 19 is from 1950 1950 version.

109
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.530
Like I said,
it's written and we'll just after world war two obviously,

110
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:46.531
so the lessons are fresh and I guess that the new version has been cleaned up or

111
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:51.700
something.
There's,
there's,

112
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.880
I guess that the 1950s version isn't fully politically,

113
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.950
I don't know because to be frank,

114
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:01.200
I haven't read the new version because I got the old version.

115
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.120
I want the real deal and I don't find anything offensive in this,
in this one.

116
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.160
So maybe someone else will,

117
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.530
I guess there's some things that might be a little bit borderline,
but yeah,

118
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.483
I'm not,

119
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.120
I'm not really feeling it in this book was given to me a long time ago by a

120
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:22.470
friend of mine that said,
you might like this,
and he specifically said this,

121
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:25.680
but they'll make this one anymore.
But guess what?

122
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.730
Everyone's in love because they do.
They brought it back,
they brought it back.

123
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.150
So the book is the Armed Forces officer and it really goes into how to lead,

124
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.523
how to lead.

125
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.340
So going to the book to call forth great loyalty and other people and to harness

126
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:47.970
it to any noble undertaking,

127
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.180
one must first be sensible of their finder instincts and feelings.

128
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.660
Certainly these things at least are among the gentle qualities which are desired

129
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.470
in every military officer of the United States.

130
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.360
So here's some basic things that the officers in the military are supposed to

131
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:09.810
have.

132
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.810
One strong belief in human rights to respect for the dignity of every other

133
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.190
person.
Three,

134
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.310
the golden rule attitude toward one's daily associates for an abiding interest

135
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.610
in all aspects of human welfare.
Five,

136
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.700
a willingness to deal with every man as considerately as if he were a blood

137
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.790
relative.
It's a pretty simple rules.

138
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.870
Respect other people.
The golden rule,
you know,

139
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.510
treat people how you want to be treated yourself.
That's,

140
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.540
these are the basis of what they're saying you need to be,
and again,

141
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.090
less not actually I'm not.
I was going to go into this,

142
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.280
but they're going to go into it themselves.
Here we go.
Back to the book.

143
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.260
These qualities are the epitome of strength,
not of softness.

144
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.140
They mark the man who's capable of pursuing a great purpose consistently in

145
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.830
spite of temptations.
He who possesses them,

146
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:12.360
we'll all the more surely be regarded as a man among men.

147
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.120
Take any crowd of new recruits,

148
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.450
the greater number of them during their first few days in service,

149
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.490
we'll use more profanity and obscenity,

150
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.420
talk more about women and boasts more about drinking than they have ever done in

151
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:29.070
their lives because of the mistaken idea that this is the quick way to get a

152
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:34.050
reputation for being hard boiled,
but at the same time,

153
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:39.290
the one or two men among them who stayed decent talk moderately and walk the

154
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:44.691
line of duty will uniquely receive the infinite respect of the others.

155
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

156
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.750
<v 0>It never fails to happen.</v>

157
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.100
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.270
<v 0>so little contrary to what we might think,
and there's definitely,</v>

159
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.920
when you get in the military,
when you're going through bootcamp,

160
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.880
there's all kinds of people acting like tough guys.

161
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
All kinds of people act like tough guys and that that happens is you.

162
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.000
One thing that happens in bootcamp,

163
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.260
I s I bet I met more potential professional athletes when I was going through,

164
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.190
when I was going through bootcamp,
everyone was,
I was about to go in the NFL.

165
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.120
I was about to be a pro baseball player.
I don't know why,

166
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.120
but they ended up in the military.
Interesting.
Yeah,

167
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.440
it is interesting that kind of like the guy who's 500.0 in the streets,

168
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.550
it comes to the MMA gym.
That guy,
that guy doesn't work out too well.

169
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.290
All right,

170
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.290
and obviously I'm a bridging this book a little bit skipping through here we go

171
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:41.230
back to the book,
men be get goodwill in other men by giving it,

172
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.810
they develop courage in their following mainly as a reflection of the courage

173
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.330
which they show in their own action.

174
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.030
These two qualities of mind and heart are the essence of sound officer ship.

175
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.960
One is of little avail without the other and either helps to sustain the other.

176
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.410
So you got goodwill and you've got courage and they help each other and they

177
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:13.360
sustain each other back to the book as to which is the stronger force in its

178
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.560
impact upon the masses of men.
No truth is more certain than the words.

179
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:20.020
Once written by William James.

180
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.010
Evident though the shortcomings of a man may be if he is ready to give up his

181
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:29.290
life for a cause.
We forgive him everything,

182
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.760
however inferior he may be to ourselves and other respects.

183
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.660
If we cling to life while he throws it away like a flower,

184
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.270
we bow to his superiority.

185
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.590
So I guess courage gets the stronger nod out of that situation.
Back to the book,

186
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:47.850
Theodore Roosevelt once said,

187
00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:52.851
if he had a son who refrained from any worthwhile action because of the fear of

188
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:55.890
hurt to himself,
he would disown him

189
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.830
soon after his return to civilian life.

190
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.740
General Dwight d Eisenhower spoke of the ward,

191
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.600
the worthwhileness of living dangerously and officer of the United States.

192
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:11.470
Armed Forces cannot go far wrong if he holds these ideas.

193
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.130
It is not the suitable profession for those who believe.

194
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:20.131
Only in digging in and nursing a soft snap until death comes at a ripe old age

195
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.260
who risks nothing,
gains nothing,

196
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.970
nor should there be any room in it for professional smugness,

197
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:34.010
small jealousies,
and undue concern about privilege.

198
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.193
<v 3>So</v>

199
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.050
<v 0>you can't be hiding all the time.
You got to step up.
You gotta lead.</v>

200
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:45.830
You gotta take some risks.
You got to live dangerously.
Now,
of course,

201
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.040
young troopers out there,
specially guys out on the battlefield.

202
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.980
This doesn't mean running to your death.
It was what it means.

203
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.870
You will take risk in business world.

204
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.270
You'll take risk in the military.

205
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:03.800
You'll take risk if you do either in business or in the military,
you take risk.

206
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.090
Stupidly you'll die or you'll lose all your money.

207
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.250
Neither one of those is good,

208
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:12.903
<v 2>but</v>

209
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.400
<v 0>that doesn't mean you hide and it doesn't mean you take no risk and you shy
away.</v>

210
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.230
Now the next part,

211
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.760
when he's talking about small jealousies and undue concern about privilege,

212
00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:28.110
this eats people up and destroys people in that light.

213
00:15:28.111 --> 00:15:31.470
Here we go back to the book towards services other than his own.

214
00:15:31.471 --> 00:15:36.471
Any officer is expected to have both a comradery feeling and an imaginative

215
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.430
interest.

216
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.120
Any army officer is a better man for having studied the works of Admiral Mayhem

217
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.570
and familiarize himself with the modern navy from firsthand experience.

218
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.950
Those who lead.

219
00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:54.420
See going forces can enlarge their own capacities by knowing more rather than

220
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:57.990
less about the nature of the air and ground establishments.

221
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.860
The sub mariner can always learn something useful to his own work.

222
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.390
By mingling with airmen,

223
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.740
the airman becomes a better officer as he grows and qualified knowledge of

224
00:16:07.741 --> 00:16:09.060
ground and see fighting.

225
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.150
So you got to learn working with other industries.
Learn about those industries.

226
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.560
Learn as much as you can.

227
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.090
Don't just stay in your own little in your own little world cause you're

228
00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:22.770
comfortable.
I said,
what happens to a lot of us?

229
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.350
You get comfortable in your own world.
So that's what you want to stay in.

230
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.230
You don't want to look bad,
you don't appear to be ignorant.

231
00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:30.240
And animal man is kind of the,

232
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.220
well he was a civil war animal as a matter of fact,
but wrote,

233
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.060
wrote a book called the influence of Sea power upon history,

234
00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:43.500
which the Germans and the Japanese both utilized against us in World War Two.

235
00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:45.870
So a little bit of a little bit of risk there,

236
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:49.020
but it is also something that guided the thought and the building of the,

237
00:16:49.021 --> 00:16:50.790
of the modern us navy.

238
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.910
Now we talk a little bit about what life is like in the military.

239
00:16:56.911 --> 00:16:59.520
Back to the book.
The military way is a long,

240
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:04.521
hard road and it makes extraordinary requirements of every individual in war

241
00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:06.451
particularly.

242
00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:10.830
It puts stresses upon men such as they have not known elsewhere.

243
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.950
And the temptation to get out from under would be irresistible if their spirits

244
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.850
had not been tempered to the ordeal.
So you gotta be ready for the hardest.

245
00:17:20.851 --> 00:17:24.150
You've got to do things in your life that get you ready for the hardness back to

246
00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:26.160
the book,
if nothing but fear.

247
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:29.340
And this is now we're getting to some leadership if nothing but fear of

248
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:34.341
punishments were dependent upon to hold men to the line during extreme trial.

249
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.990
The result would be wholesale mutiny and the situation all together beyond the

250
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:43.600
control of leadership.
So if the only thing,

251
00:17:43.601 --> 00:17:45.280
the only reason that your people are falling you,

252
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.150
cause if it's because of fear of punishment,
when the going gets hard,

253
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.370
that's not gonna work.

254
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.433
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

255
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.990
<v 0>So it must be true that it is the out that is out of the impact of ideals out of</v>

256
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:01.720
the impact of ideals,

257
00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:06.721
mainly that men develop the strength to face situations which would be normal to

258
00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:09.970
run away,
which it would be normal to run away.

259
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.930
Also during the normal routine of peace,

260
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.500
members of the armed services are expected to respond to situations that are

261
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.930
more extensive,
more complex,

262
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.590
and take longer to reach fulfillment than the situations to which the majority

263
00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:27.700
of men instinctively respond.
So things in the military to take a long time.

264
00:18:27.701 --> 00:18:31.240
When you're a big part of that in the peacetime big bureaucratic machine,

265
00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:32.560
it can be really challenging.

266
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.960
Even the length of the enlistment period looks like a slow march up.

267
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:42.700
A 60 mile grade promotion is slow duty,

268
00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:44.140
frequently monotonous.

269
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.060
It is all too easy for the individual to worry about his own insignificance and

270
00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:53.670
to feel that he has become lost in the crowd.
Now,

271
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.460
this is something that I hear a lot about on social media.

272
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.790
More people send me messages on this or or Facebook messages I guess.

273
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.730
Um,
when they feel like they're kind of caught in a Rut,
you know,

274
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:08.190
they're doing their job,
they don't really like it.
What should I do?

275
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.540
And I think this next little section applies to that.
Back to the book,

276
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.000
what is the main test of human character?

277
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

278
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.160
<v 0>Probably it is this,</v>

279
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.120
that a man will know how to be patient in the midst of hard circumstance and can

280
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:29.140
continue to be personally effective while living through whatever

281
00:19:29.141 --> 00:19:32.560
discouragements beset him and his companions.

282
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.400
Can you drive on?
That's what it's asking those,
that job that you don't like.

283
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.170
Good.
Good.

284
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.150
It's a little test now if you're in a situation that you don't like,

285
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.630
you drive on and that situation and also you figured out what your exit strategy

286
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:51.310
is going to be cause you don't want to go through life miserable.
Yeah.

287
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.140
You figure out,
you start saving your money,
you start getting another education,

288
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:57.810
you figure it out on the job.
You get yourself promoted,
you do what you gotta do,

289
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.980
but don't let that monotonous job that's you're not into that day.

290
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:03.920
Don't let that bird you down.
Yeah.

291
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.610
That's kind of the key there were you'd drive on and it's like you drive on in

292
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:12.300
life.
You don't necessarily have to drive on and keep doing that job.

293
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.600
It's like you drive on as opposed to ou start complaining or go into some thing

294
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.660
where you get self destructive,
where you seek,
seek some kind of,
I don't know,

295
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.820
escapist outlet or something like that,
but I'll tell you,
you do,

296
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.400
you drive on it.
You have other options,
right?
You work those other options,

297
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.750
but whatever it is that your job is,
and you'd kick ass at that job.
Yeah.

298
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.240
That's what you do it.
The minute you start slacking,
you're going backwards.

299
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:38.430
Don't do it.
It's not going to what?
What benefit are you gonna get from that?

300
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:42.000
You're going to get zero benefit.
You're going to work your eight hours a day,

301
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.770
you're going to make your $12 an hour.
Are you going to do it in a slack way?

302
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.900
Yeah.
Or are you getting,

303
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.440
<v 4>are you going to do it in an awesome way?
I keep,</v>

304
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.720
you know how I'm going to do in an awesome way.
Yeah.

305
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.060
And that's what's going to get you promoted.
That's what's going to get you,

306
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.870
that's what's going to get you taken care of in the long run.

307
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.550
If you or you,
you like you say this a lot,
where you,

308
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.160
even if you're going to do something,
even if you don't enjoy,
you still,

309
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:07.450
you do it just the best you can.

310
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.540
I think you said that like from the beginning and for someone like me,

311
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:14.970
when I look at it like that,
um,

312
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.210
of course it sounds like a good idea to do it that way,
but after you do it,

313
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.690
you kind of think back and I've done both.
I've done it where I'm like,
oh,

314
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:23.291
I hate doing this,

315
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:27.010
so I'm just going to basically go through the motions until it's finally done,

316
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.650
you know?
And I can kind of be relieved or whatever.

317
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.270
But when you think back of like,
Hey,
I remember when I was doing whatever it is,

318
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:37.210
that job or whatever.
When you look back,

319
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:41.890
you kind of have this fulfillment that you did it the best you can.
You know,

320
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:44.980
you never look back and be like,
Dang,
I'm glad I've phoned it in.

321
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.340
You know you always are going to,
even if he didn't like it like you,

322
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.660
you're always satisfied that that yeah,
I did it the best that I could.
So do it,

323
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.830
do it the best you can.
Now

324
00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.110
<v 5>here's a,
there's a couple of the lists in this book.
Here's another one.</v>

325
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.200
This is the one that's talking about the the simple virtues that provide a firm

326
00:22:05.811 --> 00:22:08.750
foundation.
So here we go.

327
00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:13.751
One a man has honor if he holds himself to a course of conduct because of a

328
00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:18.770
conviction that it is in the general interest,

329
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.270
even though he is a well aware that it may lead to inconvenience,

330
00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:26.030
personal loss,
humiliation or grave physical at risk.

331
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.700
So when he says general interest,
he's talking about like the team.

332
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.750
So you're going to hold that conviction.
Even if it's good for the team,

333
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.830
you're going to hold that course even if you're well aware that it may lead to

334
00:22:36.831 --> 00:22:41.690
inconvenience,
personal loss,
humiliation or grave physical risk.
Boom.

335
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.510
That's what honor is.
You know here,
honored,
laid out that well,

336
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.930
very often he has veracity.

337
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.640
If having studied a question to the limit of his ability,

338
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.950
he says and believes what he thinks to be true,

339
00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.040
even though it would be the path of least resistance to deceive others and

340
00:23:00.261 --> 00:23:05.240
himself.
So this is kind of in the same vein.
If you,

341
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.660
if you look at something and maybe you don't agree with it,

342
00:23:08.661 --> 00:23:11.630
but the easiest thing to do would just be agree with it.
No,
you don't do that.

343
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.420
You step up and say,
Hey,
no,
I don't agree with this.
Now,

344
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.810
we could go into detail on that in the times when you,

345
00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.970
when you do want to maybe not be the most truthful person in the world.

346
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.010
For instance,
we've talked about this before,

347
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.600
when your wife is making chicken and it's dry,
right?

348
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.790
It might not be the best thing to tell her the the amount of water that you're

349
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:37.760
going to need to drink.
So,

350
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.560
but in real things and important things.
Tell the truth.

351
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.110
Back to the book.
Number three he has justice.

352
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.790
He acknowledges the interest of all concerned in any particular transaction

353
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.720
rather than serving his own apparent interest.

354
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.660
Look out for others.
Number four,

355
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.160
he has graciousness if he acts and speaks forthrightly,

356
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.930
agrees,
warmly,

357
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:08.050
disagrees fairly and respectfully participates enthusiastically refrains from

358
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:12.650
harboring grudges,

359
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.520
takes his reverses in stride and does not complain or ask for help in the face

360
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.680
of trifling calamities.

361
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.340
Those are just solid.
Those are just solid.
I would say this though,

362
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.360
sometimes you got to ask for help,
right?

363
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.720
That's one thing that I want to work with businesses.

364
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.590
There'll be somebody that's extreme ownership and I'm going to own this and all

365
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.130
of a sudden you realize that,
hey,
you're owning that,

366
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:42.830
but if you're not going to be successful at it because that's too much for you,

367
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.020
you need help.
You need to,

368
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.790
you need to put your ego in check and you need to be able to raise your hand and

369
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:49.940
say,
look,
I need some help on this.
I can't,
I don't have this cupboard.

370
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.510
This is too much for me.
I want to expect in this,
here's my hands in the air.

371
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.130
Let me get,
let me get some help sometimes.

372
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:57.770
Seems like it's not necessarily even ego.
It's more like,
oh,

373
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.410
I guess in a way it's ego,
but it's more like,
shoot,

374
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:04.400
I don't want to be the guy who has to be dependent on somebody or something like

375
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.940
that.
Like I,
you know,
which is what extreme ownership,
which is ego.
Actually.

376
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:09.770
If you're the guy that doesn't want to be dependent on other people,

377
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.720
that's probably regal,
but you are.

378
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:16.130
I think what you're trying to say is that I don't want to be the guy that has to

379
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:17.960
ask for help.
I want to be that guy cares my own load.

380
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.880
I'd see this on on seal patrols and a couple of times in my career where guys

381
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:28.370
were overloaded and they didn't want to ask for help.

382
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.690
I got this because it's humiliating,
you know,
hey,
can you carry my ammunition?

383
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.680
Or Hey,
can you carry my radio?
Yeah.
Can you carry my weapon?

384
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.460
That's I,
I've,
I've seen it happen.

385
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.510
I've carried some extra weapons from time to time and it's,
it's a bummer,

386
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.430
you know,
and you know what?
Take the weapon I.
Amen.
Okay.

387
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.760
Get some water in you.
You know,
but that's what you're talking about.

388
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:53.870
People don't want to be that guy,

389
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.110
but what's going to be worse if they don't take a load off and they get a heat

390
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:03.200
casualty and now they're down.
Well now we're,

391
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:06.950
now I've got to carry him not just as a weapon,
which is a bad thing.

392
00:26:06.951 --> 00:26:10.850
We don't have them anymore.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And he can't,
he can't fight.

393
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.500
He can't even do anything as opposed to the other guy who doesn't know the

394
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:19.150
difference between needing help and wanting help.
Oh,
help me.

395
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.140
Cause you don't want to work.
I had a guy one time,

396
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.650
we were on a long patrol.
This is back in the day.
Back in the day,

397
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.310
this is prewar and my radio man,

398
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.080
because I was a rating then when I was enlisted guy and now I wasn't ready to

399
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.040
Manaus and officer and,

400
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:40.110
and we were on a long patrol and my radio man was going down like he was,

401
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.610
didn't have enough water,
was dehydrated,
it was weak.
And so he was bummed,

402
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.440
you know,
he's,
he,
he couldn't keep up with us anymore.
And I said,

403
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:52.680
okay,
let me get your radio.
So I'm taking a 20 pound radio off his back,

404
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.340
putting in my back.
I'm carrying it for a little,
I don't know,
the half a day.

405
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.640
And then we get to a,
like a layup point.

406
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.700
So this is where we're going to see for civilian of this is we're going to camp

407
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:07.701
out for the night and when we get there we get a resupply of water and Gatorade

408
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:09.211
or whatever.

409
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:13.140
So all of a sudden now everyone's rehydrated and while we're in there,

410
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.410
we got to make a communication a hit too.

411
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.140
You've got to call headquarters and say,
Hey,
this is our location.

412
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.600
So he comes in and takes the radio out of my,

413
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.310
out of my backpack,
you know,
it comes over,

414
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.650
hey link at the radio so I can make this communication.
It's like,
oh yeah,
cool.

415
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.340
Open up my bag,
give it to him.
And you know,

416
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.760
he makes the radio communications and I'm out doing like a reconnaissance of the

417
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:37.440
area to find out what route we're going to take.

418
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.180
<v 0>Anyways,
I thought,
you know,
now he's rehydrated decent,</v>

419
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:44.520
take that radio and you know,
we'll be back in back in the game.

420
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.660
So I come back and when I get back the radio was sitting on my rucksack.

421
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.010
Oh No.
But you know what?
I did put it back in my rucksack carried out.
Yeah.

422
00:27:56.011 --> 00:27:58.230
You've just got to do it.
Um,
but yeah,

423
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.890
so you don't want to be that guy once you get rehydrated man,

424
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.850
get your weight back on

425
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.740
the difference between needing help in one.
Yeah.
And he did need help.
Yeah.

426
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.170
At one point.
But once the Gatorades come in,
you know,

427
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:17.640
you're good to go take that radio back.
I was,

428
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.400
I was,
uh,
chuckling inside when I saw that radio.

429
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:24.230
Been placed back on top of my run.
Not Inside,
but just placed on you.

430
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.230
You got it from here.
Yeah,

431
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:29.400
you got to put it back in and thanks and we'll be all good.
Awesome,
good times.

432
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.210
<v 5>And the last one here,
he has integrity.</v>

433
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.900
If his interest in the good of the service is at all times greater than his

434
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:45.290
personal pride.
And when he holds himself to the same line of duty,

435
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.530
when unobserved as he would follow if all his superiors were present,

436
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.730
this is the classic,
what do you do when you're not,
when people aren't looking,

437
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.573
you know,

438
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.870
here's another point.
The cause of much of the friction,

439
00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:07.871
it administrative machinery is that at all levels there are individuals who

440
00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:12.020
insist on standing in their own light and now this is a term to actually had to

441
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:14.780
look upstanding.
You're only,
it means getting your own way.
It means you're,

442
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.160
you're,
you're preventing your,

443
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.400
you're preventing your own success and he uses the term of lunch in here

444
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.880
standing in your own life.
This is important.

445
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.760
They believe that there is some special magic,

446
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.910
some quick springboard to success.

447
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.650
They mistakenly think that it can be won by boot licking,

448
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.540
apple polishing,

449
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.780
yessing higher authority playing office politics,

450
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.770
weight around,
ducking the issue,
striving for cheap popularity,

451
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.780
courting publicity,
or seeking any and all means of grabbing the spotlight.

452
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.610
So this is the guy,

453
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:55.090
everybody that's listening to this podcast right now knows that who I'm talking

454
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:56.110
about,
that guy,

455
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.480
that guy that's just always trying to kiss everyone's ass and make himself look

456
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:05.290
good and,
and that's,
you know,
that's a shortcut,
right?

457
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.420
This is what Marshall St is a is a shortcut or a springboard.

458
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.510
You think it's a quick springboard
back to the book.

459
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.950
Any one of this set of tricks may enable a man to carry the ball forward,

460
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.710
a yard or two in some special situation.

461
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.850
But at least this comment can be made without qualification of the men who have

462
00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:30.230
risen to supreme heights and the fighting establishment of the United States and

463
00:30:30.231 --> 00:30:33.440
have had their greatness proclaimed by their fellow countrymen.

464
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:38.090
There is not one career which provides any warrant for the conclusion that there

465
00:30:38.091 --> 00:30:42.620
is a special shortcut known only to the smart operators.

466
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:44.783
True enough,

467
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.850
a few men have gained fairly high ranked by dint of what late Mr. Justice Holmes

468
00:30:50.521 --> 00:30:52.770
called the instinct for the juggler,

469
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.400
a feeling of when to jump and where to press and how to slash in order to

470
00:30:56.401 --> 00:31:00.120
achieve somewhat predatory personal ends

471
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.060
that will occasionally happen in any walk of life.
And I say this all the time,

472
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.810
I've said this on this podcast,
if you got that guy that we're talking about,

473
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.300
sometimes they're gonna if they're going to get a better recommendation you,

474
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:11.260
but sometimes they're going to get,

475
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.440
they're going to get that promotion that you were wanting and you,
you just,

476
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.180
you just held the line and we're a good person.

477
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:18.950
That person took the credit for something and no one really realized.

478
00:31:18.951 --> 00:31:20.230
And next thing you know,
they get the promotion.

479
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.840
But I agree with what's being said here.

480
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:26.560
That does happen sometimes in every walk of life,
but in the long run,

481
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.180
that person's going down.
Yeah.
That person's going down in the long run.
Yeah.

482
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.770
And the more you kind of depend on that sort of thing,

483
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.120
the less likely for any kind of success anyway.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yup.

484
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

485
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.440
<v 5>And he says here,
but from Washington,
Wayne and Jones down to Eisenhower,</v>

486
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:47.830
Vandergriff and Nimitz,
the best,
the men,

487
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.130
best loved by the American people,
for their military successes.

488
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.170
We're also the men with greatness of soul.

489
00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

490
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.270
<v 5>During World War Two,</v>

491
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:06.040
there were quite a few higher commanders relieved in our forces because it was

492
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:08.890
judged for one reason or another that they had failed in battle.

493
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.220
So relieved means you got fired of the total number.

494
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.220
There were a few who took a reduction in rank,

495
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.600
went willingly to a lower post and a fighting command,
utter no complaints,

496
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.860
kept their chins up,
worked courageously and sympathetically with their commands,

497
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.750
and provide an example of manhood that all who saw them,
we'll never forget.

498
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.960
So if you get,
I get asked this,
I've gotten,
been asked this a couple times.

499
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.470
I got demoted or sometimes not demoted,
but I got passed over.
You know,

500
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:37.990
someone else got promoted instead of me.
What should I do?

501
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:38.963
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

502
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.510
<v 5>Get after it.
That's what these guys did.
That's what these guys did.
Hey,</v>

503
00:32:43.511 --> 00:32:46.670
you screwed up.
You know what?
Check.
All right,
cool.
Let's,
let's say,

504
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.370
here's what I messed up.
That was my fault.
I'm ready to rock and roll.

505
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.210
You put me down,
put me in charge of less people.
I got it.

506
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.470
I'm going to do well though their names need not be mentioned.

507
00:32:56.471 --> 00:33:00.790
They were imprinted with the real virtue of the services even more deeply than

508
00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:03.700
many of their colleagues who had no blemishes on their records.

509
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.610
Their character had met the ultimate test.

510
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.920
The men who had the privilege of working close to them realized this and the

511
00:33:11.921 --> 00:33:12.640
supply,

512
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.640
sublime effect of his personal influence help strengthen the resolve of many

513
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:21.520
others.
So it's actually inspirational to people around you.
When they see that,

514
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.900
and there's been many guys that I've known that a bounce back for some kind of

515
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.800
form,
some kind of,
you know,
career problem,
they mess something up.
They got,

516
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.980
they got fired and they take it.

517
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.440
They'd be humble about it and they come back and turn it around.

518
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.730
The person that complains and thinks that they're a victim,

519
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.900
not going to work out for him.

520
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.460
That's an in the civilian sector and in the military sector.
Now,

521
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.040
let's start talking to him a little bit about being a recruit and the kind of

522
00:33:51.971 --> 00:33:53.380
the,
the mental training,

523
00:33:53.381 --> 00:33:57.970
the mindset training that happens as a recruit to the book,
his Pr,

524
00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:03.030
his perseverance in the care of weapons in keeping his living quarters orderly

525
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.330
and in doing his full share of work is best insured,

526
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.540
not through fear of punishments but by stimulating his belief that any other way

527
00:34:13.571 --> 00:34:17.200
of going is unworthy of a member of a fighting service.

528
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.860
Precision in personal habits,

529
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.920
precision in drill and precision in daily living are the high road to that kind

530
00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:28.900
of discipline,

531
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:34.080
which best ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field

532
00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:40.140
of battle.
Yeah.

533
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.840
You know,
it's just the,
it's,
it's basically he's talking about the,
the,

534
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.150
the unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

535
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.940
That's what it is and that ensures cool and collected,

536
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:55.670
fought and unity of action on the field of battle.

537
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.490
Now I got nothing to say about that other than yes.
Amen.

538
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.260
Here's another little section.
When men are well led,

539
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.100
they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see

540
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:15.320
fit to put before them.
Let's think about that.

541
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.290
When men are well led,

542
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.320
they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see

543
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:24.770
fit to put before them.

544
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.070
So what we're talking about here is when somebody is a good leader,

545
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.350
the troopers around them,
the people that are working for them,
they start to,

546
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.100
they believe a whole body,
everything,
right?
They start

547
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.160
<v 0>to believe everything that you're saying.
And that's powerful.</v>

548
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.440
That's obviously powerful.
Yeah.

549
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:47.490
It kind of goes back to like what you were saying about,
um,
like if you're a,

550
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.740
if they fear your punishment,
that's how you lead,
you know,

551
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.780
iron fist and they fear the punishment.

552
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.990
So they're going to do enough to not get punished,

553
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.500
but they won't do anything that they don't have to.
Yeah.

554
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.200
It's so it's only what they have to do,
so you won't get people doing their best.

555
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.060
You know what I mean?
So,
yeah.
Yeah.
And that,
that,

556
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:08.940
that punishment piece that I kind of breezed through is,

557
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.340
is not through fear of punishments,

558
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.390
but by stimulating his belief that any other way.
So that's 100% right.

559
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.530
And we've seen,
you know,
I say that all the time.
If you,

560
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.980
if people are doing what you told him to do just because they're afraid of you,

561
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.980
sure you can get get that's going to work for a little while,
right?
You know,

562
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.790
all you,
I'll fire you.
Okay.
What's that person doing?
We gets home putting this,

563
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.340
putting his resume on monster.com looking for another job,

564
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.200
doing the best and not to get fired.
The best not to get fired.
He's,
he's,
yeah.

565
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.050
All right.
Going back to the book though,
it has been said before,

566
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.460
even so it can be said again.

567
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.450
It is paramount and overriding responsibility of every officer to take care of

568
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:45.820
his men before caring for himself.

569
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.920
Yet many junior officers do not seem to understand that steadfast,

570
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.400
steadfast fidelity to it is required,

571
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.540
not lip service and have this,

572
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.340
as Admiral Mahann would say,
man would say,
comes much evil.

573
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.060
The loyalty of men simply cannot be commanded when they become embittered by

574
00:37:11.261 --> 00:37:12.550
selfish action.

575
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.410
So a minute your troop c that you're being selfish or you're doing this for

576
00:37:17.411 --> 00:37:21.540
yourself,
that's the beginning of well,
we,
he says,
Adam,

577
00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:25.390
a man says much evil.
He says,
evil comes from that.

578
00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:28.330
When you started acting selfishly as a leader,
evil comes from that.

579
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.423
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

580
00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.310
<v 0>If an officer is on a tour with an enlisted man,
he takes care of the man.</v>

581
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.710
He takes care of that.
The man is accommodated as to food,
shelter,

582
00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:42.730
medical treatment,
or other prime needs before satisfying his own wants.

583
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.750
If that means that the last meal or the last bed is gone,

584
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.300
his duty is to get along the hard way.

585
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.503
<v 6>Boom.</v>

586
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.480
<v 0>Take care of your people.</v>

587
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.670
Now again,

588
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.530
this is written in 1950 but even in 1950 you might think this is a hard post.

589
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:08.460
World War Two,

590
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.290
Chapter Eight is actually called getting along with people.

591
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.510
Boom.
Now,
here's a real,
and some of this stuff is so simple,

592
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.500
so obvious.

593
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.230
It's so simple and so obvious that they had to write a book about it so that

594
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:26.790
people could do it cause we all fail to do it.
So here we go.
If you like people,

595
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.380
if you seek contact with them rather than hiding yourself in a corner,

596
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.140
if you study your fellow men sympathetically,

597
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.460
if you try consistently to contribute

598
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460
<v 5>to something to this success and happiness or contribute something to their</v>

599
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:45.490
success and happiness,
if you are reasonably generous,

600
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.710
which your thoughts and your time,

601
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:53.190
if you have a partial reserve with everyone but as seeming reserve with no one,

602
00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.550
if you work to be interesting,
rather than spend to be a good fellow,

603
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.290
you will get along with your superiors,
your subordinates,
your orderly,

604
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.690
your roommate,
and the human race.
That's all you got.

605
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.630
If you want to get along with everybody.
Now,
one of the ones that I,
I,
you know,

606
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.850
these are all pretty obvious,
but one of the ones,

607
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.910
if you have a partial reserve with everyone,

608
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.420
but a seemingly but a seeming reserve with no one.

609
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:25.290
So what that means is you're not just flying off the handle.
You,

610
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.960
you're just reserved a little bit.
You're just,
you,
she'll restraint.

611
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:33.230
But the restraint doesn't come across as aloofness,
right?
It's not so much,

612
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.270
you know,
if I come into a room and I'm going to show restraint,

613
00:39:36.271 --> 00:39:37.390
so I'm not going to say hi to you,

614
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.530
I'm going to come across as aloof and you're not going to like me.
But if I,

615
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.220
but if I was walking to go echo my brother,
I'll give me a hug.
Well,

616
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.810
you're not gonna like me,
either
you or one of the few people.
Well,

617
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:53.680
that's the Hawaiian Aloha spirit.
So,

618
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.520
so it's,
it's that measured reserve,

619
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:01.660
that measured restraint to balance is a little dichotomy there.

620
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.560
I got to find a good,
good spot in the middle.
Again,

621
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.620
getting along with people back to the book by the scores of thousands precepts

622
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:14.710
and platitudes have been written for the guidance of personal conduct.

623
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.210
The odd part is that despite all of this labor,

624
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:24.270
most of the frictions in modern society arise from the individuals feeling of

625
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.060
inferiority,
his false pride,
his vanity,

626
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.020
his unwillingness to yield space to any other man,

627
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.340
unwillingness to yield space to any of them.

628
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.800
And I get hit on this one a lot because again,

629
00:40:38.801 --> 00:40:42.760
because of my personalities can be a little bit forceful.

630
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.800
People think I'm just no compromise my way or the highway and this is what

631
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:51.730
they're talking about.
I'm not like that.
I'm open to suggestions.

632
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.460
I'm willing to say,
you know what?
That's a better idea.
Or you know what?

633
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.460
I like your idea.
Could we make this adjustment to it or yes,

634
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:00.250
I can change my idea to fit with what you're saying because it makes sense.

635
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:05.230
People that don't do that have unwillingness to yield space to any other man

636
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:11.430
continuing on and his co consequent urge to throw his own weight around.

637
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:13.893
Right?

638
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.650
These are just ways to not get along with people and speaking of ways to get not

639
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:21.430
get along with people.
Here's the 13 mistakes,

640
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.440
the 13 mistakes.
This is from the United States Coast Guard magazine.

641
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.840
13 pitfalls.
Here we go.

642
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:33.841
One to attempt to set up your own personal to attempt to set up your own

643
00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:35.660
standard of right and wrong,

644
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:41.960
to try to measure the enjoyment of others by your own.

645
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.880
To expect uniformity of opinions in the world,

646
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.270
to fail to make allowance for inexperience.

647
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:56.350
It's a good one to endeavor to mold all dispositions alike,

648
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:03.100
not to yield on unimportant trifles same thing we just heard the things that

649
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:08.540
don't matter.
Who Cares?
Let the guys do what they're going to do on that

650
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.070
to look for perfection in our own actions,

651
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.560
to worry ourselves and others about what can't be remedied.

652
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.090
Why you worried about that?
Can't change it.
Let's not worry about it.

653
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.880
Let's just move on.
Here's a big one,

654
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:32.350
not to help everybody wherever,
however,

655
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.910
whenever we can.
That's a big ask.
That's a big requests.
Hey,

656
00:42:36.911 --> 00:42:40.360
you know what I want you to do in your life.
Help everybody,
however,

657
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.740
wherever and whenever you can.
That's,
that's asking a lot.
That's a big one

658
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.100
to consider.
Impossible.
What?
We cannot ourselves perform.
Nike.

659
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:52.934
You'd never do that

660
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:59.290
to believe only what our finite minds can grasp.

661
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:05.380
I must say that one again to believe only what our finite minds can grasp.

662
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.990
That's humility to recognize it.
You know what?

663
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:10.310
I don't understand everything in the world.

664
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.810
I don't understand everything in the world.
It's okay.

665
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.730
There's things beyond my comprehension and that's okay.
You got to admit to that

666
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.760
not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others

667
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:32.770
to estimate by some outside quality when it is that within,

668
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.360
which makes the man

669
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.013
<v 2>so</v>

670
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:40.623
<v 5>very simple.</v>

671
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.260
Interesting how you can make allowances for or according to the 13 things,

672
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.640
you can make allowances for inexperience of others,

673
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:56.020
but not the weakness of a know.
It says,
it says not to make,

674
00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:57.070
so this would be a mistake.

675
00:43:57.071 --> 00:44:00.070
It would be a mistake not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.

676
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:04.810
All threes.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.
You got to just say,
oh,
this,
this guys,
you know,

677
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.670
I got to,
I got to make allowances for flex a little bit,

678
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.090
just a little bit and not fly off the handle.

679
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.043
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:14.711
<v 5>Back to the book.</v>

681
00:44:14.711 --> 00:44:19.711
It's suffice to say that when any officer has the inexcusable fault that he

682
00:44:20.561 --> 00:44:22.990
takes snap judgment on his own men,

683
00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:28.170
he will not be any different in his relations with all other people and we'll

684
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:32.160
stand in his own light for the duration of his career.
There's that term.

685
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.200
If you're,
if you're making snap judgments of people,
you're,

686
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.510
you're not going to do him justice.

687
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.380
And that's something that I was always very careful about because I've talked

688
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:46.140
about before and the seal teams,
you're reputation is very,

689
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:51.141
very important and everybody that's done something stupid in the seal teams,

690
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.290
every single person knows it.
I mean at a high level of stupidity,
if you,

691
00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.060
if you do something really stupid,
everybody knows about it.
And then minor,

692
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.070
stupid things.
A lot of people know about it.

693
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.360
And so you develop a reputation over time and

694
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.030
it's very easy to fall in that category of all,
I heard this guy's,
you know,

695
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:15.890
kind of a Turd or whatever and not give them a chance.
But I always,

696
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.660
I always tried to give people a chance and say,
okay,

697
00:45:17.661 --> 00:45:18.860
let me see what this guy is really like.

698
00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.830
And I guess I would take a little personal challenge if it was a guy that was

699
00:45:21.831 --> 00:45:25.550
going to be working for me.
Let's see if I can make this guy rock and roll.

700
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:29.570
You know,
let me see if I can make this guy into a solid seal.

701
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.830
Can't always pull it off,
but sometimes you can just need that second chance.

702
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:38.050
Some people go too far with the mistakes that they made their own.

703
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.170
They don't get a second chance.

704
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:41.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

705
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:45.550
<v 5>Okay.
We've talked about this before.
Let's talk about it again.
Here we go.</v>

706
00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.130
The man who will not listen,

707
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:52.660
never develops wits enough to distinguish between a bore and a sage and

708
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:54.760
therefore cannot pick the best company.

709
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:56.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

710
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.840
<v 5>The vacant stare,</v>

711
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.990
the drifting of eyes from the speaker to a window or a picture or a passing

712
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:04.134
blonde,

713
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:10.010
though greatly tempting in the midst of long discourse are taken only as signs

714
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:11.370
of inattention.

715
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:17.020
Many a young officer called to the carpet for some trivial businesses managed to

716
00:46:17.021 --> 00:46:20.920
square himself with his commander just by looking straight and talking straight

717
00:46:20.921 --> 00:46:23.440
in the few moments that decided his future.

718
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.860
So I guess this might be something that didn't make the politically correct

719
00:46:26.861 --> 00:46:27.520
version.

720
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.940
If your eyes are wandering on a passing belonged that while we're having this

721
00:46:30.941 --> 00:46:31.774
conversation,

722
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.450
so that might've been one of those things where they change that for the 2007 in

723
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.460
addition.
That's show chauvinist.
Yeah,
I guess that would be chauvinist stick.

724
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.160
It's the blonde.
It didn't think girl.
Okay,
well maybe a good point.

725
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.150
Maybe it's maybe it seems like racial anti Brown haired people

726
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.230
and this is important though.
You go into,
it's all,
you're in trouble.

727
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

728
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.110
<v 5>You get there,
look straight and talk straight for a few minutes with the boss.</v>

729
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.900
Hey,
this boss is what happened.
This is what I did.
This some mistakes I made.

730
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.320
That's got infinitely better chance of of you recovering from that situation as

731
00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:12.660
when you go in there and their bumped to buy,
buy,
buy,
buy.
But don't be that guy.

732
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.630
Don't be that guy
elsewhere in the book,

733
00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:23.370
a great deal has been said about the importance of the voice and of developing

734
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:28.290
one's powers of conversation.
Not a great deal needs to be added there,

735
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.340
but there is no excuse for the officer who talks so that others must strain to

736
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:37.390
hear what he's saying.
Unless he is suffering from laryngitis.

737
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.800
It is simple enough to keep the chin up and let the words rollout.

738
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.180
Many persons have the bad habit of letting the voice drop at the end of a

739
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:47.014
sentence.

740
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.740
The effect on the other party is like watching a man run away from a fight.

741
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.610
Notice I said fight really loud because I didn't want to be the guy that was

742
00:47:57.611 --> 00:47:58.960
dropping off on the end of a sentence.

743
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.310
So you're just talking about speaking and how you speak and speaking clearly and

744
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:06.790
not mumbling and not fading off on the end of your words.

745
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.560
This thing isn't,
this thing is a goldmine.
This book,
actually,

746
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:16.330
this should be issued to 13 year olds nationwide in my opinion.

747
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.960
Maybe we could start a campaign to make that happen.

748
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.400
Go back to the book carefulness in the little things count counts much.

749
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.720
Men develop an aversion to the individual who can not remember their names,

750
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.610
their titles,
or their stations,

751
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.820
but they will warm to the person who remembers and they will overlook most of

752
00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:42.040
his other shortcomings.
Likewise,

753
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.330
they one by any words of appreciation or of interest in what they're doing.

754
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.090
So again,
how we get along with other people,
remember their name.
I know.

755
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.230
And that's hard.
You know,
bro,
that's hard.
There's tricks for that.
Yeah,
I know.

756
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:59.710
That's the,
you need tricks for it.
Even everyone needs,

757
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.570
but I'm just saying it's understood that that's hard and there's tricks out

758
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:08.410
there because people know that that can be hard and they also know that it's

759
00:49:08.411 --> 00:49:11.130
impactful.
Yeah.
It's an impactful.
Yeah,
man.

760
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.610
But you forget the guys name.
Literally two seconds.
Bless you.

761
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:18.850
Unless you make it a point to command yourself to remember it.
Right.

762
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.540
That's tricky.
It's tricky.
I've,
I knew a guy that was,
uh,

763
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.390
a really good leader,

764
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.320
but he would go into a room of 25 people and he would go,

765
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.620
he would go over the top and when he got done,
he would say,

766
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.490
I know all your names now.
And he'd go name every single 100 does that.

767
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.970
It's legit.
I bet henders got some little trick to do it.
Yeah,

768
00:49:41.971 --> 00:49:46.060
he remembers you know,
you,
you,
oh,
your name is echo.
Cool.

769
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:51.070
I look at you and I th I see big e on your face right now.
I remember it.
Yeah.

770
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.740
That's interesting.
But man,
sometimes you can be like,
Hey,

771
00:49:53.741 --> 00:49:55.990
I'm gonna make it a point to remember that one guy.

772
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.230
I'm going to make it a point to remember this guy's name.
He'll be like,
Hey,

773
00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:03.760
my name is John.
You'd be like,
Hey,
Josh Brown,
you'll forget it quick sometimes.

774
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:08.230
It's weird,
man.
Not Good.
Got to remember those names.
You got to lock them in.

775
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.290
I think if you take a certain amount of pride in doing that,

776
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:14.830
I think that helps us.
Step number one,
take pride in your job.

777
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.200
I'm going to try that now.
This is,
this is an interesting little dig here.

778
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.490
It's actually kind of funny.

779
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.170
He's basically going back and saying that all this information about getting

780
00:50:26.171 --> 00:50:27.190
along with other people,

781
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.680
he's saying he's kind of recapping the whole thing to close it out.

782
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.610
Back to the book.
It isn't lengthy advice which is needed on this subject.

783
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.570
Since a man commissioned is considered to have graduated from at least the

784
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:40.340
kindergarten of good manners,

785
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.000
what counts is simply caring about it and not,

786
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.340
not to be ingratiating to other people,

787
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:50.630
but for the sake of one's own dignity and self respect.

788
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:56.290
None of the oracles on winning friends and influencing people have said it in

789
00:50:56.451 --> 00:51:01.070
those few words,
and if they had,
there would have been no books to sell.

790
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.690
So there's a little shot,

791
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.400
little shot on a winning friends and influencing people.
You,

792
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:09.950
when was Ellen right then?
Oh,
that,
that was written.

793
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:12.800
I don't know what the date dates,
but that's right.
A long time ago.
Dang.
Okay.

794
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.820
Long term.
Don't worry.
No,
that's,
that's turn of the century old school.

795
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.953
Old School.

796
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.310
Talking about now we're going to leader leaders in leadership and what type of

797
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:26.540
men are leaders,

798
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:32.150
those who come forward to fill the same places and to command them with equal or

799
00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:35.940
greater or 40 and competence will not be plaster St.

800
00:51:35.941 --> 00:51:37.800
So if you remember in the beginning,

801
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:39.890
you know he goes on this thing about how you view you,

802
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:42.020
you're not going to swear and you're going to be not going to talk bad about

803
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:42.854
women.

804
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.040
He's given some leeway now to that saying they're not going to be plaster Saints

805
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.360
Laden With All Human Virtue,

806
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:55.420
spotless and character and fit to be anointed with a superman legend by some

807
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:58.640
future Parson Weems.

808
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.160
They will be men with the human quality and a strong belief in the United States

809
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.280
and the goodness of a free society.

810
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:13.340
They will have some of the average man's faults and maybe a few of his vices,

811
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.990
but certainly they will possess the qualities of courage,

812
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:23.140
creative intelligence and physical fitness in more than average measure.

813
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.720
So again,
there's not as,

814
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.710
it's not quite as strict as he laid out in the beginning.
Yeah.
Cause it's like,

815
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.230
remember on Trey you to training day,

816
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.140
remember that Denzel and then I saw part of it,

817
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.650
the little concept is in there where he said you got to have a little dirt on

818
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:48.200
you so they can trust you.
Okay.

819
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.110
So basically if you have to sneaky clean.
Well yeah,

820
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:54.680
I mean like there's all kinds of heroes that are not as squeaky clean and all

821
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:55.920
kinds of leaders that aren't,

822
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.100
I would say there's more heroes that aren't squeaky clean.
Yeah.

823
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.051
They're real person.

824
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:03.020
Plenty of leaders that aren't squeaky clean and they're great leaders.

825
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.740
And that's what they're given that up in this book is saying,
look,

826
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.100
not going to be a plaster site.

827
00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:12.200
You gotta be a person going to have faults or weaknesses going to have vices to

828
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:15.800
have dirt.
Yeah.
Just a little bit.
A little bit.
Yeah.
For the record,

829
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:17.750
the training day guys were all corrupt.

830
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.800
So that's a little bit of an extreme example.
They a little too much dirt.

831
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.910
All right,
so now we're talking about grant general grant,

832
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.920
civil war general and beset by human failings.

833
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.080
He could not look impressive.
Impressive.
Average,
though he was in many things.

834
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.730
There was nothing average about the strong way in which he took hold,

835
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.170
applying massive common sense to the complex problems of the field.

836
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.900
That is why he is worth close regard his virtues.
As a military leader,

837
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.580
we're of the simpler sort,

838
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.050
which plane men may understand and hope to emulate.

839
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:03.270
He was direct and manner.
He never intrigued.
His speech was homely,

840
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:07.410
he was approachable.
His mind never deviated from the object.

841
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.480
Though a stubborn man,
he was always willing to listen to his subordinates.

842
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.520
And I love this one right here.

843
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.640
He never adhered to a plan obstinately but nothing could induce him to forsake

844
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:24.120
the idea behind the plan.
So look,
I'm not going to say,

845
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.970
here's my idea and I'm going to hold that idea cause it's good,

846
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.090
but the plan that's going to get us there,
I'm not too worried about that.

847
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.350
I'm not going to hold onto that and let it drag me into the ground.

848
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.050
Back to the book.
In the military service services though,

849
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:45.051
there are niches for the pet damped character is at all times at least as vital

850
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:49.440
as intellect.

851
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.890
So today is like overly educated type scenario or you know you're pedantic,

852
00:54:56.731 --> 00:55:00.240
right,
and the main rewards go to him.

853
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:05.130
Who can make other men feel toughened as well as elevated.

854
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.760
Here's some traits here.
Quiet resolution,

855
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.580
the hardy hood to take risks,

856
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.890
the will to take full responsibility for decisions,

857
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:22.200
the readiness to share its rewards with subordinates.

858
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:26.740
This is obviously extreme ownership and part of extreme ownership is when you'd

859
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:29.970
something that goes well.
You don't own that part.
You give that away

860
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.210
and equal readiness to take the blame when things go adversely,

861
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.193
boom.

862
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:43.310
The nerve to survive storm and disappointment and to face towards each new day

863
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.820
with this score sheet wiped clean,

864
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:53.570
neither dwelling on one successes nor accepting discouragement from one's

865
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:58.660
failures.
Like I said,
this book should be issued to 13 year old.

866
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.780
Really good book by the way.
I figured he'd dig this one.

867
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.330
I used a lot of highlighter on this one.
I've had this book for a long time.

868
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.760
I couldn't,
it's funny when I read it this time,

869
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:15.150
I hadn't read it in so long that it was almost like I was reading it again.

870
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.230
I pretty much had forgotten most of it and a lot of it,
you know,

871
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:23.350
I subconsciously was part Venn probably part of my game for a long time.
Yeah.

872
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.450
I can't tell though.
I can't tell what I just,
what I buried and what,

873
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.780
what was the seed that grew?
Yeah.

874
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.930
Probably there's some ideas in here that were seeds,
if my thought,
yeah,

875
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:37.720
I would imagine so that that's not the kind of book where it's like,
Oh yeah,

876
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:40.360
let me memorize all this.
You know,
it's more like,
oh shoot,

877
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:45.361
I gotta I gotta Kinda in Jeff and his idea and here's the straight up truth.

878
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.260
When somebody gave me this book,
I probably read 10 pages of it and said,
oh,

879
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.880
this is pretty cool.

880
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.410
Put it in my locker and then went out and worked out and forgot about it for

881
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.210
next 15 years.
So it's not,
I didn't,
you know,
this,
this,

882
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:03.330
this current Jocko we'll call it where I kind of overlay and in bring in,

883
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:09.870
it's like Jujitsu when you don't,
when you're good at Jujitsu,
you if you're no,

884
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:12.940
if you're a brown belt,
purple belt,
the black belt in Jujitsu,

885
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.720
somebody can show you a move and you can assimilate it really quickly and you
go,

886
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:19.330
oh yeah,
all I need you to do is this.
Well,

887
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:23.470
I was a white belt before in this stuff and so when I'd read it,

888
00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.980
it kind of made sense,
but it was,
it was,
it was,

889
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:28.140
didn't make as much sense as that.

890
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:33.010
When I read this stuff now it's like I totally understand it at a deeper level

891
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.250
and so it's way more impactful for me.

892
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.770
People are always asking me about this one as well.

893
00:57:42.771 --> 00:57:46.190
Back to the book to speak of the importance of a sense of humor would be

894
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:52.290
unavailing if it were not that what cramps so many men isn't that they are by

895
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:55.460
nature humorless,

896
00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:00.020
but that they are hesitant to exercise what humor they possess

897
00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.100
within the military profession.

898
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:09.130
It is unwise to let the muscles go soft and to spare the mind the strain of

899
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:10.310
original thinking.

900
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:11.530
<v 6>Okay,</v>

901
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:15.370
<v 5>great.
Humor has always been in the military tradition.</v>

902
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:18.700
People ask for some reason,
people ask me about humor a lot.
Hmm.
Hey,

903
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.790
isn't it good for an officer to it or isn't it good for a leader to tell Joe?

904
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:24.250
And like,
yes it is.
And that's why I always,

905
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.650
whenever there's something funny in the war books that we read,

906
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.540
I always try and capture that.

907
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.780
So then people realize that these guys are out there and they keep that sense of

908
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:33.550
humor going all the time.
Yeah.

909
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.780
And I guess it doesn't really necessarily mean telling jokes all the time,

910
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.610
just like 11 yeah.
I feel that's funny.
I'm going to,
you know.
Yeah.

911
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.610
Yeah.
This just having a good time making,

912
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:47.860
making light of these miserable situations for sure.

913
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.093
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

914
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:53.520
<v 5>Said Admiral,
this is going into the next chapter,</v>

915
00:58:53.521 --> 00:58:56.190
which is called main springs of leadership

916
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:02.550
said Ab rule,
forest p Sherman,
chief of naval operations.

917
00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:07.820
I concur that we can take average good men and by proper training developing

918
00:59:09.571 --> 00:59:12.210
them the essential initiative,
concert,

919
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:16.260
confidence and magnetism which are necessary in leadership.

920
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.950
I believe that these qualities are present in the average man to a degree that

921
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:26.951
he can be made a good leader if his native qualities are properly developed.

922
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:31.340
Whether or not he becomes a great leader depends upon whether or not he

923
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:34.520
possesses that extra initiative,
magnetism,

924
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.040
moral courage and force,

925
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:41.390
which makes the difference between the average man and the above.

926
00:59:41.391 --> 00:59:44.600
Average man said,
General CB,

927
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:48.410
Kate's commandant of the Marine Corps leadership is intangible,

928
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:50.810
hard to measure and difficult to describe.

929
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.590
It's qualities would seem to stem from many factors,

930
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.550
but certainly they must include a measure of inherent ability to control and

931
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:02.840
direct self confidence based on expert knowledge,
initiative,

932
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.990
loyalty,
pride and sense of responsibility.

933
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.620
Inherent ability obviously cannot be instilled but that which is latent or

934
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:13.610
dormant can be developed.

935
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.850
Other ingredients can be acquired.

936
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.240
They are not easily taught or easily learned,

937
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:24.560
but leaders can be and can be and are made.

938
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.160
The average good man and our service is and must be considered a potential

939
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:33.560
leader.
So there you go to that question.

940
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.910
It's the same answer that I give them basically all the time when people ask me

941
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:39.830
if leaders leaders are born or may or made,

942
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:41.600
there's the answer from these two guys.

943
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:45.260
They agree with me or should I say I agree with them since they are senior to
me.

944
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:50.420
But,
but look,
you got certain traits you can take.
I would say,

945
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:53.540
look,
you can take someone that's an okay leader and make them a better leader.

946
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.570
You can take a good leader and make them an outstanding leader and outstanding

947
01:00:56.571 --> 01:01:00.830
leader.
You can make an a rapid leader because you're gonna improve these things.

948
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.510
You can learn about these things.

949
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:06.380
The one person that you can't make any better as the person that's not humble,

950
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:10.190
they're not going to get any better cause they can't be coached because Danny

951
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:12.260
and his own light cause he's standing in his own light.

952
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.670
Maybe we'll bring that back him and bringing that

953
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.840
back to the book.
And before I go back to the book,

954
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:23.690
this is another thing I get asked about a lot,

955
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.700
is people ask me because they know that I work a lot.
Yeah.

956
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.780
They know that I get after it.
Right.
And they asked and they asked me about,

957
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.870
uh,
you know,
how do you,
how do you do with your family?
You've got a family.

958
01:01:35.871 --> 01:01:40.040
Cause I've got four children and a wife.
Sure.
And a goldfish.

959
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.790
Okay.
Icicle.
That's the name.
That's the name I know.

960
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.750
So I got to give to the family,
right.
So people say,
hey,
how do you,

961
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.950
how do you balance?
So here we go back to the book.

962
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:58.970
Personal advancement within any worthwhile system requires some sacrifice of

963
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:04.901
leisure and more careful attention to the better organization of one's working

964
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.543
routine.

965
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:13.330
But that does not entail heroic self sacrifice or for fitting of any of life's

966
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:17.480
truly enduring rewards.

967
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:22.590
It means the completion of work ahead of Gulf.

968
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.990
Yeah.
So,
so,

969
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:30.600
so often you see people that you don't,
you're just,

970
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.880
I'm not going to work myself to death.
Oh,
okay.

971
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:34.110
Are you going to play golf to death?

972
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:38.580
Because that's apparently what you're trying to do here.
Right.
But yeah,

973
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:41.130
you got to find balance.
You got to find balance.
Especially,

974
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:43.590
you know when he's talking about life's truly and dory rewards,

975
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.710
that's talking about your family and the things that you achieve outside of the

976
01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:48.420
work world.

977
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:49.683
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

978
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:56.910
<v 5>Abby dim net and Abby Abby dim net was a priest,</v>

979
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.060
I'm pretty sure priest and wrote a book called the art of thinking and he's

980
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:05.650
quoted here in this book,

981
01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:10.651
he said concentration is supposed to be exceptional only because people do not

982
01:03:11.981 --> 01:03:16.981
try and in this as so many things starve within an inch of Plenti.

983
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.210
Ooh,
I like that quote.
Starve within an inch of plenty.

984
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.570
You're almost there.
Almost there.
Almost got plenty.

985
01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:32.830
But your starve to death right there within an inch.
Why?
Cause you,

986
01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.130
you failed a concentrate,
you failed to focus and that's what happens.

987
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:42.500
Oh and well this is,
this is just awesome.
Here we go.

988
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:47.710
There is of course that communist of excuses for rejecting the difficult and

989
01:03:48.711 --> 01:03:52.370
taking life easy.
I haven't time,

990
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.720
but for the man who keeps his mind on the object,

991
01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.840
there is always time figure it out about us in the service as daily we see busy

992
01:04:04.101 --> 01:04:09.101
men who somehow managed to find time for whatever is worth doing while at the

993
01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:14.711
adjoining desks are others with abundant leisure who can't find time for

994
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:20.681
anything when something important requires doing is usually the busy man who

995
01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:23.930
gets the call.

996
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:27.180
<v 6>Okay.</v>

997
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.870
<v 4>Haven't got time for that,
Huh?
There's always time.
Always time.</v>

998
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.000
And how can you ever have time

999
01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:37.690
<v 5>if you don't take time?
That sounds cool,</v>

1000
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:38.524
but I don't know what it means.

1001
01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.630
<v 4>Expand.
Oh,
who has time?
Ah,
but ah,</v>

1002
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:45.710
how can you ever have time if you don't take,
oh,
so you're going to take it out.

1003
01:04:45.711 --> 01:04:47.940
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Patrick given,

1004
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.230
is that where it's like park or something like that?
Do some,

1005
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.670
there was a part two to that movie.
I think there's like a part three.
Two.
Wow.

1006
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:59.490
Anyway,
that was,
that was a good one.
It's true though.
You know,

1007
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:01.800
like guys will be like,
Hey,
I wanna um,

1008
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.860
I want to get in really good shape or something.
Like this,

1009
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:06.960
I want to get like real strong or whatever.
I was like,
okay,

1010
01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.940
I'm gonna work out like this.

1011
01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:12.110
May I don't have like time to wolf then you don't have time,

1012
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.770
then you then you can't get in shape.

1013
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.040
It's like saying I don't have the inclination,
it's more or less the same

1014
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.990
<v 0>thing.
I don't have the time.
Yeah.</v>

1015
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:25.020
I was with one of my buddies and we were counseling someone and my buddy said

1016
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:35.200
you don't care about this.
And the guy says no,
no I do care.

1017
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.821
And he said,

1018
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:41.700
well why can't you show up on time if you cared you would show up on time.
Right.

1019
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:45.940
And case closed.
You were fired.
That was that.
I was like,
well you know what,

1020
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.480
let's just stop talking cause we're done.
We're done.
Cause that's 100% accurate.

1021
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:55.210
So as you probably know,
I come from a long line of late.

1022
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.950
Yes we've,
we've discussed that before.

1023
01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:01.570
So I kind of analyzed it where there was a time where I felt like,
Dang,

1024
01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:05.980
I just,
I don't know.
I just can't be on to,
it's like,
it's like almost like this,

1025
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:10.400
like a mentor,
physical block almost.
That's what it felt like,
but then

1026
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:16.510
really amylase,
this is when you really realize that you are just lazy,

1027
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:20.470
not lazy.
It wasn't important.
Just like,
are you saying this is what?

1028
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.420
So let's say work for example.

1029
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:25.930
I was late literally more times than I was on time at work.

1030
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.000
I won't ever forget her name.
So many times I did a good enough job.

1031
01:06:29.001 --> 01:06:32.370
I would have fired you and then rehired you so I could fire you.
Just Starkey,

1032
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:36.130
take pleasure in it.
Probably would have been a good idea nonetheless.

1033
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.680
So when I analyze it,
I was like,
wait,
why am I late?

1034
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.980
Why don't I get prepared the night before?

1035
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:45.430
Whatever it takes to be on time every single time and just like,

1036
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.480
it's not important.

1037
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:51.690
Like why would I spend my off work time preparing to go be at work?

1038
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:56.020
I should be resting or d,
that's my off time.

1039
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.340
Watching a little bit more television or yeah,
whatever.
Not Working.

1040
01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.450
I can squeeze in another episode of this program.
Exactly right.
Not Working.

1041
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.900
Why should I spend off work time doing work,
stuff like that.

1042
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.090
I'm not getting paid.
We're kind of thing,
you know,

1043
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.490
it's not important that it goes back to this whole,

1044
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:16.330
this whole book starting off with the attitude of trying to do good job all the

1045
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:19.600
time.
And actually somebody brought that up.
If somebody sent me a direct message,

1046
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.400
and this was a great point that I didn't think about,

1047
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.760
we got asked another question on the podcast about,
hey,

1048
01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:28.450
if you're getting told to go to a meeting that you're not going to get paid for

1049
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.210
a,
remember that conversation?
This guy wrote me and said,
hey,
you know,

1050
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.600
legally that that's illegal if you're on an hourly rage.

1051
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:36.370
So that's a great point that I didn't think of.

1052
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:39.670
I didn't think of it from a HR perspective,
but that's a good point.

1053
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.440
Now you've got people that you're breaking the law.

1054
01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.580
So I kind of assume that these guys were not being specifically compensated,

1055
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:49.620
but that they,
they were maybe salaried employees that they were,

1056
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:53.550
but I could be wrong.
And if those people are hourly now you,
now you,

1057
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.270
now you've got to go to the boss and say,
Hey boss,

1058
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.060
I want to get this meeting going,

1059
01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.840
but what you're doing to us and what you're doing to these guys is illegal.

1060
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.970
Or maybe the manager,

1061
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:07.810
a lot of times managers are salaried and the workers are hourly,

1062
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.390
so he would need to go,
look,
I'll come to the meeting because I'm on salary.

1063
01:08:10.391 --> 01:08:12.910
It's all good with me.
I'm here to win.
But the guys,

1064
01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.740
I can't bring them in here unless you want to be looking at a,

1065
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.050
at a labor law suit,

1066
01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.410
<v 4>you and the game for that boss because I'm not,</v>

1067
01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:21.170
that's going to cost our company money.
It's gonna make us look bad.
Let's,

1068
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.420
let's do this another way.
Yeah,
boom.

1069
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:26.090
But that is a different element to the whole,

1070
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:28.820
like the point as far as what you're talking,
what are you talking about?

1071
01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:32.120
Like if something's like not important versus it is important,

1072
01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:35.960
like it doesn't necessarily go for just worked it.
So he goes for anything.

1073
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:37.850
Like if you're late to anything,
like if you,

1074
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:42.660
if you like this podcast I'm rolling in late every single time it's,

1075
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:46.130
it's obviously because being on time isn't that important and that bleeds into

1076
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.690
this podcast in one way or another.

1077
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:52.310
What we're about to do isn't important enough and that's why you're on time

1078
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.550
because it is important to you.
There you go.
Oh,
I'm glad.

1079
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.110
Cause it's important to me too.

1080
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.180
And I will spin off my quote unquote free time doing stuff to prepare for,

1081
01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:06.560
you know the ontime stuff.
Well that's good.
You see what I'm saying?

1082
01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:09.070
Otherwise you'd be getting fired.
I'm just using this as a high.

1083
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:13.540
Give me another echo.
Charles,
you got a twin brother,
right?

1084
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:16.600
Don't even know the difference.
Good point.

1085
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.240
Although he probably genetically has the same problem.
I told you,

1086
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:24.580
we come from a long line and he knows the importance of,
you know,

1087
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.970
the,
and it's,
and it's a sign of disrespect to,
by the way,
it's like saying,

1088
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:31.310
not only do I not think what we're,

1089
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:34.640
what we've planned to do or agreed to do and all this type stuff.

1090
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.040
Not only do I not think that's important,

1091
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:40.010
I don't respect how much you think it's important.

1092
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.390
That's why I need to respect my time.
Nope.
None at all.
None at all.
The on time.

1093
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.830
Well and make time.
Take your time.

1094
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.930
If you want to have the time you get a picture.

1095
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.453
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1096
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.333
<v 5>Yeah.
And that's,</v>

1097
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.880
that's what's so I like about this guys actually making fun of people that say I

1098
01:09:57.881 --> 01:09:58.714
haven't got time

1099
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:04.450
because for the man who keeps his mind on the object,

1100
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.790
there is always time.

1101
01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:09.150
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1102
01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:12.900
<v 5>Next section says much as conveyed an F in few words.</v>

1103
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:17.990
In army field forces brief on practical concepts of leadership.

1104
01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:22.620
It is stressed.
They're in that the preeminent quality,

1105
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:27.950
which all great commanders have owned in common is a positiveness of manner and

1106
01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:30.864
a viewpoint.

1107
01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:36.050
The power to concentrate on means to a given end to the exclusion of exaggerated

1108
01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:42.810
fears of the obstacles which ally a fort the course.

1109
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.100
Every word of that should be underscored and above all what it says about the

1110
01:10:50.141 --> 01:10:54.850
need for affirmative thinking and concentrating on how things can be done.

1111
01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:58.150
This is the PR you always hear about this.
You always hear about this person,

1112
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.490
the person that says when you go to them and say,
Hey,
can we do this?
They're,

1113
01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.540
they're always looking for a way to say no.

1114
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.870
Our reason why something can't happen instead of,
no,
we can do that.

1115
01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.000
We can make that happen.
We can,
we can figure out a way.

1116
01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:11.920
That's what we're looking for.

1117
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:17.130
Next section,
those.

1118
01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.230
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1119
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:18.471
<v 5>Oh,</v>

1120
01:11:18.471 --> 01:11:23.471
in this section is actually the same topic of what this podcast is the topic of

1121
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.330
and that is human nature

1122
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:28.533
<v 6>legit.</v>

1123
01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.200
<v 5>Those who had the chance to study American men under the terrible rigor of</v>

1124
01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:38.201
Japanese imprisonment during World War Two gave an analysis that in certain of

1125
01:11:38.931 --> 01:11:39.770
the prisoners,

1126
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:45.310
character and sanity with it held fast against every circumstance in others,

1127
01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:51.600
some of whom had been well educated and came from gentle homes.

1128
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:57.020
The brute instinct was as upper most as in an east African Cannibal.

1129
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.570
And when they say brute instinct,

1130
01:12:01.571 --> 01:12:04.660
that's the person that just loses and goes to the animal instincts.

1131
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.633
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1132
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.080
<v 5>From such crucibles as these even more than from the remittance stresses of</v>

1133
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:17.571
combat in war comes the clearest light on the inner nature of man in so far as

1134
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:23.541
it needs to be understood by the officer who may some day lead a force into

1135
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.473
battle

1136
01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.253
<v 6>human nature.</v>

1137
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:37.440
<v 5>One of the things that he says about cumin nature and here is goodwill and</v>

1138
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:40.770
weakness may be combined in one man,

1139
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.740
bad will and strength in another.

1140
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.540
Hi moral leading can lift the first man to excel himself.

1141
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.970
It will not reform the other,

1142
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:57.070
but there is no other sensible rule then that all men will be approached with

1143
01:12:57.981 --> 01:13:02.981
trust and treated as trough trustworthy until proved otherwise beyond reasonable

1144
01:13:04.371 --> 01:13:08.350
doubt.
So He's thrown out.

1145
01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:10.520
The trust is a little bit opposite.
I've talked about it or it's like,

1146
01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:15.730
actually I should take that back.
I remember one time on the podcast,
I said,
look,

1147
01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:19.570
I don't have a high expectation of people when I meet him and I hold that true

1148
01:13:19.571 --> 01:13:24.160
to this day,
but I don't straight up not trust them as a human.

1149
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.160
Yeah,
there's a difference there.
Yes.
I think there's a difference.

1150
01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:28.360
I think I feel that way.

1151
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:31.600
<v 4>There is a d yeah.
And,
and it's not an obvious difference,</v>

1152
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:33.040
but it's like the difference between,

1153
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:36.880
I don't have an a high expectation of somebody's aunt versus I have a low

1154
01:13:36.881 --> 01:13:41.800
expectation of person.
Got It.
So yeah.
But it does sound the same though.

1155
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:46.270
It sounds the same expectation than what can expectation do you have obviously a

1156
01:13:46.271 --> 01:13:49.660
low one.
Right,
exactly.
Right.
Maybe just to maybe just a neutral one.
Right?

1157
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:51.730
Like I'm not gonna put any expectations.

1158
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.880
I'm not expecting you to do a bunch of hero,
you know,

1159
01:13:54.881 --> 01:13:57.460
I don't have any expectations.
Neutral.
Yeah.
I think I come up,

1160
01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:59.800
come in with a neutral attitude on that one.
Yeah.

1161
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:01.250
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1162
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.791
<v 5>Back to the book.</v>

1163
01:14:01.791 --> 01:14:06.791
Men Do not achieve a great solidarity or preserve it simply by being together.

1164
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:08.960
They're mutual.

1165
01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:13.961
Bonds are forged only by doing that which they have been convinced is

1166
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:15.580
constructive.

1167
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.140
The absence of a common purpose is that chief source of unhappiness in any

1168
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:27.961
collection of individuals lacking it and the common standard of justice,

1169
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.000
which is one of its chief agents,

1170
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.720
men become more and more separate units each fighting for his own rights.

1171
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.380
This is why you got to have that common purpose.

1172
01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:43.420
This is why that commander's intent is so important.

1173
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:44.800
This is why it's important that everyone understood.

1174
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:46.660
It has to understand why they're doing what they're doing.

1175
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:51.010
They have to understand the strategic goal that you're trying to meet as a

1176
01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:54.070
company,
as a business,
as a team,
as a platoon

1177
01:14:55.710 --> 01:14:58.080
<v 4>and as a person and less like a lot of people.</v>

1178
01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:02.370
They'd go into straight up depression because I mean if I don't see the big
goal,

1179
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.450
if they don't feel purpose in their life map,
yeah,

1180
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:09.680
<v 5>that is true.
Back to the book,</v>

1181
01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.050
whatever his rank,

1182
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:17.470
it is impossible for any man to lead if he is himself running behind this

1183
01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:24.080
bespeaks the need of constant study,

1184
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:29.290
the constant use of one's personal powers and the exercise of the imagination as

1185
01:15:30.531 --> 01:15:35.531
men advance that which was good soon ceases to be good simply because something

1186
01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:41.560
better is possible.
You got to evolve.
You've got to continue to evolve,

1187
01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.250
get to continue to improve yourself.

1188
01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:50.170
History confirms and a study of the workings of the human mind supports one

1189
01:15:50.361 --> 01:15:55.361
proposition which many of the great captains of war have accepted as a truism.

1190
01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:01.220
There are no bad troops.
There are only bad leaders.

1191
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:08.420
Yeah,
interesting.
It's here.
Napoleon set.

1192
01:16:08.421 --> 01:16:10.820
Napoleon said there's no bad colonels,
only bad regiments.

1193
01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:15.650
Hackworth said the same thing.
No bad t I think he said,

1194
01:16:15.651 --> 01:16:20.060
no bad troops,
only bad officers in the book that Lafe and I wrote,

1195
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:22.160
no bad teams,
only bad leaders.
So

1196
01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.100
very common

1197
01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.100
and very true stands the test of time.
You know,

1198
01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:36.220
there's a reason why Napoleon thought that there's a reason why SLA Marshall

1199
01:16:36.231 --> 01:16:40.190
said that there's a reason why Hackworth said that there's a reason why Lafe and

1200
01:16:40.191 --> 01:16:43.850
I put that in the book because that is true.
And the minute you,

1201
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:44.860
if you're in a leadership position,

1202
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.070
the minute that you accept that fact is the minute you step forward to becoming

1203
01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:52.280
a better leader.
Because as soon as you're blaming it on other people,
you're,

1204
01:16:52.281 --> 01:16:56.330
you're,
you're,
you're just not going to make about,
oh,
my team sucks.
You suck.

1205
01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:01.320
<v 4>Right?
So it's,
I don't know if you'd call this irony or what,
but,</v>

1206
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:05.580
okay.
No bad teams.
Only bad leaders.
So if you're like,
wait,
that's not true.

1207
01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:07.410
Well guess what?
Your bed.

1208
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.543
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1209
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.090
<v 0>it's,
it's like a catch 22 yeah.</v>

1210
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.340
Or what's good for the goose is good for the Gander.
Actually.

1211
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:19.190
I don't think that's it,
but all right,
this is awesome.

1212
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.580
Here we go back to the book and this actually,

1213
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:26.120
this section here has gone to group nature,

1214
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.990
so we've gone from human nature to group nature.
Back to the book,

1215
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:35.050
among the Communist of experiences in war is to witness troops doing nothing or

1216
01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:42.920
worse doing the wrong thing without one commanding voice,

1217
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:46.940
being raised to give them direction.
In such circumstance,

1218
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:51.941
any man who has the nerve and presence to step forward and give them an

1219
01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:57.590
intelligent order in a manner indicating that he expects to be obeyed,

1220
01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:02.870
will be accepted as a leader and will be given their support.

1221
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.860
Did you hear that?
I did.
That's all it is.
Who's going to step up?

1222
01:18:06.861 --> 01:18:10.440
Who's going to have the nerve and the presence to step up and give it an

1223
01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:14.140
intelligent order that you believe in and that you believe will be followed on?

1224
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:18.530
I get you would expect we'll bid,
you'll be obeyed.
So again,

1225
01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:21.080
I hear all these people say,
well,
you know,
I'm not in the senior position,

1226
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:25.100
therefore I can't do anything wrong.
Actually you can step up and lead

1227
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:31.400
back to the book.
For this reason.
Under the conditions of modern battle,

1228
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.580
the coherence of any military body comes not only of men being articulate all

1229
01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:38.630
down the line,

1230
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:43.610
but of building up the dynamic power in each individual.

1231
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:49.760
It is a thoroughly sound exercise in any unit to give every man a chance to take

1232
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:53.990
charge and give orders in drill or other limited exercises.

1233
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:56.210
Once he has learned what the orders mean,

1234
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.180
by the same token,

1235
01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:04.210
it is good practice for the junior leader to displace a file that means just one

1236
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:09.080
of the guys to displace a file in a training exercise and become commanded for a

1237
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:13.350
time to sharpen his own perspective.
So

1238
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.950
it's good for the junior guys to step up into leadership positions in lead.

1239
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.370
It's good for the leaders to go and be one of the boys and the platoon.

1240
01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.860
And I got really lucky because I was at prior,

1241
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.510
what's called a prior enlisted guy,
a Mustang officers.

1242
01:19:28.511 --> 01:19:33.290
So I spent my first eight years in the seal teams as a,
as a guy in the,

1243
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:34.410
I was one of the files.

1244
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:37.980
So I knew what it was like when a leader didn't tell you know what was going on.

1245
01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:40.560
I knew what it was like when you had a good leader.
Yeah.

1246
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.860
So when I stepped up into those leadership positions,
I could,

1247
01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.060
I knew at least what not to do and I knew what I would try and do to be a good

1248
01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:51.330
leader.
Yeah.
It's like the curse of knowledge,
right?

1249
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:54.600
Like you don't Chris sinologist when like you can't see it from some

1250
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:57.150
inexperienced persons point of view.
Oh Yup.
Yup.

1251
01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:01.260
And so you don't really have that,
you know,
cause you've been the inexperience.

1252
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:02.990
He can just draw on those memories,
you know,

1253
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.320
to have that perspective though full kind of know what it is like to good won't

1254
01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:07.154
want to worst things.

1255
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:11.460
You're at the end of a 16 man seal platoon patrolling through the night and you

1256
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:14.310
just have no idea where you are.
You have no idea how far the target is.

1257
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.100
A way you have no idea when you're going to stop.
You have no idea what you've,

1258
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:17.881
no idea of anything.

1259
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:22.220
You're just walking like a like a miserable or boots,

1260
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:27.000
boots,
boots,
boots.
That's what you're getting the zone off.
It's just the worst.

1261
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.060
So when I was a platoon commander,
when I was a squad leader,

1262
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.300
everybody I tried with everything.

1263
01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:35.390
I had to make sure everyone knew what's going on.
Yeah,

1264
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:38.880
all the time because I never wanted my guys to be thinking what is happening?

1265
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.770
What are we doing?
Yeah,
that's good.

1266
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:49.340
Progress comes of making the most of our strengths rather than looking for ways

1267
01:20:49.341 --> 01:20:53.960
to repair weaknesses.
This is true in things both large and small.

1268
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.940
The platoon leader who permits himself to beat bedeviled by the file who won't

1269
01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:00.500
or can't keep step,

1270
01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.700
cannot do justice to the ambitions of the 10 strongest men beneath him.

1271
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:10.180
I'll pawn to whom the life of the formation would depend common emergency to

1272
01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:16.040
nourish and encourage the top rather than to concentrate effort and exhaust

1273
01:21:16.041 --> 01:21:18.050
nerves and trying to correct a few,

1274
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:22.820
least likely prospects is the healthy way of growth within military

1275
01:21:22.821 --> 01:21:26.920
organization.
Take care of your top people,
put your foe folks and energy in them.

1276
01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.320
And I was,
you know,
going to give some time to the guys that are struggling.

1277
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:32.930
Try and help them out.
But let's not focus on them.

1278
01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.410
They're not gonna make or break you.
So those leaders that you want to,

1279
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:37.510
you want to develop,
you want to,

1280
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:41.060
you've got a good seed that's starting to grow water,
that seed.

1281
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.120
Don't worry about that thing over there in the corner that's not doing anything.

1282
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.590
It is a good,
this is classic.

1283
01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:56.710
It is a sign of a good level of discipline in command when orders are given and

1284
01:21:57.801 --> 01:21:59.210
faithfully carried out.

1285
01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:05.260
But it is a sign of a vastly superior condition when the men are prepared to

1286
01:22:06.711 --> 01:22:10.190
demand those orders,
which they know the situation requires.

1287
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:13.400
If it is to be helped.
No competence.

1288
01:22:13.401 --> 01:22:17.240
Subordinate sits around waiting for someone else to give impulse to movement.

1289
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:20.930
If he senses,
if it senses tell him that things are going to pot,

1290
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:26.690
either suggests a course of action to it's superior or asks authority to execute

1291
01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:31.430
it on his own or in the more desperate circumstances of the battlefield gives

1292
01:22:31.431 --> 01:22:33.470
orders on his own initiative.

1293
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:39.360
Decentralized Command.
Everybody's a leader.

1294
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:41.430
Everybody steps up and makes things happen.

1295
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:44.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1296
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:48.260
<v 0>Back to the book General Dwight d Eisenhower was thinking on these things when</v>

1297
01:22:48.261 --> 01:22:49.580
he said during World War II,

1298
01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:53.540
there is among the mass of individuals who carry rifles in war,

1299
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:56.300
a great amount of ingenuity and efficiency.

1300
01:22:57.230 --> 01:23:00.050
If men can talk naturally to their officers,

1301
01:23:00.051 --> 01:23:04.670
the product of their resourcefulness becomes available to all.

1302
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:09.370
<v 5>So as long as you can,
as long as your guys feel comfortable talking to you,</v>

1303
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:14.320
you're going to have access to all their ideas and all their ingenuity back to

1304
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:18.970
the book.
But the art of open communication requires both receiving an ending.

1305
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:23.890
And the besetting problem is to get officers to talk naturally to men.

1306
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.390
Develop the relationships with the troops is what you gotta do.

1307
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.380
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1308
01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.920
<v 5>Another section here at all.
Training,</v>

1309
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.400
all training at all levels has a dual object to develop us all as leaders of men

1310
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.000
and as followers of leaders.
Dichotomy.
Got To be a leader,

1311
01:23:47.001 --> 01:23:51.770
got to be a follower.
It's like your Twitter thing and know your Twitter,

1312
01:23:51.771 --> 01:23:54.620
bio leader,
follower over eager listener

1313
01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.320
reader.
That is,
that is,
there's a dichotomy there.

1314
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:02.720
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1315
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.530
<v 5>back to the book.</v>

1316
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:08.530
The paralysis which comes of fear can be lifted only through the resumption of

1317
01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:14.660
action,
which will again give individuals the feeling of organization.

1318
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:17.420
So this is interesting.
We remember that

1319
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:23.690
Joe Owen when he was in Korea in the coldest war in,

1320
01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:28.650
in colder than hell,
he's freezing and he,

1321
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.850
there's shooting starts and he's got his own procedure of how he's going to

1322
01:24:31.851 --> 01:24:34.100
overcome the fear he's going to do.
He's going to take action.

1323
01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.770
And it's something that I've said on here a bunch of times here.

1324
01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:38.960
You're afraid to something take action and step into it.
So what this,

1325
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:42.080
what this is saying is the same thing but not on an individual level,

1326
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.580
but on a group level.

1327
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.600
Because we're talking about group nature here and it's the same thing as you do

1328
01:24:47.601 --> 01:24:50.450
with an individual you do with the group.
So listen to this again,

1329
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.400
the paralysis which comes a fear can be lifted only through the resumption of

1330
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:56.150
action,

1331
01:24:56.150 --> 01:25:00.860
which will again give the individuals feeling of organization.

1332
01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:05.450
This does not mean ordering a bayonet charge or firing a volley at such and such

1333
01:25:05.451 --> 01:25:06.284
a clock.

1334
01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:11.540
It may mean only padding one man on the back talking it up to a couple of

1335
01:25:11.541 --> 01:25:11.990
others,

1336
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:16.990
sending someone out to find a flank or turning ones or turning oneself to dig in

1337
01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:21.200
while passing the word to others to do.
Likewise,

1338
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.540
this is action in the realest sense of the term.

1339
01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:32.620
Out of rear reinvigorating men toward the taking of many small actions develops

1340
01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:36.740
the possibility of large and decisive action.

1341
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:42.490
That unit must first find itself before doing an effective job of finding the

1342
01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:43.754
enemy.

1343
01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:49.100
Out of those acts which are incidental to the establishing of an order,

1344
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.170
the leader reaffirms his own power of decision.
So those are,

1345
01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:57.920
that's beautiful advice.
Beautiful advice.
Just like you do with yourself,

1346
01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:00.110
you're afraid of something.
Take action step into it.

1347
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:02.900
You got your group and everyone started to get scared and overwhelmed.

1348
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.110
Let's take some action.
Hey guys,
dig in.
Hey guys,
online,

1349
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.880
whatever that order is going to be.
That's that.
It may not solve the problem,

1350
01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.040
but it regains your,

1351
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.930
your stability as a team and now you can move forward.

1352
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:22.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1353
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:26.510
<v 5>This next section is subtitled environment.</v>

1354
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:33.730
Back to the book.
It is only to the man who is burdened with unnecessary,

1355
01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:35.060
an exaggerated fear,

1356
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.400
fears and who mistakes for fancied security.

1357
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:45.670
The privilege of sitting quietly in one place that the uprooting which comes

1358
01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:47.870
with war is demoralizing.

1359
01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:55.020
The natural officer sees it as an hour of opportunity and though he may not like

1360
01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.330
anything else about war,

1361
01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:03.450
he at least relishes the strong feeling of personal contention which always

1362
01:27:04.571 --> 01:27:05.404
develop,

1363
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:10.470
develops when there are many openings inviting many men as world as one World

1364
01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.190
War II commander expressed it during war.

1365
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.390
The ball is always kicking around,
loose in the middle of the field,

1366
01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.720
and any man who has the will may pick it up and run with it.

1367
01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.170
That's true by life.

1368
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.030
So many opportunities out there who's going to pick it up and run with it

1369
01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.170
becomes the question.

1370
01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1371
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:44.330
<v 5>Now we get into touching back a little bit on to some discipline back to the</v>

1372
01:27:45.661 --> 01:27:50.661
book when men are given absolute freedom with no compulsion upon them,

1373
01:27:51.121 --> 01:27:56.121
but to eat and sleep as with a group of south sea savages,

1374
01:27:57.030 --> 01:28:00.780
there can be no strong uniting bond between them.

1375
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.490
<v 5>Absolute freedom doesn't get you what you want.</v>

1377
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:11.640
There's gotta be a counter to that and that counter is discipline.

1378
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:15.330
I suppose that's another politically incorrect thing that we've run into the

1379
01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.200
book a couple of times.

1380
01:28:16.201 --> 01:28:21.201
The South Sea savages whose that technically probably natives from the South

1381
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.033
Sea.

1382
01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:24.880
<v 1>Yes,</v>

1383
01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.900
<v 5>yes.
In fact,
that is who it is.
Okay.
All right.
There you go.</v>

1384
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.640
No offense intended

1385
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.620
back to the book in officer Schipp.

1386
01:28:35.621 --> 01:28:40.621
There is simply no substitute for personal recognizance nor any other technique

1387
01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:44.560
that in the long run we'll have half its value.

1388
01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.840
So when he's talking about personal recognizance,

1389
01:28:46.841 --> 01:28:49.840
here's not talking about going to reconnaissance reconnaissance of an enemy

1390
01:28:49.841 --> 01:28:50.674
position.

1391
01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:55.600
He's talking about going down and Rocana syncing,

1392
01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.490
doing reconnaissance within your own element,
talking to your peoples.

1393
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.040
What he's talking about here,
he's talking about that

1394
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.970
<v 0>habit of,</v>

1395
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:08.040
of personal recognizance once formed the habit of getting down to the roots of

1396
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:12.570
organ,
of organization,
of seeing with one's own eyes.

1397
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:17.250
What is taking place of measuring it against one's own scale of values,

1398
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:22.430
of ordering such changes as are needed and a following through to make certain

1399
01:29:22.561 --> 01:29:26.970
that the changes are made becomes the main spring of all efficient command

1400
01:29:26.971 --> 01:29:29.610
action in battle.

1401
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.000
There is no other way to be sure in training.

1402
01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:37.170
There is no better way to move towards self assurance,

1403
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.800
so get down there,
get in the weeds sometimes,

1404
01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:44.190
see what's going on on the front lines.
Talk to your people.

1405
01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.360
This section talks about the mission.
When an order is given,

1406
01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:58.780
what are the responsibilities of the man who receives it in sequence these to be

1407
01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:04.190
certain that he understands what is required to examine an organize his

1408
01:30:04.191 --> 01:30:09.191
resources as promptly as possible to and fully informed his subordinates upon

1409
01:30:09.441 --> 01:30:14.441
these points to execute the order without waste of time or means to call for

1410
01:30:15.861 --> 01:30:16.694
support.

1411
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:21.680
If events prove that his means are inadequate to fill up the spaces in the

1412
01:30:21.681 --> 01:30:25.430
orders.
If there are developments which had not been anticipated

1413
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:30.450
when the detail is complete to prepare to go on to something else.

1414
01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.093
Straightforward.

1415
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:37.640
Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Morgan who planned the invasion of Normandy,

1416
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:38.900
put the matter this way.

1417
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:43.070
When setting out on any enterprise it is well,

1418
01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:46.100
it is as well to ask oneself three questions.

1419
01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:51.340
To whom is one responsible for what precisely is one responsible?

1420
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:56.360
What are the means that disposable at disposal for discharging this

1421
01:30:56.361 --> 01:30:57.200
responsibility?

1422
01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:03.580
Nothing so warms the heart of a superior as that on giving an order.

1423
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:07.130
He sees his subordinate salute and say yes sir.

1424
01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.700
Then about face and proceeded to carry it out to the hilt without faltering or

1425
01:31:13.791 --> 01:31:14.624
looking back.

1426
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.900
This is the kind of a man that a commander will choose to have with him every

1427
01:31:19.901 --> 01:31:22.720
time and that he will recommend for first advancement.

1428
01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:24.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1429
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.870
<v 0>On the other hand,</v>

1430
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:30.050
clarification of the object is not only a right but a duty and it cuts both

1431
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:34.260
ways.
So if you don't understand you,
it's you.
You,

1432
01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:37.740
you have the duty to ask for clarification.

1433
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:42.780
Orders are not always clear and no superior is on form from ground.

1434
01:31:42.781 --> 01:31:47.610
When he is impatient of questions which are to the point or resentful of the man

1435
01:31:47.611 --> 01:31:51.210
who asks him.
I say this all the time.
If you're a subordinate says,
hey,

1436
01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:54.210
why are we doing this?
And you get angry,
you're wrong.

1437
01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.900
You should be happy that your subordinates asking why,

1438
01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:03.050
but it is the but it is natural that he will be doubtful of the man whose word

1439
01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:07.900
show either that he hasn't heard or is concerned.
Mainly with irrelevancies.

1440
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:12.550
A cultivation of the habit of careful,

1441
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.860
concentrated listening and have collected,

1442
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:19.861
fought in reading into any problem is principal portal to successful officer

1443
01:32:20.981 --> 01:32:24.670
ship
from the pen,

1444
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:28.180
from the pen of General Eisenhower comes these words,

1445
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:33.330
the commander success will be measured more by his ability to lead then by his

1446
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:37.450
adherence to fixed notions.

1447
01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.450
Thus in the conduct of operations,

1448
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:45.390
not less than an execution of orders,

1449
01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:50.540
it is necessary that the mind remain plastic and impressionable.

1450
01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:51.961
Again,

1451
01:32:51.961 --> 01:32:56.961
the idea of the military man as this person that can't change and is close

1452
01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.120
minded,
it's wrong.
Now there are military leaders like that

1453
01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.110
and it's unfortunate they're not good.
You gotta have the flexible mind.

1454
01:33:06.111 --> 01:33:07.580
You gotta have the plastic mind.

1455
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.720
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1456
01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.180
<v 0>Obedience is not the product of fear,</v>

1457
01:33:12.181 --> 01:33:15.690
but of understanding and understanding is based on knowledge that you've got to

1458
01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:18.270
make sure that your troops don't understand what's going on so they know what's

1459
01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:21.450
going on so they can obey properly.
Not out of fear.

1460
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:29.990
To grasp the spirit of orders is not less important.

1461
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:35.100
Then to accept them cheerfully and keep faith with the contract,

1462
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.220
but the letter of an instruction does not relieve him who receives it from the

1463
01:33:41.221 --> 01:33:46.070
obligation to exercise.
Common Sense.
You get told to do something,

1464
01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.390
you still got to do.
You still gotta hold common sense.

1465
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:53.750
In the Carolina maneuvers of 1941 a soldier stood at a road intersection for

1466
01:33:53.851 --> 01:33:58.110
three days and nights directing civilian traffic simply because the man who put

1467
01:33:58.111 --> 01:34:02.190
him there had forgotten all about it.
Though he was praised at the time,

1468
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:06.090
he was a hardly a shining example of the hold up to the troops.

1469
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:11.810
Moving into the next chapter,

1470
01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:16.460
which the name of the chapter is discipline.

1471
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:25.370
This is,
you're going to recognize this one.

1472
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:28.130
Once a man condones remiss,

1473
01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:31.880
his own belief and discipline begins to wither.

1474
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:37.810
The officer who tolerate slackness in the dress of his men soon ceases to attend

1475
01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.620
his own appearance and if he is not called to account,

1476
01:34:42.621 --> 01:34:46.820
has sloppy habits will shortly begin to inflict his superior.

1477
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.100
There's only one correct way to wear the uniform when any deviations and dress

1478
01:34:52.101 --> 01:34:53.810
or condoned within the services.

1479
01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.730
The way is open to the destruction of all uniformity and unity.

1480
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:05.180
It's not what you preach,
it's what you tolerate.
You can don't remixes

1481
01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:08.350
you're opening.

1482
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:12.760
Now this might be a little bit extreme when he says that when you're out of

1483
01:35:12.761 --> 01:35:16.640
uniform or you allow these units of the way is open to the destruction of all

1484
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:17.680
uniformity and unity.

1485
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:23.100
I'm not sure I 100% agree with that and I was always very pro uniform and making

1486
01:35:24.341 --> 01:35:25.810
sure that guys were squared away in their uniforms.

1487
01:35:25.811 --> 01:35:30.811
I was probably the one of the most stringent in the seal teams in the seal teams

1488
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:33.460
is not,
uniforms are not,

1489
01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:37.300
we're not real good at wear uniforms and looking good and uniforms and being

1490
01:35:37.301 --> 01:35:38.110
squared away in uniform.

1491
01:35:38.110 --> 01:35:41.320
So it's kind of hard for me to agree that that opens up the way for the

1492
01:35:41.321 --> 01:35:45.760
destruction of all uniformity.
But the lesson here is,

1493
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.130
is it more about the uniforms?
It's more about just,

1494
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.590
it's not what you preach it to what your dollar,
right?
Yeah.

1495
01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:54.930
That slippery slope situation.
Yes.
It is.

1496
01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.930
Well opening the ways that necessarily insuring something true.
True,

1497
01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:06.060
true.
I'll give it to you.
Technically.
You get me on the technicality sometimes.

1498
01:36:06.061 --> 01:36:09.720
That's fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
With that,
I'm plastic in my mind and I can,

1499
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:13.440
I can accept that plastic.
You know how some people say plastic like,

1500
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:16.560
oh that guys look plastic meaning like he's fake or something like that.

1501
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.500
This is for like,
like plasticity.
Yes,
absolutely.

1502
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:24.980
Written in 1950 before plastic was everything that we used.
Yeah.

1503
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:30.360
I used to have this theory that anything that was made of metal was better.

1504
01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.430
It just make everything of metal.

1505
01:36:32.431 --> 01:36:37.260
I wanted to make everything that was made metal.
Right.
Don't they see stuff?
That,

1506
01:36:37.261 --> 01:36:40.860
same thing about like food and Bacon.
I like anything with Bacon as best similar.

1507
01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.550
It's the same kind of thing would be correct.
Yeah.
Good.

1508
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:50.760
Back to the book.
No leader ever fails his men,
nor will they fail him.

1509
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:54.120
Who leads them in respect for the disciplined life.

1510
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:55.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1511
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:56.880
<v 0>Between these two things,</v>

1512
01:36:57.030 --> 01:37:00.810
discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military.

1513
01:37:00.811 --> 01:37:05.811
Value of discipline lies all the difference between military maturity and

1514
01:37:06.631 --> 01:37:07.464
mediocrity.

1515
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.400
A salute from an unwilling man is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a

1516
01:37:14.191 --> 01:37:15.024
tree.

1517
01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.210
It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by a gust of wind,

1518
01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.290
but a salute from the man who takes pride in the gesture because he feels

1519
01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:27.660
privileged to wear the uniform of the United States.

1520
01:37:27.810 --> 01:37:32.310
Having found the service good is the epitome of military virtue.

1521
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:37.913
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1522
01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:41.890
<v 0>Until men are severely tried,</v>

1523
01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:47.810
there is no conclusive test of their discipline nor proof that their training at

1524
01:37:48.031 --> 01:37:51.600
arms is satisfying a legitimate military end.

1525
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.980
Military forces relatively undisciplined until physically toughened and mentally

1526
01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:03.240
conditioned to unusual exertion.
Consider the road march.

1527
01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:09.250
No body of men could possibly enjoy the dust,
the heat,

1528
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:11.980
the blistered foot and the aching back,

1529
01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:17.340
but hard road marching is necessary if a sound foundation is to be built under

1530
01:38:17.831 --> 01:38:20.770
the discipline of fighting forces,

1531
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:25.830
particularly those whose labors are in the field and the gain comes quickly.

1532
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.720
The rise in spirits within any organization which is always to be observed after

1533
01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:37.020
they rebound from a hard marsh does not come essentially from the feeling of

1534
01:38:37.021 --> 01:38:38.940
relief that the strain is past.

1535
01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:44.100
But rather from the satisfaction that a goal has been crossed,

1536
01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:47.650
it must be accepted.

1537
01:38:47.651 --> 01:38:52.420
That discipline does not break down under the strain of placing a testing demand

1538
01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:53.620
upon the individual.

1539
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:59.520
It is sloppy off and not activity that destroys discipline.

1540
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:05.650
Think about that one.
So the,
it's not the strain,

1541
01:39:05.651 --> 01:39:08.080
it's not the pressure that you put that breaks down the discipline.

1542
01:39:08.081 --> 01:39:10.840
It's the laziness.
It's the slop that breaks discipline.

1543
01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.030
Troops can endure hard going when it serves an understandable end.

1544
01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.980
This is what they will boast about.
Mainly when the fatigue has ended,

1545
01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:24.790
a large part of training is necessarily directed toward conditioning them for

1546
01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:29.350
unusual hardship and privation.
They can take it in stride,

1547
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:33.910
but no power on earth can reconcile them to what common sense tells them is

1548
01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.320
unnecessary hardship,

1549
01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:39.460
which might have been avoided by greater intelligence in their superiors.

1550
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:42.970
So if you're telling people to do something and they realize that there's an

1551
01:39:42.971 --> 01:39:46.210
easier way to do it there,
they're going to be angry.

1552
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:49.330
When they are overloaded,

1553
01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.360
they know it when they were required to form a parade two hours ahead of time

1554
01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:57.940
because their commander got overanxious or didn't know how to write an order

1555
01:39:58.090 --> 01:39:58.720
again,

1556
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.550
they know it and they are perfectly right if they go sour because this kind of

1557
01:40:03.551 --> 01:40:06.400
thing happens a little too often within the command,

1558
01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:10.550
within our system,

1559
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:14.300
that discipline is nearest perfect,

1560
01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:19.540
which assures to the individual the greatest freedom of thought and action

1561
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:27.470
while at all times promoting his feeling of responsibility toward the group.

1562
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:29.911
The Greg,

1563
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:34.200
do you hear about the greatest form of discipline is the one that gives the

1564
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:37.830
greatest freedom of thought and action.
That's what we want.

1565
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1566
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:45.250
<v 0>Want the discipline equal freedom.
Hmm.
That's interesting.</v>

1567
01:40:45.251 --> 01:40:49.480
His take on like when you go through some hard stuff,

1568
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:54.100
the satisfaction isn't that it's over.
It's the fact that you did.
Absolutely.

1569
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.053
Yeah.
It's like,

1570
01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.240
<v 1>okay,</v>

1571
01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.310
<v 0>you know,
I told you my whole sleep thing.
Well,
he used to be worth,</v>

1572
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:02.430
if I didn't get my eight and a half hours,
I was done for the day.

1573
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:07.860
But so now let's say get two hours sleep and I'm like,

1574
01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:10.800
Hey,
I'm going to,
I'm going to still do this,
a workout,
whatever.

1575
01:41:10.801 --> 01:41:14.160
This conditioning something hard.
Sure.
It's going to be hard.
Sure.

1576
01:41:14.161 --> 01:41:15.780
I'm not looking forward to it,
but yeah,

1577
01:41:15.781 --> 01:41:19.740
the satisfaction is afterwards all even go how it said you're going to have

1578
01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:22.200
something to brag about or something like that.
That's true.

1579
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:25.080
You go and tell your friends,
hey,
I did this.

1580
01:41:25.110 --> 01:41:27.720
I only had two hours sleep natured anyways.
Yeah.

1581
01:41:27.721 --> 01:41:30.840
You do kind of have that feeling like you want to brag about it.
No doubt.

1582
01:41:30.841 --> 01:41:35.040
Like I did some hard stuff.
You know,
it's,
we shouldn't be surprised.

1583
01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:39.420
We're kind of getting excited when these things completely makes sense.
Yeah.

1584
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.970
These are the,
these are,

1585
01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.230
these are generals that knew and understand human nature.
Yeah.

1586
01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:50.170
And these are things that we look at and we learn.
We've experienced.
Yeah.

1587
01:41:50.610 --> 01:41:54.270
So it shouldn't come as a surprise.
Yeah.
I know.
It's crazy when you're,

1588
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.990
it's like tunnel vision.
You know where it will happen and you'd almost like,

1589
01:41:57.991 --> 01:42:00.060
you don't even realize it will happen.
Like everyone does that.

1590
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:03.120
Everyone does something that's hard for sure.
Gets through hard work day,

1591
01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.280
did something under the circumstances that they hate.

1592
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:08.610
They might even be complaining about it like all this was going on.

1593
01:42:08.611 --> 01:42:12.060
So such a stressful day.
But when you get it actually done,

1594
01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.050
you brag about it at the very least that you feel like you want to brag about it

1595
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.560
and keep that,
pursue that,
you know,
keep that up.

1596
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.660
Now there's some counter to that.
Here we go back to the book.

1597
01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.720
If the man is cramped by monotonous routine or made to feel that he cannot move

1598
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:32.070
unless an order as barked,

1599
01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.000
he can not develop these qualities and he will never come forward as a junior

1600
01:42:36.001 --> 01:42:39.540
leader.
So if you put too much discipline on somebody,
they're going to your grid,

1601
01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:43.100
crimp.
There's their leadership capabilities.
Say that all the time

1602
01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.770
in the words of do peak,
who saw so deeply into the hearts of fighting men.

1603
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:53.130
If one does not wish bonds broken,

1604
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:58.950
one should make them elastic and thereby strengthen them.

1605
01:43:01.410 --> 01:43:05.790
That's a guy he wrote.
He wrote a thing called the battle studies will actually,

1606
01:43:05.791 --> 01:43:10.320
he didn't finish right here cause he got killed in action fighting,
uh,

1607
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:11.723
fighting.

1608
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:17.940
<v 0>Napolli with he was,
he was a French fighting again,
the in the,</v>

1610
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:23.940
I want to say fighting oppressions,
but he egg another,
a great quote from him

1611
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:27.900
that I wrote down.
Nothing can be,
nothing.

1612
01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:32.901
Can wisely be prescribed an any army without exact knowledge of the fundamental

1613
01:43:33.811 --> 01:43:38.190
instrument of man and his State of mind,

1614
01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:43.570
his morale at the instant of combat.
So the,
you know,

1615
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.010
the peak is a guy that really started looking at the,
the mentality of guys,

1616
01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:51.803
<v 1>okay,</v>

1617
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:52.750
<v 5>we're going to have to get it.</v>

1618
01:43:52.751 --> 01:43:57.670
We're going to have to dive into him at some point.
Now speaking of morale,

1619
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.680
next section is about morale.
Uh,
World War II,
Blah.
Blue Jackets said it this way,

1620
01:44:03.681 --> 01:44:06.560
blue jackets term for navy guys said it this way.

1621
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:09.620
Morale was when your hands and feet keep working.

1622
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.780
When your head says it can't be done.

1623
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.360
The handiest beginning is to consider morale in conjunction with discipline.

1624
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.920
Since in military service they are opposite sides of the same coin.

1625
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.880
When one is present,
the other will also be there.

1626
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:32.270
Morale and discipline,
morale and discipline.
They go together.

1627
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.510
This is a familiar story.

1628
01:44:35.511 --> 01:44:38.960
It was repeated by the United States forces in World War II during the Normandy

1629
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:42.740
headrow fighting and the invasions of the central Pacific atolls.

1630
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.120
Troops had to learn the hard way,
how to hit,

1631
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:51.170
how to survive in moving through jungle or across mountains and the desert.

1632
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.000
When that happened,

1633
01:44:53.210 --> 01:44:57.650
the only disciplinary residue which mattered was obedience to orders.

1634
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:03.190
The movements they had learned by rote were of less value than the spiritual

1635
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:07.130
bond between one man and another.

1636
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:11.840
The most valuable lesson was that of mutual support.

1637
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:16.910
So this is awesome.
The moves,
the battle moves that they,

1638
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:17.960
that they've learned,

1639
01:45:17.961 --> 01:45:21.080
that they trained that were hard and put them through this hard work.
You know,

1640
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:23.180
getting ready to deploy overseas.
When they got overseas,

1641
01:45:23.181 --> 01:45:24.770
they were fighting in a hedgerow.
They never did that before.

1642
01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.510
They're fighting in the mountain.
They never did that before.

1643
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:28.040
So they had to take these,

1644
01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:30.500
these drills that they had learned to kind of throw them out the window.

1645
01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:35.510
So all they have left and the most valuable thing of all that training wasn't

1646
01:45:35.511 --> 01:45:36.680
the movements themselves.

1647
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.570
It was this spiritual bond between these men that was more important than the

1648
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:44.900
tactical maneuvers was the fact that they did hard training together and they

1649
01:45:44.901 --> 01:45:48.110
work together and they knew each other and they had that spiritual bond.

1650
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:49.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:54.290
<v 5>Back to the book in its essential discipline is not measured according to how a</v>

1652
01:45:54.291 --> 01:45:59.240
man keeps step in a drill yard or whether he salutes at just the right angle.

1653
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:02.240
The test is how well he willing,

1654
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:07.250
willingly response to his superiors and all vital matters.
And finally,

1655
01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.300
whether he stands or runs when his life is at stake.

1656
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:13.820
History makes this clear.

1657
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:18.970
There are countless examples of successful military forces which had almost no

1658
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:22.610
discipline when measured by the usual yardsticks,

1659
01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:28.060
yet had a high battle morale productive of the kind of discipline which beats

1660
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:32.690
the enemy in battle.
So that's another little dichotomy.

1661
01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.501
You know what he's talking about,

1662
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:36.500
like you might not be the most disciplined on the parade field,

1663
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:39.920
but if you've got that bond,
you've got that discipline bond,

1664
01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:42.440
you can still come up with the victory.

1665
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:47.180
This is important.
Back to the book,

1666
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.010
man is able to recognize a right and reasonable

1667
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.690
<v 0>discipline as such,</v>

1668
01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.530
even though it causes him personal inconvenience because he's he,

1669
01:46:55.830 --> 01:47:00.030
he has acquired a sense of military values,
but

1670
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.680
if it is either unduly harsh or unnecessarily lax,

1671
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:12.950
he likewise knows it and wears it as a hair shirt to the undoing of his morale.

1672
01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:21.040
Though the man like the group can be hurt by being pushed beyond sensible

1673
01:47:21.471 --> 01:47:25.640
limits,
his spirit will suffer even more sorely.

1674
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:29.660
If no real test is put upon his abilities and moral powers,

1675
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:34.820
the greater has intelligence,
the stronger will be his resentment.

1676
01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.980
That is the law of nature.

1677
01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:41.900
The enlightened mind has always the greatest measure of self discipline,

1678
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:47.350
but it also has a higher sense of what constitutes justice fairplay and a

1679
01:47:47.871 --> 01:47:51.080
reasonable requirement in the performance of duty.

1680
01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:57.240
If denied these things,
he will come to hold his chief,

1681
01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.600
his job and himself in contempt.

1682
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:02.303
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:03.880
<v 0>So if you get the,
if you're a military leader,</v>

1684
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:05.670
if you're a civilian leader and you get the idea,
okay,

1685
01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:08.110
Jack was talking about discipline.
Discipline's key.

1686
01:48:08.111 --> 01:48:12.120
So you're going to come in and just throw discipline on your people and burden

1687
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:14.100
them with this heavy realm of discipline.

1688
01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:18.840
It's not going to work out because everyone knows that it's unjust,
unfair,

1689
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.370
unnecessary.
We don't want that unnecessary discipline,

1690
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:27.300
but we embrace,
we might not outwardly,
but we deep inside,

1691
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:30.360
we embrace the hardcore discipline,
if it makes sense and has meeting.

1692
01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:31.413
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1693
01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.840
<v 0>Admiral Ben Morrill has stated a formula and understanding terms by his</v>

1694
01:48:40.841 --> 01:48:44.830
explanation of what made the CBS notable for competence and devotion to duty

1695
01:48:44.831 --> 01:48:47.650
during World War II.
What he said is this.

1696
01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.790
We used artisans to do the work for which they had been trained in civilian
life.

1697
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.850
They were well led by officers who spoke their language.

1698
01:48:55.970 --> 01:49:00.020
We made them feel that they were playing an important part,
integrated venture,

1699
01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.350
and thus they achieved a high standard of morale.

1700
01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:09.220
The elements underscored by Admiral Marril deserve special note satisfaction in

1701
01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:13.910
a work program.
Mutual confidence between leaders and ranks.

1702
01:49:14.150 --> 01:49:18.140
Conviction that all together we're striving for something more important than

1703
01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:20.930
themselves.
Talking about the CBS,

1704
01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.220
the construction battalions in the navy that do engineering work.

1705
01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:26.940
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

1706
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:30.630
<v 0>overseas and I actually had CBS with us in Ramadi that were awesome,</v>

1707
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:35.570
awesome guys that did everything for us.
They kept everything going,

1708
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:40.440
kept everything running,
kept everything working,
built everything that we used.

1709
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.060
Awesome guys.

1710
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.950
And every CB I've ever worked with has bit of just a just a beast.

1711
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:48.130
They have that attitude like

1712
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.650
<v 5>they know they're gonna make their,
their,
their motto is,</v>

1713
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:53.350
can do and believe me when you tell him to do something,

1714
01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.470
there are 100% of that motto right there.
They're going to make it happen.

1715
01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:02.410
Here we go back to the book talking about morale under training conditions or

1716
01:50:02.411 --> 01:50:05.770
were in combat,
the mental ills and the resulting morale,

1717
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:08.170
moral and physical deterioration,

1718
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:13.090
which sometimes be set military forces cannot be cured simply by the

1719
01:50:13.091 --> 01:50:17.570
intensification of disciplinary methods.
Can't just turn it up.
[inaudible].

1720
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:23.290
It is true that the signs of a recovery we'll sometimes attend the installation

1721
01:50:23.291 --> 01:50:27.760
of a more rigid or less rigid discipline that you can't just,

1722
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:28.960
you can't just go up or down.

1723
01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:34.570
The onset is in fact usually due to the collateral influence of an increased

1724
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:39.571
confidence in the command whereby men are made to feel that their own fortunes

1725
01:50:39.971 --> 01:50:41.170
are on the mend.

1726
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:47.310
Then discipline and morale are together revitalized almost as if by throwing in

1727
01:50:48.191 --> 01:50:51.940
electric switch in army history,

1728
01:50:51.941 --> 01:50:56.680
there's no better example of the working of this principle than the work of

1729
01:50:56.681 --> 01:51:01.270
Brigadier General Par Paul Be Malone.
He took over.

1730
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:06.420
This is World War One 1919 he took over command where slackness and indiscipline

1731
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:07.263
where general,

1732
01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:11.830
the men were suffering terrible privation and too many of their officers were

1733
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:16.000
indifferent to their needs.
Many of them had been battle casualties.

1734
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:19.210
Some had been discharged from hospitals before.
Their wounds were healed.

1735
01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:20.680
The mess was abominable.

1736
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.480
The camp was short of firewood and other supply in freezing weather.

1737
01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:28.960
Men were sleeping on the ground with only a pair of blankets,
a piece.

1738
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:31.840
The death toll from influenza,

1739
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:36.841
pneumonia and the aggravation of battle wounds rose daily despair and resentment

1740
01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:41.860
over these conditions began to express itself in semi violent form.

1741
01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:47.320
Every fresh breath of discipline was countered with harassing punishments until

1742
01:51:47.321 --> 01:51:51.100
an air of wretched stagnation hung over the whole camp.

1743
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.590
General Pershing visited the Bait,

1744
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:57.100
the base the men refuse to form for him.

1745
01:51:58.770 --> 01:52:01.270
Then the men were off to the generals coming in.
The men,

1746
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.440
we're not going to form up for him.

1747
01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:06.670
When he tried to address them at a mass meeting,
they wouldn't hear him out.

1748
01:52:07.150 --> 01:52:11.290
Instead of taking any action against the men he sent for General Malone,

1749
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:15.730
the new commander arrived without any instructions except to determine what was

1750
01:52:15.731 --> 01:52:18.880
wrong and correct it with soldierly instinct.

1751
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:24.150
He recognized that the indiscipline of the camp was an effect and not a cause,

1752
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:29.790
but even as he gave orders for leaving the physical distress of the men,

1753
01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:32.400
he demanded that they returned to orderly habits.

1754
01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:36.540
He walked around the areas already on his ordered on his orders.

1755
01:52:36.541 --> 01:52:40.650
Duck boards were being laid throughout the mud and the whole physical setup was

1756
01:52:40.651 --> 01:52:45.570
in a process of reorganization.
The men grown listless from weeks of mysteries,

1757
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:49.850
mistreatment paid.
No,
he'd get on your feet.
I'm your general,

1758
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:53.330
I respect you but I want you respect where his words,

1759
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.270
they restored the whole situation.

1760
01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:01.370
The first impact of this one man on the camp that was never forgotten by anyone

1761
01:53:01.371 --> 01:53:02.204
who saw it.

1762
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:08.350
It is a point to remember a firm hold at the beginning pays 10 fold dividend of

1763
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:13.040
the timid approach followed by a show of firmness.

1764
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:15.740
Later on within 48 hours,

1765
01:53:15.741 --> 01:53:20.390
the physical condition of the camp was showing improvement and 60,000 men were

1766
01:53:20.391 --> 01:53:24.110
again doing their duty and bearing themselves in a military manner.

1767
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:29.240
The lessons from this one incident stand out like beams from a search light

1768
01:53:29.241 --> 01:53:30.074
battery

1769
01:53:32.410 --> 01:53:33.243
<v 6>leadership.</v>

1770
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:41.480
<v 5>One man is able to accomplish a miracle by an act of will accompanied by good</v>

1771
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.314
works.

1772
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:48.490
The morale of the force flows from self discipline of the commander and in turn

1773
01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.700
the discipline of the force is reestablished by the upsurge of its moral power.

1774
01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.680
Another example here when the redeployment period which followed World War II

1775
01:54:01.681 --> 01:54:05.010
threatened to complete collapse to the morale of the general military

1776
01:54:05.011 --> 01:54:05.844
establishment.

1777
01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:10.970
The remedy attempted by some unit leaders was to relax discipline and the work

1778
01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:15.570
requirement all around other officer's met this crisis by improving the

1779
01:54:15.571 --> 01:54:16.650
conditions of work,

1780
01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:20.700
setting an example which proved to the men that they believed in its importance

1781
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:24.360
and paying such close attention to the personal problems of those within the

1782
01:54:24.361 --> 01:54:25.194
unit.

1783
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:29.820
They found that they could still get superior performance in the midst of chaos.

1784
01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:34.860
Organic strength materializes in the same way on the field of war.

1785
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:36.480
However,

1786
01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.480
adverse the general situation men will stick to the one man who knows what he

1787
01:54:41.881 --> 01:54:46.560
wants to do and welcomes them to a full share in the enterprise

1788
01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:51.811
leadership,

1789
01:54:51.811 --> 01:54:56.520
leadership and leadership most important thing on the battlefield

1790
01:55:00.810 --> 01:55:04.050
in the words of colonel g f r Henderson,

1791
01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.760
it is the leader who reckons with the human nature of his troops and of the

1792
01:55:08.761 --> 01:55:12.210
enemy rather than with their mere physical attributes.

1793
01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:14.610
Numbers are Mirman and the like.

1794
01:55:14.730 --> 01:55:18.690
Who can hope to follow in Napoleon's footsteps?
Got To know your people.

1795
01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:19.680
Got To know human nature.

1796
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:24.120
God know human nature is more important than physical.

1797
01:55:24.121 --> 01:55:26.270
It's more important than people that you got,
number of people you've got.

1798
01:55:26.271 --> 01:55:27.570
It's more important than their weapons.

1799
01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:29.533
<v 6>Human Nature.</v>

1800
01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:37.500
<v 5>There are a few governing principles and before considering their application in</v>

1801
01:55:37.501 --> 01:55:39.660
detail,
we should first think about the file.

1802
01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.220
So now we're talking about a god troop,
a soldier.
He is a man.

1803
01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:50.400
<v 0>He expects to be treated as an adult,
not a schoolboy.
He has rights.</v>

1804
01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:54.570
They must be made known to him and thereafter respected.

1805
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:55.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1806
01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:58.790
<v 0>He has ambition.
It must be stirred.</v>

1807
01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:03.470
He has a belief in fairplay.
It must be honored.

1808
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:09.250
He has the need of comradeship.
It must be supplied.

1809
01:56:10.210 --> 01:56:14.140
He has imagination.
It must be stimulated.

1810
01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.690
He has a personal sense of dignity.

1811
01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:19.360
It must not be broken down.

1812
01:56:20.650 --> 01:56:21.910
He has pride.

1813
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:27.430
It can be satisfied and made the bedrock of his character once he gains

1814
01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.170
assurance that he is playing a useful and respected part in a superior and

1815
01:56:32.171 --> 01:56:37.110
successful organization
to give men working as a group.

1816
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:41.880
That feeling of great accomplishment together is the acme of inspired

1817
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:46.000
leadership.
You could basically,

1818
01:56:46.001 --> 01:56:47.290
if you're going into a leadership position,

1819
01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:51.700
just read that to yourself every morning,
just what you,

1820
01:56:51.701 --> 01:56:55.480
what your subordinates are,
what they are a man.

1821
01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:58.840
Be Treated as an adult,
not a school boy.
Those are just

1822
01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:03.040
so important,
the way you view your troops.

1823
01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.620
And some people have a hard time with that.

1824
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:07.510
So when people have a hard time with that.

1825
01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.120
Next section is called knowing your job

1826
01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:22.090
in one of the,
in one of his little known passages,
Robert Louis Stevenson.
Yeah,

1827
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:23.960
that's the guy that wrote a doctor.

1828
01:57:23.961 --> 01:57:28.580
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and treasure island did the perfect portrait of the man who

1829
01:57:28.581 --> 01:57:32.480
finally failed at everything because he just never learned how to take hold of

1830
01:57:32.481 --> 01:57:34.610
his work.
It goes like this.

1831
01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:38.870
His career was one of unbroken shame.

1832
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:42.470
He did not drink.
He was exactly honest.

1833
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:47.690
He was never rude to his employer's yet he was everywhere,
discharged,

1834
01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:53.120
bringing no interest to his duties.
He brought no attention.

1835
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:59.660
His Day was a tissue of things neglected and things done.
A mess.

1836
01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:01.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1837
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.510
<v 0>And from place to place and from town to town.</v>

1838
01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:07.680
He carried the character of one thoroughly incompetent.

1839
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:13.340
That's how we started this conversation today and we started talking about doing

1840
01:58:13.341 --> 01:58:14.174
your job.

1841
01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:18.980
Now this is important just as a rough approximation,

1842
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:24.010
any officer's work should comprise about 50% execution and the other half study

1843
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:28.700
if he is to make the best use of his force,

1844
01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:35.020
the woods are loaded with go getters who claim they are men of action and

1845
01:58:35.151 --> 01:58:37.520
therefore have no need of books.

1846
01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:40.700
We're talking about studying what's the we're talking about,

1847
01:58:40.701 --> 01:58:45.610
we're talking about and studying and these guys that say that there's no need

1848
01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:46.444
for books.

1849
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.560
They are of the same bone and marrow as the drone who is always counseling half

1850
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:57.120
speed.
Don't sweat.
Just get by.

1851
01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:01.680
Extra work means short life,
you're better off if they don't notice you.

1852
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:05.910
This chat can be heard by anyone who cares to listen.

1853
01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.300
It's the old American invitation to mediocrity,

1854
01:59:11.070 --> 01:59:16.070
but not all wisdom is to be found in books and at no time is this more true than

1855
01:59:16.471 --> 01:59:18.330
one when one is breaking in.

1856
01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:23.600
What is expected of any novice in any field is that he will ask questions,

1857
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:28.410
smart ones if possible,
but if not,

1858
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:33.470
then questions of all kinds until he learns that there is no such item as

1859
01:59:33.481 --> 01:59:38.190
Reveley oil.
And that skirmish line doesn't come on spools.

1860
01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:42.990
So Reveley oil revenues,
when you wake up in the morning,

1861
01:59:42.991 --> 01:59:46.230
it's that an Reveley oil is something that doesn't actually exist,

1862
01:59:46.231 --> 01:59:49.230
but you'd say to a new guy,
hey,
we need to get some revenue oils for tomorrow.

1863
01:59:49.231 --> 01:59:50.610
Can you go down to supply and get it for me?

1864
01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:55.110
Or skirmish line of skirmish line is when you get online to engage the enemy,

1865
01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:57.540
you don't mind in put your guns in the same direction.

1866
01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:02.190
That's called a skirmish line.
Well,
he said,
hey,
we need a spool,
a skirmish line.

1867
02:00:02.191 --> 02:00:02.581
Could Echo,

1868
02:00:02.581 --> 02:00:05.700
can you run down to the supply department and get us as a role of skirmish line?

1869
02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:07.410
So you know,
just kind of like little practical jokes,

1870
02:00:07.411 --> 02:00:09.720
but his point is here and people ask me this,
them where you will.

1871
02:00:09.721 --> 02:00:12.900
I just checked in and I'm just taking over as leader.
I'm just,
I'm a new officer.

1872
02:00:12.901 --> 02:00:15.840
I'm getting commissioned.
What should I do?
How should I lead?
Ask questions.

1873
02:00:15.841 --> 02:00:18.120
There's nothing wrong with it.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1874
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:21.911
Back to the book,

1875
02:00:21.911 --> 02:00:26.911
wisdom begins at the point of understanding that there is nothing shameful about

1876
02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.080
ignorance.

1877
02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:34.810
It is shameful only when a man would rather remain in that state than

1878
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:37.660
cultivating other men's knowledge.
Boom.

1879
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:41.830
There's never any reason why you should hesitate for it is better to be

1880
02:00:41.831 --> 02:00:46.090
embarrassed from seeking counsel than to be found short for not having sought
it.

1881
02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.940
Ideally,
any officers should be able to do the work of any man under him.

1882
02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:58.190
However,

1883
02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:02.990
it is obviously absurd to expect that any officer could know more about radio

1884
02:01:02.991 --> 02:01:04.310
repair than his repairman.

1885
02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:08.390
More about mapping then as Carter Carter garage goal section.

1886
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:13.570
More about moving parts that are gunsmith more about radar that a specialist in

1887
02:01:14.991 --> 02:01:18.380
electronics and more about cipher than a cryptographer.

1888
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:24.430
The distinction lies in the difference between the power to do a thing well and

1889
02:01:24.431 --> 02:01:27.070
that of being able to judge when it is done well.

1890
02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.680
A man can say a book is bad though.
Not knowing how to write one himself.

1891
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:37.480
Provided he is a student of literature though he has never laid an egg.

1892
02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:40.040
You can pass fair on an

1893
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.390
<v 5>Omelet.
So this is another thing,</v>

1894
02:01:44.391 --> 02:01:46.460
you know you're knocked the know everything.
As a leader,

1895
02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.710
you know that I know as much about sniper sniping as my snipers didn't even know

1896
02:01:51.711 --> 02:01:55.520
clothes.
No heart.
You know that I know as much about it.
Just like he said,

1897
02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.720
I'm not as much about the radios.
Is My radio mended?
No,
no.

1898
02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.900
Close to what they knew.
You don't need to know everything,

1899
02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:06.740
but you have to have an understanding of it and you have to at least be able to

1900
02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:09.050
understand when something is being done right or wrong.

1901
02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:16.500
This is another good point.
We can ponder the words of William Hazlitt,

1902
02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:21.650
a man who's shrinks from a collision with his equals or superiors will soon sink

1903
02:02:21.871 --> 02:02:26.700
below himself.
We improve by trying our strength with others,

1904
02:02:26.970 --> 02:02:28.290
not by showing it off.

1905
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:30.510
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1906
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:33.660
<v 5>so you can't be afraid to bring stuff up to your superiors.</v>

1907
02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:35.790
Do you gotta be respectful?
Yes you do.

1908
02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:40.860
But instead of just being a yes man,
don't be that.

1909
02:02:41.730 --> 02:02:42.780
Now this next section,

1910
02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:47.613
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1911
02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.830
<v 5>scald writing and speaking,</v>

1912
02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:53.850
all other things being equal,

1913
02:02:53.851 --> 02:02:58.830
a superior rating will invariably be given to the officer who is preserved in

1914
02:02:58.831 --> 02:03:02.820
his studies of the art of self expression.

1915
02:03:03.330 --> 02:03:07.290
While his colleague who attaches little importance to what may be achieved

1916
02:03:07.291 --> 02:03:10.830
through working with the language will be marked for mediocrity.

1917
02:03:12.130 --> 02:03:15.670
So we're talking about reading and speaking,
writing and speaking

1918
02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:20.910
as the British statesmen Disraeli put it,

1919
02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:26.150
men govern with words within the military.

1920
02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:30.410
Establishment Command is exercised through what is set,

1921
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:36.010
which commands attention and understanding and through what is a written which

1922
02:03:36.351 --> 02:03:38.270
directs,
explains,

1923
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:43.390
interprets or informs battles are won through the ability of men to express

1924
02:03:46.281 --> 02:03:50.780
concrete ideas in clear and unmistakable language.

1925
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:59.140
Battles are won through clear and unmistakable language.

1926
02:03:59.170 --> 02:04:01.780
That's how battles were won back to the book.

1927
02:04:01.781 --> 02:04:06.730
All administration is carried forward along the chain of command by the power of

1928
02:04:06.731 --> 02:04:11.560
men to make their thoughts articulate and available to others.

1929
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:17.310
There is no way under the sun that this basic condition can be altered once the

1930
02:04:19.261 --> 02:04:22.770
point is granted,
any officer should be ready to accept its corollary.

1931
02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:26.100
That superior qualification in the use of language,

1932
02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:30.960
both as to the written and the spoken word is more essential to military

1933
02:04:30.961 --> 02:04:35.250
leadership.
The knowledge of the whole technique of weapons handling.

1934
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.340
So when people ask me why I studied English in college,

1935
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:43.860
this is why I studied English in college.

1936
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.233
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1937
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.520
<v 5>Some men will take refuge in the excuse offered by the great majority.</v>

1938
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:57.870
I'm just a simple fighting file with no gift for writing or speaking.

1939
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:04.500
That is the mark of an officer who has no ambition to properly qualify himself

1940
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:08.610
and is seeking to justify his own laziness.

1941
02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:15.270
And the reason he's saying that is because he thinks that you can become a good

1942
02:05:15.271 --> 02:05:18.570
writer back to the book writers are self made,

1943
02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:24.710
but it is a reasonable speculation that history might never have heard of.

1944
02:05:24.841 --> 02:05:28.860
The greater number of these men had they not work,

1945
02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:33.890
said jealously to become proficient with the pen as well as with the sword.

1946
02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:37.700
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1947
02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:42.560
<v 5>Men who command words to serve their thoughts and feelings are well on their way</v>

1948
02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:46.190
to commanding men to serve their purposes.

1949
02:05:47.090 --> 02:05:52.090
All senior commanders respect the junior who has a faculty for thinking an idea

1950
02:05:54.591 --> 02:05:58.970
through and then expressing it comprehensively and clear unvarnished phases.

1951
02:05:59.270 --> 02:06:02.000
So you're young,
young leader out there,
young trooper.

1952
02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:06.980
Think about improving your method of fault.

1953
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:09.770
Think about making your speech more clear.

1954
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:16.940
Any man who has the brain to qualify for commission can make of himself a

1955
02:06:16.941 --> 02:06:21.770
competent writer because of natural limitations.
He may never excel in this art,

1956
02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:25.610
but if he has had average schooling,
knows how to open a dictionary,

1957
02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:29.480
can find his way to the library and is willing to commit himself to long study

1958
02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:32.120
and practice,
particularly in non duty hours.

1959
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:37.280
And we'll finally free himself from the superstition that writing is a game only

1960
02:06:37.281 --> 02:06:38.300
for specialists.

1961
02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:43.460
He can acquire all the skill that is necessary to further his advanced within

1962
02:06:43.461 --> 02:06:48.380
the military profession.
But where should work begin?

1963
02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:50.450
How about a little practical advice?

1964
02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:55.460
The only way to learn to write is to write.

1965
02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:01.490
That's it.
There is no other secret other than hard,

1966
02:07:01.850 --> 02:07:03.650
unremitting practice.

1967
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:09.940
Most writers at the start are mentally muscle bound and poorly coordinated bath

1968
02:07:10.661 --> 02:07:14.930
thoughts in their head.
They can,
they think they can develop them clearly,

1969
02:07:14.931 --> 02:07:16.670
but when they tried to apply,

1970
02:07:16.671 --> 02:07:20.510
I'll largely dormant vocabulary to the expression of these thoughts.

1971
02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:25.010
The result is stiff and self conscience self-conscious.

1972
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:30.850
The only cure for this is constant mental exercise with one's pen or over one's

1973
02:07:33.051 --> 02:07:33.884
typewriter.

1974
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:35.820
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1975
02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:38.970
<v 5>the discipline through which one learns to write,</v>

1976
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:44.000
add substance to thought whereby one's ideas are given body and connection.

1977
02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:49.710
Such common faults as worriness overstatement,

1978
02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:54.770
faulty sentence structure and week use of words are gradually corrected with

1979
02:07:56.431 --> 02:07:58.860
their passing confidence grows.

1980
02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:01.830
This does not mean however,

1981
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:07.140
that the task becomes easy so you can get better at this game.

1982
02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:10.350
You just gotta practice kind of like getting better at pull ups.

1983
02:08:10.351 --> 02:08:14.460
I get it better at pull ups.
Pull ups.
Now this is interesting.

1984
02:08:14.461 --> 02:08:17.190
Speaking of a reading and or speaking of writing,

1985
02:08:17.191 --> 02:08:20.730
now we're getting into reading a little bit here.
This is good.

1986
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:26.550
It is a good habit to underscore passages and books which have contributed

1987
02:08:26.551 --> 02:08:31.440
something vital to one's own fought.
So break out the highlighters.

1988
02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:38.040
I kind of laughed when I read that because I have a lot of highlighters and I

1989
02:08:38.041 --> 02:08:41.490
use them all.
Thank you.
Went Winchester on a couple of that idea.
That's right.

1990
02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:46.140
Now this is talking to going back to writing again.

1991
02:08:46.141 --> 02:08:49.680
As a practical matter is better to concentrate on a few elementary rules of

1992
02:08:49.681 --> 02:08:54.570
thumb such as are contained in the following list than to bog down attempting to

1993
02:08:54.571 --> 02:08:59.571
heed everything that the pendants have said about how to become a writer.

1994
02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:03.240
So here's some advice on writing and you'll notice that these are good advice on

1995
02:09:03.241 --> 02:09:06.990
life.
The more simply a thing is said,

1996
02:09:07.050 --> 02:09:12.050
the more powerfully it influences those who read plain words make strong

1997
02:09:12.361 --> 02:09:13.194
writing.

1998
02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:19.100
There is always one best word to convey a thought or a feeling to accept a

1999
02:09:19.141 --> 02:09:24.141
weaker substitute rather than to search for the right word will deprive any

2000
02:09:24.211 --> 02:09:25.650
writing of force.

2001
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:30.360
Economy of words invigorates composition

2002
02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:35.280
and all writing.
But in military writing particularly,

2003
02:09:35.730 --> 02:09:40.680
there is no excuse for vague terminology or phrases which do not convey an exact

2004
02:09:40.681 --> 02:09:45.681
expression of what was done or what is intended and just think about how you

2005
02:09:46.561 --> 02:09:50.670
communicate with your subordinates and think about these rules.
So impactful.

2006
02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:53.700
This is a good one.

2007
02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:58.730
It is better at all times to reign in the strength of military writing like the

2008
02:09:59.671 --> 02:10:03.810
soundness of military operations does not gain through overstatement and

2009
02:10:03.811 --> 02:10:07.500
artificial coloring.
The bigger the subject,

2010
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:10.050
the less it needs embroidery.

2011
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.020
Now he's going to start talking here.

2012
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:16.960
Go from talking about writing to talk about speaking.

2013
02:10:19.450 --> 02:10:24.450
A majority of the world's most gifted writers would in all probability be dumb

2014
02:10:24.451 --> 02:10:29.451
struck if put before an audience though dealing confidently with ideas.

2015
02:10:29.681 --> 02:10:32.890
They lacked the confidence when dealing with people.

2016
02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:39.020
The military officer has need of both talents and as to where the accent should

2017
02:10:39.811 --> 02:10:43.620
be placed.
It is probably more important that he should speak well.

2018
02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:47.610
Then his writing prose should be polished.

2019
02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.520
A unit commander may permit a clerk or a subordinate to do the greater part of

2020
02:10:53.521 --> 02:10:57.240
his paperwork either because his own time is taken with other duties are because

2021
02:10:57.241 --> 02:10:58.410
he is awkward at it.

2022
02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:03.180
But if he permits any other voice to dominate the councils of the organization,

2023
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.950
he soon ceases to exercise moral authority over it.

2024
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:13.910
So you got to be confident in your speaking a little bit more important than the

2025
02:11:14.551 --> 02:11:17.590
writing.
Cause you can have your guys do some writing.
Get the apple,
I'll sign it.

2026
02:11:17.610 --> 02:11:18.540
Looks good to me.

2027
02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:23.890
<v 4>This guy,
uh,
one of the bosses I had both of that.</v>

2028
02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:28.900
Oh so he'd always misused words like almost to the point where you know how some

2029
02:11:28.901 --> 02:11:30.600
comedians will do that.
They'll miss you.

2030
02:11:30.601 --> 02:11:32.610
Like [inaudible] does that a lot of time,
but yeah,

2031
02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:35.830
by this guy would for real do it.
Cause he didn't,

2032
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:38.560
but you know what it was is you know how the King Guy who's,

2033
02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:43.830
they want to try to sound smart basically and not a good idea.

2034
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:47.910
So he would use the word like irreguardless.

2035
02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.730
He would say it regardless as opposed to regardless.

2036
02:11:50.731 --> 02:11:52.260
And then there's another one that,

2037
02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:56.370
it's so funny because it's so counterproductive because when he would talk and

2038
02:11:56.371 --> 02:11:59.010
we'd all be holding in our laughter,
and I had worked with this other guy,

2039
02:12:00.210 --> 02:12:03.240
he was the king,
got relentless jokes,
you know,
when you're gone.

2040
02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.470
So if you did something,
and in this case you'd misused words when he leaves,

2041
02:12:07.471 --> 02:12:10.470
brother jokes would come in,
he'd be just so funny.
But nonetheless,
he would use,

2042
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:14.150
um,
be hoof,
you know,
be who like it would be who.
Yeah,

2043
02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.440
I think it is.
Behoof oh,
you're right behind.
That's what I thought.
Anyway.

2044
02:12:19.441 --> 02:12:21.960
I though that's a whole nother thing.
But anyway,
behoove then,

2045
02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:24.840
so he would misuse that word.
He would,

2046
02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:30.480
he thought it meant what he thought it meant baffling.
Like,
Oh,
you know,

2047
02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:33.660
what really behooves me is that they do it this way and then he,

2048
02:12:33.661 --> 02:12:37.020
but he keep doing it,
you know,
and um,
so anyway,

2049
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:41.430
the point there is where you Kinda,
you gotta know how to talk.
Right?
So,

2050
02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:42.850
<v 3>okay.</v>

2051
02:12:42.850 --> 02:12:44.020
<v 4>And in this case,
this was,</v>

2052
02:12:44.050 --> 02:12:48.140
this wasn't like some high level like speeches he was making or address.

2053
02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:51.220
It was just like normal stuff.
So bright.

2054
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:56.470
I thought that that was kind of critical in the way.
Like we regarded him as a,

2055
02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:59.650
that was one of the meat,
like major things where it's like,
Bro,

2056
02:12:59.651 --> 02:13:02.800
we can't even take this guy seriously.
Yeah.
Cause he,

2057
02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:04.140
he behooves me with everything.

2058
02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:10.890
Oh Lord.
Wrong usage.
It's okay.
People,
yeah it was not okay.

2059
02:13:11.050 --> 02:13:12.220
I guess the point there,

2060
02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.760
a Norris separate point is learn the words before you start trying to throw him

2061
02:13:17.791 --> 02:13:21.960
out I guess.
And that goes back to what you're saying.
That would be very,
yeah,

2062
02:13:21.961 --> 02:13:24.780
that'd be who,
what you were saying about,
um,
uh,

2063
02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.000
it's better to seek then or be seek the knowledge and be embarrassed cause you

2064
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:31.980
gotta seek rather than get it

2065
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.670
<v 5>called out when you don't know it or whatever.
Anyway.
Yeah.</v>

2066
02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:39.570
That's what he was doing
back to the book.

2067
02:13:39.690 --> 02:13:44.690
The matter of nerve is a main element in speaking when an officer's ill at ease,

2068
02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:48.360
fidgety and not to the point,

2069
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:52.110
the vote of his command for the time being is no confidence.

2070
02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:53.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2071
02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:57.830
<v 5>And so long as he remains that way,
they will not change.
No matter though,</v>

2072
02:13:57.831 --> 02:14:02.000
his goodwill shines forth through in other acts,

2073
02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:03.350
so it says what you just said.

2074
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:07.430
Someone's jacked up when they're trying to talk to you and talk to the group.

2075
02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:10.990
You're,
your vote is no confidence.
Yeah.
That's a comfortable road

2076
02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:17.450
as this is a good good.
Back to the book.

2077
02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.750
As for how an officer to talk to his men,

2078
02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:24.410
his manner and tone should be no different than if you were addressing his

2079
02:14:24.411 --> 02:14:26.480
fellow officers or for that matter,

2080
02:14:26.630 --> 02:14:30.440
a group is the intellectual and political peers from any walk of life.

2081
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:36.180
If he is stuffy,
he will not succeed.
If he affects a superior manner,

2082
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:39.720
that is a mark of his inferiority.

2083
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.790
If he is patronizing and talks to grown men as a teacher might talk to a class

2084
02:14:44.791 --> 02:14:46.110
of adolescence,

2085
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:50.670
the rug figuratively will be pulled out from under him.

2086
02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:55.340
His audience,
where we put down,
we'll put him down as a chump,

2087
02:14:56.540 --> 02:15:00.890
is curiously the case that the junior officer who can't get the right pitch when

2088
02:15:00.891 --> 02:15:05.510
he talks to the ranks will also be out of tune.
When he talks to his superiors,

2089
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:11.030
this failing is a sign mainly that he needs practice in the school of human

2090
02:15:11.031 --> 02:15:11.864
nature.

2091
02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.390
By listening a little more carefully to other men,

2092
02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:21.250
he may find he may himself in time attain maturity.

2093
02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:25.150
Another good way to get better at speaking is by listening.

2094
02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:27.910
<v 1>No doubt</v>

2095
02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:34.390
<v 5>when you're speaking,
sometimes you're instructing.
And one of the,</v>

2096
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:37.990
one of the pieces here is called the art of instruction.

2097
02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:39.320
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2098
02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.810
<v 5>Because you spent so much time when you're in a leadership position,</v>

2099
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:44.360
you're instructing people whether you realize or not,
you're instructing people,

2100
02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:47.300
here's the rules that they say to follow.
Keep it simple.

2101
02:15:47.690 --> 02:15:51.920
Have but one main object.
Stay on the course,
remain cheerful,

2102
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:53.450
be enthusiastic,

2103
02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:58.480
put it out as if the ideas were as interesting and novel to you as to your

2104
02:15:58.551 --> 02:15:59.384
audience.

2105
02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:05.830
Now this is a story which really dawn on,
you know,
it has to do with instruction,

2106
02:16:05.831 --> 02:16:06.770
but it's cool story.

2107
02:16:06.771 --> 02:16:11.470
So I'm gonna read it anyways because it's just bad ass in World War One and

2108
02:16:11.471 --> 02:16:12.820
American major name.

2109
02:16:12.821 --> 02:16:17.470
Now long forgotten was given the task of making the realms and talking to all

2110
02:16:17.471 --> 02:16:20.860
combat formations and convincing them that the future was bright.

2111
02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:24.970
No boy scout errands.
So you mentioned new World War One,

2112
02:16:24.971 --> 02:16:29.971
we've talked about that it's a nightmare and he's his is to go around and ensure

2113
02:16:30.821 --> 02:16:33.550
people that the future's bright,
but wherever he went,

2114
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:38.440
morale was lifted by his words.
It's substance in substance.

2115
02:16:38.441 --> 02:16:39.940
What he said was this [inaudible]

2116
02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:45.790
none of us cares about making a living with any individuals who wants every

2117
02:16:45.791 --> 02:16:46.990
break his own way.

2118
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:52.420
But when the odds are even to gamble is worth any good man's time.

2119
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:57.340
So let's look at the proportion.
You now have one chance in two.

2120
02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:01.480
You may go overseas or you may not.
Suppose you do.

2121
02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:05.860
You still have one chance in two.
You may go to the front or you may not.

2122
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:10.480
If you don't,
you'll see a foreign country at Uncle Sam's expense.
If you do,

2123
02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:15.310
you'll find out about war,
which is the toughest chance of the mall.

2124
02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:19.930
But up there on the front,
you still have one chance.

2125
02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:23.410
In two you may get hit or you may not.

2126
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:28.630
If you breeze through it,
you'll be a better man for all the rest of your life.

2127
02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:33.430
And if you get hit,
you still have one chance in two,

2128
02:17:34.570 --> 02:17:39.280
you may get a small wound and become a hero to your friends and family,

2129
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:45.070
or there was always the last chance that it may take you out all together.

2130
02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.890
And while that is a little rugged,

2131
02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:53.590
it is at least worth remembering that very few people seem to get out of this

2132
02:17:53.591 --> 02:17:54.730
life alive.

2133
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:59.140
Classic classic.

2134
02:18:01.510 --> 02:18:02.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2135
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:04.190
<v 5>Now,
talking about reading,</v>

2136
02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:10.240
Napoleon once said that the point that the trouble with books is that one must

2137
02:18:10.851 --> 02:18:15.230
read so many bad ones to find something really good,
true enough.

2138
02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:16.340
But even so,

2139
02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.510
there are perfectly practical ways to advance rapidly without undue wasted

2140
02:18:20.511 --> 02:18:23.740
motion.
Consider this among one superiors.

2141
02:18:23.741 --> 02:18:27.500
There were always discriminating men who have adopted a few good books after

2142
02:18:27.501 --> 02:18:29.270
reading many,
many bad ones.

2143
02:18:30.290 --> 02:18:32.870
When they say that a text is worthwhile,

2144
02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:36.020
it deserves reading and careful study.

2145
02:18:38.090 --> 02:18:42.170
So what books did somebody you respect,
read?
They say it's a good book.

2146
02:18:42.171 --> 02:18:44.660
Read it now you gotta be careful because,

2147
02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.593
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2148
02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:48.613
<v 5>because of this,</v>

2149
02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:53.360
the well-read man need not have more than a dozen books in his home provided

2150
02:18:53.361 --> 02:18:57.560
that they all count with him and he continues to pour over them and ponder the

2151
02:18:57.561 --> 02:19:00.590
weight of what is said.
On the other hand,

2152
02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:05.540
the ignorant man is frequently marked by his bookshelf stocked with titles,

2153
02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:10.960
not one of which suggests that he has any professional discernment.

2154
02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:15.170
Now,
I can tell you right now,
I'm building a library of books.

2155
02:19:15.171 --> 02:19:18.770
That's kind of crazy.
Um,
because every time somebody calls,

2156
02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:23.090
every time somebody hits me up on social media and says,
hey,

2157
02:19:23.091 --> 02:19:24.080
you gotta check out this pocket,

2158
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:28.310
I used to like go on Amazon and kind of look read reviews.
Now I just order

2159
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:29.390
<v 0>it,
right?
I mean,</v>

2160
02:19:29.391 --> 02:19:33.200
it basically order it because I don't have time and it's hard to tell from the

2161
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:38.090
reviews and it takes much time.
It's easier just to press,
click,
buy.
Now Amazon,

2162
02:19:38.091 --> 02:19:41.650
I'm clicking through the Jocko podcast store website.
So we're,

2163
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:44.270
we're giving back to the,
to the,
uh,
to the podcast.

2164
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:49.070
But the thing is,
a lot of people might think this book is great,

2165
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:53.700
all of this would be a great book,
but it doesn't quite work,
you know?

2166
02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:57.680
So I'm probably getting,
I'd say one out of every five books that I ordered,

2167
02:19:57.681 --> 02:20:02.460
do I say,
yeah,
this one's this one's game.
Yeah.
What he's saying there about,
um,

2168
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:07.700
the difference between somebody who has a huge stock of books,

2169
02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:11.550
is he seeing like a variety variety of different books that doesn't end.

2170
02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.850
It said something about not indicating any kind of expertise or something just

2171
02:20:14.851 --> 02:20:17.480
says he did.
It just shows that he doesn't have any discernment.

2172
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:20.390
This guy just buying or much of books and might not know anything about them.

2173
02:20:20.391 --> 02:20:24.470
It doesn't mean it.
Don't judge a book by its cover,
Pun intended,
you know,

2174
02:20:24.471 --> 02:20:27.530
just cause this guy's got a bunch of books,
doesn't mean that he's read them all.

2175
02:20:27.531 --> 02:20:31.460
Doesn't mean that he actually,
oh,
they're all great books really.

2176
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:34.360
I can tell you right now.
And they're an all great books in the world.
Yeah.

2177
02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:37.940
A lot of books are not good and you shouldn't waste your time reading them.

2178
02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:40.550
But if I,
if you walked into a guy that was smart that you respect,

2179
02:20:40.551 --> 02:20:42.170
he get 12 bucks.
Right?
Right.

2180
02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:44.210
I would just write them all down and go buy them all.

2181
02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:48.560
And you're probably going to be 10 for 12 for 12.
Yeah.
Or at least 10 for 12.

2182
02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:49.070
Yeah.

2183
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:54.070
Whereas if I go into your room and you've got 570 bucks in there and go,

2184
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:57.200
yeah,
these are all great books.
There's something wrong with your discernment.

2185
02:20:57.201 --> 02:20:58.850
You don't know what a good book is.
Yeah.

2186
02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.480
So get some discernment or I'm just trying to make,

2187
02:21:02.481 --> 02:21:05.310
like I read so much to the length of life,

2188
02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:10.310
uh,
this,
this section,

2189
02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:12.890
your relationships with your men.

2190
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:14.323
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2191
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:16.070
<v 0>And I had to break,</v>

2192
02:21:16.071 --> 02:21:20.840
I had to say this park and officer's not expected to appear all wise to those

2193
02:21:20.841 --> 02:21:24.170
who serve under him.
So often guys feel that pressure that they think should,

2194
02:21:24.171 --> 02:21:26.400
they should know everything.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
No.

2195
02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:28.310
If I admit that I don't know this,
I'm going to look bad.

2196
02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:31.340
Bluffing one's way through a question.

2197
02:21:31.341 --> 02:21:35.540
When ignorant of the answer is foolhardy business.
I'm sorry,
but I don't know.

2198
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:37.460
It's just as appropriate from an officer's lips.

2199
02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:42.140
It's from any other and it helps a little more to add,
but I'll find out.

2200
02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:47.000
Rank should be used to serve one subordinates.

2201
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:50.600
It should never be flaunted or used to get the upper hand of a subordinate.

2202
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:55.630
Any situation save where he is already discredited himself in an unusually ugly

2203
02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:57.890
or unseemingly manner.

2204
02:21:59.270 --> 02:22:01.850
When suggestions from any subordinate or adopted,

2205
02:22:01.851 --> 02:22:04.250
the credit should be passed on to him publicly.

2206
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.320
When a subordinate made a mistake but not from any lack of goodwill,

2207
02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:13.580
it is common sense to take the rap for him rather than make him suffer doubly

2208
02:22:13.581 --> 02:22:18.581
for his error and officer should not issue orders which he cannot enforce.

2209
02:22:20.130 --> 02:22:25.130
He should be as good as his word at all times and in any circumstance he should

2210
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:30.570
<v 5>promise nothing which he cannot make stick and officer should not work.</v>

2211
02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:32.070
Looking over his men shoulders,

2212
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:35.850
checking on every detail of what they're doing and calling them to account at

2213
02:22:35.851 --> 02:22:37.590
every for long past

2214
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:44.470
this mainly Lee attitude corrodes confidence and destroys initiatives that don't

2215
02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:47.200
micromanage.
On the other hand,

2216
02:22:47.410 --> 02:22:49.690
contact is necessary at all times,

2217
02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:54.430
particularly when men are doing long term work or operating in a detachment.

2218
02:22:54.431 --> 02:22:55.420
At a remote point,

2219
02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:58.720
they will become discouraged and we'll lose their sense of direction unless

2220
02:22:58.721 --> 02:23:00.700
they're superior.
Looks in on them.

2221
02:23:00.701 --> 02:23:05.701
Periodically ask them whether he can be of any help and so doing gets them to

2222
02:23:06.341 --> 02:23:09.040
open up the discussion and the problem.

2223
02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:14.910
The navy says,
this is another good,
another good one right here.

2224
02:23:15.930 --> 02:23:20.930
The navy says it isn't courtesy to change the set of the sail within 30 minutes

2225
02:23:21.451 --> 02:23:25.290
after the relief of watch applied to command job.

2226
02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:29.580
This means that is a mistake for an officer on taking a new post to order

2227
02:23:29.581 --> 02:23:33.990
sweeping changes affecting the other men in the belief that this will give him a

2228
02:23:33.991 --> 02:23:36.300
reputation for action and firmness.

2229
02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:42.080
The studying of the situation is the overture of the steadying of it.

2230
02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:43.390
<v 3>Okay?</v>

2231
02:23:43.390 --> 02:23:48.390
<v 5>The story is told of General Curtis Lemay of the Air Force taking over the 21st</v>

2232
02:23:48.821 --> 02:23:53.821
bomber command and in the Mariana's he faced the worried staff officers of his

2233
02:23:53.981 --> 02:23:58.210
predecessor and said,
quietly,
you're all staying put.

2234
02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:01.930
I assume you know your jobs or you wouldn't be here.

2235
02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:06.580
Pretty simple.
Then people always ask,
come into Neil,

2236
02:24:06.581 --> 02:24:10.660
what do I do when I take over?
Relax,
be humble,
listen,
observe.

2237
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:13.990
Don't need to jump in there and change the set of the sail or an echo is gone.

2238
02:24:13.991 --> 02:24:17.590
Now I'm in charge.
Change everything.
No wrong answer.

2239
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:23.960
This next section,
your men's morale,
moral and physical welfare.

2240
02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:26.150
When men are moral,

2241
02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:31.180
the moral power which binds them together and fits them for high action is given

2242
02:24:31.611 --> 02:24:33.620
its main chance for success.

2243
02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:41.550
Now listen to these to be temperate in all things,

2244
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:46.910
to be continent and refrain from loose living of any sort are acts of the will.

2245
02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:52.080
They require self denial and the foregoing of that,

2246
02:24:52.081 --> 02:24:56.880
which may be more attractive in favor of the thing which should be done.

2247
02:24:57.900 --> 02:24:58.340
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2248
02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:01.760
<v 5>Granted there are a few individuals who are so thin blooded that they never feel</v>

2249
02:25:01.761 --> 02:25:05.620
tempted to digress morally.
Men and mud,

2250
02:25:05.621 --> 02:25:07.150
the majority are not like that.

2251
02:25:07.151 --> 02:25:09.760
So there's some guys that just on the straight narrow,
they're so,

2252
02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:13.630
they're so thin blooded that they just,
they get no temptations.

2253
02:25:14.350 --> 02:25:17.710
Most men,
they get temptations.
What they were announcing,

2254
02:25:17.711 --> 02:25:22.711
the name of self discipline at the cost of the considerably and considerable

2255
02:25:22.810 --> 02:25:27.370
inner.
They endeavor to compensate by gains in their personal character.

2256
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:30.460
Making that grade isn't easy,

2257
02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:35.580
but no one who is anyone has yet said that it isn't worthwhile in the armed

2258
02:25:37.391 --> 02:25:37.901
services.

2259
02:25:37.901 --> 02:25:41.770
They're an old saying that an officer without character is more useless than a

2260
02:25:41.771 --> 02:25:46.630
ship with no bottom.
In summing up,
the strength of will,

2261
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:52.090
which enables a man to lead a clean life is no different than the strength of

2262
02:25:52.091 --> 02:25:56.590
purpose,
which fits him to follow a hard line of duty.

2263
02:25:57.730 --> 02:25:59.440
There are exceptions to every rule.

2264
02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:04.150
Many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.

2265
02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:09.500
But even though he had an uncomparable unconquerable weakness for drinking,

2266
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.350
women has resolution had to become steeled along some other line or we would

2267
02:26:14.351 --> 02:26:17.290
have been no good when the pay off came.

2268
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:19.660
So this is,
you know,

2269
02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.880
saying that the strength of will that it takes to stay strong and all of these

2270
02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:28.450
situations,
all these temptations that that will,
is,

2271
02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:31.750
is real and that can transfer over it.

2272
02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:36.420
Now I can tell you that this one is,
you know,

2273
02:26:36.430 --> 02:26:38.920
there's all the military is filled.
Like he says,

2274
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.800
many of lovable rounders proved himself to be a first class.

2275
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:44.030
What I mean of course guys,

2276
02:26:44.031 --> 02:26:48.940
they're bad ass guys throughout the ages that were why even Henry the fifth,

2277
02:26:48.941 --> 02:26:52.540
I don't wild man reputation going back to Shakespeare

2278
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:59.730
and so,
but he's saying that you know these,
these

2279
02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:05.190
staying on the straight and narrow enforces your will is what he's saying.

2280
02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:07.530
Back to the book,
putting aside for the moment,

2281
02:27:07.531 --> 02:27:11.820
the question of the vices and regarding only the game to moral power,

2282
02:27:11.821 --> 02:27:15.150
which comes of bodily exercise and physical conditions.

2283
02:27:15.151 --> 02:27:19.140
So he's talked about vices.
Okay,
we got it.
Stay clean,

2284
02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.980
stay clean is what he's saying.
But now he's saying there's something else.

2285
02:27:22.981 --> 02:27:25.110
There's something called exercise and physical conditioning.

2286
02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:31.470
It should be self evident that the process which builds the muscle must also

2287
02:27:31.471 --> 02:27:35.220
train in alert the mind.
How could it be otherwise?

2288
02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:39.630
Every physical act must have as its origin,

2289
02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:42.690
a mental impulse,
conscious or unconscious.

2290
02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:46.260
Thus in training a man to master his muscles,

2291
02:27:46.470 --> 02:27:49.170
we also help him to master his brain.

2292
02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.870
He comes out of physical training,
not only better condition to move,

2293
02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:58.740
but better prepared to think about how and why he is moving,

2294
02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.900
which is true mobility.

2295
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:06.580
So you want to strengthen your will.
Yes,
stay clean,

2296
02:28:06.730 --> 02:28:08.830
stay on the moral path,

2297
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:12.430
and then get your physical conditioning on because that's gonna make you

2298
02:28:12.431 --> 02:28:13.510
mentally tougher.

2299
02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:17.620
Back to the book in the United States Service,

2300
02:28:17.621 --> 02:28:22.550
we are tending to forget because of the effect of motorization at the higher

2301
02:28:22.551 --> 02:28:26.720
value of the discipline of the road.
March in other days,

2302
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:31.810
wasn't that it hearted the muscles,
but that short of combat,

2303
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:36.280
it was the best method of separating the men from the boys.

2304
02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:38.410
This is true today,

2305
02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:42.580
despite all the new conditions imposed by technological changes are hard.

2306
02:28:42.581 --> 02:28:47.380
Road March is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength of the

2307
02:28:47.410 --> 02:28:48.640
individual man.

2308
02:28:50.130 --> 02:28:55.050
At the same time to census the overload men for road marching hurts them in two

2309
02:28:55.051 --> 02:29:00.030
ways,
dichotomy to everything so you can hurt them with a road march.

2310
02:29:00.390 --> 02:29:04.110
Here's the two ways.
Eight weakens their faith in the sense of the command,

2311
02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:09.350
thereby impairing morale and it breaks down their muscle and tendons.

2312
02:29:09.351 --> 02:29:11.370
So you overload them.
You're going to crush them,
you're going to break them,

2313
02:29:11.371 --> 02:29:12.480
you're going to ruin their spirit.

2314
02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.490
There is another not infrequent cause of breakdown.

2315
02:29:18.270 --> 02:29:22.890
The leader who makes the mistake of thinking that every man's limit is the same

2316
02:29:22.891 --> 02:29:27.640
as his own.
So you,
oh,
I can,

2317
02:29:27.700 --> 02:29:32.620
I can,
I can do this.
I can hump in 20 miles or 20 clicks.
Everyone can do it.

2318
02:29:32.890 --> 02:29:33.760
Wrong answer.

2319
02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:39.070
When an officer does this kind of thing thoughtlessly he shows himself to be an

2320
02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:43.630
incompetent observer of men.
When he does it to show off,

2321
02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.950
he deserves to be given 10 days in the electric chair.
Hey,

2322
02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.980
there you go.
Getting the electric chair 10 days.
That's a,

2323
02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:54.610
that's like how many times do you die in 10 days in the electric chair or know a

2324
02:29:54.611 --> 02:29:57.690
lot,
but don't show off is the point.
Yeah.

2325
02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:59.980
Otherwise you're going in the electric chair for 10 days,

2326
02:30:00.370 --> 02:30:05.050
but isn't that like an old classic thing in the movie where it's usually to like

2327
02:30:05.051 --> 02:30:07.600
combat like a situation where the guys are complaining,
you know,

2328
02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:11.930
like all of this,
do I this unrealistic,
I don't know.
Obstacle course.
Yeah,

2329
02:30:11.931 --> 02:30:16.750
they're like this.
And then the drill sergeant or whoever he,
he does it.

2330
02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:19.720
You know,
he's like the older guy.
Well yeah,
he's proving that,
look,

2331
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:22.140
I'm not asking you to do anything that I wouldn't do myself.
Yeah.

2332
02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:27.160
That's all that that is.
Right.
But in a way he's like,
Hey,
I can do it.

2333
02:30:27.430 --> 02:30:30.700
So you should be able to do it.
That's true.
Guess what?

2334
02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:32.910
A young recruit should be able to do it.

2335
02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:38.440
Otherwise it's not reaching the standards.
You've got to have standards.
Yeah.

2336
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:41.500
But if he was saying,
hey,

2337
02:30:41.501 --> 02:30:44.320
you should be able to do this with one arm tied behind your back,
like I can,

2338
02:30:44.350 --> 02:30:47.560
cause that could be wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see the difference sir?
Well,
yeah,

2339
02:30:47.650 --> 02:30:49.830
cause it makes sure because otherwise you can get me on a technicality.

2340
02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.210
Don't want that to happen over here.

2341
02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:56.800
Speaking of athletic accomplishments in the nature of things,

2342
02:30:56.801 --> 02:31:01.120
the officer who's been an athlete can fit himself into this part of the program

2343
02:31:01.121 --> 02:31:05.320
with little difficulty and with great credit provided he acts with moderation

2344
02:31:05.321 --> 02:31:08.380
that adhere as suggested.
By the same token,

2345
02:31:08.381 --> 02:31:10.540
the officer who is shown sports in school,

2346
02:31:10.541 --> 02:31:13.930
either because he didn't have the size or coordination or is more interested in

2347
02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:14.710
something else,

2348
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:18.610
we'll frequently have an understandable hesitation about trying to play the lead

2349
02:31:18.611 --> 02:31:21.990
hand in anything which he thinks will make him look bad.

2350
02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.170
Just talking about the benefits of the sports.

2351
02:31:25.450 --> 02:31:26.283
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

2352
02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:31.930
<v 5>If he has not kept himself in good physical shape,</v>

2353
02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:36.940
his nerves will not be able to stand the strain of combat to say nothing of his

2354
02:31:36.941 --> 02:31:40.600
legs.
It can be said again and again.

2355
02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:44.470
The highest form of physical training that an officer can undergo is the

2356
02:31:44.471 --> 02:31:46.570
physical conditioning of his own men.

2357
02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:51.640
Nothing else can give him more faith in his own ability to stay the course and

2358
02:31:51.641 --> 02:31:55.900
nothing else is likely to give him a firmer feeling of solidarity with his men

2359
02:31:56.650 --> 02:32:01.150
study and an active thirst for wider professional knowledge have their place in

2360
02:32:01.151 --> 02:32:03.430
an officer's scheme of thing things.

2361
02:32:03.610 --> 02:32:08.350
But there is something about the experience of bodily competition of joining

2362
02:32:08.351 --> 02:32:11.770
with and leading men and strenuous physical exercise,

2363
02:32:11.890 --> 02:32:16.720
which uniquely invigorates one spirit with the confidence.
I can do this.

2364
02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:19.450
I can lead,
I can command

2365
02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:25.020
the body and mind are connected everybody.

2366
02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.003
<v 2>No it</v>

2367
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:30.080
<v 5>back to the book.</v>

2368
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:34.550
The really good thing about the gain and moral force deriving from all forms of

2369
02:32:34.551 --> 02:32:38.150
physical training is that it is an unconscious gain,

2370
02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:41.270
willpower,
determination,

2371
02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:46.390
mental poise and muscle control all march hand in hand with the general health

2372
02:32:46.551 --> 02:32:49.130
and wellbeing of the man with results,

2373
02:32:49.131 --> 02:32:53.300
not less decisive under training conditions.
Then on the field of battle,

2374
02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:58.670
a man who develops correct posture and begins to fill out his body so that he

2375
02:32:58.671 --> 02:33:02.570
looks the part of a fighter of will take greater pride in wearing the uniform.

2376
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:04.340
In doing so,

2377
02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:09.590
he will take greater care to conduct himself morally that he will not disgrace

2378
02:33:09.591 --> 02:33:10.424
it.

2379
02:33:10.460 --> 02:33:15.460
He will gain confidence as he acquires like a confident and determined bearing.

2380
02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:21.260
This same presence and the physical strength which contributes to it will help

2381
02:33:21.261 --> 02:33:23.390
carry him through the hour of danger.

2382
02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:29.500
Strength of will is partly of the mind and partly of the body in combat.

2383
02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:36.400
Fatigue will beat down men as quickly as any other condition for fatigue

2384
02:33:37.701 --> 02:33:42.080
inevitably carries fear with it.
Tired.

2385
02:33:42.081 --> 02:33:43.610
Men are afraid.

2386
02:33:44.730 --> 02:33:45.170
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2387
02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:48.230
<v 5>there is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the road.</v>

2388
02:33:48.231 --> 02:33:51.050
For lack of preliminary hardening in troops.

2389
02:33:51.470 --> 02:33:56.420
Such a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander who insists on

2390
02:33:56.421 --> 02:34:01.010
driving troops and extra mile beyond their general level of physical endurance.

2391
02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:03.260
So,
so if you got guys that aren't ready,

2392
02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:05.900
just cause you're fired up doesn't mean it's going to work.

2393
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:08.330
You can't push them hard.
Now here's what happens.

2394
02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:13.220
Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command and thus

2395
02:34:13.221 --> 02:34:16.730
strike at tactical efficiency from two directions at

2396
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:20.260
for when men resent to commander,

2397
02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:24.640
they will not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent,

2398
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:26.970
their nerves are gone.

2399
02:34:30.370 --> 02:34:34.690
Physical conditioning.
Now on top of that,

2400
02:34:34.691 --> 02:34:39.691
we got the physical addition and you also have to keep your people informed in

2401
02:34:40.361 --> 02:34:44.830
war.
In the absence of information man's natural promptings,

2402
02:34:44.831 --> 02:34:49.831
alternate between unreasoning fears that the worst is likely to happen and the

2403
02:34:50.281 --> 02:34:53.320
wishful thought that all danger is remote.

2404
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:59.400
Either impulse is a barrier to the growth of that condition of alert confidence

2405
02:34:59.830 --> 02:35:04.390
which comes to men when they have a realization of their own strength and a

2406
02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:07.720
reasonably clear concept of the general situation.

2407
02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:11.970
You got to keep your people in form.

2408
02:35:11.971 --> 02:35:14.660
That's what I was talking about earlier being at the end of a platoon.

2409
02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:20.670
Next section is about counseling your men.

2410
02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:26.460
Nothing more unfortunate can happen to an officer then to come to be regarded by

2411
02:35:26.461 --> 02:35:27.171
his subordinates,

2412
02:35:27.171 --> 02:35:32.171
says unapproachable for such a reputation isolates him from the main problems of

2413
02:35:33.541 --> 02:35:37.620
the command responsibility as well as its chief rewards.

2414
02:35:39.050 --> 02:35:42.810
How do you become approachable?
The two formal manner,

2415
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:45.180
the over rigid attitude,

2416
02:35:45.181 --> 02:35:48.990
the disposition to deal with any human problem by the numbers as if it were one

2417
02:35:48.991 --> 02:35:53.991
more act in an organizational routine can have a chilling effect upon men so

2418
02:35:56.311 --> 02:35:59.670
that that idea that you're just going to be by the book on everything,

2419
02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:01.320
that's not going to make you approachable.

2420
02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:08.070
That being said back to the book,
it is not necessary that an officer,
wet nurses,

2421
02:36:08.071 --> 02:36:12.930
men in order to serve well in the role of counsel,
his doors should be open,

2422
02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:18.080
but he's not play the part either of father confessor or of a hotel greeter,

2423
02:36:19.650 --> 02:36:22.650
neither great psalm knee or a few snus or called for,

2424
02:36:22.651 --> 02:36:26.610
but mainly serious attention to the problem and then straight forward advice or

2425
02:36:26.611 --> 02:36:31.611
decision according to the nature of the case and provided that from his own

2426
02:36:31.621 --> 02:36:34.860
knowledge and experience he feels qualified to give it.

2427
02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:36.810
If not,

2428
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:41.610
it is wiser to differ then to offer a half baked opinion.

2429
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:44.370
That's okay.
If you don't know,
hey,
look,
I don't really,

2430
02:36:44.371 --> 02:36:47.790
I've never dealt with this before.
Maybe you should go talk to echo.

2431
02:36:47.791 --> 02:36:49.620
He deals with these computers all the time.

2432
02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:51.510
Come to me with your computer problems.

2433
02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:56.530
Back to the book of World War,

2434
02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:01.330
two officers had to abide by this standard dealing with the general malaise

2435
02:37:01.331 --> 02:37:02.950
which rose out of redeployment.

2436
02:37:04.170 --> 02:37:05.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2437
02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.600
<v 5>When a man came forward and said that he couldn't take it anymore and the</v>

2438
02:37:08.601 --> 02:37:12.290
commander knew that he'd always been a highly dutiful individual.

2439
02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:15.800
It became the commander's job to attempt to get the home.

2440
02:37:17.390 --> 02:37:21.130
But when a second man came forward with the same story and the record showed

2441
02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:23.120
that he'd always shirked his work,

2442
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:27.320
the question was whether he should be given the final chance to shirk it again.

2443
02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:28.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2444
02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:32.040
<v 5>To favor the first man meant furthering discipline,</v>

2445
02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:37.110
his comrades recognize that as a fear deal to turn back.

2446
02:37:37.111 --> 02:37:42.090
The second man was equally constructive to the same end.
So those are,

2447
02:37:42.091 --> 02:37:45.500
that's just classic and we've seen that in just about every book we read you and

2448
02:37:45.501 --> 02:37:48.030
with some Guy World War II or we saw a bunch of it.

2449
02:37:48.310 --> 02:37:50.430
If some guy would just lose it and we've installed the Korean,

2450
02:37:50.431 --> 02:37:53.070
you know some of the Korean books we've covered,
the guy loses it,

2451
02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:55.530
but there are a good guy.
Remember the guy walking around in his sleeping bag?

2452
02:37:55.570 --> 02:37:58.470
Look,
we're just going to take care of this guy.
He's been a good guy.

2453
02:37:58.471 --> 02:38:00.090
We'll get him off the front.
He's got a few days left,

2454
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:05.220
but then when you get a guy that's that's a weak and scared and doesn't man up

2455
02:38:05.221 --> 02:38:08.580
and do his duty at any wants to go home,
they're not given that got slack,

2456
02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:10.110
doesn't deserve it.
Didn't earn it.

2457
02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:11.293
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

2458
02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:15.970
<v 5>Now,
this is interesting.</v>

2459
02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:20.950
There are officers who hold every subordinate like grim death.

2460
02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:23.710
See no better way to advance their personal fortunes.

2461
02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:25.900
So this is what we're talking about here is,

2462
02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.040
and this happens a lot in the military,

2463
02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:28.660
what it happens in every business I work with,

2464
02:38:28.661 --> 02:38:33.010
where you've got people that are being moved around,
so like,
oh,
echo works.

2465
02:38:33.011 --> 02:38:35.170
You've got this guy Billy that works for you.
Hey,

2466
02:38:35.171 --> 02:38:38.680
I need Billy to help me with this project.
What do you say?
No,
you can't have him.

2467
02:38:39.010 --> 02:38:40.810
He's my guy.
What?
What do you have more working on right now?

2468
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:44.080
I've got some projects coming up.
I need him right now.
You know what I'm saying?

2469
02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:47.860
So people go into that mode where they hold everyone like a grim death.

2470
02:38:48.930 --> 02:38:52.960
There are officers who hold every able subordinate like grim death scene.

2471
02:38:52.961 --> 02:38:55.720
No better way to advance their personal fortunes.

2472
02:38:56.110 --> 02:39:00.190
This is a sign of moral weakness,
not have strength,

2473
02:39:00.370 --> 02:39:03.910
and it is inevitable fruit and it's inevitable.

2474
02:39:03.911 --> 02:39:06.370
Fruit is discontent within the organization.

2475
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:12.510
The sign of superiority in any officer at whatever level is his confidence that

2476
02:39:12.581 --> 02:39:15.790
he can make another good man to fill any vacancy.

2477
02:39:18.250 --> 02:39:18.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2478
02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:21.080
<v 5>The other time I don't like that is when somebody,
you know,</v>

2479
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:23.660
if you're gonna give me Billy and it's actually your promotion for Billy,

2480
02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:26.960
it's like a step up,
but you don't want to give them to me anyways,
you're,
you're,

2481
02:39:26.961 --> 02:39:30.380
you're hurting him because you're just trying to help yourself.
Yeah.
No.

2482
02:39:30.381 --> 02:39:33.420
Give a guy up.
Find somebody else new.
Find a better person.
Find some,

2483
02:39:33.421 --> 02:39:38.020
it's going to mold and make better.
Yeah.
I had that happened to me before you,

2484
02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:42.770
the guy,
were you the guy,
the guy that got,
didn't get promoted.
Correct.

2485
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:45.530
Somebody held onto you.
Yeah.

2486
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:49.370
And it was less about if I did or didn't get promoted,

2487
02:39:49.430 --> 02:39:53.480
it was that he was just holding on where you know,

2488
02:39:53.481 --> 02:39:58.130
to kind of negate any chance of that.
He was clear.
He actually even told me too.

2489
02:39:58.430 --> 02:40:03.380
Well,
that was at least straight forward on them.
Yeah,
not good.

2490
02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:05.150
How'd that work out for you,
for your morale?

2491
02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.240
It didn't help it daily.

2492
02:40:11.130 --> 02:40:11.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2493
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:14.520
<v 5>Back to the book.
Some the ablest commanders</v>

2494
02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.770
<v 7>in our service have abided by this rule.</v>

2495
02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.870
They never denied the man who had a legitimate reason for transfer and they

2496
02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:26.871
never shuffled off their lemons and gold bricks under a false label,

2497
02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:32.570
<v 5>so that does another thing that happens in businesses.
Hey,
you've got Billy,</v>

2498
02:40:32.571 --> 02:40:36.290
he bill,
he's a bum,
and I say,
Hey,
echo,
I need a guy over here to help me with us.

2499
02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:39.170
Oh yeah,
you can have Billy,
great guy.
You give me a bill.

2500
02:40:39.171 --> 02:40:43.100
He's a disaster as a gold brick.
It's a lie.

2501
02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:50.530
Here's a few common sense rules which when followed will enable any officer to

2502
02:40:50.931 --> 02:40:55.931
play as part more effectively in the counseling of men and access of expression

2503
02:40:56.060 --> 02:40:56.930
is a failing.

2504
02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:01.490
So when you give away your facial expression looks all that's a failing

2505
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:08.530
to listen well is the prelude toward pondering carefully and speaking wisely?

2506
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:10.220
Listen,
got to listen.

2507
02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:16.180
To refuse with kindness is more winning.

2508
02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:20.320
Then to acquiesce ungraciously.
That's a good one.

2509
02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:24.520
Just ain't know what I don't think it's going to be rather than all right.
Yeah.

2510
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:27.830
That's like something you've got to deal with with your wife.
No.

2511
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:30.700
Your wife wants to go do something new.
You'd be better to say,

2512
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:33.130
you know what I'm thinking about?
That's not do that tonight.
Let's do,

2513
02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:36.430
let's do this other thing instead as opposed to,
all right,
fine.

2514
02:41:36.431 --> 02:41:40.930
We'll go to your friend's house.
Don't want to do that.

2515
02:41:41.550 --> 02:41:43.210
Didn't act like a dick when you get there.

2516
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:49.590
To note another man's mood and become congenial to it is the surest way to

2517
02:41:50.351 --> 02:41:51.850
engage is competence.

2518
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:57.870
Decisions which are wholly of the heart and not of the mind will ultimately do

2519
02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:03.760
hurt to both places.
Use your logic.

2520
02:42:03.761 --> 02:42:06.610
Don't get emotional.
No Man.

2521
02:42:06.611 --> 02:42:09.280
We'll talk freely if met by silence,

2522
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:14.230
but an intelligent question encourages frankness above all else.

2523
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:19.890
When a man loses possession of himself,

2524
02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:24.750
it is the more reason that the other should tighten his reserve.

2525
02:42:25.530 --> 02:42:30.360
Legit.
This is a good one to express.

2526
02:42:30.361 --> 02:42:35.361
Pity for a man does not serve to restore him and put him above pity.

2527
02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:43.290
When a man is so burdened by a personal problem that it shuts out all else,

2528
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:46.200
he must be led to something else

2529
02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:52.700
and the last one here in prudent tactics can undo the wisest strategy and that

2530
02:42:54.091 --> 02:42:57.510
happens at every level.
It happens in war,
it happens in business.

2531
02:42:57.690 --> 02:42:58.590
You've got a great strategy,

2532
02:42:58.591 --> 02:43:02.070
but the guys on the ground are really not doing it tactically well.

2533
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:05.250
It doesn't matter the strategy you're going to fail.

2534
02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:12.020
Finally in counseling like all else and military life has a combat purpose.

2535
02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:15.440
Other things being equal,

2536
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:20.650
the tactical unity of men working together in combat will be in ratio to their

2537
02:43:20.691 --> 02:43:24.200
knowledge and sympathetic understanding of each other.

2538
02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:26.470
Whatever the cause,

2539
02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:31.540
aloofness on the part of the officer can only produce a further withdraw on that

2540
02:43:33.561 --> 02:43:35.060
part of the man

2541
02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:43.100
aloofness.
Now,

2542
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:45.140
the last section of this book

2543
02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:49.570
was really devastating on my highlighter.

2544
02:43:50.890 --> 02:43:52.840
It's called Americans in combat,

2545
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:54.543
<v 6>okay?</v>

2546
02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:59.720
<v 5>The command and control of men in combat can be mastered by junior leaders of</v>

2547
02:43:59.721 --> 02:44:03.950
American forces,
short of an actual experience under enemy fire.

2548
02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:08.930
It is altogether possible for a young officer his first time in battle to be in

2549
02:44:08.931 --> 02:44:13.931
total possession of his faculties and moving by instinct to do the right thing.

2550
02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:18.170
Provided that he has made the most of his training opportunities

2551
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:25.210
exercise in the maneuvering of men is only an elementary introduction to this

2552
02:44:25.491 --> 02:44:30.350
educational process.
The basic requirement is a continuing study,

2553
02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:32.000
first of the nature of men.

2554
02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:37.060
Second of the techniques which produce unified action and last of the history of

2555
02:44:38.091 --> 02:44:43.070
past operations which are covered by an abundant literature.

2556
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.940
That's how you got to get ready for combat.
Those things right there.

2557
02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.470
Now there are a few simple and fundamental propositions which the armed services

2558
02:44:51.471 --> 02:44:56.471
subscribe insane to officer corps what may be expected of the average man of the

2559
02:44:57.501 --> 02:45:01.970
United States under battle conditions.
Generally speaking,

2560
02:45:01.971 --> 02:45:06.170
they have held true of Americans in times past.
From Lexington to Okinawa,

2561
02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:10.460
the fighting establishment builds it's disciplined training,

2562
02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.720
code of conduct and public policy around these ideas.

2563
02:45:14.721 --> 02:45:19.721
Believing that what served yesterday will also be the one best way tomorrow and

2564
02:45:21.351 --> 02:45:24.830
for so long as our traditions and our system of freedom survives,

2565
02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:27.020
these propositions are

2566
02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:34.060
when lead with courage and intelligence and American will fight as willingly as

2567
02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:38.210
and as efficiently as any fighter in world history.

2568
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:40.550
I concur with that.

2569
02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:45.920
His keenness and endurance in war will be in proportion to the zeal and

2570
02:45:45.921 --> 02:45:47.570
inspiration of his leadership.

2571
02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:49.380
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

2572
02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:52.800
<v 5>he is resourceful and imaginative,
imaginative,</v>

2573
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:58.070
and the best results will always flow from encouraging him to use his brain

2574
02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:00.090
along with his spirit.

2575
02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:04.160
Under combat conditions.

2576
02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:09.220
He will reserve his greatest loyalty for the officer who is most resourceful in

2577
02:46:09.441 --> 02:46:14.441
the tactical employment of his forces and most careful to avoid unnecessary

2578
02:46:15.621 --> 02:46:16.490
losses.

2579
02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.200
So the the soldiers going to know if you're throwing bodies away,

2580
02:46:21.201 --> 02:46:23.630
they're going to know it.
And same thing in the business world.

2581
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:28.460
I've worked with a lot of companies where they do their utmost to,

2582
02:46:28.461 --> 02:46:31.130
let's say there's a downturn in the market and they're going think that they're

2583
02:46:31.131 --> 02:46:35.300
going to fire some people and they do their best to mitigate that.

2584
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:36.800
That develops loyalty,

2585
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:39.620
that makes them fight harder when the market turns back around.

2586
02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:44.000
Now sometimes that can be a problem because people try and be so loyal that

2587
02:46:44.001 --> 02:46:45.920
they'd run their business in the ground.
They fail

2588
02:46:49.970 --> 02:46:52.730
back to the book,
except on a Hollywood lot.

2589
02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:56.390
There is no such thing as an American fighter type.

2590
02:46:57.230 --> 02:47:01.190
Our best month men come in all colors,
shapes,

2591
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:05.660
and sizes.
They appear from every section of the nation,

2592
02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.700
including the territories.

2593
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:10.080
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2594
02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:10.920
<v 5>In battle,</v>

2595
02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:15.720
Americans do not tend to fluctuate between emotional extremes.

2596
02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:20.550
In complete dejection one day an XL Taishan the next according to the changes in

2597
02:47:20.551 --> 02:47:23.640
the situation,
they continue on the whole,

2598
02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:28.380
on a fairly even keel when the going is tough and when things are breaking their

2599
02:47:28.381 --> 02:47:32.960
way,
even when heavily shocked by battle losses,

2600
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:34.880
they tend to bounce back quickly.

2601
02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:36.560
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2602
02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:40.580
<v 5>Though they're griping is incessant.
They're natural.</v>

2603
02:47:40.581 --> 02:47:45.581
Outlook is on the optimistic side and they react unfavorably to the officer who

2604
02:47:47.241 --> 02:47:49.970
looks eternally on the dark side.

2605
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:53.990
Next during battle,

2606
02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:59.020
American officers are not expected either to drive their men or to be forever in

2607
02:47:59.511 --> 02:48:01.880
the van as if praying to be shot.

2608
02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:06.440
So the van is like on the front lines the front of your formation,

2609
02:48:07.070 --> 02:48:12.070
so long as they are with their men taking the same chances as their men and

2610
02:48:12.231 --> 02:48:17.231
showing a firm grasp of the situation and of the line of action which should be

2611
02:48:17.901 --> 02:48:20.150
followed.
The men will go forward

2612
02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:27.220
in any situation of extreme pressure or moral exhaustion where men cannot

2613
02:48:27.350 --> 02:48:30.020
otherwise be rallied and led forward.

2614
02:48:30.290 --> 02:48:35.270
Officers are expected to do the actual physical act of leading,

2615
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:38.810
such as performing as first scout or point.

2616
02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:43.670
Even though this mean take means taking over what would normally be an enlisted

2617
02:48:43.671 --> 02:48:46.880
man's function.
The normal next,

2618
02:48:46.881 --> 02:48:51.881
the normal gregarious American is not at his best when playing alone handed or

2619
02:48:53.031 --> 02:48:55.310
tactically isolated part in battle.

2620
02:48:56.150 --> 02:49:00.740
He is not a kamikaze or a one man torpedo.
Consequently,

2621
02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:05.980
the best tactical results obtain from those dispositions and methods which link

2622
02:49:06.051 --> 02:49:09.210
the power of one to that of another.

2623
02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:15.510
Men who feel strange with their unit having been carelessly received by it and

2624
02:49:15.511 --> 02:49:20.511
indifferently handled will rarely if ever fight strongly and courageously.

2625
02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.700
But if treated with common decency and respect,
they will perform like men.

2626
02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:31.630
So that's just talking about when you check in somewhere,
you know,
you,

2627
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:34.170
if you're in the military and you get somebody that checks and take care of
them,

2628
02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:36.930
welcome.
If you're at a company and somebody checks and take care of them,

2629
02:49:36.931 --> 02:49:39.630
welcome.
Show him around a sign of a mentor.
Get them in the game.

2630
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:40.583
<v 6>Hmm</v>

2631
02:49:43.650 --> 02:49:47.160
<v 5>to lie to American troops to cover up a blundering.</v>

2632
02:49:47.161 --> 02:49:50.370
Combat rarely serves any valid purpose.

2633
02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:56.720
They have a good sense of combat and an uncanny instinct for ferreting out the

2634
02:49:56.851 --> 02:49:59.640
truth.
When anything goes wrong.
Tactically,

2635
02:50:00.930 --> 02:50:03.420
they will excuse mistakes,

2636
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:06.990
but they will not forgive being treated like children.

2637
02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:10.170
<v 6>Basic leadership,</v>

2638
02:50:14.770 --> 02:50:15.790
<v 5>good one here.</v>

2639
02:50:15.970 --> 02:50:20.970
When spit and Polish are laid on so heavily that they become onerous and the

2640
02:50:22.061 --> 02:50:26.560
ranks cannot see any legitimate connection between the requirements and the

2641
02:50:26.561 --> 02:50:30.280
development of an attitude which will serve a clear fighting purpose.

2642
02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:35.550
It is to be questioned that the exaction serve any good object,

2643
02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:39.550
whatever.
So again,
I'm a I,
I'm like leaning in the seal teams.

2644
02:50:39.551 --> 02:50:41.500
I'm probably the extreme level of,

2645
02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:45.640
of military bearing and uniformity.

2646
02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:49.390
But I'm definitely not a believer that,
you know,
you got everything,

2647
02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:52.130
every single thing spit and Polish all day long.
No.
Hmm.

2648
02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:56.920
And they're saying clearly here that if you go so far in that direction and

2649
02:50:56.921 --> 02:50:59.620
people don't make any sense of it,
it's not going to be good.
Yeah.

2650
02:51:00.430 --> 02:51:03.640
I mean even picture,
you know,
Hackworth was like Mr Spit and Polish,

2651
02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:07.060
look at pictures of Hackworth in Vietnam.
I mean you wouldn't even wear rank.

2652
02:51:07.061 --> 02:51:10.210
You know,
he looked like a regular soldier can look any exquisite parade.

2653
02:51:10.211 --> 02:51:11.710
Matter of fact,
he makes fun of the guys from the,

2654
02:51:11.810 --> 02:51:15.380
that come into the camp that looked like they're in parade ground uniforms.
Yeah.

2655
02:51:16.210 --> 02:51:18.910
I saw a quote,
it's like yesterday,

2656
02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:24.990
<v 4>a spotless house is the sign of a wasted life.</v>

2657
02:51:25.470 --> 02:51:29.720
Which when I saw it,
I tend to like,
I dunno,

2658
02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:31.460
disagree with a lot because it like,

2659
02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:35.410
it basically takes one kind of perspective and like makes it into this like

2660
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:40.110
thing.
But if I like with this when I was like,

2661
02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.900
well,
or it means you clean your house all the time,
that's what you know.

2662
02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:46.900
Or maybe your discipline you have,
you know,

2663
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:49.980
you clean your stuff including your house.
I don't know.

2664
02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:52.140
Maybe you take care of your house.
Maybe here as cleaning person,

2665
02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:54.270
that's not a wasted life by the way,

2666
02:51:54.910 --> 02:51:57.150
<v 5>I think.
I think that's just an extreme statement,</v>

2667
02:51:57.151 --> 02:52:02.100
but I think the underlying messages,
you know,
hey live a little is basically,

2668
02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:05.800
yeah.
In a way it's kind of the message there is kind of,
you're saying you,

2669
02:52:05.801 --> 02:52:07.840
if you take it literally,
yeah,
that could,
you could,

2670
02:52:07.930 --> 02:52:10.810
you could go too far down that road.
You can just take it as

2671
02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:12.350
<v 7>okay.</v>

2672
02:52:12.350 --> 02:52:16.490
<v 5>A message.
I think the messages fairly clear and I somewhat agree with it,</v>

2673
02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:17.181
you know?
Yeah.

2674
02:52:17.181 --> 02:52:20.420
Like you spent your whole life making sure everything in your house is clean.

2675
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:22.160
Yeah.
You know,
they say also like the,

2676
02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:27.190
the Highly Polished Samurai sword that's never been used in battle is a lot less

2677
02:52:29.061 --> 02:52:30.270
valuable to me than the,

2678
02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:36.010
than the switch blade knife that's rusty from blood k Bar.

2679
02:52:36.051 --> 02:52:41.000
That's rusty from blood know.
Next one

2680
02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:43.790
on the other hand,

2681
02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:48.800
because standards of discipline and courtesy are designed for the express

2682
02:52:48.801 --> 02:52:52.520
purpose of furthering control under the extraordinary frictions.

2683
02:52:52.521 --> 02:52:54.200
Impressions of the battlefield.

2684
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:59.710
They're maintenance under combat conditions is as necessary as during training.

2685
02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:04.250
Smartness and respect are the marks of military alertness,

2686
02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:06.710
no matter how trying the circumstances,

2687
02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:11.510
but courtesy starts at the top in the dealing of any officer with his

2688
02:53:11.511 --> 02:53:15.140
subordinates and then the decent regard for their loyalty,

2689
02:53:15.290 --> 02:53:19.370
intelligence and manhood.
So even though you can't be over disciplined,

2690
02:53:19.371 --> 02:53:20.510
you've still got to have the discipline.

2691
02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:28.180
Next though Americans enjoy relatively a bountiful and even luxurious standard

2692
02:53:31.041 --> 02:53:32.570
of living in their home environment.

2693
02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:37.780
They do not have to be pampered for spoon fed or overfilled with every comfort

2694
02:53:39.921 --> 02:53:44.420
and convenience to keep them steadfast and devoted.
Once war comes,

2695
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:49.790
they are by nature rugged men and in the field they will respond most perfectly.

2696
02:53:49.791 --> 02:53:52.010
When called on to play a rugged part.

2697
02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:57.670
Soft handling will soften even the best men,

2698
02:53:59.170 --> 02:54:00.460
but even the week man,

2699
02:54:00.461 --> 02:54:05.230
we'll develop a new vigor and competence in the face of necessary hardship.

2700
02:54:05.530 --> 02:54:10.530
If moved by a leadership which is courageously making the best of a bad

2701
02:54:10.691 --> 02:54:13.700
situation,
it's just awesome.

2702
02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:19.480
Soft handling will soften even the best men and the weak man will come around

2703
02:54:21.250 --> 02:54:22.970
for a necessary hardship.

2704
02:54:22.971 --> 02:54:25.490
You notice they put that word in there NESAD not just beating him up for no

2705
02:54:25.491 --> 02:54:27.620
reason.
Yeah,
they got to see why it is.
Yup.

2706
02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:35.330
Next extravagance and wastefulness is somewhat rooted in the American character

2707
02:54:35.331 --> 02:54:39.200
because of our mode of life.
When our men enter the military service,

2708
02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:42.890
there's a strong holdover from their civilian habits.

2709
02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:46.220
Even under fighting conditions,
they tend to be wasteful of drinking water,

2710
02:54:46.221 --> 02:54:50.600
food munition,
and other vital supply.
When such things are made to accessible,

2711
02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:51.810
<v 7>okay,</v>

2712
02:54:51.810 --> 02:54:56.430
<v 5>they tend to throw them away rather than conserve them.
In the general interests.</v>

2713
02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:59.130
This is a distinct weakness during combat.

2714
02:54:59.730 --> 02:55:04.610
When conservation of all supplies a touchstone of success,
the regulating

2715
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:09.610
<v 0>of all supply and the preventing of waste in any form is the prime obligation of</v>

2716
02:55:10.461 --> 02:55:11.390
every officer

2717
02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:16.383
<v 1>be frugal.</v>

2718
02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:23.500
<v 0>Next,
under the conditions of battle,
any extra work,</v>

2719
02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:25.630
exercise,
maneuver,
or marching,

2720
02:55:25.631 --> 02:55:30.100
which does not serve a clear and direct operational purpose is unjustifiable.

2721
02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:35.380
The supreme object is to keep men as physically fresh and mentally alert as

2722
02:55:35.381 --> 02:55:36.214
possible.

2723
02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:40.690
Tired men take fright and her half whipped before the battle opens.

2724
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:43.870
Worn out.
Officers cannot make clear decisions.

2725
02:55:44.650 --> 02:55:46.570
The conservation of men's powers,

2726
02:55:46.690 --> 02:55:51.040
not the exhaustion thereof is a successful way of operations.

2727
02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:59.220
Next,
when forces are committed to combat,

2728
02:55:59.250 --> 02:56:04.080
it is vital that not one unnecessary pound be put on any man's.
Yeah,

2729
02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:04.993
<v 1>back</v>

2730
02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:10.390
<v 0>lightness of foot is the key to speed of movement and the increase of fire
power.</v>

2731
02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:12.580
In judging of these things,

2732
02:56:12.581 --> 02:56:15.790
every officer's thought should be on the optimistic side.

2733
02:56:16.030 --> 02:56:19.660
It is better to take the chance that men will manage to get by on a little less

2734
02:56:19.661 --> 02:56:24.661
than to overload them through overcautious reckoning of every possible

2735
02:56:25.211 --> 02:56:29.710
contingency,
thereby destroying their power to do anything effectively.

2736
02:56:31.450 --> 02:56:35.800
Every pound counts they used to,
when I was at a team too,

2737
02:56:35.801 --> 02:56:40.801
they had winter warfare platoons and so you'd be up burning calories on skis and

2738
02:56:42.131 --> 02:56:47.131
those guys were so anal about making their gear as light as possible.

2739
02:56:47.261 --> 02:56:47.921
It's pretty impressive.

2740
02:56:47.921 --> 02:56:51.070
So you know when you've got a backpack or something and it's got straps,

2741
02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:52.690
you know that you can loosen up or tighten up.

2742
02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:56.470
They would through the whole backpack that they would cut off.

2743
02:56:56.650 --> 02:57:01.480
Any excess strap would be gone just to get everything as light as possible.

2744
02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:11.150
It's kind of a good strategy to follow when you travel,
you know?
Yeah.

2745
02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:14.980
You know what the funny thing is too is I've got this now,

2746
02:57:15.010 --> 02:57:17.230
I've got this pretty down where I was like,
you know what?
If I buy,

2747
02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:20.620
if I don't have this,
if I don't bring this and I need it,
I'm just gonna buy it.

2748
02:57:20.650 --> 02:57:23.650
Right.
I'm going to go to a wherever and buy it,
no factor

2749
02:57:25.700 --> 02:57:29.740
because this kind of those two schools of thought,
whatever,

2750
02:57:29.741 --> 02:57:31.540
two ways to think about it where the person is like,

2751
02:57:31.541 --> 02:57:34.810
I might need it so I'm going to bring it and the other person is like,

2752
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:38.800
if I can't think of a specific time that I'm going to need this on the Strip,

2753
02:57:38.830 --> 02:57:42.580
I'm not going to bring it and just like how you say it,
if I need it,

2754
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:47.830
I'll buy it there.
Travel light freeze at night.
Yes.
All right.
Yeah,
yeah.

2755
02:57:47.890 --> 02:57:51.190
Talk to me that one before.
Next.

2756
02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:56.280
Unity of action develops from fullness of information in combat.

2757
02:57:57.340 --> 02:58:00.820
All ranks have to know what is being done and why it is being,

2758
02:58:02.250 --> 02:58:04.290
<v 5>if confusion is to be kept to a minimum.</v>

2759
02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:08.940
This holds true in all types of operations,
whatever the service,

2760
02:58:10.990 --> 02:58:11.823
however,

2761
02:58:12.310 --> 02:58:16.510
a surplus of inflammation clouds the mind and may sometimes depress the spirit.

2762
02:58:16.511 --> 02:58:17.500
We can take one example.

2763
02:58:17.501 --> 02:58:22.030
Commander might be confronted by a complex situation and his solution may be a

2764
02:58:22.031 --> 02:58:25.120
continuing operation in three distinct phases.

2765
02:58:25.630 --> 02:58:29.350
It would be advisable that all hands be told the complete detail of phase a,

2766
02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:33.730
but it might be equally sensible that his subordinates only his subordinates who

2767
02:58:33.731 --> 02:58:37.840
are closest to him be made fully informed about phase B and phase c.

2768
02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:43.450
All plans in combat are subject to modification as to circumstances dictate this

2769
02:58:43.451 --> 02:58:45.580
being the case,
it is not better.

2770
02:58:46.570 --> 02:58:50.650
It is better not to muddle the men by filling their minds with a seemingly

2771
02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:55.150
conflict of ideas or conflict in ideas.

2772
02:58:55.390 --> 02:58:59.650
More important still,
if the grand object seems too vast and formidable,

2773
02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:04.540
even the first step toward it may be a pure doubly difficult fullness of

2774
02:59:04.541 --> 02:59:09.541
information does not void the other principle that one thing at a time carefully

2775
02:59:10.571 --> 02:59:15.571
organized all down the line is the surest way prioritize and execute.

2776
02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:19.900
There is no next,

2777
02:59:19.901 --> 02:59:24.901
there is no excuse for malingering or cowardice during battle is the task of

2778
02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:25.721
leadership.

2779
02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:30.400
To stop it by whatever means would seem to be the surest cure,

2780
02:59:30.430 --> 02:59:34.300
always making certain that in doing so,
it will not make a matter of

2781
02:59:34.380 --> 02:59:35.213
<v 3>worse.</v>

2782
02:59:37.780 --> 02:59:38.680
<v 5>Next.</v>

2783
02:59:39.310 --> 02:59:43.360
The armed services recognize that there are occasional individuals who nervous

2784
02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:48.600
and spiritual makeup may be such that they erode rapidly and may suffer complete

2785
02:59:48.761 --> 02:59:50.920
breakdown under combat conditions.

2786
02:59:51.610 --> 02:59:56.320
They still may be wholly loyal and conscientious men capable of doing duty

2787
02:59:56.321 --> 03:00:00.400
elsewhere.
Men are not alike in some,

2788
03:00:00.430 --> 03:00:02.080
however willing the spirit,

2789
03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:06.490
the flesh may be too weak to punish,
degrade,

2790
03:00:06.491 --> 03:00:11.491
or in any way humiliate such men is not more cruel than ignorant when the good

2791
03:00:13.751 --> 03:00:17.710
faith of any individual has been repeatedly demonstrated earlier service.

2792
03:00:17.860 --> 03:00:21.940
He deserves the benefit of the doubt from his superior pending study of his case

2793
03:00:21.941 --> 03:00:25.660
by medical authority.
But if the man has been a bad actor,

2794
03:00:25.661 --> 03:00:29.350
consistently has officers warranted in proceeding on the assumption that has

2795
03:00:29.351 --> 03:00:30.360
combat failure.

2796
03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:35.400
Just one more grave moral dereliction to fail to take proper action against such

2797
03:00:35.891 --> 03:00:40.891
a man can only work on usual hardship on the majority trying to do the duty

2798
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:49.450
next,
the United States abides by the laws of war.

2799
03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:55.640
It's armed forces in dealing with in their dealings with all other peoples are

2800
03:00:56.011 --> 03:01:01.011
expected to comply with the laws of war in the spirit and to the letter in

2801
03:01:01.841 --> 03:01:06.841
waging war we do not terrorize helpless noncombatants if it is within our power

2802
03:01:07.691 --> 03:01:11.770
to avoid doing so.
Wanting killing,
torture,

2803
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:16.830
cruelty or the working of unusual and unnecessary hardship on enemy prisoners or

2804
03:01:17.351 --> 03:01:22.351
populations is not justified under any circumstance like wise respect for the

2805
03:01:24.311 --> 03:01:29.311
reign of law as that term is understood by the United States is expected to

2806
03:01:29.501 --> 03:01:34.270
follow the flag wherever it goes.
Pillaging,

2807
03:01:34.450 --> 03:01:37.840
looting and other excesses are as a moral,

2808
03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:42.790
as unmoral where Americans are operating under military law as they are living

2809
03:01:42.791 --> 03:01:46.850
together under civil code.
Nonetheless,

2810
03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:51.290
some men in the American services will loot and destroy properly unless they are

2811
03:01:51.291 --> 03:01:53.150
restrained by fear of punishment.

2812
03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:57.320
War looses violence and disorder.

2813
03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:02.630
It inflames passions in makes it relatively easy for the individual to get away

2814
03:02:02.631 --> 03:02:04.580
with unlawful actions,

2815
03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:09.890
but it does not lessen the gravity of his offense or make it less necessary.

2816
03:02:10.010 --> 03:02:12.500
That constituted authority put him down.

2817
03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:14.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2818
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:19.070
<v 5>The main safeguard against lawlessness and hooliganism in any armed body is the</v>

2819
03:02:20.491 --> 03:02:22.680
integrity of its officers.

2820
03:02:23.730 --> 03:02:28.730
When men know that their commander is absolutely opposed to sus such excesses

2821
03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:33.270
and we'll take forceful action to repress any breach of discipline,

2822
03:02:33.810 --> 03:02:35.190
they will conform.

2823
03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:41.220
But when an officer winks at any degradation by his men,

2824
03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:45.570
it is no different than if he had committed the act.

2825
03:02:47.230 --> 03:02:51.480
Remember that one young leaders out there on the battlefield,

2826
03:02:52.980 --> 03:02:55.680
but an officer winks at any degradation of his men.

2827
03:02:56.210 --> 03:03:00.570
It no different than if he'd committed the act and if you hold the discipline,

2828
03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:06.030
if you call the discipline,
they will conform.
If they know where you fall,

2829
03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:08.520
where you stand,
I should say,
if they know where you stand,

2830
03:03:10.350 --> 03:03:11.250
they will conform.

2831
03:03:13.710 --> 03:03:16.020
Next on the field of sport,

2832
03:03:16.530 --> 03:03:20.120
Americans always talking up to keep nerve steady and degenerate.

2833
03:03:20.130 --> 03:03:25.130
Confidence the need is even greater on the field of war and the same treatment

2834
03:03:25.141 --> 03:03:29.820
will have no less effect.
When men are afraid they go silent.

2835
03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:34.770
Silence of itself further intensifies the fear.

2836
03:03:35.910 --> 03:03:39.360
The resumption of speech is the beginning of thoughtful,

2837
03:03:39.390 --> 03:03:42.540
collected action for self.

2838
03:03:42.541 --> 03:03:47.541
Evidently two or more men cannot join strength and work intelligently together

2839
03:03:47.610 --> 03:03:50.640
until they know one another's thoughts.
Consequently,

2840
03:03:50.850 --> 03:03:55.850
all training is an exercise in getting men to open up and become articulate,

2841
03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:57.853
articulate,

2842
03:03:57.890 --> 03:04:02.630
even as it is a process in conditioning them physically to move strongly

2843
03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:07.390
together.
Once again,

2844
03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:12.820
step in,
even talking is action.
That starts to dispel fear.

2845
03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:13.733
Hmm.

2846
03:04:14.610 --> 03:04:19.320
Next inspection is more important in the face of the enemy.
Then during training,

2847
03:04:19.321 --> 03:04:24.300
because a found piece of fouled piece may mean a lost battle and overlooked.

2848
03:04:24.301 --> 03:04:28.620
Sick man may infect a fortress and a mislaid message can cost a war.

2849
03:04:29.790 --> 03:04:31.230
In virtue of his position,

2850
03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:36.000
every junior leader is an inspector and the obligation to make certain that his

2851
03:04:36.001 --> 03:04:40.140
force at all times is inspection proof is unremitting.

2852
03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:45.340
Then the last one,
I'm going to read the close out this book.

2853
03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:50.700
It's clear in battle crisis for majority of Americans present,

2854
03:04:51.611 --> 03:04:56.611
present will respond to any man who has the will and the brains to give them a

2855
03:04:58.181 --> 03:05:00.100
clear,
intelligent order.

2856
03:05:01.450 --> 03:05:06.450
They will follow the lowest ranking man present if he obviously knows what he's

2857
03:05:06.850 --> 03:05:10.900
doing and is morally the master of the situation.

2858
03:05:12.850 --> 03:05:17.850
But they will not obey a chuckle head if he has nothing in his favor but his

2859
03:05:20.801 --> 03:05:21.634
rank.

2860
03:05:26.740 --> 03:05:28.540
And that's,
that's it for this book.

2861
03:05:28.541 --> 03:05:31.900
And I think that closing statement,

2862
03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:35.410
<v 6>okay,</v>

2863
03:05:35.410 --> 03:05:40.360
<v 5>don't be a chucklehead,
don't be a chocolate.</v>

2864
03:05:40.361 --> 03:05:44.890
And this is just talked about earlier that they will follow the lowest man,

2865
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:50.030
the lowest making ranking man present if he knows what he's doing and is the as

2866
03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:54.130
morally the master of the situation and can give a clear,

2867
03:05:54.131 --> 03:05:59.060
intelligent order.
And I think the rest of the,
you know,

2868
03:05:59.090 --> 03:06:00.620
if you're a chuckle head,

2869
03:06:00.621 --> 03:06:02.900
people aren't going to listen to you just because of your rank.

2870
03:06:02.901 --> 03:06:06.020
And I talk about that all the time.
You shouldn't use your rank.

2871
03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:09.140
<v 6>Okay.
And</v>

2872
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:14.120
<v 5>I think this book actually,
you know,
give some pretty,</v>

2873
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:19.400
some pretty obvious ways to avoid being a chuckle head.
Gee,
humble,

2874
03:06:19.490 --> 03:06:22.370
be calm,
educate yourself.

2875
03:06:23.210 --> 03:06:23.590
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2876
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:24.910
<v 5>Workout hard,</v>

2877
03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:28.840
physical physicality is important.

2878
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:33.190
It's all the stuff.
Same stuff that we talk about all the time.
And again,

2879
03:06:34.210 --> 03:06:36.970
these are universal and I know we've got a lot of listeners that are overseas.

2880
03:06:36.971 --> 03:06:37.870
This stuff was this,

2881
03:06:37.890 --> 03:06:42.470
it's applying to Americans for this applies basically a worldwide.
Yeah.

2882
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:43.990
At least Western world.

2883
03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:51.330
And they've stood the test of time.
They work today,
so fall on them

2884
03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:54.073
<v 6>and,</v>

2885
03:06:58.990 --> 03:07:03.990
<v 5>and lead this lead in everything you do is start by leading yourself with these</v>

2886
03:07:04.241 --> 03:07:08.500
principles.
Because if you can't,

2887
03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:12.880
there's no way that you can lead others

2888
03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:16.180
if you can't lead yourself.

2889
03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:23.380
And I'll tell you where little over the three hour mark right now.

2890
03:07:23.381 --> 03:07:26.890
So it doesn't look like we're going to be doing Q and a this episode.

2891
03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:33.480
So if anyone is out there still listening at this point and they want to know

2892
03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:39.370
how to support the podcast Echo,
tell them how to do it well,

2893
03:07:41.470 --> 03:07:44.770
there's a few ways.
Yeah.
So let's start with the,

2894
03:07:45.080 --> 03:07:48.790
a lot of times I feel like it's just like kind of repetitive.

2895
03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:50.800
Well it is repetitive.
Yeah.

2896
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:55.030
And since we've already had people listening for three plus hours at this point

2897
03:07:55.330 --> 03:07:58.270
we can feel free to move quickly,
I think.
Yeah,
I think so.

2898
03:07:58.271 --> 03:08:00.790
But here's the thing though.
Oh,
there's a,
but I did.
Yeah.

2899
03:08:00.791 --> 03:08:03.010
I did more thinking where,

2900
03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:08.220
what if this is the first time somebody was listening or maybe the second time

2901
03:08:08.381 --> 03:08:10.510
it won't be as repetitive.
Okay.

2902
03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:14.920
But if it's a person that they're going to listen to other ones,
sure.

2903
03:08:14.921 --> 03:08:15.730
To go back.

2904
03:08:15.730 --> 03:08:16.563
<v 1>Yup.</v>

2905
03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:19.740
<v 5>And they can listen to one of those episodes.</v>

2906
03:08:19.741 --> 03:08:22.300
That's an hour and a half and they going to be like,
oh,

2907
03:08:22.301 --> 03:08:26.700
I'm going to listen to a little bit more.
But right now if we go long right now,

2908
03:08:26.860 --> 03:08:30.600
yeah.
They may not listen at all.
Yeah.
Now some people say,
well,
we do.
It's fun.

2909
03:08:30.601 --> 03:08:33.030
We liked that.
No,
no.

2910
03:08:33.090 --> 03:08:37.830
Nothing is fun after three hours long and there's so much good information in

2911
03:08:37.831 --> 03:08:39.900
this book though.
I went long.
I'm sorry,

2912
03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:44.580
but I'm not really sorry.
There's good information.
Yeah,
that's the game.

2913
03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:49.060
It's good.
But I think we could proceed quickly.
That's what I think.

2914
03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:51.870
Sure.
I dig it.
That same,
no banter.
You know,

2915
03:08:51.871 --> 03:08:55.620
I know you've got things you want to talk about him with this stuff,
but avoid

2916
03:08:55.620 --> 03:08:59.320
<v 4>the banter.
The key here is really the,
okay,
look,
I can,
okay,
we'll go ahead.</v>

2917
03:08:59.370 --> 03:09:04.100
We'll go into it on it.
Supplementation,
you know,

2918
03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:06.900
sometime sometimes,
hey,
I don't need supplements,

2919
03:09:06.901 --> 03:09:10.320
I have a great diet or I'm just not into it.
Just in general.

2920
03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:15.680
I have to successfully conveyed the importance of supplementation or at the very

2921
03:09:16.801 --> 03:09:21.270
least the value.
Go ahead,
do it.
So I'm not going to banter with you.

2922
03:09:21.450 --> 03:09:24.990
I'm just going to go ahead and get after it right here as far as weight cause

2923
03:09:25.140 --> 03:09:28.830
you can anyway.
All right,
Chaka real quick on it.

2924
03:09:29.460 --> 03:09:30.151
Supplements,

2925
03:09:30.151 --> 03:09:34.680
if you didn't already know Krill oil or EDC k our EDC,

2926
03:09:34.681 --> 03:09:36.750
everyday consumption of supplements,

2927
03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:41.900
essential Krill oil for your joints and this is good because the legit one,

2928
03:09:42.930 --> 03:09:46.200
it's not the one where they kill a bunch of Krill,

2929
03:09:46.201 --> 03:09:49.380
grind them up and then sell it to you.
It's like a goose.
She's the real deal.

2930
03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:53.770
That helps you.
I can tell you the story about how it helped me,

2931
03:09:53.771 --> 03:09:58.600
but listen to the other 52 podcasts if you want to hear that story.

2932
03:09:58.601 --> 03:10:03.450
Yeah.
Just so I understand if you're going for results on it.
Supplements,

2933
03:10:03.451 --> 03:10:07.780
Krill oil,
EDC,
Krill oil,
Alpha brain,
shroom tech.

2934
03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:10.840
Where are your bars?
Even though those aren't really supplements,
they're like,

2935
03:10:10.841 --> 03:10:14.200
but you do eat them every day.
Yeah,
everyday consumption.

2936
03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:18.460
And I got the uh,
the preworkout good.

2937
03:10:18.850 --> 03:10:23.610
I'm going to give it a shot and non stimulant by the way.
So you're not jittery.

2938
03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:26.500
Jittery.
Yeah.
Nothing like this.
And it's um,

2939
03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:29.790
it's like there's like earth grown ingredients in there as well.
Good.

2940
03:10:29.800 --> 03:10:34.210
It actually tastes good.
So audit calls,
things earth grown ingredients.

2941
03:10:34.270 --> 03:10:35.620
I'm just going to,
I know it sounds cool.

2942
03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:39.840
Where else are they growing space and wouldn't it be cooler if they grow space

2943
03:10:40.110 --> 03:10:42.270
or subterranean or something?
What's up?

2944
03:10:42.580 --> 03:10:46.090
Why are they trying to make it sound cool?
Good stuff.
How would they say that?

2945
03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:49.510
Well,
the answer has grown.
The answer to that is lab grown.

2946
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:54.010
If you can grow stuff in the lab or just concoct it chemically and the lack

2947
03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:58.320
quiet.
So I'm just saying that's the differentiator.
You went,
which is good.

2948
03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:02.910
You went earth grown is actually cool.
It's a good thing.
And,

2949
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:07.390
and if there's any more questions about these types of growth.
I was thinking,

2950
03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:10.030
I was thinking moon base alpha.
Yeah.

2951
03:11:10.031 --> 03:11:12.850
And if you can indicate the benefits of anything mooned grown,

2952
03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:15.250
I'm sure that they would provide that on the website or whatever.

2953
03:11:15.251 --> 03:11:19.540
That's where I get it.
The information anywhere Alpha brain is proven as well.

2954
03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:22.990
That's the thing with nootropics.
Nootropics,
which help your brain.

2955
03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:26.680
A lot of times people will be like,
Eh,
it's a placebo thing.

2956
03:11:27.220 --> 03:11:30.310
They went through the real test to prove that it works.

2957
03:11:30.311 --> 03:11:34.360
Proven scientifically fact that it's dope.
Anyway,

2958
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:39.700
on a.com/chocolate get 10% off.
If you want 10% off,
if you don't want 10% off,

2959
03:11:39.701 --> 03:11:44.080
just go on it.com paypal price,
boom,
support everybody,

2960
03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:45.830
everything,
whatever,
whatever.
No,

2961
03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:48.460
you're actually not supporting anybody and you're definitely not supporting us.

2962
03:11:48.461 --> 03:11:50.170
If you don't do that.
That's cool.

2963
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:55.210
We'll technically it is cause it's like you're still getting your supplements.

2964
03:11:55.930 --> 03:12:00.760
You know,
you're still getting supplementation.
We're just not getting the credit.

2965
03:12:00.761 --> 03:12:05.410
So just like if like you donate to a cause and you put anonymous in the thing

2966
03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:10.840
and then you donate another 10% same thing.
See what I'm saying?
Anyway,

2967
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:13.600
I'm going to just let this one go and that's a good way because I realized I'm

2968
03:12:13.601 --> 03:12:17.100
guilty for making these things longer cause I'm interjecting.
Yeah,

2969
03:12:17.140 --> 03:12:21.820
I should just be quiet.
Be Quiet.
What's your podcast?

2970
03:12:21.821 --> 03:12:24.100
So you say whatever you like.
Our podcast,
come on.

2971
03:12:24.310 --> 03:12:29.310
So on it is one of the ways to support to wrap it up on.com/jocko get 10% off.

2972
03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:35.020
Help hates they're good.
Just trust me.
They're good.

2973
03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:41.170
Another good way.
Christmas is almost here,
man.
It's like what?
For three,

2974
03:12:41.171 --> 03:12:44.320
four days,
something like that.
So I'm like that.

2975
03:12:44.980 --> 03:12:47.620
If you shop in Amazon,
click through the website.

2976
03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:52.010
That's a good way to support.
Click through the website.
That's called

2977
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:55.490
<v 0>Jocko store.com or called Jocko podcast.com</v>

2978
03:12:57.240 --> 03:12:59.990
that's the website you got to click through,
correct?
Yes.
Jocko,

2979
03:12:59.991 --> 03:13:03.770
podcast.com over on the side,
there's the Amazon little banner.

2980
03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:07.910
Click on that one before he damaged Amazon shopping for Christmas or whatever,

2981
03:13:07.911 --> 03:13:12.080
or buying any one of these books that that Jocko talks about on the Jocko story.

2982
03:13:12.081 --> 03:13:15.120
You got to go on the menu items support and then it'll take you to the page with

2983
03:13:15.121 --> 03:13:16.970
the band.
Hey,
speaking of which,
a podcast,

2984
03:13:16.971 --> 03:13:20.810
100 as we talked about when Tim was on this podcast,

2985
03:13:20.811 --> 03:13:22.040
Tim Ferriss was on this podcast.

2986
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:27.200
We're going to do Musashi for podcast 100 because it's a big,

2987
03:13:27.201 --> 03:13:30.990
big,
big book.
Oh right.
You mentioned that we need to get it on the Po,

2988
03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:32.750
so that will be on the website.

2989
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:35.600
So you can buy that book now cause it's a thick book and when to do it for

2990
03:13:35.601 --> 03:13:38.330
podcast 100 right.
You can click through.

2991
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:43.610
The other thing is that's beneficial about these ways of supporting the podcast.

2992
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:47.540
No advertisements on the podcast except for this here,

2993
03:13:47.541 --> 03:13:49.490
which I guess could be considered an advertisement,

2994
03:13:50.720 --> 03:13:55.600
but I don't want to have the,
and now for a commercial break.
Yeah,

2995
03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:00.200
we would like to present.
Yeah.
Something that doesn't matter.

2996
03:14:00.260 --> 03:14:04.760
Are you tired of sleeping right?
You know,
that kind of stuff.
Yeah.

2997
03:14:04.970 --> 03:14:07.760
So yeah,
the Amazon please.
That's a good one.
That's like,
um,

2998
03:14:08.030 --> 03:14:09.230
cause it doesn't cost them nothing.

2999
03:14:09.231 --> 03:14:13.070
It's like super easy and it's like you're kind of just in the whole game of
just,

3000
03:14:13.071 --> 03:14:16.310
you know,
reinforcements,
support,
Amazon,

3001
03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:19.220
click through the website before you do shopping,
boom.

3002
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:23.870
You can also subscribe to the podcast.
I know that seems obvious,

3003
03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:27.590
but sometimes you don't.
Back to this,
you know,

3004
03:14:27.591 --> 03:14:29.630
you talk about this sometimes Amazon,

3005
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:33.530
so you can click through Amazon,
right?

3006
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:36.800
Let's say you're going to buy something that's not expensive,
like a,

3007
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:40.730
like a bunch of pins.
Sure.
Or some duct tape.
You might think,
aw man,

3008
03:14:40.731 --> 03:14:43.540
I'm just going to go directly to Amazon because that's no big deal.
Right?

3009
03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:45.980
We don't need to support the podcast on this purchase.

3010
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:48.860
There's two problems with that.
Number one,

3011
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:51.800
if no one bought their duct tape without clicking through,

3012
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:55.310
we wouldn't get any of the benefit of having the site there.

3013
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:59.510
The other thing is you've got an extra exercise,

3014
03:14:59.511 --> 03:15:01.880
daily discipline in all things and that if you get,

3015
03:15:02.180 --> 03:15:03.890
my point is that if you get in the habit of doing it,

3016
03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:07.400
then you'll be in the habit.
Otherwise if you only do it sometimes,

3017
03:15:07.401 --> 03:15:12.401
then the time you go out and buy a lawn mower then you know,

3018
03:15:12.591 --> 03:15:14.660
or something,
somebody bought a set of golf clubs.

3019
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:16.980
Remember that guy say he's like,
I just bought some ball golf course,

3020
03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:20.790
like thousand dollars set of golf clubs,
clubs he clicked through,
you know,

3021
03:15:20.930 --> 03:15:22.700
so that,
that definitely supports the podcast.

3022
03:15:22.970 --> 03:15:24.980
But it's because he had the discipline,

3023
03:15:25.570 --> 03:15:30.570
the reinforced reiteration of doing it all the time.

3024
03:15:30.830 --> 03:15:33.440
So just do it.
Just do it all the time.
That's my recommendation.

3025
03:15:33.740 --> 03:15:34.790
Yeah it is true man.

3026
03:15:34.791 --> 03:15:38.300
Cause that's kind of the key is to remember to do and here's the end and

3027
03:15:38.301 --> 03:15:41.720
everyone's duck tape counts and,
and here's the thing,

3028
03:15:41.721 --> 03:15:45.080
like you're under no obligation to do that.
I'm just saying,

3029
03:15:45.290 --> 03:15:50.070
most times you'd be like,
Hey,
I want to support the podcast.
It's cool because you

3030
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:54.990
<v 4>know,
but at the time of,
you know,
hey,
I need my duct tape,</v>

3031
03:15:54.991 --> 03:15:59.110
I go and do it.
I buy the duct tape and it's like,
oh,
I forgot.
You know,

3032
03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:03.210
just to kind of avoid that kind of situation.
If you have any in your mind,

3033
03:16:03.211 --> 03:16:06.510
that's really the key is to remember that then you're living with the guilt

3034
03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:11.460
barely can go on anyway.
Yeah.
So yeah,

3035
03:16:11.461 --> 03:16:15.900
I'll do that or subscribe to the podcast or end subscribe to the podcast I

3036
03:16:15.901 --> 03:16:18.690
should say.
Yup.
It seems obvious on iTunes he subscribed,

3037
03:16:18.691 --> 03:16:20.850
but I don't know if you haven't already subscribed,

3038
03:16:20.851 --> 03:16:25.710
that's a good way to support and leave a review man.
If,
if you're compelled to,

3039
03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:30.750
those reviews are pretty dope by the way.
I'm subscribed on Youtube.

3040
03:16:30.751 --> 03:16:33.900
We are along with the podcasts in video format.

3041
03:16:34.650 --> 03:16:37.770
We'll do some excerpts stuff you can share with people that they don't,

3042
03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:40.560
they don't have to commit to three hours and you know,

3043
03:16:40.561 --> 03:16:44.280
however long the case may be to listen to the whole podcast thing and just

3044
03:16:44.281 --> 03:16:48.240
listen to the,
you know,
three minute,
one minute,
five minute even.
You know,

3045
03:16:48.241 --> 03:16:52.770
things about whatever the case may be,
but whatever little excerpts,
you know,

3046
03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:55.110
um,
I think those are beneficial.

3047
03:16:55.111 --> 03:16:58.950
I think when people share that time with me,

3048
03:17:00.330 --> 03:17:02.910
I think you can learn a lot.
For sure.

3049
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:07.010
I think there's a lot to be said for it.
I think I agree with you.

3050
03:17:07.700 --> 03:17:12.560
Or we have store,
Jocko has a store,
it's called now you say,

3051
03:17:12.561 --> 03:17:15.680
I have a store.
We have a store.
Not My store.
Yeah,

3052
03:17:15.681 --> 03:17:20.540
but if I say Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store.

3053
03:17:20.541 --> 03:17:24.670
Okay.
It just sounds kind of cooler.
Okay,
so let's find a regional name too.
Yeah.

3054
03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:27.740
Yeah.
So I was trying to do that,
but kind of interrupted.
But that's cool.

3055
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:29.720
There's some cool shirts on there,

3056
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:32.610
some layers on the shirts and we'll let you look.

3057
03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:38.870
You see the layers on your own,
soGood@jockostore.com.

3058
03:17:40.260 --> 03:17:42.010
See if he can find the layers on the shirt.

3059
03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:46.950
I'm not saying to buy a shirt or a tank top or a Hoodie or forest.

3060
03:17:46.980 --> 03:17:48.180
I'm not saying to buy one,

3061
03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:51.630
but if you feel compelled to buy one because you think they're cool,

3062
03:17:51.690 --> 03:17:55.650
the layers hit you,
they resonate with you.
I don't like that word resonate.

3063
03:17:55.810 --> 03:17:59.400
You use it anyway.
If they resonate with you,
get a shirt.

3064
03:17:59.550 --> 03:18:03.600
That's a good way to support
some patches too.

3065
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:08.230
Do you know the,
the ones that with the Velcro,
this regulation,

3066
03:18:08.231 --> 03:18:11.770
those are on there too.
Yup.
Per your and other people's requests.

3067
03:18:11.890 --> 03:18:16.890
We had a lot of military and law enforcement that wanted regulation size.

3068
03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:22.300
Yeah.
Second one.
Color in the field as has a crushing evil in the world.
Yeah man.

3069
03:18:22.920 --> 03:18:25.210
So yeah,
they're on there too and whatever else.
Uh,
you know,

3070
03:18:25.211 --> 03:18:27.840
you think is cool where I'm going to Redo the mugs,
they're going to be like the,

3071
03:18:28.090 --> 03:18:33.080
like a special like one,
like a super high quality one.
The travel mugs.
Yeah.

3072
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:36.680
The,
Yep.
And then,
um,
yeah,
there you go.
And,
and um,

3073
03:18:37.330 --> 03:18:41.500
psychological warfare.
See that was a done that turned out good.

3074
03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:45.550
And I'm going to tell you that I was listening to your explanation of what

3075
03:18:45.551 --> 03:18:48.130
psychological warfare was you to listen to it.
It

3076
03:18:48.130 --> 03:18:52.510
<v 5>is unclear you,
you,
you told the story,
but it was like,
you know,</v>

3077
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:55.030
we're talking to each other right now.
Yeah.
And you were telling me,

3078
03:18:55.031 --> 03:18:57.900
you're kind of telling me the story,
right?
But I know a bunch about it.

3079
03:18:57.940 --> 03:19:01.270
So when I listened to it,
I said,
you know what,
people that are aren't that,

3080
03:19:01.271 --> 03:19:03.520
don't know what this is are going to wonder what this is.

3081
03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:09.120
Echo asked me some questions about what I'm thinking about in certain situations

3082
03:19:09.251 --> 03:19:12.580
of weakness,
right?
Certain situations of weaknesses.

3083
03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:16.030
And he asked me a couple of minutes and I kind of told them like off the cuff,

3084
03:19:16.150 --> 03:19:17.800
oh I pick about this and this.

3085
03:19:17.980 --> 03:19:21.310
And he's kind of got that look in his face when I know he's thinking of

3086
03:19:21.311 --> 03:19:24.790
something.
So I said,
oh,
he's thinking of something.
And then the next day,

3087
03:19:24.791 --> 03:19:28.680
you know,
hey,
we got to do record these.
So he,

3088
03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:31.870
we came up with some more questions that echo is like,
oh,
this is a good one.

3089
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:32.703
This is a good one.

3090
03:19:32.930 --> 03:19:37.750
Came up with the questions and then I wrote down the answers and I read them

3091
03:19:38.530 --> 03:19:42.580
into a microphone.
We recorded it because that's what what eco does.

3092
03:19:43.390 --> 03:19:46.930
And then he said,
hey,
I'm going to make this into,

3093
03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:51.370
cause people ask for ringtones.
They give,
they want to be able to awake to,

3094
03:19:51.940 --> 03:19:56.500
cause they want to be able to wake to me alarm clocks and stuff.
So He's,

3095
03:19:56.501 --> 03:20:01.330
I'm going to put these on iTunes and put them for sale.
And I said,

3096
03:20:01.660 --> 03:20:03.040
oh well if that's what you think.

3097
03:20:03.280 --> 03:20:08.280
So the album is called s so it's an album of clips there like two or three

3098
03:20:09.791 --> 03:20:12.100
minutes long.
You know,
they're for,

3099
03:20:12.130 --> 03:20:16.580
they're for cub there for psychological warfare against moments of weakness.

3100
03:20:17.350 --> 03:20:20.020
And we're into the mode one once a weakness come when you want to get up in the

3101
03:20:20.021 --> 03:20:23.770
morning.
So there's,
there's actually,
cause I know that's a hard one for people.

3102
03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:28.360
There's three psychological attacks against the weakness of not getting out of

3103
03:20:28.361 --> 03:20:29.194
bed in the morning.

3104
03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:32.680
There's psychological warfare against wanting to eat bad food.

3105
03:20:32.681 --> 03:20:35.560
There's psychological warrant warfare against procrastination.

3106
03:20:35.650 --> 03:20:40.300
Just moments of weakness are covered in the psychological warfare album.

3107
03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:43.240
Very well covered.
And it's for sale on iTunes and you,

3108
03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:47.530
you got to search for w Jocko Willink or psychological warfare.

3109
03:20:48.070 --> 03:20:51.340
It's a little bit hard to find because of the way I tunes is laid out because

3110
03:20:51.341 --> 03:20:54.520
it's in spoken word,
but that doesn't drop down under music anyways.

3111
03:20:54.521 --> 03:20:59.080
It's kind of hard to find,
but it is on there and it's for sale.

3112
03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:02.860
And that is in fact another way to support the podcast because it is for sale

3113
03:21:03.010 --> 03:21:07.110
because people want to support the podcast.
And so they say,
hey,
you know,

3114
03:21:07.120 --> 03:21:11.200
how can we support the podcast and the,
you know,
we used to say,
people say,
Oh,

3115
03:21:11.201 --> 03:21:14.380
do you have this thing where you can donate money if it will just give you
money.

3116
03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:18.280
I don't want you to just to give me money when to give you something if you,
you,

3117
03:21:18.281 --> 03:21:21.940
you just don't give me money,
I'm not going to take it.
Well,

3118
03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:23.860
well there's been to public a couple people that have given money,

3119
03:21:23.861 --> 03:21:26.970
which is awesome.
We appreciate it.
But for the general,
for,

3120
03:21:27.050 --> 03:21:30.070
for my general a conscience,
right?
Right.

3121
03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:34.330
Reciprocation.
I want to give you something back.
So here's what we give you.

3122
03:21:34.570 --> 03:21:38.140
You give us money for the iTunes album,

3123
03:21:38.680 --> 03:21:39.880
you get something back and you know what?

3124
03:21:39.881 --> 03:21:44.380
You get back discipline in MP three format.
That's what you get.

3125
03:21:44.830 --> 03:21:46.000
So check it out.
They're

3126
03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.260
<v 0>pretty,
they're,
they're funny either no screaming,
but they're,</v>

3127
03:21:48.261 --> 03:21:50.570
they're getting after it in the feedback that I've gotten was awesome.

3128
03:21:50.571 --> 03:21:53.180
Like everyone's done Twitter zoo.
I bid out of bed.

3129
03:21:53.181 --> 03:21:57.530
Every time you I overeat know I didn't procrastinate on this project and the

3130
03:21:57.531 --> 03:21:58.290
debit.
Debbie said,
oh,

3131
03:21:58.290 --> 03:22:01.790
I got this project done a week early because I didn't want to procrastinate.

3132
03:22:02.780 --> 03:22:07.460
But two,
two side notes to that one.
If you're going to do the alarm clock thing,

3133
03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:12.020
he said this last time,
clear it with your,

3134
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:14.420
whoever you're sleeping with,
your wife or whatever,

3135
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:17.000
just make sure that they have the heads up because if they hear it,

3136
03:22:17.001 --> 03:22:20.180
they're going to flip out.
Yeah.
And they won't flip out because I'm going crazy.

3137
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:23.550
They'll flip out because all of a sudden there's a man in the room talking and

3138
03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:27.200
that's enough nice.
The fruit.
Somebody okay,
you got one.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3139
03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:30.170
So kind of go over it.
You know,
go over the plan.

3140
03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:32.270
You don't want to freak people out.
You having,

3141
03:22:32.271 --> 03:22:35.850
you're having your significant other were reaching for their sidearm.
Yeah.

3142
03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:41.030
Putting the laser on around the room.
Searching and a second side note.

3143
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:45.500
Good feedback for sure.
But it's been,

3144
03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:50.560
I look at the stats sometimes it's been number one and spoken word category on

3145
03:22:51.261 --> 03:22:55.370
iTunes.
Number one.
That's fine.
There's some other good people on that list,

3146
03:22:55.371 --> 03:22:57.320
but it's not,
it's been number one for,
that's awesome.

3147
03:22:57.650 --> 03:23:01.550
Since I put we put it on there.
Dang.
Anyway.
Well thank you everyone.

3148
03:23:01.551 --> 03:23:04.100
That's everyone that's leading.
Yeah.
Everyone that's,
that's picking that up.

3149
03:23:04.101 --> 03:23:07.850
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
That's awesome.
But yeah,

3150
03:23:07.880 --> 03:23:09.950
those are a gas solid ways to support.

3151
03:23:10.430 --> 03:23:12.890
A couple of other ways that you can support this.

3152
03:23:12.891 --> 03:23:17.780
One is you can get some Jocko white tea.
It's pomegranate white tea.

3153
03:23:17.781 --> 03:23:20.870
This on pomegranate.
Granted there can get some of that stuff.

3154
03:23:21.380 --> 03:23:23.990
If you haven't gotten it and you think,
I don't like tea,

3155
03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:30.530
you're wrong because you haven't tried this tea cause it tastes,

3156
03:23:30.531 --> 03:23:32.020
it doesn't take,
I'm telling you it doesn't taste,

3157
03:23:32.050 --> 03:23:33.800
I don't know what it tastes like.
You know what it tastes like.

3158
03:23:33.801 --> 03:23:34.940
It tastes like what it tastes like.

3159
03:23:34.970 --> 03:23:38.060
There's nothing else that you can compare it to.
It just tastes good,

3160
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:41.930
really good and it's got a little bit of caffeine in it.

3161
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:44.750
You can actually drink it before you go to bed if you need to.

3162
03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:47.570
You won't and won't keep you up.
It's not that kind of caffeine.

3163
03:23:48.290 --> 03:23:51.140
Is there different guys,
a couple of other kinds of earth grown caffeine.

3164
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:55.310
It's gets kind of caffeine that there's not a lot in there.
It's got,

3165
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:59.030
it's got antioxidants in there and it tastes really good and you can have it pre

3166
03:23:59.031 --> 03:24:03.710
workout,
post workout,
pre meal post-meal pre bed after bed,

3167
03:24:03.740 --> 03:24:06.440
during bed.
You can get her to have it whenever you want.

3168
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:08.720
So that's the Jocko white tea.
You can get that and by the way,

3169
03:24:09.470 --> 03:24:14.270
it's now been in stock.
I'm going on like three or four or five days.

3170
03:24:14.271 --> 03:24:17.540
It's in stock now.
We've got a better system.
We might have another fade.

3171
03:24:17.541 --> 03:24:19.040
I got some stuff on the horizon.

3172
03:24:19.041 --> 03:24:23.000
There might be a little little dip in the system,
but it's in stock in the,

3173
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:24.980
in the tin.

3174
03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:29.630
The luxurious tin luxury or the big box,

3175
03:24:29.720 --> 03:24:34.070
which has a hundred in it.
Reload,
reload,
and then you can get a mug.

3176
03:24:34.071 --> 03:24:38.030
You can get a mug.
By the way,
the Mug,
it'll tell you what to do.

3177
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:42.530
It'll tell you what to do every single time and will tell you to do is get after

3178
03:24:42.531 --> 03:24:43.980
it.
You know?
Did you get that Mug on

3179
03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:47.400
<v 5>there?
Jocko proofed and then extreme ownership.</v>

3180
03:24:47.430 --> 03:24:49.110
The book Christmas.

3181
03:24:49.170 --> 03:24:52.320
Why not get it for every single person you've ever known in your life,

3182
03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:55.350
you might as well know,
uh,
extreme ownership.

3183
03:24:55.351 --> 03:24:57.870
If you listen to the podcast and you kind of like what we talk about here,

3184
03:24:58.350 --> 03:25:01.080
the book extreme ownership,
it's about the same thing.

3185
03:25:01.081 --> 03:25:05.310
It's about combat leadership.
Also,
speaking of extreme ownership,

3186
03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:09.720
again,
New York City,
May 4th and fifth,

3187
03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:13.290
we're doing the extreme ownership muster.

3188
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:18.590
Number zero zero two the last one was zero zero one in San Diego,

3189
03:25:19.950 --> 03:25:23.370
this one zero zero to May 4th and fifth at the Marriott.

3190
03:25:23.610 --> 03:25:25.860
We're going deep on combat leadership,

3191
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:30.210
which means we're going deep on all leadership because the principals do not

3192
03:25:30.211 --> 03:25:34.710
change the thing.
That's cool.
Everybody that's there,
everyone's in the game.

3193
03:25:35.130 --> 03:25:38.010
Everyone's in the game.

We thought of that one and we look forward to seeing you guys there in the

3212

meantime.

3213
03:26:53.310 --> 03:26:53.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

3214
03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:56.670
<v 5>If,
if you want to kind of kick it with us,</v>

3215
03:26:57.240 --> 03:27:02.220
we are kicking it ourselves on the Inter webs on Twitter,

3216
03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:07.320
on Instagram as well.
And also we got to be on that one,

3217
03:27:07.321 --> 03:27:10.200
that Facebook ball,
how are we going to be,
their

3218
03:27:11.820 --> 03:27:16.820
echo is at Echo Charles and I m at Jocko Willink and finally

3219
03:27:22.980 --> 03:27:24.000
go out there.

3220
03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:25.830
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

3221
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:26.663
<v 5>and execute.</v>

3222
03:27:27.450 --> 03:27:31.920
And we talk a lot about a lot of different subjects on this podcast and we hear

3223
03:27:31.921 --> 03:27:35.490
from incredible leaders in the lessons that we learned today,

3224
03:27:35.491 --> 03:27:39.840
lessons that were learned and lessons that are written in blood.

3225
03:27:42.690 --> 03:27:46.650
<v 0>But those lessons are meaningless.</v>

3226
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:49.740
They're meaningless if you don't execute on them.

3227
03:27:52.150 --> 03:27:54.820
If you listen without doing,

3228
03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:57.520
you might as well not even waste your time.

3229
03:27:57.521 --> 03:28:02.260
Just keep being arrogant and wasting your time not being productive and not

3230
03:28:02.261 --> 03:28:07.261
living up to your potential to keep wasting your life if you're not going to

3231
03:28:07.541 --> 03:28:11.140
execute on what we learned.

3232
03:28:14.130 --> 03:28:15.120
But if you listen

3233
03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:21.510
and then you go and you do than stay on it.

3234
03:28:22.140 --> 03:28:25.950
And remember also that the rewards don't come easy.

3235
03:28:25.951 --> 03:28:28.110
Don't count on any glory.

3236
03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.430
Just hold the line.

3237
03:28:34.210 --> 03:28:35.043
<v 3>Great.</v>

3238
03:28:35.060 --> 03:28:38.930
<v 0>And stay on the path so that you know,</v>

3239
03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:46.480
so that you know that you are in the game 100%

3240
03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:52.950
and that you know that you

3241
03:28:55.260 --> 03:28:56.250
are getting after it.

3242
03:28:58.990 --> 03:29:00.700
So until next time,

3243
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:04.110
this is echo and Jocko

3244
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:06.800
<v 3>out.</v>
