United States military and political objectives in Vietnam,

18
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.460
whereas 44 veterans of how three gave their lives and supportive military

19

33
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.160
the most decorated navy squadron during the Vietnam War.

34
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>Whereas the maintenance and administrative personnel of how three contributed</v>

36
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.170
greatly to the success of the nine,

37
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.490
how three detachments operating throughout the Mekong Delta providing the

38

42
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.490
whereas how three delivered over 37,000 passengers and over 1 million pounds of

43
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.464
cargo.

44
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.230
And whereas how three was disestablished in March,

45
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
1972 at being three south Vietnam as part of the Vietnamese program,

46
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.190
leaving behind it,
a combat and humanitarian record recognizing,

47
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.460
recognized as bringing great credit upon the United States navy and its role in

48
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:46.360
the Vietnam War.
Now therefore be it resolved

49
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.730
that the House of representative one honors the service,

50
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.790
courage and sacrifice of the veterans of how three two honors the families of

51
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:02.641
how three veterans for their support three expresses its condolences to the

52
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:08.701
families and comrades of those killed in action and for recognizes how three as

53
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:15.490
a unique squadron in the history of naval aviation

54
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.413
<v 1>and that</v>

55
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.540
<v 0>resolution of recognition was made in 2010 actually 38 years after the sea</v>

56
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.530
wolves were disestablished in Vietnam.

57
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.130
And that is a long time to wait for recognition.

58
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.430
And this is because,
well,
for one thing,
they weren't looking for recognition,

59
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.500
but also too much of the world.
The seaward.
See Wolves were relatively

60
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.213
<v 1>unknown</v>

61
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.110
<v 0>for me,
having grown up in the seal teams,
I actually knew about the sea wolves.</v>

62
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.070
I knew about the reputation from the Vietnam era seals that held them in the

63
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:12.090
absolute highest regard
possible.

64
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.880
<v 0>Then they were considered extremely courageous,
courageous,</v>

66
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.820
sometimes beyond courageous.

67
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.680
They were incredible pilots and the highly aggressive gunners and the teams that

68
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.910
maintain and kept the aircraft flying it really horrible conditions.

69
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.310
They were known for getting the job done.

70
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.450
And there's one thing that always stuck in my mind when I heard stories about

71
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.960
the sea wolves in Vietnam,
and that was this,

72
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.630
simply if you called them,

73
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.540
they would come
and it didn't matter if it was day or night,

74
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.420
sunny skies or typhoon rains,

75
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.960
a calm extraction or a hot landing zone filled with enemy fire to the seawalls.

76
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.820
None of that mattered.

77
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.470
<v 1>Okay?</v>

78
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.210
<v 0>What mattered is that the troops on the ground needed help and if you called the</v>

79
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.044
sea wolves,

80
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.940
<v 1>okay,</v>

81
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.773
<v 0>they would come.</v>

82
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.910
<v 0>And it is an honor today to have one of these men here with us to tell us about</v>

84
00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:23.940
this.
Relatively unknown.
But at the same time,

85
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.840
legendary squadron of Naval Aviation Helicopter Attack Squadron Light,

86
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.240
how three the sea wolves.
And we have Dennis Rally,

87
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.100
naval officer,

88
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.790
naval aviator and of course Seawolf Sir,

89
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.550
absolutely honored to have you on the show.
Thank you for coming

90
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.690
<v 2>Jocko.
Hi.
Thank you.
And you echo a for the opportunity to be here.
It's uh,</v>

91
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.650
it's something that I didn't want to do.
If,
you know,
you hear the old saw about,

92
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:02.560
uh,
you don't talk about,
uh,
the war.

93
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.300
And I think that's true of most all of the guys that I knew and flew and fought

94
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:08.134
with.

95
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.140
We just don't talk about it except over a beer in a bar somewhere with that guys

96
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:18.340
we've trusted our lives to,
however,

97
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.390
my wife Stinky and my son and daughter when they heard about this opportunity

98
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.500
told me,
you got to do this.

99
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.370
You got to help keep the reputation of the seawalls alive.

100
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.060
And I don't think at reputation,
he's a lot of buildup on my part.
Uh,

101
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.030
I'm here to honor the 44 of our brothers who weren't able to come on back with

102
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:49.090
us.
And I'm here to help share a little bit of history about the,
uh,

103
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.953
the squadron.

104
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.840
And I'm here to thank everyone of you swinging Dick Gunners,

105
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.640
who helped me get my little pink body back without any additional holes in it.

106
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.480
Those guys are phenomenal.
I mean,
they're really something,

107
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.070
but we'll get into that.
Uh,
it's a pleasure to be here.
I am.

108
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.610
I looking forward to the conversation.
Uh,

109
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.730
I'm still scratching my head as to why I'm here because you guys have giant saw

110
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:21.460
on the show.
You just had a fella who was,
uh,

111
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.990
a highly decorated marine,
uh,
uh,
infantry officer.

112
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.000
He,
uh,
went on to get a law degree.
He went on who work in the Va.

113
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:33.910
He became the secretary of the navy.
He,
uh,

114
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.770
became a congressman from the great story of the state of Virginia.
And,
uh,
oh,

115
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:39.401
by the way,

116
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:44.110
it was a little known candidate for president of the U S and party politics

117
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:44.561
aside.

118
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:48.580
This country would have been better off if Jim Webb had been our president.

119
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.530
Totally agree.
Yeah.
And I can say that,
uh,
not from a,
you know,
just a casual,

120
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.710
uh,
a reading of his bio.

121
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.010
I know Jim because he was a classmate of mine at the Naval Academy.

122
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.600
I know Jim because it was a company made a mine at the Naval Academy

123
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.810
and I know Jim to be the,
uh,
the,
the kind of a man that,
uh,

124
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.070
I would hope my son would become just a great guy.

125
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.480
I can also say that I know Jim because for a brief time,
plebe summer,

126
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.590
we roomed together.

127
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.060
So you're looking at one of the only guys that you'll ever meet who is proud to

128
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.430
share the fact that he slept with the secretary of the navy.

129
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.440
So yeah,
we're,
we're here to spread the word and,
and have a little fun.
The,
uh,

130
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:40.010
the one thing that was really important about a recent past is a AC Wolf Wolfer

131
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:43.080
Union.
We have reunions every,

132
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.350
every couple of years and now many reunions more frequently.

133
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.300
But this one who was a pretty special,
yeah,
it was about two months ago.
We,

134
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:53.790
we gathered on the flight deck of the Midway,
uh,

135
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.800
for the premier of a documentary called scrambled to see wolves.

136
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.370
They had a big inflatable screen on the flight deck and we were all up there

137
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:04.270
laughing and scratching.
Uh,

138
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.430
one thing that I noticed about the entire experiences,

139
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.840
man over those guys look old now.

140
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.510
I mean with the,
the,
uh,

141
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.010
the movie,
the documentary was very well shot.

142
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.690
It's a actually being released on,
uh,
KPBS and PBS.

143
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:29.610
And I assume that shortly after that it'll be available on youtube.
But,
uh,

144
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.300
it,

145
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.300
it gave us a sense of pride and I think I can speak for everyone that it gave us

146
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:40.020
a,
a little greater sense of belonging,
uh,

147
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.490
based upon the fact that,
uh,
our,
our story could now

148
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.790
<v 0>be told.
Yeah,
no,
that's a,
I I've watched in,
anybody can watch it.
You can,</v>

149
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.750
if you Google scramble the Sea Wolves Kpbs uh,
the,

150
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.890
it'll pop up and you can watch it.
You know,
there's no email to sign up for.

151
00:10:55.891 --> 00:11:00.570
It's free.
That's how you can,
you can watch it.
Um,
let's,

152
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.800
let's talk about the seawall.

153
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.090
So let's talk a little bit about your past because I think,
uh,
you're,

154
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.450
I mean starting with your,

155
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.210
your dad being a pilot and now let's start with that and,

156
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.720
and what that was like growing up.

157
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.531
<v 2>Well,</v>

158
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:17.400
my dad would really be pissed off at you for calling him a pilot because dad was

159
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:22.080
an aviation who were under distress and he knew that the guys in the back,

160
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.070
we are doing the job and the guys up front,
we're just a steering the bus.

161
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.260
No,
my dad,
William John Raleigh was a,
a hell of a guy.

162
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.420
He was an interesting man.

163
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.550
And that's the nicest thing you can say about somebody.

164
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:40.110
I think dad was a kind of a guy who could walk into a room and,
uh,

165
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:40.970
uh,

166
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.340
full of strangers and an hour later walk out and everybody thought it was their

167
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.410
new best friend.
Good Guy,
great guy.

168
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.710
But he comes from a long line of Warriors.
My,
uh,

169
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.030
grandfather who married my grandmother from Hilo.
Uh,
yeah,

170
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.790
he,
uh,
he fought in a world war one.

171
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.240
I have a wonderful picture at home of my mom and her three brothers,
uh,

172
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.440
taken during World War II.
And,
uh,
Uncle Walt,

173
00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:10.570
who's there in his marine corps uniform.
Uncle Bob is there in his navy blues.

174
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.740
And My,
uh,

175
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.660
my uncle Jim is there and his army air force uniform.
Yeah.

176
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.880
And then,
uh,
when World War II broke out,
and my,
my dad and his brother,

177
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:24.910
my uncle herb both joined the navy.
Uh,

178
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.300
Dad went on into aviation ordinance and uh,

179
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.280
came out the other end of the pipe after piece is one of the last of the Tojo

180
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.080
chiefs,
the guy who made chief and a little over three years.
Uh,

181
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.010
uh,
he's an interesting fellow and a leadership lesson.

182
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:47.011
A number one for me was the way he helped me grow as I was,

183
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:51.800
uh,
coming up.
You would think that a chief petty officer in the Navy,

184
00:12:51.801 --> 00:12:56.770
it can be very gruff and directive and they can,
and they are when it's required.

185
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.870
But Dad's never told me,
go do this.
He'd say,

186
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.820
have you ever considered,
have you ever thought about,
have you ever,

187
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.900
and he brought it into practice one day when,
uh,
I was,
uh,
just,
uh,

188
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.240
getting ready for college and uh,
uh,
trying to decide where I was going to go.

189
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.850
He had just come back from a mid cruise and he had one of his [inaudible] a

190
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:26.650
pilot and Naval Academy Grad.
I invite me over to his house for dinner.

191
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.980
I know,
I thought that was a little strange,
but I was pretty excited about it.

192
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.150
The,

193
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.150
a guy came and picked me up in a brand new yellow corvette and took me over to

194
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:41.341
his home and introduced me to his drop dead gorgeous Swedish wife.

195
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.000
Now Dad didn't have to say you should go to the naval academy for the experience

196
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:48.580
in learning leadership.
He brought it down to,

197
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.740
to a level that I could understand if thought you'd get issued a sweetest wine.

198
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.880
Well,
actually what I want to Jocko was somebody five,
eight,
five,

199
00:13:57.881 --> 00:14:00.790
nine long straight,
blonde hair head bitchin bod.
What'd he come?

200
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.350
Completely intelligent and,
uh,
uh,

201
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.220
imbued with a meeting instincts of a wild and making heat.

202
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.900
But what the good Lord saw fit to pair me up with was stinky and she's a stumpy

203
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:15.220
little brown here,
your old that's just ornery as a sacral wild cats.
So yeah,

204
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.260
he ain't it funny how it all works out.
Uh,
so,

205
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.340
so you,
you,
you go meet this pilot and did that,

206
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:27.210
did that flip the switch in your head?
Well,
I,

207
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.160
I always knew I wanted it to be a naval aviator.
It's just something that I,

208
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.043
that I wanted.

209
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.580
I had initially had dreams of going in and flying spats that day one was a just

210
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:43.850
a hell of a weapons carrier in a close air support mission that,
uh,

211
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.340
was a non parallel in my way of thinking.
Uh,
they,
uh,

212
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.770
got a lot of guys out of the shit.
Uh,
but uh,

213
00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:53.630
that didn't work out because the aircraft was being retired is I was going

214
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.970
through flight school.
Uh,

215
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.010
the thought of going to the Naval Academy was always intriguing to me and I

216
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.880
didn't know that I'd be able to make that,
but I was one of the,
uh,
you know,

217
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:09.050
I'm sort of large and I was,
uh,
one of the only Navy,
uh,

218
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.470
dependents who are into athletics.

219
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.320
Cubis Saki high school on Okinawa,

220
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.150
where I went through all four years of high school.
And,
uh,
the,
uh,
senior,

221
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:24.200
a naval officer on the island had roomed with a hard and the football coach at

222
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:28.000
navy.
They did a,
a quick scout and,
uh,
uh,

223
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.210
told me to take a competitive exam and I'd,
uh,

224
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.760
be considered for the academy.
I,
uh,

225
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.010
had had a year to,
to waste while I was waiting to get into the academy.

226
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.480
So I went to Berkeley.
This is in the 1963 64 school year,

227
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.250
which was very colorful.
Mario Salvo was up there.
Doing is,
uh,

228
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.020
is a dirty word movement on the steps of the administration building was,

229
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.260
it was ugly.
My parents lived across the hill in Walnut Creek,
California.

230
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:00.740
And every time a news was over,

231
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.400
I'd get a frantic call from my mother.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah,
mom,

232
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:08.670
I'm okay.
It's,
yeah.
But at any rate,
uh,
uh,
following that,
uh,

233
00:16:08.671 --> 00:16:09.500
you're at Berkeley,

234
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.480
I had every seat of presidential a appointment and even though he was,
he had,
uh,

235
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.310
had been assassinated,
uh,
John Kennedy's signatures is on that.

236
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.020
Yeah.
And I went back to the,
uh,
uh,
to the navy,

237
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.360
uh,
fell in love with a crew.

238
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.690
And I can honestly say that if it hadn't been for rowing at navy,

239
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.690
I probably wouldn't have made it through.
I probably would have quit.

240
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.480
Which is something that you would have been pissed off about
is,
uh,

241
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.700
and why is that?
Because it gave you something to focus on.
It gave you an outlet.

242
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.800
I exactly,
uh,
crew is hands down the,

243
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:53.390
uh,
the greatest team sport that you can imagine.
It,
uh,

244
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.100
if even one person is not pulling their weight is not exactly in sync.

245
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.070
The rhythm of the boat,
uh,
suffers a,

246
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.040
it'll be dragged down and everyone will know exactly that.

247
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.770
The reason for that,
you can tell by the size of the puddle,

248
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:13.130
the way the boat is a set,
it's,
it's phenomenal.

249
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:18.131
So it's a great lesson in group leadership and that everyone has to be a leader

250
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.330
in that Shell to put their there,

251
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.940
the maximum that they can into it to make the boat move.

252
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.950
If you get a chance,
read a book called the boys in the boat.
It's at,

253
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.380
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
It's got great insight into what Roy is all about.

254
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.890
And you guys should be up on other sports.

255
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.810
And so you,
you,
you row at the Naval Academy.
How has your,
how has your,

256
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.170
since you've kind of grew up in the navy,

257
00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:51.090
your dad was a chief and it must've been at least somewhat for the,
you know,

258
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:55.380
the shock in awe of chill instructors and upperclassmen and all that stuff.

259
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.610
It wasn't the,
uh,
the drill instructors or the,
uh,
uh,

260
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.480
the upperclassmen.
It was the chicken shit.

261
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.620
I had a,
uh,
a guy in our company,

262
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:12.120
they just hated me and he'd stand me up in the passageway and they had a plastic

263
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.900
baseball bat and beat me in the chest with it.

264
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.990
It's a non event,
you know,
funk,
funk,
funk.

265
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.480
But if I saw that guy again,

266
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.500
I would rip his head off because it was just so juvenile.

267
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:28.430
I was a couple of years older than my classmates for a number of reasons.

268
00:18:28.431 --> 00:18:31.200
I flunked kindergarten,
but at any rate it was,

269
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.850
you just don't do things like that.
There's,
there's,
there's no,

270
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.740
there's no leadership lessons.

271
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:41.550
There's no benefit to be had from some of the stuff that was going on in there.

272
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:45.270
But when I got out there on the water with my teammates,
you know,

273
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.090
it all just went away.
Yeah.

274
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.350
There's something to be learned from having to put up with such crap.

275
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.040
And I think there's two ways people go with it.
Some sometimes they go with like,

276
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.580
oh,

277
00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.720
I'm going to be able to do that one day in and give people a bunch of shit about

278
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:03.510
whatever.
And some people go,
okay,
I'm never going to act like that.

279
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.140
Yeah.
Oh,
and then how,
and um,

280
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.820
so you were Jim Webb's roommate plebe summer,
uh,
just for a few days,

281
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.650
but we were in the same company for all four years.
Yeah.

282
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.140
And then he's a heck of a guy.
Yeah.
Uh,
no,
it was awesome.

283
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:24.990
It was a real honor to have him on here.
And you know,
he,

284
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:28.710
he told a similar story and he wrote about it and it's in some of his books,

285
00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:33.570
which was,
you know,
a guy just smacking him in the ass with a,
some kind of bat.

286
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.280
It was our song book.
And they're telling him he needs to say,
you know,

287
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:42.060
just admit that it hurts and he wouldn't admit it.
Yeah.
But same thing,
you know,

288
00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:45.390
he's like,
he,
he,
he,
what did he say?
He said,
you know,

289
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:47.790
I don't hold anything against those guys that did that to me,

290
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.530
but I remember their names.

291
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.130
So I think they've made the list for Jim Webb.
Um,

292
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.260
and then how did you end up picking,
so you,

293
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:02.310
you already automatically knew you wanted to be a pilot?
Absolutely.

294
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.000
And was that hard to get selected for that?
Uh,
no.

295
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.120
It was a service selection is done based on class rank and I graduated in the

296
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:16.700
top 10% over the bottom third of my class and that was sufficient to get me in

297
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.030
there.
And Aviation,

298
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.980
since I couldn't fly the spad I I really wanted to go jets,
sorry guys,

299
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.870
I have to admit that.
But,
uh,
due to due to my size,
uh,

300
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.510
and my anthropometric measurements,
if I had to punch out,

301
00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:34.200
I would have a lift my knees on the Glare Shield of the,
uh,
the trainers.

302
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:38.670
How tall are you?
Six.
Four,
yeah.
Big.
Um,

303
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.010
this was,
you know,
clearly,

304
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.040
and Jim Webb talked about this when he was on the podcast.
You know,
he's,

305
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.010
he was the guy in charge of hanging up the names of the,
that had been killed.

306
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.320
<v 0>And,
and yet when I had Charlie plum on who graduated,
I think in 64,</v>

307
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.830
or he showed up in 64,
no,
graduated 64.

308
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.360
Vietnam wasn't even on the,
on the radar.
That's for them.

309
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.670
And for you guys,
it,
you know,
1967,
1968,

310
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.960
it had to,
you know,
you had to have known,
okay,
I'm going to fight in Vietnam.

311
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.340
<v 2>When you walk into mother be Bancroft Hall,</v>

312
00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:18.060
you go into the return to which was a very large open area.

313
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.130
And when we started losing a are a former classmates,
the graduate,

314
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.880
uh,
I'm sure Jim explained,

315
00:21:26.881 --> 00:21:31.620
but if you put a poster board up there with the pitcher out of the lucky bag and

316
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:34.800
a,
a,
a brief bio and a,
and not a description,

317
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.750
but where they died.

318
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.190
And initially it was just a onesies twosies,

319
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:45.150
but pretty soon that the march went all the way around the Rotunda and they had

320
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:48.030
to move it up into memorial hall.
Uh,

321
00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:52.770
and it really brought home the fact that the,

322
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.920
this is,
this is serious,
this is a,
you know,

323
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.130
you're making up your minds whether or not you wanted a dedicate your lives to

324
00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:05.070
do the defense of this country.
And it might come at a considerable cost.

325
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.410
And for 44 of our brothers,

326
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:11.010
it certainly did 44 [inaudible] Willis didn't make it back.

327
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.950
And
I'm sort of an emotional guy,
but,

328
00:22:16.951 --> 00:22:19.230
uh,
one of the few times that I've

329
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.920
really cried

330
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.350
openly and unashamedly was at the wall

331
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.300
scene,
a scene,
a couple of my gunner's up there,

332
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.750
just a really brought it home to me.

333
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.590
Amazing people got to resolve.

334
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.770
<v 0>So that's,
that's what you know,</v>

335
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:52.771
you're getting into upon commissioning and so you,

336
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:56.770
you get commissioned and you graduate in [inaudible] 68 your class 68.
Right.

337
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.060
And you then you go to Pensacola,
Florida.
Is that where you go to flight school?

338
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.040
That's right.
And

339
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.550
that's what you talk us a little bit through the flight school path.

340
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.770
You show up,
you learn to fly.
What a t 38.

341
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.660
<v 2>Is that what you're wearing on?
No,
we,
you started out at at and t 34 and that,</v>

342
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.800
that's there's,
there's been a change in the way they,
uh,
they uh,

343
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.010
instruct naval aviators now when we were going through,
you had to do the flight,

344
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.990
the fixed wing flight syllabus first before you could get into helicopters.

345
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.170
And then you'd go through the helicopter,
a syllabus.

346
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.170
And then after that,
those of us that God orders to Vietnam,
we'd uh,

347
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.230
go up to Fort Rucker and the army would a instruct us in tactics in the armament

348
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.120
systems.
Uh,
they did,

349
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.290
they did a good job in preppiness and then send us overseas and the rest of it

350
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:57.180
would be done in country.
So the,
the,

351
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.920
the training that we received along the way was a,

352
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.710
was excellent pit a,

353
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:07.130
a lot of it was just like a back at the academy.
They told us that,
uh,

354
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.203
hey guys,

355
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.690
if the education you receive here at the United States Naval Academy costs the

356
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:15.380
taxpayer approximately $250,000,

357
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.830
which was a lot of money back then.
And our reply was,
yeah,

358
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:23.600
but you stick it up our butts,
a nickel at a time.
So you know,

359
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.610
you know,
had you,
so now you're in the pipeline for,
for helicopters.

360
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.430
Had you heard of sea wolf that this time,
were you hearing about it?
Did you,

361
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.480
is it something that you said,
oh,
I want to go do that?

362
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.670
We were just starting to hear about it.
And you know,

363
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:42.290
it wasn't a fully developed in my mind.
It,
uh,

364
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.090
that's uh,
uh,
where I wanted to go,
but it quickly became,

365
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.060
ah,
there is a,
a,

366
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:56.330
a purpose for every element in the military from the guys who's swabs the decks

367
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.060
all the way on up.
But I didn't want to be a bus driver.

368
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.360
I didn't want to be a guy who bored holes in the sky.

369
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:10.870
So this being the Seawolf immediately appealed to me as an opportunity to be

370
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:17.760
able to,
I don't know,
to payback.

371
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.340
It's,
it's a funny thing and I'll jump ahead a little here,
but,
uh,

372
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.750
I have a cousin who is very close to me.

373
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:33.761
She's like a sister to me and I'd never really thought about questions like you

374
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:38.060
just asked.
But,
uh,
after immediately after I got back from Vietnam,

375
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:41.930
she was driving me on out to family home in Walnut Creek,
California,

376
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:47.090
and without taking your eyes off the road,
she said,
how can you do it?

377
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.220
And I thought about that for just a minute and said,
well,
it was pretty easy.

378
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.670
I went over there to bring as many of our guys home safely as I could.

379
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.830
And in some ways I fail.
In some ways I succeeded,

380
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.540
but that's it.
I was enough of a student,
uh,

381
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.280
to,
to understand that the domino effect.
Uh,

382
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:15.020
certainly that,
that wasn't in my thinking.
Uh,
you know,

383
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:19.790
you're thinking sort of 10 yards,
10 yards,

384
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:23.480
but uh,
in the air it's a little a more expansive,
it's,

385
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.270
it's the guys that you're flying with,
the guys in your flat fire team,

386
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:31.050
the guys on your debt,
the guys who were a,
the maintainers back in a BIM Toohey,

387
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.310
they're the,
uh,
they're the guys you think about and that's why you do it.

388
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.280
Okay.
So did you get to select,
you get done with thumb,

389
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.920
you get done with the training?
Did you get to select,
hey,

390
00:26:42.921 --> 00:26:46.470
I want to go to the squadron new Vietnam?
Uh,
pretty much,
yes.

391
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.600
It was there a long list for that day.
They were there.

392
00:26:50.601 --> 00:26:53.880
I'm sure they were more volunteers than,
uh,
then,
uh,
I got accepted.

393
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.430
I don't know the mechanics of that.
I asked for it and that.
Got It.

394
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.220
How did that look like?
Showing up in Vietnam,

395
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.390
I was the only officer assigned to the Sea Wolves who,

396
00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:13.950
uh,
took that a reverse freedom flight on into Saigon.

397
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.610
And I got there and they shuffled me off to the Annapolis Hotel,

398
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.720
which I thought was a little unusual,
but,
uh,

399
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.190
uh,
you know,

400
00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:26.460
I had a couple of days to kill because there wasn't any transfer transport down

401
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:27.170
to,
uh,

402
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.530
to BIM two e and I knew a dear friend of mine,

403
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.690
uh,
who was it,
uh,
in debt to it,
Nah,
bay.
And he'd got over there before I did.

404
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.440
So I figured,
no baby,
that's not too far away.
I'm going to go visit him.

405
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.450
And the next morning I,
uh,
check out a 45 put it in my gym bag.
I'm in civvies.

406
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:50.220
They didn't like us roaming around town in onesies,
uh,
in uniform.

407
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.820
So I jumped on a navy bus out to not obey.

408
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.090
I'm just having a great time talking to the guys at the debt there and learn a

409
00:27:57.091 --> 00:28:01.760
little about what's going on.
And
it comes time to,

410
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:06.150
to leave and it's probably about 1630.
And I say,
well,

411
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.830
I better get back.
And they say,

412
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.340
well you just missed the last bus but don't worry about it.

413
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.450
You can take a petty cab.
So here I am,

414
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.680
a brand new in country.
I've got the Zipper in my uh,

415
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:23.100
on my gym bag open with my hand,
very close to it.

416
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.160
And this a Vietnamese fellow out with his pedaling away taking me back to the,

417
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.930
the hotel.
It took us about an hour to get back there and a,

418
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:34.680
I tipped him generously because I'm not a light fellow.
I was a lot lighter then.

419
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.910
But uh,
you know,
here I am my first day in country and I'm going to get greased.

420
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.693
So,
yeah,

421
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.510
tell us if you wouldn't mind some of the,
about the formation that sea wolves,

422
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.420
because it's,
it's a very cool story about the Mekong Delta,

423
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.220
about the way things,

424
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.840
the way the enemy moved through the Mekong Delta and through the wrong sat

425
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:00.750
special zone and there was no roads and the only way to get around with water,

426
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.590
if you want to maybe expand on that just so people can kind of get a feel for,

427
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.460
for what started this whole thing off.
Sure,
sure.
The,
uh,
uh,

428
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.590
the Mekong Delta is fed by a waters from the Himalayas.

429
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.780
It comes on down and spreads out into a broad,

430
00:29:17.781 --> 00:29:20.400
a quasar.
I always see Anik area,

431
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.850
basically it's mud and crap and brown water and a HIMSS,

432
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:30.810
the Brown water navy.
But at any rate,
the,
um,
the,

433
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.430
there are very few roads that do anything but connect major cities in the meek

434
00:29:36.431 --> 00:29:38.370
on,
uh,
back then.

435
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.680
And consequently it's just about all the traffics moved by a Sam pen,

436
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.410
uh,
or,
or junk.

437
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.110
And that's the way people got around the,
uh,

438
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.370
infiltration that the Nva and,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

439
00:29:57.371 --> 00:30:02.371
the VC practice came my largely either on foot by bicycle or by boat in order to

440
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.290
counteract that,
a task force.
So one,
one six,

441
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.640
a was put into place.
Game warden was the,
uh,

442
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.800
the operational mission and we were there to interdict that traffic in
personnel,

443
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:21.941
ammunition,

444
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.800
and a food logistics that was moving down into the delta.

445
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:33.100
The,
uh,
army,
I took that mission on first,
actually flying off a couple of,
uh,

446
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.590
uh,
Ltds,
uh,
that were a rigged with a,
uh,

447
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.630
this makes you flight deck.
But,
uh,
that didn't work out too well.
And,
uh,

448
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.650
this is not saying anything against the army,
but a,
in their syllabus,

449
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.250
they weren't trained on instruments in navy.

450
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:55.030
We were rigorously first in a fixed wing and then in helicopters.

451
00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.450
So we were used to flying in the shit and the navy and the army was not,

452
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.860
and that's,
that's because the navy has to fly at sea and land on,
on,

453
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.300
on ships,
different mission.
That's it.
Different missions at the time.
The Ai,

454
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:15.070
the army,
uh,
uh,
that outgrew that.
But it was a,
it was painful.

455
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:19.090
They had had a different mission than we did.
So,
uh,
they,
uh,

456
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.940
they had a,

457
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:26.941
a unit that was assigned to our op con and they would fly a cover for a,

458
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.710
for the small boats now.

459
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.910
And those were primarily the pbrs and the swift boats.

460
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.520
We didn't see many swift boats up,
had been luck.
Uh,

461
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:40.270
we were working with a PBR sailors,
a PBR patrol boat.

462
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:45.271
River is a 32 foot fiberglass luxury boat that was stripped clean and it was

463
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.660
highly maneuverable,
but it was a,
I say,

464
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.700
stripped clean of everything that was non essential.
They were very lightweight,

465
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.540
uh,
had a little armor at all,

466
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.630
but they were very heavily armed.
And these boats,

467
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.990
do you talk about guys with a brass balls?

468
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.880
They'd poke up into,
uh,

469
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.520
these impossibly narrow canals and up a little riverlettes,

470
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.450
uh,
just looking for trouble.
And it frequently came their way.

471
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.140
So the army was,
uh,
attempting to work with them.
There were all sorts of,
uh,

472
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.780
a minor operational,
a problem,
problems to overcome,
uh,

473
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:32.170
who's calling out the missions?
Uh,
uh,
but,
uh,

474
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:35.800
the support area is,
it's just wasn't working well.

475
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.960
So at the navy decided that,
uh,

476
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:42.961
we needed a navy squadron and they've turned HC one,

477
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.360
the fleet angels though,
uh,
to put,

478
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.560
put a few debts in place to help provide cover for the,
uh,
the Brown water navy.

479
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:56.090
And by Brown water navy,
I mean the small boat guys,
the seals,

480
00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:00.620
any navy,
Navy,
uh,
a vessel that was down in the,
uh,

481
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.600
in the McAllen.
And,
uh,

482
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.350
it wasn't working well with the,
uh,
the army HC one picked it up.

483
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.690
It started working very well,
uh,

484
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:15.800
because they understood the navy's mission much better than the army.

485
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.580
And they were,
uh,
equipped with the,
uh,

486
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.230
capabilities to fly both at night and in bad weather.
And,
uh,

487
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:29.350
I don't know if you've been in monsoon before that it's shitty flight.

488
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.410
It is really bad.
So,
uh,
as a,

489
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:41.150
as you've already mentioned,
on April fool's day in a 67,

490
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.190
uh,
they decided that they,

491
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:46.810
a in country squadron was a required and a,

492
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.260
that responsibility was shifted from HC one to how three.

493
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.370
Uh,
we grew to having non nine detachments,
uh,

494
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:58.040
that were scattered throughout the Delta is to,
uh,

495
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.490
give us a quick reaction time to virtually a,
any,

496
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.690
any area in the Mekong.
And,
uh,

497
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.280
each detachment had a two aircraft assigned.
It had a,
uh,

498
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.300
two full crews for each aircraft and that was about it.
But let me,

499
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.220
let me give you a little info on,
uh,
the noble you h one.

500
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.600
Bravo.
I love that aircraft.
It was a piece of crap.

501
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.290
It really was,
but it got us out of,
uh,

502
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.090
out of a lot of trouble every time we flew it just for people that are less
than,

503
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:36.860
that's the classic Vietnam Huey aircraft.
That's,

504
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:39.830
that's what you see.
That's what you see in movies.
That's it.
Yeah.

505
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.510
There really was sort of a,
a McHale's navy,
uh,

506
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.470
that,
uh,
Kay cachet that was attached to the sea wolves.
Uh,

507
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:55.610
the army was just getting rid of their bravo models to go to this,

508
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.710
to the Charlies,
which had,
uh,
several hundred,
uh,

509
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.510
greater horsepower or more maneuverable.
I Blah,
blah,
blah.
And they had a,

510
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.540
some old Bravo's sitting around.

511
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:09.260
And rather than shipping them back to the bone yard or destroying them in place,

512
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:10.400
they gave them to the navy.

513
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:16.100
So frequently we had a lot of rebuilding to do before we turn these guys loose.

514
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.020
But God bless the army,
they gave us a,
they gave us our,
uh,
our aircraft,

515
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:22.783
uh,

516
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.320
support for the Bravo and the navy chain was not the best.

517
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:31.040
So you've,
it's easy to say,
beg,

518
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:34.180
borrow or steal a borrower.

519
00:35:34.181 --> 00:35:39.090
Steel is what we did quite well,
quite well.
Our guys were incredible.

520
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.610
We achieve at,

521
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:45.030
grabbed a couple of guys and go out and come back with exactly what we needed.

522
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.670
And you don't ask a question about that.

523
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.340
You just put it into play.
Uh,
so the,
uh,

524
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:58.210
the nine debts to a helicopters in each,
uh,
each shoe Huey was,
uh,

525
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.870
basically configured with two seven shot rocket pods,

526
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.910
a 2.75 folding thin aerial rockets.
We had a,

527
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:10.560
a pair of a sixties that were mounted a with a flexicon.

528
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.350
They a copilot control those.
But the,
uh,

529
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:18.351
the thing that really made us a unique and powerful was our door gunners when I

530
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:22.380
first got there.
And just,

531
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.330
just for a very short period of time or door gunners were still firing sixties

532
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:29.850
from the shoulder.
And that

533
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.350
was just an incredibly powerful tool in keeping the bad guys heads down during

534
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:41.340
our break and prepping the area for the next aircraft to,
uh,

535
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.503
to roll in.

536
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.900
So we typically have a door gunner on one side and on the other side,

537
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:53.130
if we were lucky,
uh,
uh,
50,
uh,
eventually this grew,
we,

538
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:57.060
uh,
got some mini guns,
most all of our,
uh,
debt birds.

539
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.880
Eventually I had a mini guns and the guys in the Backwood a fly them and it did

540
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:06.620
wonders for keeping,
uh,
keeping heads down.
As did the,
uh,

541
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.790
50 cows that we had.
Uh,

542
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.140
when we went from shoulder hair held sixties too.

543
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.810
There's a lesson,
there are guys would,
uh,

544
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:23.811
it wasn't unusual to see them standing out on the skids firing a cover for us.

545
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.390
That was a great good thing.
But it also a re resulted in Brasington ah,

546
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.840
the a sync elevator and the or,
uh,

547
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.700
it just wasn't really,
really acceptable.
If you brass the tail rotor,

548
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.270
he'll know about it.
It's a rough ride going back in.
But uh,

549
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.940
at an eight decided that no,
we can't have that

550
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.650
sort of tied the gunners hands by,
uh,

551
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.760
putting what they called it pussy pole in the a and the door and mounted the,

552
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:55.980
uh,
the 62 it,
well,

553
00:37:55.981 --> 00:38:00.980
the guy's guy got more than a little inventive and decided that a,

554
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.850
if one 60 is good too,
would be better and mounted to one.
Uh,

555
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.920
yeah.
Here,
here we go again,
Hayden.
Thanks.
Yeah.
But,

556
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:11.250
uh,

557
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:16.180
mounted to sixties there and found out that they were blasting the,
the,

558
00:38:16.181 --> 00:38:17.940
uh,
the,
the tail rotor is still,

559
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:23.150
so what they did was they rotated each 90 degrees in opposing a directions and

560
00:38:25.351 --> 00:38:28.710
all of a sudden the Brasin was no longer a much of a problem.

561
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.030
Did essentially the same way with our fifties.
Uh,
they,
uh,

562
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.630
mounted that so that a would,
uh,
a fire,
um,
uh,

563
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.740
90 degrees a longitudinally.

564
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.260
And that was a very powerful weapon for not only,
uh,
uh,
keeping,

565
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:47.830
uh,
keeping guys down,
but also,
uh,

566
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.090
it gave us a great degree of flexibility in the,
in the break.

567
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.090
And perhaps I should explain a,
that by the break we typically,

568
00:38:57.091 --> 00:39:00.720
we would fly in a,
uh,
in a wagon wheel type,
uh,

569
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.190
type approach to helicopters,
uh,
roughly,
uh,

570
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.100
flying a one 80 out from one another.

571
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.570
So when his ruling on the target as the other is coming around behind it,

572
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.790
so when you then break off the target,
the next helicopter is in there,

573
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.650
a lane down it's fire.
And,
uh,
that,
that,

574
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:28.600
uh,
50 would,
would really help us out in both,

575
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.200
uh,
identifying problem areas and taking care of the problem.

576
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:39.560
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a great,
a great background.
And,
and you know,
even when you watch,
um,</v>

577
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:44.520
a scramble,
the sea wolf,
the,
just,
all the footage is just,

578
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.930
it's unbelievable footage of the way you guys were flying and what the gunners

579
00:39:48.931 --> 00:39:53.490
were doing gunners and hanging out and shooting underneath the bird back in the

580
00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:57.960
other direction.
Yeah.
Hanging out by a gutters belt.
Um,

581
00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.670
they might have invented the term gunner's belt.
I was,
go ahead.

582
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.800
<v 2>There's a rite of passage that,
uh,
most of the,
uh,</v>

583
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.140
fngs got.
And when I was in that Fng seat,

584
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.520
I learned it one dark and stormy night.
Uh,

585
00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:20.660
we're flying along and mia and they hack,
they,

586
00:40:20.661 --> 00:40:24.810
the aircraft commanders diverted my attention off to the left.

587
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:30.140
And when I turned back right here in the window of the Huey was one of my

588
00:40:31.081 --> 00:40:33.760
gutters mooning me.

589
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.520
This is going to be fun.
And the other was,

590
00:40:41.521 --> 00:40:42.210
uh,

591
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:47.210
if you were new to the debt as a pilot and you are going to get a collar full of

592
00:40:47.371 --> 00:40:52.170
brass and it was really easy for them to do when they had the free guns,

593
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.540
I think got a little more inventive of later on how that that's,

594
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.450
that's freaking dangerous.
This smart.
Okay.

595
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.980
<v 0>So speaking of fun,
one of the,
one of the things,
uh,</v>

596
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.740
I pulled off of the website,
um,

597
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:12.850
sea wolf.org is you guys had this thing that you called the Wolf Graham,

598
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.570
which was sort of sort of like a sit rep for all the,

599
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.580
all the different elements that were out there.

600
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.860
And I think it paints a pretty good picture of the overall attitude.

601
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.290
And I pulled out one of the clips and I'm just going to read it.

602
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.850
So this is your debt debt for from beautiful downtown.

603
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.103
Ben Luck.

604
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.230
The fog cutters of debt for would like to wish everyone a merry monsoon season.

605
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.120
Only 10 shopping days left.

606
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.920
We'd better start with Lieutenant Jg who white before we forget him.

607
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:46.100
Everyone else has.
He,
he uh,

608
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.630
he though he was leaving in May but bupers forgot to assign them a new duty

609
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:51.170
station.

610
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.160
Admin forgot to request a flight booking for him and operations forgot to inform

611
00:41:55.161 --> 00:41:58.490
him that this,
that is FTL papers had been signed,

612
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.790
but we're sure will finally fee,

613
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.670
but we're sure things will finally turn around for what's his name?

614
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:11.050
Lieutenant Deacon John Johnson left on rnr to Hawaii and lieutenant JG rookie

615
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:14.450
rich,
uh,
can't read the name.

616
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:20.170
Farmer farmer farmer was called into straightened out been toy bin Toohey

617
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.630
cutting us two,

618
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:27.800
three ftls and Amex commander Hammond,

619
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:31.130
we'll still have to fly every day even after the deacon gets back.

620
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.440
Boku map as Lieutenant Johnson is referred to by Mama Sohn won't be much good

621
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:38.450
for anything after coming back from Hawaii.

622
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.570
Rookie Rich's talent for hiding should be of great value in being Toohey.

623
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.750
Lieutenant Jg Check Carlos Steel has opened a chain of combination taco stand

624
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:56.690
slash mini gun exchange outlets with branches in Cuchi,

625
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.500
Tan,

626
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.030
Tan Anne and Ben luck with others soon to be opening in long been vain,

627
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:06.320

Lieutenant Jg,

628
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:11.060
weird Harold to black is still looking for is mysteriously vanishing and 60

629
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.953
bolts.

630
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.380
Latest debt for basketball casualty was lieutenant JG buckets coffee named after

631
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:23.390
his golden touch on the court who got four stitches in his head after going for

632
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:24.224
a rebound.

633
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.760
Who Will it be an April three additions arrived at this past month.

634
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:33.170
Lieutenant Tom Rebola and Lieutenant Jg Denny Rally,

635
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.130
which is you sir,
are new in country and Lieutenant Jg,

636
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.160
Bill Beltz was shafted shifted from debt eight oh well with TV,

637
00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:46.690
booze and all the attractions of the big city.
What more could you want as a,

638
00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:51.590
one of our departed pilots used to say going home is for sissies.

639
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.050
So,
and you guys,
these are all vibed there.
They're fantastic to read.

640
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:59.810
I read that to a,
my buddy Dave Burke or I sent,

641
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.530
I sent him a copy of it and he said that's the best sit rep I've ever read in my

642
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:08.060
life.
So you guys had a,
you know,
it's,

643
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:12.650
it's good cause you know,
I,
I always talking and every vet that comes on here,

644
00:44:12.651 --> 00:44:17.330
we kind of talk about how we have fun and that shows that.

645
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.800
And I guess getting mooned through your side window also shows that you guys

646
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:24.020
were having fun.
I don't know if the hot brass is a fun,

647
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.910
but you guys were having a great time and you guys were making it fun.

648
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.580
Um,
and at the same time,
man,

649
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.120
it was very intense and very dangerous.

650
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.230
One of the things that,
you know,
you,
you,
you kind of threw it out there,
you said,

651
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:40.351
hey,

652
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.230
we put these debts all over the place so we could have a quick response time.

653
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.360
And what that meant was you guys were spread out in these debts so that you

654
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:52.350
could get two guys on the ground within a matter of minutes.

655
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.370
Tell me about that op tempo and what it was like when,

656
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:57.750
when they scrambled theZ wolfs

657
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.170
<v 2>well,
we had,
uh,</v>

658
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.130
two full crews for each one of our two birds.

659
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.810
And what that meant was you were 12 hours on 12 hours off,

660
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.820
three 65,
24,
whatever.
Uh,

661
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.790
in order to support the,
uh,
the Brown water navy,
uh,

662
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.930
when they got in the shit,
they,

663
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.700
they needed us right away and we could literally get off the deck,
uh,

664
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.900
in about three minutes.
And,
uh,
that put us out there,
uh,

665
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.860
quickly enough that we could probably get them out of trouble.
The,

666
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:37.170
the worst thing that could,
could happen to them,

667
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:42.171
in my estimation other than a losing someone as a,

668
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:47.130
is losing their engine because then they were just a out there with,
uh,

669
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.000
uh,
they were a grape,
no,
no place to go.

670
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:54.510
So all they could do is just absorbed the,
uh,
uh,
the incoming.

671
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.240
And with that in mind,

672
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.140
what we would do is go on out and try and first get,

673
00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.400
get their heads down and then to start,
uh,
uh,
working the target.

674
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.380
Uh,
we had a very close relationship with the,
uh,

675
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:14.310
the PBR sailors very close.
Those guys,
uh,

676
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.230
were sticking their necks out every day and,
uh,

677
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.980
that the times they got in trouble,
we were happy to go and uh,
and uh,

678
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.800
try and extricate them on no matter up no matter what.

679
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.820
But one of the great quotes that I saw in the,
uh,

680
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.700
in the history that I was reviewing is,
uh,

681
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:36.810
the first contact that HC one made the,
the,

682
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.140
the two boats had gone out on patrol and had stumbled across a battalion size

683
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:48.531
element with a about 80 sampans and junks that we're trying to cross a river.

684
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:54.290
And the boats came under obviously intense fire when the sea sea wolves got

685
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:59.880
there.
A couple of,
uh,
uh,
minutes after this,

686
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.630
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,
incoming fire team league,
uh,

687
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:06.420
contacts the chief of the boat and says,
uh,
uh,

688
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.530
where do you want us to put in our strike?
And he said something like,

689
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.843
hell,

690
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.740
I want you boys to go in there and hold field day on those guys.

691
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.190
And that sort of,
the attitude that,
you know,
it is,
it's,
it,

692
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.180
it's an overused term,
but it's a brotherhood.
It,
it truly is.

693
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.600
A,
you did,
we do for those guys,
they were putting it all out.

694
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.360
Did you guys,
did you guys,
um,

695
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.600
pre brief with them for missions or how did you figure that out on the Oud?

696
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.790
You figure it out.
So did you know where they were going?

697
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:46.810
Did you know what their target was?
Did they pre-brief you?
Unfortunately,

698
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.160
we had a,

699
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:53.060
in intelligence that a was to put a kindly generally,
uh,

700
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.590
a piece of crap.
It wasn't very good for a number of reasons,

701
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.410
for a number of reasons.
But,
uh,
what we do is,

702
00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.660
so we talked to the guys on the boats.

703
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.040
We know what the tactical situation was in the way,
and we would,
uh,

704
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.790
uh,
know where they were going and what,

705
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:14.810
what they were doing.
That is,
are you going out for a bunker?
Are you,
uh,

706
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.380
doing an insert with seals?
Uh,
we'd get that information from the,
uh,

707
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.350
from the team that was there.
Actually,
we didn't have a team.
I play as a,

708
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.750
just as a squad.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
we'd share the,

709
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.100
share the information,
so we've know about where they were going and what we do.

710
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:36.040
As soon as we got airborne,
his head for the,
uh,

711
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:41.041
the pre very spot and they'd get a update the info in route so that by the time

712
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:45.250
we got there,
we knew that where the fire was coming from,

713
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:49.390
what the situation was with the boats and where we were likely to put in our

714
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:50.224
first strike.

715
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.580
So the deconfliction as far as where you were shooting in friendly fire and all

716
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:58.630
that was,
I mean,
as long as,
as long as they tell you,
hey,
north,

717
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:00.130
north side of the river or something like that,

718
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:03.040
is that how you would deconflict and did you,

719
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.840
when you were supporting ground troops,

720
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:07.700
how the hell did you know who was who down there?
And we'd buy,
uh,

721
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.870
have him pop smoke.
And that generally worked.

722
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:15.871
But the worst thing that could happen is when you say pop bread and one shows up

723
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:21.970
right where you expect it.
And when shows up 100 meters on down.

724
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.860
So,
uh,
the bad guys had,
are kind of freaks in,
uh,

725
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.420
uh,
well I don't know if they had her freaks or not,

726
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.530
but they could certainly see a smooth ride and uh,
if they'd pop it also right,

727
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.070
same one and that could create a little that confusion.

728
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:43.420
But it also gave us a,
a,
uh,
Lucas points so that we could,
uh,

729
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.960
talk to the guys on the boats and they could direct our fire.

730
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.950
And one thing that's important about that,

731
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.810
the 2.75 holding fee and an aerial rocket,
uh,

732
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.330
was a great tool.

733
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:04.350
I didn't like it as much because it wasn't all that uncommon to have one of the,

734
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:11.030
the fins not open properly and then it had just go squirrelly and go anywhere.

735
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.470
If you had the aircraft,
uh,
trimmed up,
uh,
it could be an effective weapon,

736
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.980
but I didn't like to use it too far out because that gave it more of an

737
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:27.320
opportunity to,
uh,
to develop a mind of its own.

738
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.500
I use it more as a,
as a close in weapon.

739
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:35.660
<v 0>So these,
the,
you'd be sitting in your,
in your hooch or whatever.</v>

740
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.310
And you'd be stamped,
you know,
just standing by what was your 12 hour shift.

741
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.510
And then all of a sudden the radio call would come in.
They'd,

742
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.430
they'd tell you guys go,
what was the procedure like from there?

743
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.960
<v 2>Uh,
assholes and elbows out to the aircraft.
The,
uh,</v>

744
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:56.460
one of the other crews,
first,
first guy,
there would a be a suddenly,
uh,
the,

745
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:01.880
the aircraft was pretty cocked,
but they'd go ahead and,
uh,
set the uh,

746
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.860
uh,
the uh,

747
00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:08.660
rockets up for us and uh,
jump in,

748
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.100
hit the button and go,
you,
uh,
every,

749
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:19.430
I think that it's safe to say that practically every operational mission that we

750
00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:23.810
flew,
we took off over Max gross weight.
Uh,

751
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.870
you pulled it up enough to get it out of the revetment and get it out there.

752
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.620
What we do when we were really seriously overweight,

753
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:38.390
it just sort of inching ahead and get a little forward,
a momentum,

754
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.560
uh,
on the helicopter and then drop the collective,

755
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.970
which puts all the way down on the skids and spread the skids and then pop it up

756
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:47.720
a little.

757
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.430
And the aircraft would be s would sling shot up to oh,

758
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.220
about three feet and then,
you know,
yeah,

759
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.400
hopefully you'll get across the [inaudible] fence at the end of the end of the

760
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.110
runway.
It was colorful,

761
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.060
but had to do it in order to carry enough ordinance to,
uh,
to get it

762
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.650
<v 0>guys out of trouble.
And then not,
I mean,
um,</v>

763
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.070
when we were in Iraq,
we always felt like the helicopters,
which when Ramadi,

764
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:17.910
the helicopters,
they wouldn't really fly over the city of Ramadi cause it was,

765
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:23.250
it was too dangerous for them.
Um,
the couple times that they came in,

766
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:25.020
it was like a,
it was like a,

767
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:30.240
just massive machine gun fire at them and they didn't really enjoy that too

768
00:52:30.241 --> 00:52:33.840
much.
But you guys were just so,

769
00:52:33.841 --> 00:52:37.410
so my point is that helicopters and actually vehicles as well,
they're,

770
00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:41.310
they're like bullet magnets,
right?
Everyone of you see a helicopter come in,

771
00:52:41.311 --> 00:52:44.850
the enemy just sees that and focuses on it.
You guys must have be,

772
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:47.040
you had to be taken fire all the time.

773
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.820
<v 2>Yeah.
All the time.
You get used to it.
The,
uh,</v>

774
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.450
one of my gutters reminded me of a,
uh,
the first time that,
uh,

775
00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.100
we saw a 51 cal coming at us.
It was a,

776
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:05.690
it was night.
And these things,
you know,
it's a big,
as a basketball,

777
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.050
it's as big as a freaking basketball coming up at ya

778
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.480
starting to see the tracers come up at it.
And he says,
Damn,

779
00:53:14.481 --> 00:53:17.850
you did the right thing.
I said,
yeah.
And he says,

780
00:53:17.851 --> 00:53:20.450
he lowered the collective immediately,

781
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.410
got down on the deck and then,
uh,
came around and we could,
could adjust.

782
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:29.700
But those things are frightening.
Oh yeah.
That's cool.
It's,

783
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:34.740
it goes with the turf.
You're,
you're,
you're 20 years old.
That was 23 at the time.

784
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.880
And
it's,
you think the mission,

785
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.120
you think the pride that you take in and the guys and the,
uh,
the,

786
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.880
the pride they take in you and it's frightening,
you know,

787
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:52.530
was there,
I was terrified at times.
I think we all were that,
uh,

788
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:58.150
you get by that you get by that you think about the guys down there who are

789
00:53:58.151 --> 00:54:00.900
really in the ship and it's easy to,
uh,

790
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:05.840
apply what you know tactically and,
uh,
get the job done.
That's a,

791
00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:06.900
that's another thing that,

792
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.050
that's why I was kind of asking you about meeting with the guys in the ground

793
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.640
because you guys are doing this and I'm sure in some situations you would never

794
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:18.690
met the people that were down there and you're still risking your lives to go in

795
00:54:18.691 --> 00:54:21.780
there and give them the support that they need.
Yeah.

796
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.730
It's what we did.
There's a,

797
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:30.600
there's a counterintuitive thing to two helicopters that you just mentioned,

798
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:34.860
which is when you're getting shot at from the ground,
if you get lower,

799
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.570
it takes away some of their field of fire.
Right?
Right.
So,
so you would think,
oh,

800
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.850
there's someone shooting at me,
I'm going to get up and go away.

801
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.470
When the reality is if you get lower,
you know that that person's,

802
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.050
there's gonna be trees or whatever.
Yeah.
Terrain features in between.

803
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.510
That's of take a little bit of time to,
uh,

804
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.200
to get your instincts go to that direction.
Yeah.
Yeah.

805
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.870
It certainly does,
but it's amazing how quick those instincts are development.

806
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.360
When you got somebody shooting Mecha.
Uh,
and then the maintenance crews,

807
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.840
the birds,
I saw pictures of birds,
they were just like,

808
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.990
it looked like they'd been used for target practice.
Yeah.
Coming back,

809
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.200
you go watch that movie a scramble,
the seawall.

810
00:55:15.201 --> 00:55:16.770
So it looks like target practice was used.

811
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.390
That's what they were using the boards for target practice.

812
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:21.720
That's what some of them look like.
And the maintenance crews would just,

813
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.280
they said they were making uh,
uh,
patches from beer cans.

814
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.430
That's true.
That's true.
And they get,
the guys were proud of that.
And the,
uh,

815
00:55:32.431 --> 00:55:36.360
the patch that,
uh,
was a beer cam would not be painted over generally.

816
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.670
Yeah.
Knowing that there was one thing that I want to say,

817
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.450
and then this is going to sound like I'm a one trick pony and my love for the

818
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:48.450
gunners.
Uh,
but those guys,
uh,

819
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.000
not only fired the weapons,

820
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:55.290
they service the weapons they serviced.
Uh,
the,
uh,

821
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.380
the helicopters,
they performed all the dailies.

822
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:00.330
They were all qualified plain captains.

823
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:05.340
They kept that thing up and running for us so that we could walk out with our

824
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:08.340
silk scarves and a strap the thing on and uh,

825
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:13.050
take them out to where they needed to be in order to get the job done.
No,

826
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.410
we're not air force.
We don't believe in silk scarves.

827
00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:22.440
Sorry.
Air Force brethren.
And then not,

828
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.010
so you're,
you're doing this,

829
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:29.130
<v 0>this is a crazy optempo operational tempo of 12 on 12 off 365 days.</v>

830
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:34.600
Yeah,
that's insane.
You get used to it.
You know,

831
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:39.010
it's funny.
I mean,
you got it.
You got eight hours of sleep.
Okay.

832
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.490
And then you got four hours to eat and then the other 12 hours you're on standby

833
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:46.480
to go fly into,
into gun battles.
I got for 365 days.

834
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.980
<v 2>Yeah.
I got nervous though when I wasn't flying.
You know,</v>

835
00:56:49.981 --> 00:56:53.910
a decent aviator wants to fly and uh,
it was hard.

836
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:58.200
Sometimes it's sitting around waiting for your turn.
We played,

837
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:02.970
lifted a lot of weight,
a plead a lot of volleyball for the,

838
00:57:02.971 --> 00:57:06.840
played volleyball a with and against the,
uh,
the seals and sometimes the,
uh,

839
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.450
the boat drivers,
uh,
it just,

840
00:57:09.451 --> 00:57:14.070
it was a 50 meters from the air from the aircraft.
And that kept us,

841
00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:16.530
kept us right there so we could respond quickly.

842
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:22.670
<v 0>And then,
um,
how often will you guys do in casualty evacuation?
Yes.</v>

843
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.260
<v 2>Only when needed.
Yeah.
It wasn't a primary mission of ours.</v>

844
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:32.270
If somebody got shot up and a needed to lift out of town,
uh,
we provide that.

845
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:37.130
And occasionally we'd get a call that,
uh,
uh,
someone,
uh,

846
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:40.400
was a wounded and,
uh,
uh,
we'd go out and pick them up.

847
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:45.460
But generally that was a job that was done by some certifiable idiots that I

848
00:57:46.701 --> 00:57:50.810
love.
The,
uh,
the dustoff pilots,
you've got to 20,

849
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.330
1920 year old kids that are out there given the keys to,
to a,
a,
a,

850
00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:59.480
a Maserati.
Chris,
this was only a Huey,
but still,
you get the idea.

851
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:02.780
They were crazy.
They'd fly into India.
Anything.

852
00:58:02.781 --> 00:58:07.300
My hat really goes off to him because,
uh,
uh,
they'd fly into areas

853
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:12.370
<v 0>where they shouldn't.
That's a,
another thing I talked about,
um,
with,</v>

854
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.990
uh,
Colonel Bill reader who was on this podcast and same thing.

855
00:58:16.991 --> 00:58:20.050
I mean he just said that the,
the pilots back then,

856
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:25.000
and maybe it's because the aircraft were a very inexpensive compared to the,

857
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.720
you know,
to what they fly nowadays.
They don't want to risk the aircraft now,

858
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.610
but he said he's got,
they would just fly into like,
it was a,
hey,
your,
your,

859
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.740
your aircraft is just going to get hit.
That's the way it's going to be.
Yeah.

860
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.590
Deal with it.
And if you ever get the,

861
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:42.320
get the operator

862
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.000
<v 2>Tunity to read,
uh,
the,
uh,
some of the,
uh,</v>

863
00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.640
citation for the congressional medal for the fees or Hilo pilots,

864
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:50.563
it's,

865
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.960
<v 0>it's incredible what they did.</v>

866
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.670
Now when I was an always on this show,

867
00:58:56.671 --> 00:59:00.810
give the same praise that you give to the machine gunners because the machine

868
00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:03.270
gunners in,
in a ground combat,

869
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:06.480
it's the machine gunners that are going to allow you to be able to maneuver and

870
00:59:06.481 --> 00:59:10.590
get away from a situation.
Um,
or maneuver towards,
you know,

871
00:59:10.591 --> 00:59:13.410
they're going to allow you to move.
And same thing with,

872
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:17.640
with your gunners and what they were doing.
So you had a gunner on each side.

873
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:22.070
That's right.
That would protect the flanks.
That's right.
One of them on

874
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:27.100
<v 2>either a 60 or a dual 60 and the other one on a 50 cal or in really corner.</v>

875
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:33.870
Eventually a mini gun.
Oh,
and then you guys got the mini guns?
Yes,
I will.

876
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:39.220
I looked at there wasn't real a real fast flash on the screen in scramble to see

877
00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:42.800
Wolfe's there's a mini gun and it's actually,
it's upside down.
You can't,

878
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.180
I had to pause it and to read it.

879
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.660
It said the Lord Giveth and the mini gun take away.

880
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.753
Yeah.

881
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:58.630
It was a formidable weapon for a close closer support.
Yeah.

882
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.240
For people that don't know what a mini gun is,
it fires.
It fires what?

883
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:06.860
5,000 rounds a minute.
I mean,
it's absolutely ridiculous.
What she hasn't sent it.

884
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:11.450
I don't know what the rate is,
but it's,
it gets your attention.
Yeah.
And it just,

885
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.520
it,
it's powered.
It's powered.
It's electrically powered.
So it,

886
01:00:15.521 --> 01:00:18.920
it actually feeds the ammunition faster than,
than a,

887
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:22.160
than a normal mechanical weapon could fire.
But it just,

888
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.620
it's crazy how much,
how much,
how many rounds,
because I think it's 5,000,

889
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:30.290
something like that.
It's a ridiculous amount.
And then you guys got those.

890
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:34.070
So those were on your birds while you were on deployment?
That's right.
Yeah.

891
01:00:34.071 --> 01:00:37.760
As far as the,
uh,
the mini gun goes,
you know,
it doesn't go bang,
Bang,
Bang.

892
01:00:37.761 --> 01:00:41.810
It goes business at the rate of fire is phenomenal in the,
uh,

893
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.550
the gunners loved it.
But you know,

894
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.470
there's a little John Wayne and all of us and I think,
uh,

895
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:52.460
every one of them would like to go back to the,
to the free guns.
One thing,
uh,

896
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:54.890
that I,
I do want to point out is that,
uh,

897
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.940
we were not very well equipped.
So when we were up in around a,
you know,

898
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:05.490
on patrol or,
or,
uh,
actually out there engaged in,
uh,

899
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:10.130
had to fly into a tank of gas up and uh,
and uh,
uh,

900
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:11.263
rearm

901
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:17.650
we'd go into an army base because the army had all the fuel and they had nails.

902
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.490
The a 2.75 makes a boom,

903
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:27.860
but if you can load it with flush jets,
you can really keep the enemy down.

904
01:01:27.861 --> 01:01:32.820
So we'd go on up there.
Uh,
depending on the tactical situation,
uh,
if,

905
01:01:32.821 --> 01:01:37.070
if we had a cause,
a fair,
uh,
Eh,
anti personnel,

906
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:41.180
uh,
some something developing on the ground,
we'd,
uh,
we'd load up there.

907
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:46.430
And that's where I saw my first Cobra.
The snake was an impressive,

908
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.980
uh,
aircraft.
It was so much,

909
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.820
it had so much more fire power than any one of our Hueys.

910
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:57.430
But where do you put the gunners?
You know,

911
01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.740
it's four and a half seating.

912
01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:03.770
They don't have any suppression for rolling off target other than a,

913
01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:08.270
your wing man.
And you know,
it was intriguing,

914
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:11.840
but it just didn't make sense to me there.
I remember this correctly,

915
01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:16.760
that at one point you're whoever the commander was at the time got offered,
Hey,

916
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:18.940
do you guys want some cobras?
And the answer was no,
we,
we,

917
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.600
we need to stick with the u s I'd heard that story.
I don't,

918
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.770
don't know whether it's true or not or,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
we'd like that.
But,
uh,

919
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:26.190
you know,

920
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:30.390
one of the guys you mentioned in the Wolfegram and I will mention his name.
Uh,

921
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.270
chuck steely,
uh,

922
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.320
object was quite a guy and he would go out,
uh,

923
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.030
on to requisition parts for us.
Uh,

924
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.130
at the time the army had a,

925
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.920
a contractor dine electron that was doing the,
uh,

926
01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:51.000
the work on their aircraft and you know,

927
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:54.000
they're bored out of their skull when they don't have anything to work on.

928
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:55.850
So they,
uh,
got a,

929
01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:00.970
a loach and started rebuilding it from spare parts from here and there and got

930
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:04.730
it to be fully functional and you know,

931
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.950
to have an observation helicopter like that,
uh,

932
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.550
to go out and a snoop and poop with us,
that would be incredible.

933
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:17.510
Chuck engineer to deal where for a refrigerator full of beer,

934
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:23.330
they'd give us this aircraft.
You know,
it was written off the uh,
roles there.

935
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.820
But uh,
you know,
they said,
hey,
if you have a problem,
let us know.

936
01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:30.440
We'll come down and take care of it.
I,

937
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.770
I like to think that chuck was unplugging our refrigerator when the Deno and see

938
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.210
Amy again and not just no,
but hell no.

939
01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.920
But that sort of thing was not unusual over there.
Yeah.
God Butts Chuck.

940
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.390
He did.
Did everybody a lot of great service.
The uh,

941
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:51.150
that speaking of beer,
apparently the,

942
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:56.470
the wolf on the Seawolf insignia somehow based on the low end brow beer can,

943
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.000
that's what they saw.
Allegedly.
That's what they say.

944
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.320
I can neither confirm nor deny.
You know,
strangely enough,

945
01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.190
I didn't drink much beer at all when I was over there because uh,
uh,
the,

946
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.430
the seem to treat it with something that a,
just put the taste off.

947
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:16.200
We all thought it was formaldehyde.
That was the,
the,
the going rumor.

948
01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:19.860
But when they told us that and go and I was in Guam,
my first deployment,

949
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:22.860
they told us the same thing.
Yeah.
That there was formaldehyde.

950
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:23.820
That rumor has been heard.

951
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:28.820
That rumor survived from 1969 to 1992 when I was on my first deployment,

952
01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:33.360
there was formaldehyde in the beer.
But how did the beer tastes awful?

953
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.400
And I kept trying to see if I could make it taste better,
but I didn't succeed.

954
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:44.790
There's,
so some of the stuff that you're talking about,
um,
you know,

955
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:47.160
from a leadership perspective,
you got,

956
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:51.930
you got guys that are risking their lives every time that call comes.

957
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.270
How,
how did you,

958
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.530
did you see guys that got to a point where they couldn't take it anymore?

959
01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:02.730
Did you,
did you have situations where you had to send guys back to the rear?
Um,

960
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:07.790
what did you do when you saw a guy kind of starting to start to get too nervous

961
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.420
to go,
uh,

962
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.150
this may sound self serving and I don't care.

963
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.200
I didn't see anyone in our debts and I did not see directly anyone who behaved

964
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:25.720
in a cowardly manner.
And overcautious manner.

965
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:30.670
Uh,
we didn't have anyone that,
uh,
was sent back to the,
to the rear.

966
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.970
Uh,

967
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:36.970
there was a comradery that you just can't explain to somebody who hasn't enjoyed

968
01:05:37.361 --> 01:05:41.290
it.
It,
uh,
it's an honor to serve with people like that.

969
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:46.770
And we all took pride in our reputations among our,

970
01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:52.060
uh,
our squadron mates.
So it wasn't hard at all.

971
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:57.340
And that was so clear when you watch scrambled to see Wolfe's.

972
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:02.440
It's so clear and there's this incredible,
um,

973
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:06.370
they,
you can see the comradery and you can hear it when you read through the,

974
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.330
the,
the wolf grams.
You can see that guys are having a good time.

975
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:15.100
And there's this,
I mean,
what I would consider,
and you can tell me if I'm wrong,

976
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:20.020
but like a peer pressure of,
hey,
we're gonna,
we're gonna,
we're gonna do this.

977
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:20.591
You know,
I've,

978
01:06:20.591 --> 01:06:25.591
I've often said that when you get to a good seal platoon is not a team.

979
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.810
It's not a platoon.

980
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.840
It's like a gang that makes a game and we just don't allow for that bad attitude

981
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:43.030
to creep out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I feel the same way about the,

982
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:43.670
uh,

983
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:48.670
the Se wolfs and this might be a good time to share with you the fact that,

984
01:06:49.691 --> 01:06:51.130
uh,
I,

985
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:57.450
at one time after a returning from Vietnam was so fed up with the mission that

986
01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:01.180
we were flying.
It was an aging aircraft.

987
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:03.400
It didn't have systems that were required to do the job,

988
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:08.401
that the job itself was not that important.

989
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:11.950
And you know,
you come from living on adrenaline,

990
01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:16.060
adrenaline for a year and then come back and uh,
you're expected to,

991
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.170
I dunno if I figure he really puts your,
a boots up on the table.

992
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:25.210
One day I got so pissed off in the middle of the morning,

993
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:29.400
I jumped in my corvette,
remember that maybe,

994
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:34.180
Hey,
I learned,
I learned,
jumped in my corvette and a,

995
01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.370
a tour on up to a corner auto.

996
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:41.200
And two of the seals that we operated with friends,
uh,
were there.

997
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:44.830
And I walked into the office.
They had their lsds pulled up face to face.

998
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:49.570
And I said,
guys,
I've had it.
I want to join up.

999
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.350
And they looked at each other and they locked up their secret.

1000
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:57.340
And each of them grabbed me by an elbow and took me up to the little club in

1001
01:07:57.341 --> 01:08:01.180
Coronado.
And we started pounding beers that tasted great,

1002
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.890
no formaldehyde there.
And by the middle of the afternoon,
they convinced me that,

1003
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:10.750
uh,
uh,
being a,
uh,
a peace time seal,
uh,
wasn't,

1004
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:15.740
uh,
everything that,
uh,
that I would expect.
And that,
uh,

1005
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:19.940
the Navy had put an awful lot of investment into making me what I was and I

1006
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:23.570
could make them far better contribution by continuing to fly.

1007
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.370
And I,
uh,

1008
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:31.330
I turned my back on my opportunity to find out whether I had what it takes to

1009
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:32.324
become a seal.

1010
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:38.360
<v 0>I'm surprised that those guys,
um,
you're,</v>

1011
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:42.960
I'm surprised they didn't talk you into it.
Those must've been,
it must,

1012
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:44.880
I'm strives once they got enough beer in them,
they did.

1013
01:08:44.881 --> 01:08:45.960
They didn't have you down at,

1014
01:08:45.961 --> 01:08:48.600
down at buds with the logo of the sand and over your head.

1015
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:54.090
Is there any particular missions in when you were in Vietnam that,

1016
01:08:54.091 --> 01:08:57.870
that stand out as,
you know,
one of the ones on scramble and see,
we'll set,

1017
01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.880
they talked about this was absolutely ridiculous.
They're talking about the,

1018
01:09:02.881 --> 01:09:05.090
the,
the helicopter was there,

1019
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.380
the helicopters were there supporting a unit on the ground.

1020
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:12.000
There was no one to relieve him.
Um,
they needed more fuel.

1021
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:14.280
They were running out of fuel.
The fuel lights on.

1022
01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:18.450
They're still no one to no one to relieve the helicopters and provide support.

1023
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:20.040
They say,
you know what?
Screw it.

1024
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:24.090
We're just going to stay until we run out of gas.
And that's,

1025
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.730
and that's what they did.
They stayed until they ran out of gas.

1026
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.170
The other group came in,

1027
01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:33.420
they used ammo cans to refuel,
to carry.
Once the,

1028
01:09:33.421 --> 01:09:37.980
once the fire on the ground had subsided,
they used ammo cans to refuel the,

1029
01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.580
the helicopters that were out of fuel so they could get back to base.

1030
01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.430
That's freaking crazy.

1031
01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.530
<v 2>Well,
you know,
we never really took time to think about whether it was crazy.</v>

1032
01:09:50.531 --> 01:09:51.364
You're not,

1033
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:56.730
you've got a job to do and you know that that's probably a natural way to,

1034
01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.300
to explain it.
That was the job.

1035
01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:04.590
You went out and did that because that's what was expected.

1036
01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:08.100
That's what the guys on the,
in the boats expected of you.

1037
01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.540
That's what the cl team that we had a,
these are the seals that we had operated.

1038
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.870
It had been luck expected and when they call you,
you go,

1039
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.390
<v 0>that's another thing I think is really,
um,</v>

1040
01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.020
impressive about the Seawolf says,

1041
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.110
well first of all they took volunteers to go do the job.
And uh,

1042
01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:30.820
and like you said,
a bunch of people volunteered.
But the other thing is,

1043
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.130
and I heard some of the vets talking about this,

1044
01:10:33.131 --> 01:10:35.590
some of the seawall phets talking about the fact that they'd say,
oh,

1045
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:38.500
I was in the navy and I was in the shit in Vietnam.

1046
01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.240
People say you were in the navy and you weren't in the shit.

1047
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.900
But the reality is people,
you wouldn't,

1048
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:48.930
I can't imagine that there was any of the gunners that when they join the navy,

1049
01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.530
they thought to themselves,

1050
01:10:50.531 --> 01:10:54.760
what I'm going to be is a door gunner in direct combat with the enemy.

1051
01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.790
These are guys that were joined the navy for whatever reason.

1052
01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:02.740
And they end up in that job where,
you know,

1053
01:11:02.741 --> 01:11:07.060
they're doing this day in,
day out and risking their life day in,
day out.
Not,

1054
01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:11.800
not really what they signed up for and yet they held the line over and over and

1055
01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:12.990
over again.
All of them.

1056
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.330
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it a ma,</v>

1057
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.310
it humbles me to have,
uh,
been able to,
a,
to operate with guys like that.

1058
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.300
And you know,
I'd be
the pilots.
Yeah.

1059
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:32.610
The pilot's a brass balls.
It was expected.
It was the job.

1060
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.190
The gunners had those balls and then some,

1061
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:40.230
because they kept us up and kept the aircraft up,
kept the systems up.

1062
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:45.900
I had a leadership lesson,
uh,
when I first got there,
uh,

1063
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:48.170
the grown up,
my dad,
uh,
you know,
he,

1064
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.690
we hunt and fish and I,
uh,

1065
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.660
had fired are we had to,
uh,

1066
01:11:55.661 --> 01:11:58.880
fourteens for each bird.
They hung on the back of the,
yeah.

1067
01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.930
Pilot's seat and I'd taken one on out.

1068
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:05.760
We had a little makeshift range and fired it and brought it back on in after I

1069
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:10.761
was done and took it in to the crew area to clean it.

1070
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.540
You would have thought that I had just stepped on a baby rabbit.

1071
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.340
I mean it was more,
it was polite,
it was respectful,
but give me that thing.

1072
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:29.490
And the guys had that feeling about,
uh,
the armament,
you know,

1073
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:33.780
it,
this,
this is my job,
I do this.
So,
you know,

1074
01:12:33.781 --> 01:12:37.560
it took a little getting used to,
it was easier to let them clean my 45

1075
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:46.570
<v 0>then,
uh,
I just kind of want to be,
you know,
when you're,
when you're there,
um,</v>

1076
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.950
you,
you start to get to know these guys really well.
I don't,
I don't,

1077
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.821
you didn't loot,

1078
01:12:51.821 --> 01:12:55.120
you didn't have anyone killed from your debt while you were there.

1079
01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.350
Is that correct?
That's correct.

1080
01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:02.040
But obviously other guys in other debts were killed while you were there.

1081
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.650
Did you guys have any kind of,

1082
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:08.950
and this is something I've talked about before is Americans and I think it's

1083
01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:11.740
just um,
cause we have so many different cultures here.

1084
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:16.090
We don't have a good protocol to deal with to deal with death.

1085
01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:21.400
And you know,
other,
other cultures around the world.
If someone dies,
you know,
you,

1086
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.330
you do this for a day,
you do this for a day,
you say this prayer,
you,

1087
01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.430
you go through the ceremony and then you move on.
And Americans,

1088
01:13:27.431 --> 01:13:30.040
we have so many different cultures here that are all mixed together.

1089
01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:33.460
And death isn't something that happens all the time.
So we really don't know.

1090
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:36.880
A lot of times,
Hey,
what am I supposed to do?
And I think that's what,

1091
01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.030
that's what causes people problems is they don't know.

1092
01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.400
They don't know how to handle it.
They don't know how to put closure on it.

1093
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.550
And so it just kind of sticks around.
When you guys would learn that,

1094
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.610
that someone,
your debt had been killed,

1095
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.310
was there any protocol that you guys set up?

1096
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.890
Was there anything that you guys did too,

1097
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:58.020
to try and take that on board and then move past it?
I probably

1098
01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:03.230
<v 2>not on a leadership opportunity and when a guy's got killed,
uh,</v>

1099
01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:08.630
and other debts in combat or even just a fairing and aircraft in for

1100
01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:10.760
maintenance,
uh,

1101
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:15.580
I didn't sit down with the guys and talk about it.

1102
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.400
I internalized it and being Irish,

1103
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.180
uh,
could reflect on all the good times we had.

1104
01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:29.620
Didn't think about,
uh,
what,
what went wrong.

1105
01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.660
It didn't want to know initially,
you know,

1106
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:35.380
eventually you do because it's important,
uh,
for,
uh,
uh,

1107
01:14:35.381 --> 01:14:40.270
for your trade that,
uh,
I just think about the good times that we,

1108
01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:43.510
uh,
we shared together.
I lost a couple of academy classmates.

1109
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.470
I lost some great friends that I made while I was in country.

1110
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.670
Uh,
when young fella,
and I don't want to mention any names,

1111
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.090
but he and I were,
uh,
both,
uh,
bicyclists.

1112
01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.640
And the one thing that he wanted to do when he got back home was built himself,

1113
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.050
the Primo bike and,
uh,
uh,
start,
uh,

1114
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.870
start competing and he never got that opportunity.

1115
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:13.390
And when you,
when you personalize something like that,

1116
01:15:13.391 --> 01:15:17.770
when you think about the opportunities that are lost in a heartbeat,

1117
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.030
uh,

1118
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:26.310
it makes you very thankful to be alive and makes you very thankful to have known

1119
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.274
that person.

1120
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:32.730
And it makes you feel like he should redouble your efforts to get the sons of

1121
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:37.520
bitches that,
uh,
that took that life away from him.
It death,

1122
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.600
you can help focus your aggression and that's a good thing.

1123
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.460
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
no doubt about it.
And that was,
um,
I guess my way,
again,</v>

1124
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:50.260
I was uneducated,
no one ever taught me,
but one thing I did is,
okay,

1125
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:53.830
we're going to go to work.
That's the thing that I knew how to do.

1126
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:57.550
That's what I still know how to do is like go to work.
And you know,
there's,

1127
01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.600
I guess you could say there's some,
uh,
you know,

1128
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.670
eventually you gotta you gotta deal with it.

1129
01:16:03.671 --> 01:16:08.200
You got to feel it more in the future.
But man,

1130
01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:11.710
when I was overseas,
it's like,
yeah,
okay,
we're going to work.

1131
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:14.230
And that's where the focus becomes because you know,

1132
01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:17.500
and also from my perspective was like,
you know,
your guys,

1133
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:22.750
that's what they would want you to do.
That's what they would want you to do.
So

1134
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.920
<v 2>let me,</v>

1135
01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.910
let me share something with you based upon what your guys would want you to do.

1136
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.830
Came home from a mission,
uh,
uh,
one night we were in contact and you know,
you're,

1137
01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:40.140
you're decompressing and I walk up to my rack and there's this Manila envelope

1138
01:16:41.001 --> 01:16:45.140
for lieutenant JG rallies eyes only.
And I feel,
oh no,

1139
01:16:45.141 --> 01:16:47.810
somebody back on back home has died.

1140
01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.430
And I opened this thing up with trembling hands and pull it out and it's a

1141
01:16:52.431 --> 01:16:57.050
standard navy message.
And I said,
hi honey,

1142
01:16:57.051 --> 01:17:00.380
I'm going to be in a 10 minute,
uh,
in three days time.

1143
01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:03.320
Come on up and then see me.
Uh,

1144
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.850
Shawn's mom felt the love of my life.
Call Sign Stinky.

1145
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:12.950
It doesn't anything to do with the personal problems.
It's a matter of attitude.

1146
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:14.443
Yeah.

1147
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:18.110
She was a flight attendant for Braniff and she was flying to freedom birds in

1148
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:21.140
and out and she had one coming in Ben Lux,

1149
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:24.200
only about 40 click south of us.

1150
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.560
I gone and okay.
And you know,

1151
01:17:27.561 --> 01:17:30.770
word immediately spread like wildfire throughout the debt.

1152
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:36.370
And my God,
God bless them,
they slept in a son,

1153
01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:40.130
a sandbag bunker,
or enlisted a crew,

1154
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.980
and it was normally pretty ripe,

1155
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:47.840
but it was also the only place that was really a,
it had a little bit of privacy.

1156
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:48.471
Well,

1157
01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:53.300
they had determined that I was going to bring stinking on down for lunch,

1158
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.210
pick her up in Thompson Newton and bring her on down.

1159
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.490
So they had that place spit shine.

1160
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:01.750
I don't know how he'd be at if it was already it.

1161
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.730
That turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.
We,
uh,
flew,

1162
01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.830
flew a helicopter on up to Thompson who,
and you know,

1163
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:12.380
we're going over a bad guy country.
So,
uh,

1164
01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.580
it was armed and I land the thing in front of,
I had no,
I didn't land it,

1165
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:20.300
I wasn't flying it.
Uh,
but we,
we landed in front of the,
uh,

1166
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:24.530
the terminal if they're at a Thompson Hooten,
uh,
immediately this air force,

1167
01:18:24.531 --> 01:18:28.490
a truck comes on out with it's cherry job going.
And this,
uh,

1168
01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:31.490
the sergeant says,
you can't land here.

1169
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.750
And I put it out to him that we already had and that we're just waiting for the

1170
01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:40.070
arrival.
And,
uh,
we solved the problem by saying,
listen,

1171
01:18:40.071 --> 01:18:41.420
this aircraft is armed.

1172
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.930
Why don't you stay here and watch it for us and we'll just be a little while.

1173
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:50.170
So we walked on over this big old green Braniff jet comes on in and everybody

1174
01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:52.790
gets off.
And,
you know,

1175
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:58.520
the incoming guys aren't nearly as gay and festive is he outgoing guys.

1176
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.560
So they get off in a,

1177
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:04.430
there's Gail standing up at the top of the ladder just waving at me.

1178
01:19:04.431 --> 01:19:07.340
So it turns out she can't get off the aircraft,

1179
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:10.370
but they didn't see anything about escalating on.
So,
uh,
you know,

1180
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:15.050
my crew goes on up to the ladder and we're in there and Gail's introducing them

1181
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:19.560
to the other stewardesses and they're loving it.
And,
uh,

1182
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:24.790
we go to the back of the aircraft and sat there for 45 minutes just talking with

1183
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:30.410
each other.
Uh,
but when we got back and Gail wasn't there,

1184
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.800
the guys were just crest fallen.

1185
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:37.400
They were so excited about having somebody there.
And you know,

1186
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.620
I,
I don't think the place who has ever cleaned again,

1187
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:48.550
but that was my experience with dating my hometown honey in the zone.
Yeah.

1188
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.120
Did,
uh,
what was it like,
um,

1189
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.250
was it standard Vietnam that were just replacements would come when it was time

1190
01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:01.310
for a guy to rotate out,
a new guy would show up?
Uh,

1191
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:03.740
pretty much like I mentioned earlier,

1192
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:08.820
I was Sorta Kinda drifted Dia Annapolis Hotel and happened to run into a guy,

1193
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:13.080
weird Harold who you referenced in that Wolfegram.
Uh,
the,
uh,
came,

1194
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:18.000
just walk them through,
uh,
with,
uh,
the,
uh,
debt for Omc,

1195
01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:22.080
a Colonel Hammond,
we called them a,
currently was a navy commander.

1196
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.670
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
Dave introduced us and said,
hey,

1197
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:30.120
this is a great guy.
We should have him.
And as it turns out,

1198
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:34.440
they had an opening and,
uh,
within a matter of a few days I was in debt for,

1199
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.990
so it,
it was sort of a roll your own environment.
Yeah.
You know,

1200
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.100
obviously they put guys into,
into slots where they needed them,
but,
uh,

1201
01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.030
they think that tick was fluid.

1202
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:51.480
So then not your time's coming up to,
to head home is it wasn't a one year,

1203
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:56.210
365 days.
Yeah,
pretty much.
Yes.
And then did you,

1204
01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.270
you stayed right on doing your 12 on 12 off until it was time to go.

1205
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.620
What they didn't normally do is for the last a week or two that you were in

1206
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:07.500
country send you into a bend to it for the,
uh,
for the,
uh,

1207
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:12.060
outprocessing and we'd fly with the c Lords.
So,
you know,

1208
01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:16.560
you didn't stop flying.
It was just a different mission and then you get back,

1209
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:20.340
I then you,
then you get,
okay,
your time's up and it's time to go home.
Yeah,

1210
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:24.990
pretty much.
Well,
you know,
there,
there'd be a little bit of a party.
I drunk acts,

1211
01:21:24.991 --> 01:21:28.290
but uh,
but other than that,
yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
that was,
that was it.

1212
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:34.070
Then how was that transition going from Vietnam and then what,

1213
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.800
how many,
how many hours later you're back in America or how many days?
Uh,

1214
01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:42.300
it was a,
he,
a street through shot.

1215
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:46.590
We stopped off in Honolulu.

1216
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:49.440
There was one other stop,
maybe Guam and then Honolulu and then home.

1217
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.580
It does straight through and it's a way you,
so you were,
you married,

1218
01:21:53.581 --> 01:21:57.210
you weren't married yet?
No,
no.
We got engaged on R and R and a Hong Kong.

1219
01:21:57.211 --> 01:21:58.410
And that's a two beer story.

1220
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:03.780
So you got R and r from Vietnam,
met your,

1221
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.190
your bride to be in Hong Kong.
That's right.

1222
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.710
And proposed a,
yeah,
the,
you know,
we'd already talked about it.

1223
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:14.880
We knew it was coming there.

1224
01:22:14.881 --> 01:22:17.370
I got down on a knee and Jimmy's kitchen and all of a sudden it,

1225
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:22.470
but it was pretty interesting.
Uh,
when I arrived in Hong Kong,

1226
01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.680
uh,
we were,
I booked a room at the Hilton,

1227
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.720
so I go on down there and you know,
I'm checking in and I'm in my,
uh,

1228
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:35.550
my uniform.
So the manager happens to be walking behind the desk and says,
ah,

1229
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.740
Mr loudly,
Mrs Lolly is waiting for you in your room.
I forget.

1230
01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:44.550
Shit.
Gail's getting here to tomorrow.
What's mom going to think?
Well,

1231
01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:46.740
of course Gail had gotten in a day early.

1232
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.320
She was in there lifting,
you know,
times were different back then.

1233
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.890
So your transition from,
um,

1234
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:02.910
from Vietnam back to America all of a sudden,
and you were,
you know,
people,

1235
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:06.100
people use the term wild west sometimes to described various

1236
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.610
<v 0>military situations where it was,
whoa,
it was like the wild west.</v>

1237
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.610
I don't know if it gets much more wild west thing being Seawolf Vietnam I read,

1238
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:19.030
it just doesn't seem the way you guys were running things the way the support

1239
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:22.000
that you got or didn't get the,
I mean,

1240
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:25.600
just the fact like you guys didn't even have flight suits.
They,
you had,

1241
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:28.300
they wouldn't issue him or something like that and you guys were just wearing

1242
01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:30.880
kind of what you,
what,
what you could get ahold of.

1243
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.680
Everything was sort of wild west.

1244
01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.760
<v 2>It took longer to get into a flight suit than it did a pull on a nomex shurtain</v>

1245
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:43.150
certain bands.
And frequently it wasn't no Max.
And,
uh,

1246
01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:47.570
as they say a,
you know,
I've flown missions in my tenny runners,
just,
uh,

1247
01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.780
we'd leave our,
uh,

1248
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.930
our gear there in the seat and if I was playing volleyball and,
uh,
they,

1249
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.690
they scrambled us.

1250
01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.960
You don't think about anything but getting in that aircraft and getting it

1251
01:23:57.961 --> 01:24:02.370
crankin.
Hmm.
So yeah,
it was wild west.

1252
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.420
<v 0>Thank God.
Yeah.
And then,</v>

1253
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:08.900
and then you get back to America and you're still in the navy,
right?
Yeah.

1254
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:10.323
How was that?

1255
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:14.410
<v 2>Well,
got through train,
you know,
first of all,</v>

1256
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:19.270
you're just decompressing now as a newly married a gal and her getting used to

1257
01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.820
living together.
Uh,
she's,
uh,

1258
01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:25.930
dealing with my unique personality and,

1259
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:30.310
uh,
it was sort of a scramble.
We partied art.

1260
01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:35.430
So when we got back a couple of,
uh,
uh,
seals,
one of them had a,

1261
01:24:35.431 --> 01:24:36.480
um,
uh,

1262
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:41.230
was connected to a family that owned one of the mansion's.
Uh,

1263
01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.920
they're in corn auto on the,
uh,
on the waterfront.
I think that was first street,

1264
01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:49.540
front street at any rate,
just to,
Oh man,
it was a beat up old place,

1265
01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:51.370
but it was truly a mansion.

1266
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:54.040
And they had a couple of mattresses on the floor and they had a,

1267
01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:58.300
a table in the kitchen,
but Noah furniture and they had a tapper.

1268
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.980
And we go over there and just party like crazy.

1269
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:04.570
And the,

1270
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.910
where I'm going with this story is through all of that time and through all the

1271
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:14.290
craziness and through all of the drinking,
uh,

1272
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.320
there was only one person who got hurt as a result of overindulging.

1273
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:25.000
He a rift,
ran his car into a telephone pole,
didn't,
uh,
didn't kill him,

1274
01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:29.050
didn't even hurt him very much.
But that was the only instance that I know of.

1275
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:30.280
And uh,

1276
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:35.281
the only casualty we had to alcohol was that same guy who turned himself in,

1277
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:38.330
uh,
to,
uh,

1278
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:42.850
for Aa and a was a cashiered out of the navy.

1279
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:48.010
And then,
uh,
for 10 years he was sober,
clean and sober,

1280
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:52.000
and he applied to get back in.
And the Navy,
God,
love it,

1281
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:55.630
let him back in.
But more remarkable than that.

1282
01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:59.830
This is one of our pilots now from a,
from a sea wolves.
Uh,

1283
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.250
they gave him his wings back and he finished up his career flying.
Well,

1284
01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:06.260
that's awesome.
But the point is we,

1285
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.320
we had a really great time when we got back and all that was sort of a haze,

1286
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:15.400
but when I checked into the squadron after I completed the rag,
uh,

1287
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:19.910
learn to fly the noble h three c slug.
Yeah.

1288
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:24.470
Yeah.
Our commanding officer took me in and a,

1289
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:28.220
in my checkerboard interview says,
I know where you've been.

1290
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:34.040
I know what you've done.
You aren't going to get away with any of that crap here.

1291
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.640
And that there was a leadership lesson there.

1292
01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.160
I knew that I never wanted to be like him.

1293
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:45.740
That had to be intimidating for our guy though that's taken on these,

1294
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.100
these pilots that have been doing what you had been doing and all of a sudden

1295
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:53.070
they got to try and reign these guys back into the world.
Yeah.

1296
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:55.760
I hope I'm not going into too many stories,

1297
01:26:55.761 --> 01:26:58.730
but a great friend about the only guy at names,

1298
01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:03.080
I'm using her guys who are deceased,
but at huge,
Candice was,
uh,

1299
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:07.670
a copilot and a,
we were sent off to,
uh,
uh,
for,
uh,

1300
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:12.200
uh,
to Guam for some,
a specialized training.

1301
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:16.160
And he and I are there in our,
uh,
in our,
uh,

1302
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.790
poopy suits at the bar,

1303
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:24.020
the old club bar at the air force base on Guam.

1304
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.220
And we're enjoying a couple of beers,
which tasted good.

1305
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.590
And all of a sudden this metal rings like crazy and income.
These guys in,

1306
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:38.950
in pressed flight suits with ascots and everybody in the bar,

1307
01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:41.780
all the air force guys are standing at attention.

1308
01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:46.160
This be 52 crew coming back from a mission.

1309
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:50.930
And we're just sitting there with our elbows on the bar and the crowd didn't

1310
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:55.400
know what to make of us,
but,
uh,
they didn't get too close to us either.

1311
01:27:56.230 --> 01:28:00.140
I mean,
come on.
We all have a mission to do.

1312
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:04.010
And Rolling Thunder was a very important,
if a taken to,

1313
01:28:04.011 --> 01:28:06.500
it's a conclusion,
uh,

1314
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:09.050
we might have not floss that war.

1315
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.530
And I use the words loss and war carefully there and that,
that's not,

1316
01:28:14.531 --> 01:28:18.320
that's not a slip of the tongue.
Uh,
they've,
they've got a mission to do,

1317
01:28:18.321 --> 01:28:23.160
but I mean,
yeah,
the war from 40,000 feet and they're,

1318
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.600
they're worried about Sam's because they turned in at this,

1319
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.520
I don't want to go there.
I'm sorry.

1320
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.240
I'd like to apologize to the United States air force and all the noble men and

1321
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:36.980
women who fly for the air force.
Yeah,
that's a,

1322
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:41.840
actually,
you know,
those,
um,
when,
when we got back from Ramadi,
we,
we,

1323
01:28:41.841 --> 01:28:45.390
um,
we got after it in a very similar way,
um,

1324
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:48.560
for several months.
And I don't know how long you did,
but yeah,

1325
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:49.990
there was a lot of,
uh,
um,

1326
01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.990
beer and other things that were drinking and I don't know,
you know,

1327
01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:59.390
there's,
it was sort of,
uh,
it was sort of,
it seemed like the normal thing to do.

1328
01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:02.100
I don't know.
It seemed like we were going to kind

1329
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.600
<v 0>of get it out of our systems for a little while and you know,
um,</v>

1330
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:11.370
get over it.
Cause it is,
it is,
you know,
it's not that big of a deal.

1331
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:13.110
I don't want to make it sound like it's all crazy,
but you know,

1332
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:16.410
you're over there and it's like,
okay.
It's a little bit of,
it's,
it's a different,

1333
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.850
it's a different scenario and you got to kind of process through the fact that

1334
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.140
everything that you just were doing,
whatever,
a week ago,
two weeks ago,

1335
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:27.510
three weeks ago,
is now completely different.

1336
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:31.380
The way your life is completely different and there's no one's shooting at you

1337
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:34.560
and there's no one not,
not,
you're not going to lose in your guys,
which was,
uh,

1338
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:39.930
the weight that I felt lifted off of me about a month after I got home.

1339
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:41.850
I was,
I just,
you know,

1340
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:45.450
woke up one morning and I just kind of felt different and I kind of,
I was like,

1341
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:47.610
why do I feel I felt different in a good way?

1342
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:51.490
And what I felt was,
oh,

1343
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.150
I was thinking about why do I feel different right now?

1344
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.710
And as I sat there and thought about it,

1345
01:29:55.711 --> 01:29:59.130
it's like I'm not worried about any of my guys getting killed right now,

1346
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:02.580
which was the first time in months that I hadn't been thinking about that all

1347
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.760
day,
every day.
And so yeah,
when you come home,
um,
there's,

1348
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:09.350
there's definitely that and I,
I think you,

1349
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.010
I think you've got to pay attention to as a leader to everyone in that group to

1350
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:19.011
make sure that guys are staying within the box and staying within what's,

1351
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:20.783
what's,

1352
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.880
I guess possibly normal for those situations because you can definitely be,

1353
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:28.920
you can,
there'll definitely be individuals that they'll,
they'll,

1354
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:32.550
they'll go too far that they're not making the transition and what they need is

1355
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.750
some help someone to come alongside,
pull alongside and say,
hey man,
let's,

1356
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:41.210
let's take it back a little bit were,
you know,
let's,
let's readjust and you know,

1357
01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:43.040
life's going to be normal again and all that.

1358
01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:46.200
<v 2>Okay.
Unfortunately,</v>

1359
01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:51.570
the way we were ruled in and out of the squadron when we left and came back to

1360
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:54.570
the world,
it was pretty much an individual effort.
Yeah.

1361
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.940
So that,

1362
01:30:56.941 --> 01:31:00.150
and I also tempered with the fact that your war was entirely different than
ours.

1363
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:01.860
I would imagine.
Uh,

1364
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:07.670
yours was more a up close in a personal than thinners that tell you the truth.

1365
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:15.470
I don't recall ever reflecting on whether my guys we're going to come back from

1366
01:31:16.231 --> 01:31:19.500
this mission or not.
You know,
it's something that we just all did.

1367
01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:23.610
We all did it together.
And I don't mean that to sound callous.

1368
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.540
It just wasn't part of my,
uh,
my thinking.

1369
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:32.100
And that goes back to a what cousin Kim asked to,
you know,
how did you do it?

1370
01:31:32.150 --> 01:31:34.620
Yeah,
yeah.
Trying to bring everybody back hole.

1371
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.520
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't,
I definitely without question thought about that every,
every day.</v>

1372
01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.640
That was the biggest thing that I thought about every day was because there was

1373
01:31:45.921 --> 01:31:50.170
guys getting killed every day,
basically.
Um,

1374
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.710
there was a memorial services every day.
There was,
uh,
you know,
one of the,

1375
01:31:54.711 --> 01:31:58.180
one of the things that I've talked about this a bunch,
but there was a,
uh,

1376
01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:00.430
vehicle graveyard outside who wasn't,

1377
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:04.000
it was on the way to the gate to leave Camp Rahmati there was a vehicle

1378
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:07.600
graveyard where all the vehicles that had been blown up and destroyed by ids and

1379
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:11.890
there was,
I would say 50 or 75,
maybe even a hundred,

1380
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:13.960
but a massive area.

1381
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.820
And so in order to leave the gate,
you drove by that,
you know,
it was a,

1382
01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:21.520
it was a pretty harsh reminder and you know,
my guys would go out and missions.

1383
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.640
I wasn't always going on missions because I was overall in charge and there was

1384
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:26.490
multiple units and um,

1385
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.490
so a lot of times I'd be just salute and the guys as they'd be leaving and,

1386
01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.880
and that's a worst feeling of like,
okay,
you know,
you just,

1387
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:36.760
you just got your damn fingers crossed and you hope you've done everything you

1388
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:39.760
can and hope you've mitigated the risk.
But that was the heaviest.

1389
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.490
The heaviest weight for me was just that daily thought.

1390
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.890
Um,
every cause then there was also,

1391
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:50.710
there was the fact that there was always guys in the field almost always.

1392
01:32:50.711 --> 01:32:53.050
So it was almost always one of my,
you know,

1393
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.180
little detachments of guys was out there with seven guys and 20 Iraqi soldiers

1394
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:01.900
and there was gun fights going on and,
and that's the way it was.
That was the,

1395
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:04.400
that was the heaviest thing.
Um,

1396
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:09.850
from a leadership perspective for me.
And yeah,

1397
01:33:09.851 --> 01:33:12.820
so when I got home it took about a month,
you know,

1398
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:16.220
before I was like beef and,
and the,
the other thing is I didn't,

1399
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.340
everything that I'm saying about that feeling,

1400
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:22.510
I was barely conscious of it while I was there.
I was like,
it was there,

1401
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:25.630
but I was more focused on doing the job.
I was more focused on,

1402
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.190
it kind of cooked me like,
you know,

1403
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:29.770
when they say the frog or we put the frog in the boiling water,

1404
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:33.100
you cook it slow whenever you,
there was like that.
It was more like that,

1405
01:33:33.101 --> 01:33:34.960
like over time it just built up.

1406
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:37.180
And what I did was just focused on work and working hard.

1407
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.180
But then when I got home,
it was like I said,

1408
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:44.790
it was like a month after I got home,
I woke up one day and just felt like,
uh,

1409
01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.840
uh,
uh,
a weight lifted.
And I was saying,
why do I have,
what is that?

1410
01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.780
What is that?
And then as I thought about it,
I'm thinking,
what am I not,

1411
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:55.840
why do I feel like this?
You know,
I just had a big smile on my face and was,

1412
01:33:56.170 --> 01:34:00.730
you know,
walking around my house and thinking to myself,
wow,
this feels good.

1413
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:03.670
What is this?
And then I realized,
Oh,
you're,
you're,

1414
01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:06.790
you're actually not worried that one of your friends is going to die today,

1415
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:10.600
which is,
uh,
which was,
uh,
a totally,
it's like I said,

1416
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:14.080
it was something that crept up on me and was just there.

1417
01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:19.090
It was just part of being over there.
And,
um,
it felt good to,
uh,
to,

1418
01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:23.680
to have that weight come off.
But,
um,
you know,

1419
01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.850
again,
I think I dealt with it pretty decently and,
you know,

1420
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.400
did I get drunk with my friends?
Yeah.
Well,
there was,
uh,
some,

1421
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:35.350
some significant to you bruiser activities that,
um,
or were,

1422
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:39.880
were fun and we let off a lot of steam.
Yeah.
And I think that's fine.

1423
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.960
But again,

1424
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:44.500
you know what worries me about saying that is that there's some people that take

1425
01:34:44.501 --> 01:34:47.790
that as like,
oh,
okay,
now I'm cleared hot just to go and,

1426
01:34:48.090 --> 01:34:52.290
and get drunk and get crazy.
And it's like,
no,
actually you're not.
Um,

1427
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.740
you got to keep that in check in,

1428
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.680
especially from the guys that are in leadership positions.
Hey man,

1429
01:34:56.681 --> 01:35:00.500
you gotta keep a close eye and step back and detach and look at the guys and
say,

1430
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:04.160
okay,
I get it.
We're going to let off some steam.
I get it.

1431
01:35:04.161 --> 01:35:05.660
We're going to adjust back to the real world,

1432
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:10.250
but we need to make sure that everyone is staying inside the box and make sure

1433
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:14.330
that they're going to come back out of this thing.
Okay.
Because I mean,

1434
01:35:14.331 --> 01:35:17.300
we all know it nowadays,
man,
the vets veterans come home.

1435
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.550
And that's a hard transition to make from,

1436
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.470
from combat to the civilian world.
And,
and,

1437
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:27.200
and even the world that you're talking about going from being a seawall from the

1438
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:29.900
wild west,
coming back to your commanding officer saying,
look,

1439
01:35:29.901 --> 01:35:33.020
you're not going to get away with that crap here.
And you know,
we,

1440
01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:37.310
we definitely had our share of little stories like that from two bruiser where,

1441
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:41.780
you know,
guys guys would not quite be ready.
And you know,
as a matter of fact,

1442
01:35:41.781 --> 01:35:45.710
JP Danelle who is with me at echelon front,
w my brother,

1443
01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.760
when he came home,
when we came home,
he was in another platoon got hurt.

1444
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:53.570
They send them to our basic training school.
So Bud's,

1445
01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:58.571
he's going to be a bug's instructor and he didn't last very long over there

1446
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:03.791
because you can't take a guy that's 23 years old that just been through what JP

1447
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:05.850
had been through and say,
okay,
now you're going to go,

1448
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.130
go and be in charge of training these guys that are trying to make it through

1449
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:14.300
buds.
It,
it wasn't a good fit.
And so I just,
you know,

1450
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.330
luckily I had friends and was able to just pull him over and he worked directly

1451
01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:17.751
for me.
Again,

1452
01:36:17.751 --> 01:36:21.080
getting guys ready for the more advanced training in combat training,

1453
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:26.180
which she was perfect for.
But that was an example of where,
you know,
I was,

1454
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.830
I had to look out and say,
okay,
this is not a good job for him.
It right now,

1455
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.290
you know,
JP is already an intense,

1456
01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:38.480
an intense guy and coming home from Ramadi,
you know,
it was,

1457
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:41.420
it was a,
it was a tough deployment.
You only lost friends.

1458
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:44.630
And as a young kid,

1459
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.580
he wasn't ready to be teaching these young,
you know,

1460
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:53.480
he's looking at these kids like,
are you kidding me?
I'm going to,

1461
01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.130
I'm going to freaking decimate you guys.

1462
01:36:55.131 --> 01:36:58.430
And so I had to pull them over to a little bit more advanced mastering my

1463
01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:02.900
brother.
Jfe um,
so you get,
oh,
so now,

1464
01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:07.100
so now you,
you're staying in the navy.
That's it never a doubt in my mind.

1465
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.200
And you end up,
I mean,
you,
you ended up doing the anti submarine warfare,

1466
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:14.960
which is the job that kind of,
is that the job that annoyed you?

1467
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:16.970
<v 2>Uh,
we called it also what</v>

1468
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:21.220
we were given a mission without the,
uh,

1469
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:26.000
the means to prosecute the mission and the,
that annoyed me.
And then,

1470
01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:29.420
and then you went on to become a test pilot.
Is that right?
Is that correct?

1471
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:33.690
Steely-Eyed Granite Jod test pilot and look at me now.
So,

1472
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:38.480
so what does that job like?
Ah,
it's,

1473
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.190
it's fascinating me.
You know,

1474
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:43.790
I'm living proof that nothing harms or that person more than too much formal

1475
01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:46.820
education,
but I get off on that and uh,

1476
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:50.390
it was brought home to me once when we were having a raging party at her home in

1477
01:37:50.391 --> 01:37:51.111
protection river,

1478
01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:54.890
Maryland when I was there at the tow center and most of the guys would have a

1479
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:57.600
copy of playboy magazine on their night table.

1480
01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:01.620
A couple of the guys had gone back to take a leak in our bedroom and found that

1481
01:38:01.621 --> 01:38:06.060
I had some technical reports.
They're
mine.

1482
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:10.080
And I didn't hear the end of that for a,
for a long time,
but I enjoyed it.

1483
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:13.400
I enjoyed the,
the technical aspects of it.
I

1484
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:20.060
often said there are only two topics that are worthy of conversation between men

1485
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.270
and that is flying and fornication.
And

1486
01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:30.690
I lived to fly.
Having said that,
since I retired,

1487
01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:32.250
I've found very little,

1488
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.380
but at that point in my life it was all about flying.
And uh,

1489
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:39.230
it was a wonderful experience.
The,

1490
01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:43.650
the flying we did was not experimental flying.
It was engineering flying.

1491
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:47.880
We test out weapons systems,
we test out new aircraft.
I was fortunate to,
uh,

1492
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.320
uh,
to,
uh,
lead one of the three prongs of the,
uh,

1493
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.220
the biggest helicopter acquisition that the navy's made when they were looking

1494
01:38:56.221 --> 01:39:00.660
for the new lamps helicopter.
Uh,
two of my great good friends,

1495
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:05.210
we're,
uh,
we're flying the a Sikorsky and the,
uh,
and the,
uh,

1496
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:09.630
Boeing products.
And they were pretty well through their test program,

1497
01:39:09.631 --> 01:39:14.631
which took I think about a year when a bell helicopter piped up and says,

1498
01:39:14.851 --> 01:39:18.710
Hey,
we've got one,
two,
well they didn't have a,
uh,

1499
01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:20.370
a really logical contender,

1500
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.660
but they needed somebody to go on down and leave the test of that aircraft.

1501
01:39:24.661 --> 01:39:28.260
And that was me and boy,
that was fun.
You know,

1502
01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:32.250
you literally are flying to test card that takes you out to the edge of the

1503
01:39:32.251 --> 01:39:36.200
envelope and then,
hey,
you're,
you're good enough.
Sure.
I'm good enough.
Yeah,

1504
01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:39.720
just uh,
uh,
don't go too far and don't bust your ass.
Here's,

1505
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:42.960
there's a lot of investment that you're sitting in right there that you want,

1506
01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.820
they want you to keep in,
in one piece.
But no,
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

1507
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.590
A lifelong friends there and

1508
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:54.110
just keep me to a story.
The two guys that were flying a,

1509
01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:56.910
the Boeing's and Sikorsky dear friends,

1510
01:39:56.911 --> 01:40:01.850
one of them was a naval academy classmate and he and I flew in Vietnam and uh,

1511
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.320
the other guy,

1512
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:07.290
Greek is just a wonderful guy and still a lifelong close friend.

1513
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:11.070
Well,
a duck,
uh,
was unfortunately,
he,

1514
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:15.640
fortunately for Hughes became their chief test pilot.
Uh,

1515
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:20.000
he got out of the navy and was a flying for Hughes and was killed in a,
in a,

1516
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:20.831
in a horrible,

1517
01:40:20.831 --> 01:40:25.831
a accident and Greek and I sorta sorta closed ranks and,

1518
01:40:27.301 --> 01:40:28.960
uh,
decided that,
uh,

1519
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.040
we were going to try and send a duck off in good stead.

1520
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:39.720
So
if you're familiar with San Diego,

1521
01:40:39.721 --> 01:40:44.040
now,
you know about the point Luma Lighthouse in the area up there,

1522
01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:47.180
that's where the family was waiting.
Hughes had given us a,

1523
01:40:47.181 --> 01:40:49.470
a 500 to a scatter.

1524
01:40:49.471 --> 01:40:54.400
The remains in a Greek,
took it himself to do this.

1525
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.750
Now at this time,
he probably had a 2,500 flight hours.

1526
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.620
He knew his way around a helicopter.
He's in his navy blues.

1527
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:03.940
He gets in the aircraft,

1528
01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:09.060
he's got the Cree mains in his lap and they're flying out along well below,

1529
01:41:10.170 --> 01:41:13.690
uh,
the,
uh,
the point on,
on out over the ocean.

1530
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:19.770
And he looks up and sees the family up there and he's so emotionally rocked that

1531
01:41:20.531 --> 01:41:24.700
he reaches down and takes the lid off of the [inaudible].
Well,

1532
01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:26.110
if you've ever been in a helicopter,

1533
01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:31.380
you know that it's not a very stable place to have Cree mains.

1534
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:37.260
And immediately he said it was ifr inside that cockpit with duck every way.

1535
01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:44.110
And fortunately the family didn't know what was going on and everything came out

1536
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:48.260
fine.
But Greek could call me up and said,
hey,

1537
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.600
I had to had to make mustard today.
And I said,
yeah.
And he says,
yeah,

1538
01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:55.720
and when I got my blues out,
I'm still brushing duck off.

1539
01:41:57.970 --> 01:42:01.760
So yeah.
There's ways you a you accommodate that?
Uh,
I,

1540
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:07.350
I always think of the great good times that a duck in Greek and I had together

1541
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.160
and I miss him.
Sure.
I miss him all the time.

1542
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:17.230
But life goes on.
It sounds like he had the final say it that way.

1543
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:24.040
Yeah.
You were OIC during the Iranian hostage crisis.

1544
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:28.720
What was that like?
Uh,
that,

1545
01:42:28.721 --> 01:42:32.530
uh,
was self made,
you know?
Yes.

1546
01:42:32.531 --> 01:42:33.790
We were the only a,

1547
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000
a helicopter out there that wasn't on the large gray boats to actually fly the

1548
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:45.460
mission that,
uh,
could,
could provide a combat search and rescue.
Uh,
so,
uh,

1549
01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:46.960
we took full advantage of that.
Uh,

1550
01:42:47.050 --> 01:42:51.790
got the armament that we thought we passing through Guam.
Uh,

1551
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.500
I took like the side arm I had,

1552
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.800
so I went on down to buy one and know it's going to take two weeks and it took

1553
01:42:56.801 --> 01:43:01.040
me about two hours to get in touch with the local authorities.
And I had my,
uh,

1554
01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:06.100
my sidearm on going over the horizon,
which is sort of silly,

1555
01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:07.510
you know what I mean?
Really,

1556
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:13.030
you're flying and overwater mission and you need,
he said,
well,

1557
01:43:13.031 --> 01:43:16.750
you never can tell.
It's always good to be prepared,
but uh,
at any rate,

1558
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:21.180
we did go out there and uh,
and just train for that,
uh,

1559
01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:24.360
when we weren't actually out there in support of the,
uh,

1560
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:27.640
the boats we can train for that.

1561
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.010
You end up doing your 20 years.
Um,
and then you called it at 20,

1562
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:35.470
because that does,
how long you did,
20,
21,
21 years.

1563
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:39.550
And then you went off to the civilian sector.
Yes,
we did.

1564
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:44.380
Started working a bunch of various jobs.
That's right.
I started out in high tech.

1565
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:47.530
Uh,
our company had a,

1566
01:43:47.531 --> 01:43:50.920
a professional staff of 260% of whom were,

1567
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.650
and I had enough technical background that,
uh,

1568
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:59.270
I'd go out to a customer with one or more of these PhDs and they'd make their

1569
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.530
presentation.
And I'd say,
let me think what the doctor meant to say was,

1570
01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:08.360
I just had it had a greater being surrounded by smart people.

1571
01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.430
It just is a lot of fun.
It can be very frustrating at times,

1572
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.290
but it's a lot of fun.
Yeah.
And we have a,

1573
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:20.420
a curious insult in the teams,

1574
01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.600
which is someone will ask you about a guy and the guy's not a bad guy,

1575
01:44:25.971 --> 01:44:29.660
but someone will say,
well,
you know,
he's,
he's a real,
he's a really smart guy.

1576
01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.000
You know,
you might not be the best,
most common sense.

1577
01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:38.510
He might not be the best leader,
but you know,
he says,
you know,
he's a smart guy.

1578
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:41.500
So yes,
it can get frustrating.

1579
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.480
Hang around with people that are super smart and then find,

1580
01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.630
and when did you move to Hawaii?
Oh,
about 14 years ago.

1581
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:53.210
I spent five years in a range operations and then they created a new position.

1582
01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.670
And for my last five years,

1583
01:44:55.910 --> 01:45:00.650
I was the environmental manager for the Pacific muscle range.
My,
uh,
daughter,

1584
01:45:00.651 --> 01:45:05.570
when she learned that said,
dad,
you hate those guys.

1585
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.500
And I said,
yes,
Heather.
But no,
I'm in a position to say no.

1586
01:45:10.230 --> 01:45:12.780
And I just had a lot of fun,
you know,
the,
the video,

1587
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.760
the local environment and coming community,
great people.
But,
uh,

1588
01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:21.690
they were not strong supporters of military training and that,
that was uh,

1589
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:27.000
my cause to help them explain why we needed to,

1590
01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:31.010
to train out there and that we've heard out to kill the whales.

1591
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:34.360
Yeah.
Are,
yeah.
Um,

1592
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:38.270
and then how long ago was it that you retired?
Retired.

1593
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:40.550
About four years ago.
That's

1594
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:45.480
retirement has been very,
very good to Dj.

1595
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:53.630
And,
uh,
I mean I got,
I got one more quote that I,
that I,
that I wanted to read.

1596
01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.010
Um,
cause I know we've been going at it for a bit here,
but,
uh,

1597
01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.080
this is another quote.
This is a quote from,

1598
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:05.170
<v 0>um,
from a Vietnam seal.
Um,
and here we go.</v>

1599
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:08.380
Not only does many a seal always life to the sea wolves,

1600
01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:12.850
but the units often operated together as a team very often located at the same

1601
01:46:12.851 --> 01:46:16.300
base of operations.
We developed friendships that are still alive today,

1602
01:46:16.930 --> 01:46:21.130
operating well outside standing opera standard operating procedures.

1603
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:26.140
The Seawolf Sev lifted seals out of enemy and circle moments and I have known

1604
01:46:26.141 --> 01:46:31.141
them to land in a hot Lz to lift out cash is too large for the seals to pack

1605
01:46:31.181 --> 01:46:32.014
out.

1606
01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:36.940
They also evacuated our wounded when medivac helicopters were not available.

1607
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:37.963
Most important,

1608
01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:42.730
they were always there for us when we were down in the mud and darkness.

1609
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.970
The night illuminated with red and green tracers,

1610
01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.100
the VC behind every shadow.

1611
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:51.240
Many times after we were out of danger,

1612
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:55.890
they stayed with us until we were safely extracted in the middle of the river

1613
01:46:56.190 --> 01:47:01.090
and out of the range of enemy fire.
And that's chief Barry Easyknock,
who's a

1614
01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:07.560
legendary seal from seal team one navy cross recipient.

1615
01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.680
And I think that that quote just really exemplifies the,

1616
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:16.770
the bond between seals and sea Wolfson.
Like I said,

1617
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:21.771
it was something that I heard about as a young seal and it's a bond that still

1618
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:26.730
exists.
When a,
when I talked to the Vietnam seals and it's a bond that's,
uh,

1619
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:31.710
that's always going to be there.
And,
um,
oh,
Amanda,
that,

1620
01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:36.600
uh,
do you have any,
uh,
you know,
I,
I,
like I said,

1621
01:47:36.601 --> 01:47:39.960
we've been at it for a while and I like,
and like I told you before we started,

1622
01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:43.680
I can sit,
I'll sit here,
I could sit here and listen to you all day,
but uh,

1623
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:47.280
do you have any other,
you know,
any other closing thoughts that you want to,

1624
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.230
that you want to mention?

1625
01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.470
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1626
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:55.850
hand salute to the 44 that didn't make it back with us.

1627
01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.770
Uh,
anyone who hasn't been to the wall,

1628
01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:03.830
anybody who's served,
who hasn't been to the wall,

1629
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:06.250
you've got to make that trip and

1630
01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:13.670
a shout out again.
And I know it sounds like a broken record,

1631
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:18.320
but to the guys that were responsible for getting me back in one piece or

1632
01:48:18.321 --> 01:48:23.321
gunners great human beings and a to the guys I flew with,

1633
01:48:24.230 --> 01:48:28.060
hey,
next time we'd get together the beers on you.
Yeah,

1634
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:33.140
I should share with you that,
uh,
as a technical person,

1635
01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:38.120
I have developed what I call rallies,
theorem and rallies.

1636
01:48:38.121 --> 01:48:43.121
Theorem says that all the truly great ladies Hook up with all the truly big

1637
01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:47.090
buffoons and stinky if you're out there listening,

1638
01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.660
I sure am glad that you did that.
Love you more than pork chops baby.

1639
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:57.500
<v 0>And uh,
we're also thanks to your son Sean for,
uh,</v>

1640
01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:01.020
for connecting us.
And then when he came up and asked me,
he's like,
Oh,
do you,

1641
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.100
would you have a sea wolf on your podcast?
I'm like,
ah,

1642
01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:08.660
let me think about that for 0.2 seconds.
Absolutely.
So,
um,
yeah,

1643
01:49:08.690 --> 01:49:12.470
thanks to Sean for connecting us and,
and it's,

1644
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:17.300
it's been an honor to sit here and listen to you and thanks for what you and all

1645
01:49:17.301 --> 01:49:20.210
the sea wolves did for our country,

1646
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:24.470
for our navy.
And specifically,

1647
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.610
thank you for the support that you and your brothers gave to my brothers and my

1648
01:49:28.611 --> 01:49:31.190
forefathers on the ground in Vietnam.

1649
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:34.670
Will never forget what you and your brothers did.

1650
01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.190
I will never forget the sacrifices of those,

1651
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:47.400
those Braves,
he wolfs that made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.
Oh Man.

1652
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.540
And Dennis Rally has,

1653
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:58.020

1654
01:49:58.631 --> 01:50:03.430

It's seawolf.org really cool website to read through.

1656
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:11.710
One of the coolest things on it is I read that example of the wolf gram.

1657
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:15.670
They got all the wolf grants and they're all just 40.
They're good,

1658
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:16.330
they're worth checking out.

1659
01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:20.230
They've also got all the awards that well not they've got the list of the wards

1660
01:50:20.231 --> 01:50:23.950
where they got the navy cross awards and there,
uh,
just an awesome website.

1661
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:26.710
So go check it out.

We know we're getting gies origin youth.
Do we all know that yet?

1666
01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.560
That's origin.
Do we know that?
Yes.

1667
01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:54.030
You should go to origin main.com that's where you get your geek and rash guards

1668
01:50:54.031 --> 01:50:56.970
for Jujitsu.
Hundred percent bar none.

1669
01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.500
I'm almost tempted to say don't even get any other kind of or rash card.

1670
01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.820
I would agree with that.
Yeah,
boom.
Hundred percent.
Also,

1671
01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.570
if you're warming up or cooling down or just cruising,

1672
01:51:09.571 --> 01:51:13.500
they have joggers and you got into the joggers.

1673
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:18.420
My son got some of the joggers,
which he's totally stoked on.
I tried them on.

1674
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:23.040
Yeah,
just to see.
It was so horrible.
They are so not,

1675
01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:27.480
not,
not use situation.
Well,
here's the thing with joggers,

1676
01:51:27.481 --> 01:51:30.870
depending on how you wear them for sure,
but they're more of a,
um,

1677
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
should I put this Kinda acceptably?

1678
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.680
They're kind of form feeding from time to time.
Right?
So they're,
you know,

1679
01:51:40.681 --> 01:51:43.680
they kind of,
you know,
so they don't flap around.

1680
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:48.390
So they're form fitting you in form fitting joggers.
Yeah,

1681
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:50.850
I could see how that could be a violation for sure.

1682
01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:55.680
But if you're not Jocko joggers,
most comfortable joggers in the world,

1683
01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.480
probably in the history of joggers,

1684
01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.380
maybe ever origin mean origin joggers.

1685
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:04.940
<v 0>Also we've got some supplements on there,
um,
that you can take.</v>

1686
01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.380
You got joint warfare,

1687
01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:11.230
which will keep your joints intact.
Yeah.

1688
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:15.590
Yeah.
Krill oil,
same thing.

1689
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:20.150
Kinda universal
substance.

1690
01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:25.240
<v 3>Yeah.
That's to maintain the joy.
I went off the joint warfare for a little while.</v>

1691
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:29.270
Why?
Wow.
Long Story.
Long Story.
Yeah,
I did,
you know,

1692
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:33.910
lapse of discipline and Holly kind where I'm like,
oh,
I don't feel the pain,

1693
01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:37.330
you know,
or nothing.
So I just don't,
I'm not like compelled as much.

1694
01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.520
You make it like a routine though,
right?
It's like,
that's just the thing.

1695
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:46.550
I get up every day.
You take it before I get,
I take her loyal and,

1696
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:50.000
and joint warfare.
When I wake up in the morning and before I go to bed at night,

1697
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:52.000
period into story every day.

1698
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:57.500
Still the a hundred percent do you want a during that day?
But yeah.

1699
01:52:58.690 --> 01:53:02.360
Well,
discipline is not 100% because I don't take that every day.

1700
01:53:02.361 --> 01:53:07.240
I take it when needed.
Yeah.
But I will say I've been using,

1701
01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:09.500
I feel like that's a little bit of a crutch right now cause I've been using it a

1702
01:53:09.501 --> 01:53:13.510
lot before.
You can take it every day.

1703
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:17.990
But no,
the joint warfare I eat.
Like your mindset.
I think I actually,

1704
01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:21.250
I think I should incorporate that where it's just every day.

1705
01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.540
So with joint warfare I'll be like,
well,
you know,
like it'll be in my mind,

1706
01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.910
not even necessarily heavily,
but it will be on my mind.
Oh,

1707
01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.600
did I train hard enough to warrant joint warfare?

1708
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:36.200
Kind of kind of attitude.
It's more or less like that.

1709
01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:41.420
So I wasn't feeling any kind of inflammation or pain or nothing.

1710
01:53:41.421 --> 01:53:45.820
So I was like,
ah,
you know,
it's like,
so I skipped it one day and then I sorta,

1711
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:49.670
you know,
it just wasn't in my mind.
Sure enough.
And I'm still lifting,

1712
01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.010
still twin it,
it's still in the game.

1713
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:57.350
Fricking elbow comes back because I'd get elbow from uniform pressing,

1714
01:53:57.351 --> 01:54:00.590
you know,
and I get little elbow things.
Nothing terrible.

1715
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:04.730
You just got to warm up more or whatever.
But man it came back and not just like,

1716
01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:07.640
Oh let's try it 100% then was just,
this was just the other day,

1717
01:54:07.641 --> 01:54:10.430
so usually it takes a few days to like kind of get back.

1718
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:14.150
How's it feeling right now?
That's fine,
but when I started,

1719
01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:17.450
if I started to do a pushup,
like a close grip pushup right now I'll feel it.

1720
01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:20.150
Probably.
Maybe it won't,
I don't know cause it's been a few days,

1721
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:24.410
so that's joint warfare,
Krill oil discipline and then got milk,

1722
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:27.260
which is just the food that you need in your body.

1723
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.800
That's what it basically is and it tastes good.

1724
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:35.480
And also for your kids you got warrior,
kid milk,
strawberry and chocolate.

1725
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.480
They're both really good,
but let's face it,

1726
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:40.070
the strawberry is a whole nother deal.

1727
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:45.530
Brian is working on adult strawberry milk will be coming out with that.

1728
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:49.820
Can I ask you this about the regular milk?

1729
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:55.850
Dark chocolate is good,
right?
You get after a certain number of,
what is it?

1730
01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.020
What is it?
What makes dark chocolate better?
Right.

1731
01:54:58.050 --> 01:55:02.700
It's like a certain percentage of
life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1732
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:06.440
Cause there's no sugar in it.
If you just get straight dark chocolate,
right.

1733
01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.270
But then there's this 80% 80% that's like the threshold.

1734
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.730
Let me read you this way.
80% is good.

1735
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:17.640
When you get to 72% you're like,
you're like,
oh that's just a tasty,
you know,

1736
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.690
you're just eating dessert.
Yeah.
80% is not quite,

1737
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.100
it still gives you a chocolate satisfaction,
but it's not like the same.

1738
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:29.270
Let me Redo this way.
If you eat two squares of 80% chocolate,

1739
01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:33.320
you won't desire more.
If you eat to eat to scores of 72% chocolate,

1740
01:55:33.321 --> 01:55:37.430
you like to have a little bit more cause it just like that.
Tasty.
Okay,
perfect.

1741
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:42.200
So,
so the uh,
the milk with adult milk,
my question to you,

1742
01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:45.510
in your opinion,
your Jocko discipline opinion,

1743
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:50.370
if I put a chunk,
because last night I've put this chunk,

1744
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:52.200
there's this chunk.
I don't know why he was there.

1745
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:56.070
It was their chunk of chocolate.
It wasn't 80% in the blender.

1746
01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:58.680
I didn't put the whole thing.
I broke off a little piece.

1747
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:02.550
So it was maybe like the size of a uh,
to,
you know,

1748
01:56:02.551 --> 01:56:07.260
the little baby snickers bars.
Two of those I would say that's how big the chunk,

1749
01:56:07.261 --> 01:56:11.760
this block of chocolate to the baby's snickers.
Yeah,
it was pretty big.

1750
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:15.160
It was a big monk shake though.
It's like three scoops,
you know like the,

1751
01:56:15.170 --> 01:56:19.710
you know,
the 30 ounce mugs that we have full anyway,

1752
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:25.790
put it in with a peanut butter chocolate milk and it enhanced it.
Oh yeah.

1753
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:29.100
Well of course you saw her in Paris.
So the question is,

1754
01:56:29.130 --> 01:56:33.240
is like how much of a violate,
like if it's 80% chocolate,
dark,
dark,

1755
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:35.100
80% dark chocolate or you didn't put any

1756
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.960
sugar chocolate or the matter what I did,
I didn't do,

1757
01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:44.610
I'm saying theoretically if I did 80% or more chocolate,

1758
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.690
that's good.
That's still within the confines of being on the path in the game.

1759
01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:50.340
You're in the game and on the path.
Okay.

1760
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:54.110
80% so if when we come across 80% chocolate,

1761
01:56:54.111 --> 01:56:55.920
let's add that just collectively,

1762
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:59.190
let's add that and see how we all feel about that.
That's what I think.

1763
01:56:59.850 --> 01:57:03.270
You get the little chips at the bottom of the cup too.
It's pretty cool.
Check.

1764
01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:04.140
Also,

1765
01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:09.140
I just talked to a guy who strawberry or for the warrior Kid Moke if your kid is

1766
01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:13.860
lactose intolerant you put them on the almond milk.
Right.

1767
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:19.400
So get some of that to get also if you want to represent on the path

1768
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:26.850
jock was a store,
it's called Jocko storms where he can get shirts,
hats,

1769
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:28.950
hoodies,
tank tops,

1770
01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.570
more rash guards recommended still within within the confines of being in the

1771
01:57:33.571 --> 01:57:36.420
game or rash guards as well.
Uh,
if yeah,

1772
01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:39.810
if you want to represent in the wild on the path and in the

1773
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:43.170
wild@thesametimejockostore.com.

1774
01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.180
That's where you can get some cool stuff.

1775
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:49.470
All Jocko approved all of it women stuff on there is by the way there is

1776
01:57:49.471 --> 01:57:53.190
counterfeit Jocko stuff.
Yeah.
But here's the thing about the conch fit.

1777
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:56.880
Here's the thing about the counterfeit ones.
They're like obviously like if you,

1778
01:57:56.881 --> 01:57:58.080
all you have to do here,

1779
01:57:58.081 --> 01:58:03.081
I dig it like you'll see a cool design that seems new.

1780
01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:06.300
Cause that's really the,
the,
what do you call it?

1781
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:11.120
The visceral visceral that's negative,
right?
Like your immediate responses,

1782
01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.150
like Oh,
new design on Amazon or wherever these counterfeits exist,

1783
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.820
you see the new design.
So you kind of,
Oh cool.
And you're in your,
in your haste,

1784
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:23.490
you click on it.
But here's the thing,
if you just stop for one second,

1785
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:27.240
you can be aggressive but not foolhardy,
right?
That's the deal.

1786
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:31.050
So you take this one moment to recognize the design.

1787
01:58:31.051 --> 01:58:34.830
You'll know there's violations all through every single design on there.

1788
01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:38.970
First off,
the font is the completely wrong fun.
It's completely wrong.

1789
01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:42.220
Then I saw one like the good one,
right?

1790
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.620
That's on like you know one of these,

1791
01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:50.670
one of these websites that you can go to and you submit your pdf or jpeg and it

1792
01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:57.880
generates a shirt for you.
It's like it's a super cheap thing.

1793
01:58:58.330 --> 01:59:00.610
So there's one of those,
I forget what it's called,

1794
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.730
but it's one of those where it's like obviously cheap and the design is wrong.

1795
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:07.690
It's backwards.
Ours is backwards.
The good sits is backwards.

1796
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:10.050
It's how it's supposed to be.
There's ones all frontwards,

1797
01:59:10.090 --> 01:59:13.300
like just some person who didn't pay attention is trying to do it.

1798
01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:16.930
It's real obvious if you take that second to notice it though.

1799
01:59:17.170 --> 01:59:21.070
So the counterfeit ones,
you know they're young.
Sorry,

1800
01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:24.940
just to look out for the counterfeit ones.
Yeah,
they're out there also.

1801
01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:29.050
Do you won't get counterfeit ones add chocolate store.com correct?
Yes.
Actually.

1802
01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:34.180
Factually.
Um,
also Jocko white tea.
Is there a counterfeit Jocko white tea?

1803
01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:38.010
Yeah.
That one's going to be a lot harder to counterfeit.

1804
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.190
You'd have to put some effort into that one.
Yeah.
You'd have to get labels.

1805
01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:47.470
I would actually be kind of impressed like slightly just in your mode of getting

1806
01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:51.300
after it.
Would it be high level because it's not easy to make tea.
No,

1807
01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:54.250
not easy to make cans of tea.
No,

1808
01:59:55.290 --> 01:59:59.770
and it's not easy to deadlift 8,000 pounds unless you've been drinking your tea,

1809
01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:03.790
so it get some of that organic too,
by the way,
certified.
Just saying.

1810
02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:09.630

in a way it's kind of like,

1814
02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:27.160
We'll definitely thinks there's also the warrior kid podcast,

1815
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:31.540
which is getting a lot of hype right now.
Yeah.
Why?

1816
02:00:31.541 --> 02:00:35.530
Because we talked about it on the last two podcasts.
Go here.

1817
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:38.920
People kind of recognized and they didn't.
This is the thing,

1818
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:43.030
I'm not real good at the whole like,
uh,
like,
hey everyone,

1819
02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.750
I look at what I'm doing that's not really sure.
You know,
I'm like,

So with the,

1821
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:54.850

1822
02:00:54.851 --> 02:00:58.570
the warrior could podcast.
The feedback is awesome and I appreciate it.

1826
02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.250
And if you want to get some of that soap,

1828
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.830
stay clean.
So check that one out.
Also,
we've got a youtube channel,

1829
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.500
which is called Jocko podcast,

1830
02:01:29.890 --> 02:01:33.580
and that's where these videos are of this podcast.

1831
02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:37.960
If you want to see what Dennis rally looks like,
how tall,
how tall he is.

1832
02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:39.890
Can you tell that from a where he's sitting down,

1833
02:01:39.891 --> 02:01:44.450
he was kind of going out of frame,
like sit up.
Yes.
So yes,
he's,
yeah,

1834
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:49.190
he's a big dude full of Aloha by the way.
Wasteful of a law.
But yeah,

1835
02:01:49.191 --> 02:01:54.191
if you want to see what what Dennis Rally looks like and you can come on there,

1836
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:58.430
you can also see echoes enhanced videos as he likes to call them.

1837
02:01:58.650 --> 02:02:00.770
He thinks it's an enhancement when he adds stuff to them.

1838
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.770
Do you think it takes it away?

1839
02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:06.830
I didn't want it takes away from the message all message.
Just I've heard that.

1840
02:02:06.831 --> 02:02:09.950
Yeah that people have actually told you that.
Well I don't agree with it.

1841
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:14.780
Totally changed.
My attitude is the,
is the Mike and the dragon,
the video,

1842
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:18.880
that video is sick.
The video that you made is sick.
Cool.

1843
02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.020
And that video,
I said to myself,
even this is more powerful.

1844
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.890
Even like,
you know,

1845
02:02:24.891 --> 02:02:27.560
you never really think about what you think about it but like the background

1846
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:28.394
music,

1847
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:32.600
like when when it says the king dies and then it's like cello kicks it in the

1848
02:02:32.601 --> 02:02:35.780
background.
I'm like
yeah,

1849
02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.300
well that that is a good point.

1850
02:02:38.301 --> 02:02:43.301
And you are kind of advanced in your thinking because re to put kind of to put

1851
02:02:44.411 --> 02:02:48.680
it kind of precisely,
the goal is it's not necessarily to be like,

1852
02:02:48.681 --> 02:02:51.050
hey what's the background music supposed to be?

1853
02:02:51.170 --> 02:02:53.550
It's like what's the feeling supposed to be?
And then you know,

1854
02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.270
certain instruments for music or whatever,

1855
02:02:56.271 --> 02:02:58.340
we'll provide certain feelings and you know,

1856
02:02:58.341 --> 02:03:01.850
that's kind of look old to line them up.
That's it man.
You recognize that.

1857
02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:07.120
So that video has definitely impressed upon me that videos can have a positive

1858
02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:11.180
impact and positively enhance to use your term,

1859
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:15.820
what's going on with the words that are in the video.
Yeah,

1860
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:21.250
but what about if I put like the walls crumbling and crashing down c and you

1861
02:03:23.151 --> 02:03:27.780
just do that over again,
it happens.
Explodes that.
Does that take away from her?

1862
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:32.120
Like one of those people that got carried away with CGI on that video,
which I,

1863
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:34.460
you know,
you've got to explore the boundaries.
Yes.

1864
02:03:34.730 --> 02:03:38.120
And sometimes you go out to sea.
On a recent video that I did,

1865
02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:40.640
I'm not going to say which one,
but I did the same thing,

1866
02:03:40.641 --> 02:03:43.490
but now with crumbling and crashing noises and effects,

1867
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:47.540
I did it with lens flares.
Lens flares,
right?
Oh yeah.
Somebody like go lens flare.

1868
02:03:47.541 --> 02:03:49.970
Somebody puts a light in front of the camera.
Yeah.

1869
02:03:49.971 --> 02:03:52.350
Well it's the aberrations or I dunno,

1870
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:55.970
whatever the word you want to use that that a light going directly at the
camera.

1871
02:03:55.971 --> 02:04:00.190
We'll create these lectures and you can do it on purpose.
Right?

1872
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:01.141
It's like a look.

1873
02:04:01.141 --> 02:04:04.550
It's like an epic look when you get what's called an anamorphic Lens.

1874
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.490
It kind of does this thing,
it compresses it to the set kind of thing.

1875
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:11.150
And then when you,
when you to put in layman's terms,

1876
02:04:11.151 --> 02:04:13.190
basically when you put the video,
did you do this on,

1877
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:17.000
I can't tell you now I'm going to go watch all my videos,

1878
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:20.060
go watch all the videos you tell me.
But here's why I don't want to say it.

1879
02:04:20.061 --> 02:04:23.360
Because now people will be paying attention to it and they'll be like,

1880
02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.520
okay,
not to go into a whole long thing,
but okay.

1881
02:04:28.521 --> 02:04:33.230
So there's a guy named Jj Abrams,
he's a director and I think a writer too.

1882
02:04:33.231 --> 02:04:37.130
But anyway,
he does,
he did like the new star trek movies.
He did the new star,

1883
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:42.120
you know,
he's like kind of a Scifi guy.
Um,
and he got a lot us,

1884
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.250
he got a lot,

1885
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:48.290
people had an issue with the amount of lens flares he allowed in star trek,

1886
02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:52.160
the newer stuff.
So Claire,
everywhere I caught her look dope man.

1887
02:04:52.730 --> 02:04:56.220
I really liked that look.
But he got a lot of,
you know,
a lot of shit for it.

1888
02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:00.900
Nonetheless,
I don't want to be in that same boat with these videos,

1889
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:04.230
with that particular video that I'm talking about,
so if they don't notice,

1890
02:05:04.231 --> 02:05:08.670
then good.
If so and that,
see what I'm saying?
I'm going to go post about it.

1891
02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.810
Nonetheless.
Psychological warfare too,

1892
02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:17.790
which is an album of tracks where I tell you what you should do to push through

1893
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:20.860
the moment of weakness and that's all we're going to say about that.
Okay.

1894
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:26.520
It works with 100% certainty.
I'll add that.

1895
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:30.690
Are you still batting 100% right now?
I'm going to call.

1896
02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:35.740
I'm going to call you on that.
Oh,
100% every single time I've ever used.

1897
02:05:35.741 --> 02:05:38.610
The other thing,
I haven't used it recently because it's like,

1898
02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:43.320
are you scared of it?
I didn't.
I knew need it.
I don't have many moments.

1899
02:05:43.321 --> 02:05:47.760
Weakness nowadays.
See,
I'm like forged in the fire of discipline.

1900
02:05:48.630 --> 02:05:50.100
No transgressions.

1901
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.850
Are you trying to set yourself up to make a video with flair for yourself?

1902
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:58.160
No.
No,
no.
I'm reporting back to you.

1903
02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:00.870
My current status on my discipline and the less,

1904
02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:04.080
I haven't had to use it recently.
So yeah,

1905
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:07.980
I mean it doesn't matter if every single time that I've used it it.
Yeah,

1906
02:06:07.981 --> 02:06:09.060
it helps.
Like what I'm going to do,

1907
02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:14.061
listen to you telling me and then like I'm stoked to me just making the effort

1908
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:19.980
to open my ears to you is already you already like on the way to like power

1909
02:06:19.981 --> 02:06:22.280
through.
Yeah,
exactly right.
Check.

1910
02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:26.940
So you know 100% on that one.
In my experience.

1911
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.050
Also you want to vary up your workout on it.
Fitness gear,

1912
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.840
is that on [inaudible] dot com they've got a lot of cool stuff on there,

1913
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:37.890
a lot of good stuff.
So if you want to improve,
enhance,

1914
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:41.760
very increased variables,

1915
02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:46.320
increased stuff in your workout.
If it's getting boring or something like this,

1916
02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:48.060
go to [inaudible] dot com get some,

1917
02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:53.090
get something from there like kettlebells or rings or battle ropes.

1918
02:06:53.970 --> 02:06:57.090
I think if you add one or more of those things into your workout,

1919
02:06:57.091 --> 02:07:01.830
it will be enhanced greatly.
Results wise.
It's my opinion.
Prediction.

1920
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:06.420
Also books.
What do we got?
Well,
first of all,
we've got Mike in the dragons,

1921
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:07.380
told you about the video,

1922
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:09.720
go watch the video and then you'll want to get the book.
Why?

1923
02:07:09.721 --> 02:07:13.050
Because Echo did a really good job at and things because the book is legit.

1924
02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:16.620
Am I love to say that about my own or that make me arrogant

1925
02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:22.590
from that again told it's legit.
Everyone appreciates it.

1926
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:27.740
And a bunch of people have now started posting reviews on Amazon,

1927
02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:29.880
which is very cool.
I appreciate it.

1928
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:34.030
I read them and I'll read some next time live.
But uh,
yeah,
so,

1929
02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.130
so Mike and the dragons,
here's the deal.
Is

1930
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.670
<v 0>it sold out at this moment in time?
Yes.
Will it be sold out when you hear this?</v>

1931
02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:43.150
Probably not.
Actually.
It's probably,
we got more books coming in.

1932
02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:47.050
I'm getting them printed,
um,
as quickly as they can possibly print them.

1933
02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:52.410
And I apologize for not correctly estimating how many books everyone would buy.

1934
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:56.260
That is my fault and I apologize for it.

1935
02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:59.440
But if you do want Mikey and the dragons,

1936
02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:04.270
order it as soon as you can so that you can get it as quickly as possible.

1937
02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:09.460
Also the way the warrior kid books where the warrior kid and Mark's mission,

1938
02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.520
those books are good for kids and adults and really anyone and you know just got

1939
02:08:16.661 --> 02:08:21.070
done talking to talking to Dennis rally downstairs and he's like Oh yeah I read

1940
02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:24.470
those books.
They're awesome.
So he's a,
he's a what are,

1941
02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:28.270
I don't know how old he is but he's a Vietnam veteran pilot and he read or your

1942
02:08:28.271 --> 02:08:31.990
kids and was was down for the cost.
That's weird.

1943
02:08:31.991 --> 02:08:34.930
You sit down for the cause cause I was thinking in my head down for the car.

1944
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:39.910
Well he is clearly down for the cost discipline equals freedom field manual.

1945
02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:45.700
<v 3>Good one.
Outstanding one acts really I think so.
Again,</v>

1946
02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:49.240
and I said this before,
I'll say it again because this is a constant thing.

1947
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:53.560
It's like one of those things like a manual,
like an actual manual for life.

1948
02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:57.730
Right.
But so okay you said that I get it but yeah you refer to it.

1949
02:08:57.790 --> 02:09:01.180
That's what you do.
It's like a reminder and we do this all the time by the way.

1950
02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.170
But this is a good one to just remember cause that's part of the,
the the,

1951
02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:08.860
actually it's the majority of the challenge right there.

1952
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.740
It's to remember this stuff like say hey,

1953
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:16.750
you shouldn't freaking drink a soda right now with your Sushi.

1954
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.680
Don't do that.
You know that already.
But if it's just part of the habit,

1955
02:09:20.681 --> 02:09:21.161
it's like boom.

1956
02:09:21.161 --> 02:09:23.710
You might forget because you were thinking about some other stuff,
you know,

1957
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:27.820
some edits or whatever that you had to do saying so he got that manual.

1958
02:09:27.821 --> 02:09:31.480
They're this time and you just refer to it kind of made me even daily.

1959
02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:36.190
Semi daily.
I recommend daily.
Daily.
Yeah.

1960
02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:39.070
And you just remember all this stuff just keeps you on the path,
man.

1961
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:41.170
<v 0>That one is in print by the way.</v>

1962
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.810
There's plenty of them so you can order that one.

1963
02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.510
And that's a good Christmas gift.
Yeah.

1964
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:51.790
For people that you know who needs it in your world.
You know what I mean?

1965
02:09:51.970 --> 02:09:55.150
And I don't think it's insulting by the way.
If someone is offended by it,

1966
02:09:55.690 --> 02:09:59.530
just get them to crack it open cause they'll realize like,
hey,

1967
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.990
this isn't meant to offend.
This is meant to build.

1968
02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:04.640
<v 3>Yeah.
And actually you know what,
now that you think of it,</v>

1969
02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:09.830
that book isn't like extreme ownership might be that kind of book that if you

1970
02:10:09.831 --> 02:10:13.190
get it with some,
for someone they'll be like,
like what are you should you know,

1971
02:10:13.191 --> 02:10:16.010
like will elicit a,
what they call defensiveness.

1972
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:20.600
But the field manual won't cause like first when you first see it you're like,

1973
02:10:20.601 --> 02:10:24.680
oh this is awesome item.
See what I'm saying?
Like looking at it.
But it's like,

1974
02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.470
yeah,
it's like a cool like field manual.

1975
02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:31.580
It doesn't scream like you need to take responsibility for stuff.

1976
02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.980
That's why I'm getting it.
Just you get that feel.

1977
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:38.450
But even if even if that person might feel that maybe you got to do it with like

1978
02:10:38.451 --> 02:10:41.480
a certain type of card or something seems saying,

1979
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:44.323
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1980
02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.960
<v 3>Thank you for everything you've ever taught me.
And then like give it to them.</v>

1981
02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.093
See what I'm saying?

1982
02:10:52.650 --> 02:10:53.940
<v 0>Well,
speaking of extreme ownership,</v>

1983
02:10:53.970 --> 02:10:56.220
there's extreme ownership and there's the dichotomy of leadership,

1984
02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:01.280
both books that are about leadership and they are available of course.

1985
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:03.000
And those are,

1986
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.000
those are books that will pragmatically teach you how to lead.

1987
02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:09.060
That's all there is to it.

1988
02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:11.333
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1989
02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.430

All of them have sold out
and all of them will sell out.

2002
02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.300
You might not think that in Australia we're going to sell out,
but we will.

2003
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:10.670
So you've seen all of them have sold out in the past?
In the past,
yes.
Sorry,

2004
02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:14.140
sorry.
Yes,
they have.
These ones haven't sold out yet,
but they will.

2005
02:12:14.141 --> 02:12:16.540
So register early.
Everyone down under,

2006
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.950
<v 3>we know when I was in Brizzy sure.
Frizzy,</v>

2007
02:12:21.110 --> 02:12:25.140
how's in Brizzy and we did a little book signing.
I did a little book signing,

2008
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:29.360
and there was people from all over Australia there.
They came.

2009
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:34.470
Brizzy did you netting out when you were in Brizzy that the Australians tend to

2010
02:12:35.671 --> 02:12:37.920
do that very thing with words.

2011
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:42.080
They'll shorten them and then put an e or o at day.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2012
02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:46.990
So the Aussies do that with their seat names.
They're Ozzie's boom.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2013
02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:50.800
Well,
there you go.
I kind of incorporated that one.
I've been there twice.
Right.

2014
02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:56.190
And Yeah,
I noticed that.
And I liked it.
The first SAS guy I worked with,

2015
02:12:56.191 --> 02:13:00.450
you know what his name was?
Well,
there was two.
The first one's name was Dutchie.

2016
02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:02.070
Dutchie was his whole name.

2017
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:03.890
<v 0>I produced long Dutch name.</v>

2018
02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:09.470
And the other one's name was Tom and then Nikki,

2019
02:13:10.130 --> 02:13:14.540
<v 3>right?
Sure.
Yeah.
It's 100%.
We're batting a hundred.
Yeah.
Bat a thousand.</v>

2020
02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.020
I was doing it,
well,
I guess what would be called a mini documentary.

2021
02:13:18.021 --> 02:13:22.220
One of the Times I went there and um,
one of the guy's name is Jason row big.

2022
02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:27.260
It's a black belt under Hixon Gracie.
So it's with him and he,

2023
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:30.020
you eat the way he'd explained when people are like,
Hey,
what are you guys doing?

2024
02:13:30.021 --> 02:13:31.980
He'd be like,
oh,
we're making a little doco

2025
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.570
<v 0>for,
you know,
for this thing or whatever.
And um,
then people understood,
oh,</v>

2026
02:13:36.571 --> 02:13:40.650
they didn't exactly.
And I was like,
doc,
oh,
I like that.
It's good,
but yet,
man,

2027
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.790
so yeah,
incorporate that into your thing.
So cool.
Yeah.

2028

2032

scramble the Sea Wolves,
