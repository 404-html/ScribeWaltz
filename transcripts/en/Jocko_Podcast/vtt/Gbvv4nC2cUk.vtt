00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.940
How did the seals deal with fatigue,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
soreness and beat down and the beat down of buds and SQT without getting

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.990
injured?
Well you just get used to it.
And,
and again,
you know,

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.540
I say this all the time buds and the SQT,

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.180
which is the kind of the initial training after you had done with buds,

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.220
which is the basic underwater demolition seal training.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.010
That's a short part of your career.

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.170
I mean it's literally a fraction of your career means nothing.
Um,

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.200
but just like any working out you get used to it.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.890
And if it's like when you work out,
when you,

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:38.220
if you haven't worked out for a long time or someone that's someone that just

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.770
starts working out from nowhere,
never worked out before,

13
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.280
they're going to be sore as hell when they first work out.

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.330
I just had this happen to me cause I got,
I want,
I went on the road,

15
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.480
I went on a road trip multiple back to back road trips and I went overseas,

16
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.820
came back when I came back I got sick.

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.910
So I was for like three weeks,

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.150
I hadn't squatted heavy at all.

19
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.830
I had nobody at all I did was bodyweight squats,
you know,
pistols,
just lunges.

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.720
That's how I work my legs.
There's just no way.

21
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.380
So you just do what you can do a hotel room in some strange part of Europe.

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.100
And when I came back,
I was all happy and I got on that squad.
Once I,
he won,

23
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.880
then I was sick.
And then once I got done being sick,

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
I finally felt good and I got back on that squat rack and man,

25
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
my legs were destroyed for four or five days.

26
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:27.960
I'm talking,
you know,

27
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.500
having a hard time sitting down and having a hard time standing up.

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.420
It was gnarly.
And,
but,
but that's just because my body just,

29
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.440
it just wasn't,
he lost that element.

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.940
So of course if you just started working out and you're walking around sore all

31
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.680
the time,
that's,
that's,
that's because you got to get used to it.
Um,

32
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
and in buds you do get injured just because it's massively repetition.

33
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.540
You know,
there was a guy that we had that was a trainer,

34
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.910
an athletic trainer for a professional sports team.
And

35
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.590
when he was there,
there's this great example,

36
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.070
there's something called Patella for moral syndrome,
which is when your Patella,

37
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.400
because of the way you're running,
it rubs on your,
your femur.

38
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.810
And it becomes problematic.

39
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.530
And he said in like a whole season in the NFL or he would see maybe one of those

40
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.640
injuries may be too,
and you'll have to figure out what it is.

41
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.830
And when he was working in buds,
he would literally see 30 of those a week.

42
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.760
So you just get to see,
I mean there's more people,
there's 10 times the people,

43
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.550
but it still was massive amount of injuries.

44
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:40.620
And it's the same thing in the seal teams and the seal teams.

45
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.520
It's your shoulders,
it's your back,
it's your knees,
it's your ankles,

46
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.590
you get abused.
And it's,
it's,

47
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.160
it's not the working out that does it to you.
It's not working out.

48
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.400
It's carrying a guy on your shoulder,
over the rocky terrain,

49
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.830
out in the desert and tripping on ankle.
That's what you get hurt.

50
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.300
It's jumping over off of a wall and you land on a cinderblock that breaks and

51
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.310
you bro,
you know,
it's,
that's the kind of stuff.

52
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.850
But working out doesn't really do it to you.

53
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.570
I actually,
one of the things when,
when I was a tasking to commander,

54
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.530
we were going through land warfare training and I would work out every day and I

55
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:25.120
would roll with guys like teach them some Jujitsu and enroll with them and I

56
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.710
would,
you know,
guys are,
cause you know,

57
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.290
we're working hard during the day or during the night.

58
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.940
And I was kind of making fun of some guys that were taking Motrin and I was
like,

59
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:37.990
you don't need that.
You're weak.
And stuff like that.
And sure enough,

60
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.430
right after we got done,

61
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.690
I got something called Bursitis in my elbow because in land warfare,

62
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.650
you're constantly getting down to the desert,
you're crawling,
you're,

63
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.180
and then I was in Jujitsu Jitsu on the Mat and I did bang it a couple times and

64
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.990
sure enough,
my elbow swelled up and I had to take Motrin.

65
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.000
Yeah,
don't,
uh,
don't open your mouth Jocko.

66
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.170
Just keep it to yourself.
Um,
so you know,
and again,
I was,

67
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.980
I was hammering guys but in a joking manner and so they hammered me right back

68
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:09.910
when I had the Motrin pills to try and heal that up.
Um,

69
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160
but it is,
like I said,
it's the,

70
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.020
it's the injuries come from not from working out.
In fact,

71
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.460
I always think that the working out prevents the injuries.
You know,

72
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.610
that I think that's true with everything.
I think that's true with Jujitsu.

73
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:27.850
I think that's true with life.
You,
you,
you work out,
you're strong.

74
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.290
You're joints are strong,
your muscle densities better.
Your,
I mean,

75
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.870
just just work out because it'll prevent injuries more than,

76
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.390
more than I don't worry about,
I look at working out,

77
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.240
not as injury is going to happen.
I look at working out as injury prevention.

78
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.020
And the last thing is you shouldn't need to like completely crush yourself every

79
00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:50.680
day in your workouts.
I mean,

80
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.100
you shouldn't be going to a point that you have massive muscle soreness over

81
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.480
your whole body or over even body parts.
You don't need to do that.

82
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.160
You don't need to do that.
Uh,
you know,
do you want to push yourself?
Yeah.

83
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:03.911
You want to push yourself,

84
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:08.260
but you want to speak so sore that you aid like can't perform your job.

85
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.110
Uh,
and also I like,
you know,
active rest,
you know,
I hardly ever just do nothing.

86
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.000
Occasionally I will occasionally I'll just,
man,

87
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.680
I'm broke down and just eat steak and just chill.

88
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.800
But uh,
but I like to do the active rest,
you know,
I like to do some kind of jogs,

89
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:29.800
swam,
surf,
whatever.
And you know,
actually Jujitsu,
like if I have a sore back,

90
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.000
I love getting on the Mat.
It just loosens everything up.
Feels so good.

91
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.810
But that's only at a certain level.
Yeah.

92
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.780
Cause when you're a white belt or a blue belts or ho purple belts,
Ben,

93
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:44.270
that Bri and it's just a battle.
You're,
you're getting off the mat sore.

94
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.730
I don't get off the mat source when she did too.

95
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:50.020
Seldom seldom do I get off the mat.
Like,
man,
I'm tired.
I mean,
we trained today.

96
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.350
I'm not,
that was a no factor.
You know what I mean?
It was just,
Oh yeah,

97
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:58.110
we trained the pill.
If you get into the takedown elements though,
the,
that will,

98
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.050
even if you got to be hard on your back,
but even the takedown elements,
you know,

99
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.180
if you're just going to do pure takedowns yet,
but I'm going to take down,

100
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.730
it's going to last how long and if your sore,

101
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.410
pull guard and work on something else.

102
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.910
So that's it in the bottom line is you work out,

103
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.160
you do so many of these workouts,
you'll get used to it,

104
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:19.730
you'll get in the zone and then you won't be so sore all the time.
Yeah.

105
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.600
That as an advocate of rest,
I uh,
that's important.

106
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.480
That part where you're like,
don't beat your doubt yourself.
Done.

107
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.190
Cause the exercise that technically freely split hairs here,

108
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.340
the exercise doesn't make you stronger.

109
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.950
The recovery from the exercise is when you get stronger.
So yeah,

110
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.020
that says a part of the whole system that makes you strong.

111
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.140
But when you recover from that exercise,
that's when you're stronger.

112
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.960
I'll give you them.
So yeah.

113
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.040
But the workout itself is what induces the recovery,
so.
Sure.

114
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.090
Yeah.
So there you go.
Um,
you,

115
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.200
well I guess so it's all kinds of different philosophies,
right?

116
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.520
Different approaches.
Like you,
you prefer the active arrest,
um,

117
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.300
and not going hard every day.
Some people they prefer go hard every day,

118
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:10.040
but then they'll have a straight up to three days off completely,
you know?

119
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.850
Um,
but yeah,
the recovery from the exercise,
that's,
that's the ticket right there.

120
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.880
And when I say go hard,
I mean like the muscular,
you know,
destroy,

121
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.040
like if you can do squats until you can't walk,

122
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.180
you can't do that all the time and you don't need to write,

123
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.190
you need to initiate the growth.

124
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.360
You don't need to destroy them and,
and you can do you,

125
00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:36.140
you know,
you can put with them with the metabolic conditioning,

126
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.300
you can really can destroy herself a lot more often.

127
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.620
And if you're doing it right,

128
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.030
you shouldn't really be getting muscularly sore from your metabolic condition if

129
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.950
you're doing it right.
But then again,
he's a,

130
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.640
isn't that really a spectrum as well?
It is a spectrum.

131
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.910
Con can be like a heavier it can I quicker with.
That's the,

132
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.140
that's the beauty of working on,

133
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.570
that's why you should never get bored with working out.
She can change it up.
