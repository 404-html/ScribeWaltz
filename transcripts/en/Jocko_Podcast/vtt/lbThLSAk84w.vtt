00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.180
Okay,

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.920
<v 1>this is Jocko podcast number one,
a weight with Echo Charles and me,</v>

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.980
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.100
<v 0>Good
bye.</v>

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.130
<v 1>You do not get to say goodbye.</v>

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.250
<v 1>That is the way it goes in this line of work,</v>

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.120
you do not get to say goodbye.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.623
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.990
<v 1>One day your friend is there,</v>

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.130
you're a brother,

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.120
your shared experiences and shared pain and shared thoughts.

13
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.100
<v 0>Okay,</v>

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.330
<v 1>one day your friend is there to share those things</v>

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.100
and then they're gone.

16
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.063
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

17
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880
<v 1>of course we think we are all going to live</v>

18
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.983
<v 0>forever</v>

19
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.920
<v 1>and then</v>

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.460
by the bullet or the bomb or the ocean or the sky,

21
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.453
they are gone.

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.340
The memories
are there,

23
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.780
but they are not enough.

24
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.800
They are not enough because the story was not complete.

25
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.243
There was more,

26
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.750
there was so much more and now there is not

27
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.410
and there cannot be,

28
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.100
and I did not say goodbye.

29
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.363
Not once.

30
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.790
I did not get to tell you the things I should have told you.

31
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.200
I did not say the words,

32
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.540
not even a thank you,

33
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.420
but you knew okay.

34
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.070
Because as I knew

35
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.453
the you knew

36
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.720
and that is good

37
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.430
and I am thankful,

38
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.700
but we did not finish the story.

39
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.980
The story
was not yet complete.

40
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.923
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

41
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.210
<v 1>So now
I finish it alone.</v>

42
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.830
I'll do my best,

43
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.970
but the story will fall short

44
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.330
without you in it.

45
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.500
But I'll do my best.

46
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.383
I will.

47
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.480
One last thing,
thank you

48
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.363
<v 0>and goodbye.</v>

49
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.170
<v 1>And I wrote down those words thinking about a question that I got asked.</v>

50
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:43.320
The question was,
as an operator,

51
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.870
I know you lost many brothers.

52
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.710
I lost my wife to cancer.

53
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.700
My question is,

54
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.590
how do you deal with the inevitable flashbacks and the toughest moments?

55
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.810
<v 0>For me,
it would be</v>

56
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.890
<v 1>the hospital visits to emergency ambulance rides or the moment of her passing,</v>

57
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.580
which I was at her side for.

58
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.120
I struggle a bit as those memories continue to rise to the surface.

59
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.650
Thank you for any advice you can offer them.

60
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.320
And my advice was,
yes,

61
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.020
this does happen.

62
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.910
You will have flashbacks of those tough moments

63
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.740
and you will lose control sometimes.

64
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.181
Thank you.

65
00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:57.890
We'll break down and that is the way it is and that is the way it will be.

66
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.443
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

67
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.080
<v 1>And as you processed the loss and you adapt to this new reality,</v>

68
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.823
<v 0>okay,</v>

69
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.620
<v 1>the breakdowns will become less frequent</v>

70
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.760
and you'll learn some what to control them.

71
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.140
But they won't go away completely

72
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.913
ever.

73
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.290
And that's okay

74
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
because they will be a reminder of what you do have

75
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.253
life.

76
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.453
So live it.

77
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.100
And that's one of the hardest things for the losses that are suffered.

78
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.420
In my old profession,

79
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.210
there was never any kind of goodbye,
at least not a spoken one

80
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.080
because even though it wasn't spoken underneath it was there.

81
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.550
We lived at,
we said goodbye every day in how we lived,
in,

82
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:33.300
how we trusted in how we gave.

83
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.120
That's the Brotherhood.

84
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.320
So to all of you out there that have lost one of your comrades in arms,

85
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.263
<v 0>okay,</v>

86
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.450
<v 1>even though you might not have gotten to say good bye,</v>

87
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.930
even though you may not have told them what they meant to you,

88
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.313
don't worry.

89
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.233
They knew,

90
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.130
they knew
when you know

91
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.110
it's going to be okay.

92
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.350
So
like I said,

93
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:41.351
that was a question I got and just wanting to offer some perspective

94
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.020
that I unfortunately do have.

95
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.010
But the speaking of questions echo,

96
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.610
it's a Q and a day.
And I know we got some,
a few questions,

97
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.010
a few more questions here to go through.
Yeah,

98
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.010
<v 2>yeah.
Um,
let's it.
Alright,</v>

99
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.170
we'll do alright.
First question.
I'm a young officer,

100
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.180
platoon commander.
I deployed late by the time everywhere I've done deployment,

101
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.870
there had been some problems at my company.
Commander had been set,

102
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.540
sent back to the states and the company,

103
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:25.960
first sergeant had been redeployed to another country.

104
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.040
Now there's a new company commander and new first sergeant.

105
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.980
They are treating all the soldiers in my platoon and in,

106
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.880
in the entire company as if we are all messed up.
I don't like their attitude.

107
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.990
And my gut tells me they're out to make themselves look good by crucifying more

108
00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:44.950
people in the platoons.
I wanted to take care of my soldiers.

109
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.230
How do I best stand up to the new leadership?

110
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.660
<v 1>All right.
So</v>

111
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.840
I would say the best way that you can take care of your soldiers is not to stand

112
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.520
up to the new leadership,

113
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.830
but instead to build a relationship with a new leadership.
Uh,
you know,

114
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.220
if you confront them,

115
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.300
you confront the new leadership that's taken over automatically,

116
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.500
they're going to see you as the enemy,
right?

117
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.900
They're going to see whoever got sent home for whatever reason.

118
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.960
Maybe there was some kind of a problem.
Maybe there was.
Yeah,

119
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.030
there's definitely some kind of a problem.
Someone got in trouble,

120
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.170
something happened bad.

121
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.110
That's why guys are getting sent out of country or back to the states.

122
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.460
If you confront the new leadership,
that means you're on the bad guys' side.

123
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.110
That's not why you want to be,
because if you're on the bad side,

124
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:36.690
if you're on the bad list,
then they're not going to listen to you.

125
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.850
They're not going to trust you and they're going to be suspect of you and of

126
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:43.720
your soldiers,
so,

127
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.420
so that is not the confrontation in this is not going to be helpful.

128
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.050
Where you want to do is if you can build a relationship with them,

129
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.540
if you can try and understand their perspective,

130
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.110
which is important because they don't know.
You get,

131
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.250
you get put into a position where you're taking over for a quote unquote bad

132
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:05.550
boss or a bad platoon or a bad company.

133
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.040
You don't know what the specific problems are.

134
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:10.800
So you're pretty suspect on everything and you kind of have to be.

135
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.080
So that's their perspective.
Their perspective is like,
yeah,

136
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.010
we don't know what's going on in here.

137
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:15.720
We're all we know is something bad happened.

138
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.700
They fired the last company commander,

139
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.420
they fired the last company first sergeant,
something bad happened here.

140
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.310
I don't know what it is,
but I'm not going to let it happen to me.

141
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.820
So I'm suspect of everything so,
so,

142
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.130
so understand that perspective and then listen to what they're saying.

143
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.840
Try and give them some kind of support,
right?
Try and gain their trust

144
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.810
so that way they will listen to you and they will start to believe you.

145
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.620
And then you will be in a protector in a position where you can actually protect

146
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:47.460
the soldiers,
right?
If you get fired,
you're not protecting your soldiers.

147
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.030
If you go,
go on the stand up for you guys.
Don't worry about it.
You go into,

148
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:52.980
hey you guys,
you're treating my soldiers bad.
Oh,

149
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.750
you're fired now who's taking care of your soldiers?

150
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.410
So be careful of that.

151
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.000
Now you could be also be right and these guys could be really,
really bad.

152
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.640
They could be out for themselves out to make themselves look good.

153
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.460
And if that is the case,
well,

154
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.570
it's still remains that the best possible thing you can do for your soldiers is

155
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:17.650
to develop a relationship with these guys and make sure that as they're trying

156
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:21.520
to make themselves look good,
you protect your soldiers as much as you can.

157
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.410
And if they end up being good guys,
right,
that were just,
like I said,

158
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:29.800
just had a coming into a bad situation,
well then you've got an opportunity,

159
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.160
then you've formed a relationship with them.
And as you get through that,

160
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.430
then you on their good side,
you're,
you're good to go that way as well.

161
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.830
Now this is where people get a little freaked out,
right?
Because,

162
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.560
because I'm sitting here and I'm saying,
you got to play the game,
right?

163
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.050
People think I'm saying,
Hey,
like you need to brown nose be,

164
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.630
hey,
here's the deal.
I'm not talking about that.

165
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.350
I'm not talking about Brown nosing.
I'm talking about being professional.

166
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.580
I'm talking about being respectful up,

167
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:04.030
talking about being humble.
That's what I'm talking about.

168
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.910
I'm talking about understanding their perspective.

169
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.020
I'm not talking about Brown nosing of those things.

170
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.140
That's not how you build relationships and by the way,

171
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:17.200
you don't build relationships through Brown nosing either way.

172
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.540
If you just try and brown nose people,
they don't respect you.
That doesn't,

173
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.570
that's not how you build a relationship.

174
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:25.780
You don't build relationships through Brown nosing.
All you do is submit.

175
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.520
You don't build anything.
You're just,
you're just on the receive side,

176
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.300
but if you're respectful and you're humble and you're professional,

177
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.440
that's how you build relationships and the better relationships you have up the

178
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:41.320
chain of command at the better you can take care of the people below you in the

179
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.410
chain of command.
That's the way it works.
Of course,

180
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:48.610
this doesn't mean you're okay if your superiors or doing something that's

181
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:52.540
illegal,
immoral,
or unethical or,

182
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.420
or if they're putting your troops or the mission in danger,

183
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.860
right?
They were not playing the game.
We're not playing the game.
Now,

184
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.760
you might still even then have to play the game.
If you were my boss,

185
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:08.110
echo and you were like,
Hey,

186
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:12.220
I want you to send your guys to attack that bunker on the elevated position,

187
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:14.590
right?
Their enemy bunker with a,
with a machine,

188
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:19.480
multiple machine guns in it with interlocking fields of fire
and I'm like,

189
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.400
we're not doing,
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

190
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.710
Now if I tell you I will not do it,
and you say,
okay,
fine,
you're fired.

191
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.850
You come here,
you take the platoon and go attack,

192
00:14:28.851 --> 00:14:30.070
and now that guy does and they all get killed.

193
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.700
Maybe what I should have done was like,
hey,
echo,
we shouldn't do.

194
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:38.260
That's not a good plan,
and you go,
no,
you do it anyways.
I go,
hey,

195
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:42.370
that's not a good plan.
And you say,
go do it or I'm going to fire you.
Okay,

196
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.710
I'll go.
I'll go.
Do it.
And now when you do it,

197
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.420
you go out and you flank,
you do something different.
You know what I mean?

198
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:52.010
You make something happen,
you mitigate the damage as

199
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 3>much as possible.
So you,
that's a,
that's a decision you're gonna have to make.</v>

200
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.830
That's why being a leader's hard,

201
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.140
cause that's a really hard decision to make right there.
Um,

202
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.370
yeah,
that's a tough one.
Yeah.
I remember at the muster last semester,

203
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.150
you're talking about like that,
that very thing like you,
you,

204
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.780
you build a relationship with them and you know,

205
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.340
some people every once in awhile,

206
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.980
I'm paraphrasing kind of what you said where some people,
we'll look,

207
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.990
we'll look at it as Brown nosing.
Yeah.
And you're like,
no,
but it's,

208
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.610
you build a relationship with them.

209
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.640
Every once in a while you might brush the words,

210
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.860
you'll brush and brush up against it,
you know,

211
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.170
every once in a while then I'll come back or whatever.
But um,

212
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.510
but the mission is worth that.

213
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.980
If I got a brush up against Brown nosing just for a second to accomplish the

214
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.050
mission and whatever,
then that's what I'm going to do kind of thing.

215
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.750
And that's what a good leader does.
I was like,
yeah man,
that,
that makes,

216
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.620
that makes good sense.
And really,
so when I thought about that,
I was like,

217
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.400
well really what that is is a lack of perspective or if people forgetting about

218
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.390
the big picture,
you know what the big overall thing is?
We're here to win.

219
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.180
We're here to win.
We're hitting when yes,
if I got to tell this guy he's got an,

220
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.500
you know,
that's a great plan sir.
Yeah.

221
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.500
That you've come up with some brilliant plans,
sir.

222
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:05.540
I'm going to go and execute that thing.
So then he says,

223
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.000
oh she Jocko gets it and I'm going to go let them execute on his own.

224
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.430
I'm not going to bother him cause he,
cause he understands my planning.

225
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.070
And then I go back to my guys and I go,
Hey,
here's what we're doing.

226
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.990
It's a little different from what the boss said,
but don't worry,

227
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.720
his intention was there.
I'm not talking bad about the boss way,
like,
Hey,

228
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:19.520
this is what the boss wanted to do.
I think this is how we're going to get,

229
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.770
get it done.
Yeah Dude,
don't talk about about your boss.

230
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.380
You just say we're making some adjustments based on his guidance.

231
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.620
You actually give him credit.
That's how you get it done.

232
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.130
You brushing up against Brown nosing a little bit.
But again,

233
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.310
if you're just a full on Brown noser,
you're not developing relationships.

234
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:37.100
You're just,
you're just an ass kisser and it's not going to go good for you.

235
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.660
Yeah.
Cause cause think about this,
think about this.
Here's why.

236
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.090
And I just thought of this myself.
Here's why a brown noser isn't developed.

237
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:47.780
Probation.
You've been here.

238
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.190
Here's how it's not good to just be a brown noser does this superior listen to

239
00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:55.970
the Brown noser does he respect their opinion?
No,
not really.
Yeah,

240
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.630
he's just looking at him like,
oh yeah,
he's just,
Oh yeah,
that's old,
old Beko.
Yup.

241
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:03.260
Yeah.
Hey Buddy.
Yup.
Yeah,
Yup.
You can do whatever.
So your nice little,
yes ma'am.

242
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:08.180
Cool.
Yeah,
you gave me input.
I'm like,
oh thanks.
Echo fats now.
Hey,
the big boys,

243
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:10.830
we're over here trying to talk.
Can you,
can you just excuse yourself?
You know,

244
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.710
you don't want to end up like that.
You're kind of the guy who like,
you know,

245
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.550
like the iconic picture of the guy fanning the other guy.
That guy.

246
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:22.400
Cool to have around.
But yeah,
man,

247
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.490
but he's not giving any strategic input on the operations and not building the

248
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:30.290
relationship.
So yeah,
build a relationship,
man.
Don't confront.

249
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.680
Build.
Yeah.
I think we're distracted by that.
Right?
The,
the,

250
00:17:34.681 --> 00:17:37.520
the feeling you get when the new guy comes.
He did.

251
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.620
I don't like the way he said that to me,

252
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:42.170
even though what he said was really important.
I don't like the way you said it.

253
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.890
You know what's interesting is when a lot of leadership books that we've

254
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:47.810
discussed in a lot of leadership guidance will say,

255
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:51.360
if you're a new leader coming in,
you just don't start barking orders.
Right?

256
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.460
You just don't start saying,
Hey,
do this.
We're changing that.

257
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.470
And you assess and you look around and you make sure.
Now,

258
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:57.720
occasionally this doesn't have this.
There's things that happen.

259
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:01.650
If you're taking over a totally messed up unit or team,

260
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.110
then you might have to go in there and lay down some law.

261
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.470
But generally you come in and you assess and you make you,

262
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.980
then you see what's wrong and you see where some adjustments can be made.

263
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.710
Now think about that from the other side,
from down the chain of command.

264
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.740
You also shouldn't jump to conclusions and be like,
oh,

265
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:20.070
the new boss is an idiot or new boss has this plan.
You know,
you should be like,

266
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:21.450
okay,
let's see what his plan is.
Yeah,

267
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.280
you should both have a little period of like a,
like a,

268
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.210
like a cooling down period,
but a warming up period.
Sure.

269
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.880
The opposite of cooling down.
So warming up,
it's getting to know each other.
Yeah.

270
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.960
This is way out in left field,
but it's a big shocker.

271
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.390
Greg Mcintyre,
he'd,
he,
he did,

272
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.030
he made this one comment where he was explaining how he rolled with like some

273
00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:54.150
like some payments in person and um,
like he rolled and I was like,
oh yeah,

274
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:55.250
like how was that?
You know,

275
00:18:55.251 --> 00:18:57.240
you know how you want the full report and like how has it really,

276
00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:00.210
I forget who it was,
but he was like,
he was like,
Nah,
it was a full on,
you know,

277
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:03.730
first date role.
Oh eight.
And I didn't never heard that before,

278
00:19:03.731 --> 00:19:06.000
but I didn't know exactly what that means.
It was like,

279
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.850
I'm not going to go hard in the paint right off the bat.
He,

280
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.350
I can feel he's not going hard and it's just kind of feeling out,
you know,

281
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.810
and a lot of respect throughout the whole way level.

282
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:19.140
Does that start at in Jujitsu?
What do you mean?
Like what,
what,

283
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:21.870
how good do you have to be in Jujitsu before you start?

284
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.110
Like having a little nice gentle for I,

285
00:19:26.111 --> 00:19:29.550
you know what I call it was just respectful.
Yeah.
Like,
like here's an example,

286
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.290
just don't dive on the ankle lock.
Yeah.
You know,

287
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.200
two seconds into rolling.
Oh really?
I mean,
I've had that happen and then,

288
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:44.230
and then I've had to,
you know,
take appropriate call measures.
Right.

289
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.790
And you see and you know that fee and that's the whole reason for the first date

290
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:50.040
role really well it because it's like,
you know,

291
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:53.220
you start to really [inaudible] you've heard of him and he's heard of you and or

292
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:54.690
whatever,
whatever the situation is.

293
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.830
And you guys role and in your mind you're kind of like,
wait,

294
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:01.560
I'm going to give this guy some respect.
And he doesn't,
he goes all out.

295
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:04.260
First thing it's Kinda like you kinda got,
you got offended a little bit.

296
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:08.520
Not majorly,
but there's that little inkling of,
Oh,
all right,
it's something,

297
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.660
it's not nothing,
it's something.
But compared to just some dude,
you know,

298
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:15.150
let's say we're all training,
some do some new person,

299
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:17.190
whatever in the gym and you guys are all good and hard.
It's all good.

300
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:21.420
You're going hard.
Like basically purple belts.

301
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.590
They're coming at me,
brown belts and black belts,
stuff that,
you know,

302
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.590
it's all cool.
You know,
it's like mutual respect and we'll roll and not saying,

303
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.210
how am I saying don't real hard.

304
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:32.720
And I'm not saying you don't escalate because as you get to going,

305
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.590
you know like things escalate and you know that's,
you know,

306
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:37.500
he gets to know each other now.
It's okay to,
to get after it a little bit.

307
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.000
That's weird.
That's a weird little unwritten thing in Jujitsu,
isn't it?
I'm like,

308
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:45.900
well,
I don't really,
I guess it's just respect.
Yeah.
I think it's respect,

309
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.830
so yeah,
if you do that up and down the chain of command to,

310
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.890
<v 1>yeah.
It's that ferment like period,
like how you said that period.</v>

311
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.360
Get to know a little warming up period.
Warming up period.
Yeah,
exactly.
Interest.

312
00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.400
Give your bosses that slack.
I'll respect all.
Nice.
You know,

313
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.090
<v 2>next question [inaudible] I've got a question regarding the quote.</v>

314
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.270
If there is a doubt,
there's no doubt.
Oh,
right.

315
00:21:09.271 --> 00:21:11.250
I remember that from the last time.
Okay.

316
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.910
This would seem to indicate avoiding taking risks.
Many,

317
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.480
many businesses or many business decisions involve risk.

318
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.650
Often there can be a doubt about either of two options.

319
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.340
Doubt that you should maintain the status quo and doubt about pursuing a new

320
00:21:26.341 --> 00:21:31.341
opportunity to frequent or you frequently talk about dichotomies.

321
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.810
Would you mind sharing your thoughts on this principle?

322
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:34.840
<v 1>Yeah,
this is,</v>

323
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.870
this is a classic thing in and it's a great point and that's why these little

324
00:21:40.241 --> 00:21:41.530
sound bites can be a little bit dangerous.

325
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:45.160
Sometime we could use a little little power soundbites because they are that

326
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:47.560
simple.
Of course I've lo,
I like things to be simple,
right?

327
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:50.440
That's the number two law of combat is to keep things simple.

328
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.310
But sometimes things like this need a little bit of amplifying information and

329
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:54.611
yes,

330
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:59.611
this could be construed as being extremely risk averse and like,

331
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:05.050
hey,
if I have any doubt about the safety of success of this mission,

332
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:07.990
did we're not going to do it.
Which if that was the case,

333
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:11.710
then I would have done a zero missions during my deployments to Iraq.

334
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.110
Uh,
same with business.
Never would have started victory.

335
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.990
Emma May never would've started echelon front because there was risk involved in

336
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:20.890
starting those things.

337
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.700
Never would have done anything really because there's always going to be down.

338
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:28.930
So this is a accurate statement and of course every business has risk.

339
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.700
And so,
so I guess that idea that if there is a doubt,

340
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:38.020
there is no doubt is not to be taken literally when it comes to risk,

341
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.390
when it comes to risk,
don't take it literally.

342
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.070
But at what it should be I think is like a a warning,
right?

343
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.140
Like a little warning that's in your head.

344
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.000
If there's a doubt like okay,
we need to think about what's going on here.

345
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.770
We need to understand what,
what is at risk here.
Because,

346
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.160
and I just had this conversation with a CEO of a company.
As a matter of fact,

347
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:02.200
I was talking about the dichotomy of leadership and I was talking about how,

348
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:05.560
you know,
giving him examples.
I was like a,
for instance,
in,

349
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:09.670
and he was in a technology company and I said,
you know,
if you didn't take risk,

350
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.560
you wouldn't,
you wouldn't make any progress.
But if you took too much risk,

351
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:17.530
you wouldn't be where you are right now.
Cause they're dominating.
So it's like,

352
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.670
oh beer.
You're balancing that dichotomy all the time.
So if he would've said,
hey,

353
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.181
if there's a doubt,

354
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:24.250
there is no doubt he would never would've gotten off the ground.

355
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.910
Now where I think it becomes a more solid statement is from like a moral or an

356
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:37.110
ethical standpoint and that is if you think that something is wrong or that it

357
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:38.550
probably is,

358
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.810
if you think you're doing something that you probably shouldn't be doing,

359
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.570
then there's doubt and you probably shouldn't be doing it.

360
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.740
I think uneasy way to keep yourself in check and these days it's a very real

361
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.860
possibility is just if you think that you're being recorded at all times.

362
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.350
Like if you just think,
oh,
I'm being recorded,

363
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.690
which probably somebody is recording you.
Yeah.

364
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.730
Like if you decided you think you can get away with something,

365
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.590
you're probably not going to get away with it.
Look at all the,

366
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.710
just go watch you two don't caught in the act or whatever.

367
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:06.500
People get caught all the time.
So whenever you're doing,

368
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.930
I think that there could be somebody there with a phone recording you and I

369
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:12.530
think that's keeps you a morally and ethically in check.
You know,

370
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:17.531
I used to tell my guys that you could be getting watched by CNN or Al Jazeera or

371
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.380
some report,
you know,
whoever,
you know,

372
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:24.470
you could be getting watched and if you're doing something that you shouldn't be

373
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:27.290
doing,
your,
you're going to get caught.
So don't do it.

374
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.770
Not to mention these days we got the aircraft overhead,
they can see everything.

375
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:34.310
So do the right thing.
That's what you do.

376
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.080
You do the right thing.
Yeah.

377
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.830
If you have any doubt that what you're doing is the right thing,

378
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.160
then you should probably shouldn't do it.
A lot of those,

379
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:47.690
a lot of the horrible police actions,
yeah.
Are,

380
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.570
you know,
recorded by some random person with a phone.
Now,

381
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:53.010
of course I always need to point out,

382
00:24:53.011 --> 00:24:56.510
but there's all these good actions that take place every single day.

383
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.700
Millions and millions of police doing the right thing.
No one publishes those.

384
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:06.200
No one uploads those on to youtube or Facebook.
But the bad acts that are caught,

385
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:07.760
they're caught because someone has a camera.

386
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.130
And so like that's great advice for our cop.
Hey,

387
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.780
act like you're being recorded all the time.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

388
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:19.120
That's interesting.
Well,
I make it because you very well might be.
Yeah.

389
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.420
So do the right thing.
Next question.

390
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.920
Thank God I didn't have cameras when I was a kid for all the dumb stuff I did.

391
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.360
Yeah.
I always want to make sure that I'm not sitting here saying like,

392
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.930
everyone out there should do the right thing.
We like me.

393
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.080
I'm not saying that if he thought I was saying that,

394
00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:41.510
I'm not saying that and I apologize for even sounding that way.

395
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.800
Like I was as dumb and stupid as the next person and still do dumb stuff.

396
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.560
Try not to you the man.
You don't do dumb stuff.
Right.

397
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:53.480
You know it was bad when,
when,
uh,

398
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.590
when we had Charlie plumb and Jim Conkle on.
Yeah.

399
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.130
And I'm like thinking they're like,
you know,
hey,
this is the way to act.
Right.

400
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:05.180
And I'm like,
don't put me in that category with you guys.
You guys are awesome.

401
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:09.240
Like heroes and I'm just over here.
Yeah.

402
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.320
Don't say that about me.
You guys can say like,
Hey,

403
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.740
talk about character.
You have character.
I'm just over here trying to

404
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.420
shuck.
Next question should make map,

405
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.000
that's what we're calling McMath McMakin.

406
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.410
That's the Marine Corps martial arts program.

407
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.990
Should make map belts carry over in some way to Jujitsu built or should everyone

408
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:37.100
starts out as a white belt no matter what kind of training you've had before.

409
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.980
Yeah.
Yup.
White belt,
white belt.
Uh,
for those of you who don't know,

410
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.250
make map is Mick map is the Marine Corps martial arts program.
It's good program.

411
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.190
It's solid.
It's a solid good place to start.

412
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.380
The Marine Corps put together a good program.

413
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:56.370
The army has a really good program to the army combatives program.
Yeah.

414
00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.600
Great stuff.
And both those are solid,

415
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:03.390
but specifically the Marine Corps makes when the Marine Corps martial arts

416
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.800
program has belts,

417
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.730
you get like a Tan belt and then I think a green belt and then a brown belt and

418
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.150
a black dog.
Pretty Legit,
right?
They have a little program.
Um,

419
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.120
there is no equivalency to Jujitsu.
Like you,
you'll know some stuff,

420
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.390
but it's,
you should just want to go to start to you to,

421
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.660
you just go with the white belt on.
I mean now it's the same thing with judo.

422
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.760
Judo is really close to Jujitsu as we know.
Judah is really close to Jitsu.

423
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.360
If you have a black belt in judo,
cool white belt in Jujitsu,

424
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.260
a sambo Severi,
you know,
again,

425
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:40.350
very similar to Jujitsu white belt.
So you might,

426
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:43.570
you're going to get promoted faster because you have a lot of experience in

427
00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:45.970
wrestling is the same thing.
Like you just don't go,
Whoa,
I'm,
I'm uh,

428
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.450
I'm just going to show up as a purple belt cause I've been grappling for eight

429
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:52.110
years.
No,
it doesn't work that way.
Shell the white belt,
be humble.
No big deal.

430
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.110
You'll advance fast.
Don't care about the belts,
man.

431
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.240
We talk about this all the time.
Doesn't matter.
Just go in there and train.

432
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.740
And matter of fact,
having a white belt,

433
00:28:01.741 --> 00:28:05.310
it's Kinda nice because there's no pressure whatsoever.
Like,

434
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.990
just enjoy that in,
enjoy,
not worried about getting tapped out.
Enjoy.

435
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.170
Just being able to roll and roll with people that are better than you or worse

436
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.030
than you.
And you're the lowest on the bottom of the totem pole.

437
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.850
You can roll with anybody in tap out and that's it.
It's cool.

438
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.880
Don't worry about it.
Yeah,
I agree.

439
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.591
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:26.591
I mean that seems kind of self explanatory maybe a little bit because you know,

441
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.430
it's like anything,

442
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.630
it's like any accolade cause it's really what the belt is essentially.

443
00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:34.490
It's like an accolade,
right,
that you can wear.

444
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.650
I think that belt actually is a sign of where you are on the,

445
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:43.580
on the hierarchy.
Right.
And it's a sign though.

446
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.460
It's not written in stone.
It's just a sign.

447
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.010
Because we know that there's indicate yes.
An indicator.
Right.

448
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.240
Cause we know that there's,
there's,

449
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:55.160
there's the can tap out black belts and there's,
yeah.
And it's just an indicator.

450
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.330
But what about like the purpose though?
You know,
it's like a,

451
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.310
it's like a little thing,
like a badge.
Okay.
Yeah.

452
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.540
I'm trying to figure if I can counter that,
but I don't think,
yeah,

453
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.670
it's like a badge.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I'm trying to figure it out for sure.

454
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.850
Like what it is.
I like belts by the way.
I like it.
I dig the whole thing.
Um,

455
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.210
but yeah,
if you get kind of that badge in,
in something specific,

456
00:29:16.211 --> 00:29:18.950
it's only something specific.
Like even like real badges,
you know,

457
00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:22.460
this is specific,
so yeah,
when you come and do something else,
it's like,
yeah,

458
00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:26.400
you got to get that specific batch.
Yeah,
true in,
you know,
um,

459
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.330
studio five 40 right.
Rubs up there.
They have judo and Jiu Jitsu judo in there.

460
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.600
So,
you know,
if you're taking the Jujitsu class,
you know,

461
00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:38.480
at noon and then you go to the judo class at two,
yeah.

462
00:29:38.481 --> 00:29:40.940
You're changing your belts.
If you're different,
you know,
you can't just,

463
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.220
I'm just going to keep up my gear

464
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.830
<v 3>and just teach me judo.
I'm not knowing and now obey you,
change your belts.</v>

465
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.910
That's how you know,
this is a different thing.
And like he said,

466
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.580
it's vice versa to get your black belt in Jujitsu,

467
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.700
go to a judo class.
White Belt.
Yeah.
Straight up.
You're not,
he goes,
yeah.
Yeah.

468
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.520
But the actually this

469
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.200
<v 2>question,
he said,
should it,
should it translate,
um,
carry over in some way.</v>

470
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.590
<v 3>Yeah.
It does carry over in some way,
right.
Have some level of skill.</v>

471
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.280
The skill does not the belt though.
Yeah.
You have some level of skill.
Now,

472
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.550
if you're a black belt in mic map,

473
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.250
if all you took was Mick map,
you will not be able to,
you won't,

474
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.860
you will get you Ahmad,
have a good time.
You will not do well against,
uh,

475
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.430
a Jiu Jitsu black belt.
Most Jujitsu,
black belts.
Yeah.

476
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.960
You're not going to do well.
And that's,
and that's just kind of speaks more

477
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.080
time.
What time of training?
It's time of training.
If you've been training longer,

478
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.980
you're going to win.
Yeah.
That's the general rule.
You know,

479
00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:41.110
of course there's athleticism and their strength and there's blah,
blah,
blah,

480
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:44.980
blah.
But if you've been training Jujitsu longer,
you're going to win.
Yeah,

481
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.040
pretty much.

482
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.400
<v 2>Yeah.
Makes Sense.
Next question.</v>

483
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.990
I run a five man team,
two men down.
What does that mean?

484
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.440
It means these missing to you guys.
Okay,
so five man team.
So what?

485
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.870
It's supposed to be seven now with fiber it's,
it's a five man team.

486
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:05.600
Now there's only three.
We don't know either way.

487
00:31:05.601 --> 00:31:09.870
We figured that he's undermanned.
Sure know.
Sure.
Okay.

488
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:14.810
Under man team five mentees to Minda.
I'm not meeting performance expectations,

489
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.640
no support coming from my command.

490
00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.510
Do you see a way out other than just getting after it?

491
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.880
I know you also talk about blaming yourself in taking extreme ownership because

492
00:31:25.881 --> 00:31:29.450
the people above you may have different information that leads to prioritize

493
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:32.120
different areas.
However,

494
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.330
when I questioned things like why we don't have enough people working in

495
00:31:35.331 --> 00:31:39.320
different zones when clearly there's an imbalance in zones to the point

496
00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:43.160
customers notice or it makes it difficult for colleagues to do their jobs,

497
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.560
then I'm deemed argumentative and that I don't have the best intentions.

498
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.603
This was,

499
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.540
this was with the manager that is in charge of in charge of business and I would

500
00:31:53.541 --> 00:31:55.610
think understands my perspective more.

501
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.060
We're supposed to have a culture of feedback,
but he isn't receptive.

502
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.830
I'm not the only one who said that about him as well.
This all leads to me.
To me,

503
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.860
this all leads me to think that I must just be fake and go through the motions.

504
00:32:12.561 --> 00:32:13.670
But that discussed.

505
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:19.930
<v 3>Yeah.
So,
uh,
what do we do here?
How do we take ownership of this?</v>

506
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:24.110
How do you take ownership of your boss not listening to you,

507
00:32:24.111 --> 00:32:25.940
not hearing what you're saying?
Well,

508
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.260
the way you take ownership of that isn't to say my boss doesn't listen and

509
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:34.070
doesn't understand the way to take ownership.
But that is to say that I'm not a,

510
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.340
I'm not doing a good job of getting my information to my boss.

511
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.900
I'm not doing a good job of convincing my boss.

512
00:32:38.901 --> 00:32:40.160
I'm not do a good job of influencing

513
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.120
<v 1>my boss' boss.</v>

514
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.700
So you can either be mad about that or you can change your approach.
Uh,
step one,

515
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.990
we're going back to this again today.
Um,
build a relationship with that person.

516
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.600
Now there's a chance that that discussed shield
there is,

517
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:58.760
right.
I've talked about that before.

518
00:32:58.761 --> 00:33:02.390
I've literally said that I had great relationships with people that I had like a

519
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:03.530
visceral hatred for.

520
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.560
I still had a good relationship with them and worked very well with them.

521
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.890
If it discussed you and you can't do that,

522
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.660
then there's other jobs,
right?
We're going to have to interact with other people.

523
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:16.490
You know,
you can be like a long haul truck driver,

524
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.310
you can be a technical writer for you.
You know,

525
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.630
where you just look at the information and turn it into words.

526
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.280
You can be a lab technician.

527
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:28.910
We don't have to interact with a lot of different people and that's cool.
Um,

528
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.300
there's a lot of jobs out there that require very little human and action.

529
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:35.990
That's fine because if you think you're going to go through life only working

530
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:39.770
with people that you get along with,
you're wrong.
That's not going to happen.

531
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.980
Especially if you want to run teams and you want to lead and you have to learn

532
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.770
how to get over the fact that you might have to work with people that you don't

533
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:50.300
like.
And by the way,
on top of that,

534
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.150
if they know that you don't like them,

535
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.080
that is not going to make your job easier and it's Kinda not going to make your

536
00:33:57.081 --> 00:33:59.870
life better.
In fact it's going to make your life more miserable.

537
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.950
The people that I had visceral hatred for that that I worked for,

538
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.680
it wasn't that bad because at least they thought I liked them and and I acted

539
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.560
like it and they liked me.
So it's like,
okay,
it was a little painful,

540
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:13.394
but you know what?
Yeah,

541
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.520
it's pretty low impact as opposed to like head to head conflict every single

542
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.383
day.
And by the way,

543
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.630
when you have head to head conflict every day you're miserable.

544
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.570
You're going to advance slower,
you're going to have less control over your fate,

545
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.020
you're not going to get promoted.
And on top of all that,

546
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:32.870
you're going to get assigned the crappiest possible jobs because your boss

547
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.240
doesn't like you and he likes that other guy over there.

548
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.510
So he's going to get the easy job.
Yeah,
right.
He's going to get go.

549
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:42.560
You go save the Princess Jocko,
go slay the dragon.
Right now,
of course we know,

550
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:44.930
I prefer to say the,
and it's never been the princess,

551
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.630
but that's what I'm saying,

552
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:51.080
like you want to get along with this person when to play the long game.

553
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.180
He wouldn't play the long game.
And here's the deal.
When you play the long game,

554
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.520
if the person's sucks as bad as you say they do,

555
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.580
they'll end up making their own bed and having to lie in it and they'll end up

556
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:07.790
working for you.
Now

557
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.620
also make sure that you come to the table with solutions,

558
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:17.090
not just complaints and problems,
right?

559
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.380
You could see that this guy's talking about we don't have enough guys and you

560
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.340
need to square with the zones.
Well,
what's your solution?

561
00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:26.330
The problems and what's really smart to do,

562
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.250
and you've gotta be a little bit careful of this,

563
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:33.251
but what can be very smart to do is if you can solve the problem with your own

564
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:38.680
internal assets,
just go and execute on it and solve it.

565
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.130
It will.
If you use your own internal assets to solve a problem,
make the,

566
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.950
make the change,
make it happen to implement it.
And you go to the Boston,
say,
Hey,

567
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.450
this is what we did.
There was this problem on our zones or whatever.
The cool,

568
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.700
yeah,
we made this adjustment.
I took two guys from this,
blah,
blah,
blah.

569
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.640
I moved them around and now here's where we're at.
We're getting better.
You know,

570
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.400
results you,

571
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.640
you have to be careful because you can say that in such a way that you're thrown

572
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.790
in your boss's face,
right?
Yeah.
You can absolutely do that now.

573
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.360
Even though you were trying to build a relationship and trying to help the

574
00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:11.650
mission and you still end up with an adversarial relationship with your boss.

575
00:36:11.651 --> 00:36:14.100
And if things go negative again,
so you gotta be careful when you do this.

576
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.130
Or you can also just present the idea and present the solution and be like,

577
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:18.990
hey boss,
here's what I want to do.
Which is,

578
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.560
that's once you've got the relationship trust built up,
that doesn't there,

579
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:25.770
that you can't just go present a broad present a solution of how you're going to

580
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:27.610
do it.
It's not gonna let you do it because he doesn't trust you.
Yeah.

581
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.120
He's got an adversarial relationship with you.
You see where this is?
Yeah.

582
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.750
You see how this works?
Yeah.
Another thing he says in here,

583
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.370
he says,
uh,
he says,
uh,

584
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.400
I would think the manage,

585
00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:44.850
this was a manager that is in charge of the business.

586
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:48.690
And I would think he understands my perspective more,
right?
So here we go.

587
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.530
If you want to take ownership of things and how you,

588
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:53.580
and you look at your boss and say,

589
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.580
he doesn't blame my perspective or doesn't understand my perspective,

590
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.280
that's his fault.
You know,
the way I look at that,

591
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.130
if you don't understand my perspective as my boss,
it's my fault.

592
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.720
That means I'm not explaining to you.

593
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.390
It means I'm not giving you enough information means I'm not convinced you.

594
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:08.490
It means I'm not building relationships so that you can see my perspective.

595
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.320
That's what that is.
So don't blame the boss.

596
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.090
Step up your game.
Build the relationship.
Teach him the perspective and a win.

597
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.740
And I'll tell you one more little thing on this from a,

598
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:29.690
to get away from the disgust mindset because I understand that.
Yeah.

599
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:31.180
You know,
the one,

600
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.850
one good way to get away from disgust mindset is to get into the game mindset.

601
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.420
The game,
like this is a game and this guy that I don't like,

602
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.110
I'm going to become best friends with them.
Watch me like,
okay,

603
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.990
oh you don't like this guy?
Cool.
Watch.
Yeah,
watch this.

604
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.420
That's how it's gonna go and you're going to find with it,

605
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.710
are you going to try and win the game?
Yeah.
Which is good.
I'm sure

606
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.390
that understanding perspective,
um,

607
00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.500
I think that's the everyday,
almost everyday kind of thing where,

608
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.980
okay,
so my wife,

609
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.990
<v 2>we're on our way to the park.
This is today by the way.</v>

610
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.810
And she's like,
oh it,
she said it's,
there's two parks,
there's one,

611
00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:16.820
you can go straight.
There's one,
you'd make a right.

612
00:38:16.821 --> 00:38:17.900
Then you make another left isn't,

613
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.120
there's two parks and I don't know which one are we going to,

614
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:25.100
I don't really mind which one we go to.
Uh,
so she was like,
yeah,

615
00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:29.570
let's,
let's go to the other one.
Right.
And she mentions the,
I dunno,

616
00:38:29.571 --> 00:38:32.620
which even one is the other one,
but whatever.
I'll follow your direction.

617
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.590
So she said,
okay,
make her said she goes,
stay this lane.

618
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.520
She doesn't motion though.
She goes stay in this lane something.
Okay,

619
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.830
we're going to stay in this lane.
And she goes,
okay turn here.

620
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.360
But then so she's not like pointing like turn here.
It's like,

621
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.000
cause there's a turn right here and then there's one like right here,
you know,

622
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.350
turn here can apply to like a bunch of stuff.
But in her mind it's super clear,

623
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:58.290
you know?
So if I would've got mad or actually the,

624
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.720
I can see how people can get frustrated right there.
Right.

625
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.810
So if I were to express myself,
oh you're not being more clear.
Boom.
Now we're,

626
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.340
we're against each other because I didn't,
in my mind I'm like,

627
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:12.520
I can't read your mind.
Explain better.
Just got a funny story.
He was,

628
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:15.490
they were on night visions in a Humvee is telling the driver,

629
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:17.500
he's in the vehicle commander seat,
which is the,

630
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.850
basically the pat the front passenger seat and he's,
he's pointing,

631
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.480
he's going,
hey,
turn here,
here,
here.
And,

632
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.690
and the guy just keeps driving and he goes,

633
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:31.270
Bro redoing and the guy's like,

634
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.400
I can't see you because we have night vision goggles on.

635
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:36.610
You have no peripheral vision.
He's like,
I can't see your fingers.

636
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.870
And leaves like,
oh sorry.

637
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.330
Because what you can probably call his right turn 30 meters.
Right,

638
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.450
right turn 500 meters.
Right.
Turn a hundred meters right.
Turn coming up.

639
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.850
Right turn,
boom.
And that way the person can do it.
Yeah.

640
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.350
But life was pointing but the guy couldn't say,

641
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:55.450
but there's this very similar to your wife who's not pointing.
Yeah,

642
00:39:55.451 --> 00:39:58.930
she wasn't pointed at the time.
Well,
here's the thing too.
This is jammed me up.

643
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:03.850
I'm not to take too long in this one,
but the way girls,
girl,
the way girls,

644
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:07.300
female females,
girls take,

645
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:09.790
do you remember the last time you talked about you generalize females?

646
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:12.630
Go ahead at your peril.
Go ahead.
No,
he wasn't in my parole because that,

647
00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:15.860
that was the same thing.
It was the giant of bicycling.
Exactly right.

648
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.290
It's the same thing.
Cause then Nolan,
Nolan,
jewel bike,

649
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:22.540
it's completely cut her off to correct someone.

650
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.540
Drew you on a trace on animated just as legit credit separate than the plane.

651
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.610
But it was good.
There was also some,

652
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.570
there was also some pretty a nonworking bicycles that were drawn.

653
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:38.460
Correct.
And I dig it and this is by no means says you know,

654
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:43.330
the superiority or inferiority of any of this,
of the sex at all.

655
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.980
I'm just saying there was a study done,

656
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:50.800
girls and guys interpret and give directions in completely different ways

657
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:55.400
because of how they,
how their brain formulates like um,
like uh,

658
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.590
directions.
So girls kind of required,
this is real.
Generally speaking,

659
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:02.680
girls are required like landmark Jordan B.
Peterson back on the talk about this.

660
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.470
Okay.
I want to,
I'd ask.
So girls,

661
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.950
they prefer like landmarks and you know,
you know,

662
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:11.860
like the voice on the thing like she'll be like,
oh,

663
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:15.600
and this one so they can wait.
You mean the Siri Voice?
Siri voice?
Yeah,
whatever,

664
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.390
whatever.
Yeah.

665
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:20.770
I mean those can help guys to or whatever that that navigation voice wasn't part

666
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:22.810
of this study so I shouldn't even mention the voice.

667
00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:27.060
But they prefer like landmarks,
like maker rights and resting in a building jet.

668
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:32.320
Yeah.
When,
when you're flying a jet plane.
Sure.

669
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.890
Yeah.
Which,
which I have done a backseat ride into f 18 before,

670
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.450
but the voice that talks to you is a,
is a female voice and the,

671
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.600
and I was told that it's because it relaxes,

672
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:49.130
it gets the attention of and then kinda relaxes the pilots.
So it says like,

673
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.120
like when I was fine and I dunno,
I wasn't like we were going to die,
but um,

674
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.950
at all,
like I'm not going to say that at all.
But the thing would say warning,

675
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.250
it was a girl's voice from take warning,
warning,
altitude,

676
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:06.290
altitude and yeah.
So they say it's relaxing a little bit.
Yeah,
I could dig it.

677
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.570
Um,
you know,
typically if my wife has given me directions,
it's not relaxing.

678
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.300
I'm not saying it's stressful,
but it's not relaxing.

679
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.420
So where were you going with this new girl that you said was going to be
shorter?

680
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.930
It's dangerous to do the directions thing,

681
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:25.280
the navigation thing with your wife or your girlfriend or with the girl?

682
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.440
With the girl.
Then like if you,

683
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.600
let's say you and a girl in whatever capacity is sitting next to you and you

684
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:33.531
guys are,

685
00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:36.710
you know how like one we're looking for the hotel and we were both sort of

686
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:40.490
looking for the hotel and we're both kind of navigating and then I failed.

687
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:43.400
Then you just jumped me.
You don't remember that.
You actually debrief me.

688
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.190
You're like hey,
when it was time,
when I failed that math,
you were just like,

689
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:50.550
I got this here.
Right.
Turn coming up 500 meters.
Right turn 200 meters.
Yeah,

690
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.660
right turn 100 meters.
Right turn right turn right turn.
Okay,

691
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.790
get the right hand lane.
And you were just like cool.
Yeah.
Yes.
So it's easy.

692
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.850
So consider that type of situation before you took over.

693
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.870
Consider that situation when we were both trying to navigate.

694
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.260
If you do that with a girl you,

695
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.320
you are more likely to run into problems because of this.

696
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.160
They interpret know what this is and how they interpret and give directions in

697
00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:14.720
different ways cause their brain works different.

698
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.830
They require it like landmarks got kinda guide them.
Okay.
Make a right at this,

699
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:22.520
make a left at this.
That helps.
Sure.
But it's more the guys go off of,

700
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.280
they build the map in their head.
So if they're like,
okay,

701
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.950
like if they looked at a map they'd be like,
okay,

702
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:31.130
they'd have a better understanding.
Okay so sure I can make a right at the,

703
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:32.540
at the building or whatever.

704
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.880
But when they make a right there like okay I made that right.

705
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:37.230
So here I am physically oriented,
you know,

706
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.640
and they kind of make sense of that way more than the girls do.

707
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.140
I'm not saying there's like one is black,
one is white.
I'm seeing w one does one,

708
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.930
one does more than,
yeah,

709
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.220
it's more than 10 tendency because it's how your mind works.
Okay.

710
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.950
This is just the start.

711
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.960
I didn't do the study at any way to address this with echo on social media can

712
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.770
address it to echo.
I'm out.

713
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:04.360
I will say this and I'll believe the study.
I sure will cause I haven't been.

714
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.830
The other one is if you have it,
if you can listen to all the podcasts.

715
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:12.070
Echo also said that girls cannot draw off hand a functional bicycle.

716
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:15.980
Correct.
And he got a lot.
He got a lot of attempts.
Yeah.

717
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.870
And he did get one person that put a gift.
It's a gift for animated Gif,

718
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:25.760
animated Gif of echo himself riding a tricycle icicle.
Yeah.

719
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:29.720
It was pretty awesome.
Again,
beside the point,

720
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.950
but it was very awesome.
I don't even

721
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.340
<v 3>have any idea what the point of anything that we've said in the last few
minutes,</v>

722
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:38.710
and I don't even want you to try and explain to about miscommunication.
Like,

723
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.770
I can't read your mind.
You've got a community,
you know,

724
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.710
like the heat don't understand my perspective he's supposed to understand kind

725
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:48.210
of thing.
You know God.
Yes,
yes.
True,
true men.
So you gotta be clear.

726
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:48.960
This is what I'm saying,

727
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.860
like how you were when we were finding that steak place or the hotel or whatever

728
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:57.540
else.
A good steak,
by the way.
Yes.
All right.
Next question.

729
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.720
Do you think we,

730
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:05.490
do you think you would take up Jujitsu in your forties if you had been

731
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:08.790
introduced to something else in your 20s like Muy Thai boxing,
et Cetera?

732
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.750
I'm struggling with Jujitsu.
I respect the hell out of it.

733
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.820
I have an easier time with boxing and kickboxing.
Just interesting.

734
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:20.700
I'm just making a little bit like I have an easier time with these things.

735
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.130
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's what I'm going to focus on.

736
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.100
Maybe giving your most recent admission that you're,
you are boring.

737
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.080
Obviously you're not because of your popularity.

738
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.350
Do you think you'd pick it up later in life?

739
00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.970
Jujitsu to me is a chore.
Boxing kickboxing is fun.

740
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:43.410
I think because in my youth I figured out how to move my body in that way.

741
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.850
I'm 43,
by the way.
Uh,
so first of all,

742
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.120
do I think I would go to Jujitsu or started Jujitsu or get into Jujitsu in my

743
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:58.480
forties if I hadn't,
if I had been?
Yes,
absolutely.
100%.
Uh,

744
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:03.210
the power of Jujitsu is very real.
It's a real thing.
And once I recognized it,

745
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.210
I wanted to have that power.
The power to

746
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.120
choke people are walk them dominate when like when with no mercy.

747
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:13.343
Now what,

748
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.200
What's interesting about this is there's certain people like certain things,

749
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:17.760
right?
And he even says like,

750
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.150
I have an easier time with kickboxing and boxing cause he's,
he's part of,

751
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:23.490
that's because he's done it for a long time since it's 20.

752
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:28.491
So it's just easy for him and [inaudible] like Jujitsu seems like a chore for

753
00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:31.800
Him.
Cause you know what else he's getting beat up,
you know,

754
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:34.280
if he doesn't just get into it now he's getting beat up.
He's getting sure out.

755
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.850
That's a chore,
man.
It's hard.
It's hard on the ego.
Yeah.
Um,

756
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:44.430
yeah,
I thought of an interesting rule.
If you don't like Jujitsu,

757
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.580
if you don't think you liked you,
maybe,
what do you think of this rule?

758
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:52.360
If you don't think you like Jujitsu,
take it.
And I was trying to think of,

759
00:46:52.361 --> 00:46:54.000
take it for six months,
take it for three months.

760
00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:59.001
And I said take it until you legitimately submit someone that is comparable in

761
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:06.690
some way to you.
Yeah.
You think that's a good rule?
I think that's a good rule.

762
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.590
Yeah,
that's a good rule.
Yeah.
Because I'm not talking about you.

763
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.560
You tap someone out that's weak and small,

764
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:16.390
are weaker than you and smaller than you,
and then you're like,
see,
I can tap out.

765
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.251
I'm going to quit now.
No,

766
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:22.251
I'm talking about someone that's equivalent to someone that has some comparable

767
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.430
like physical attributes to you,

768
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:30.010
because I believe that once somebody gets the

769
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.240
<v 2>taste of the power power,
and also this is also implies,</v>

770
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.480
or is it factually,
if you train enough that you submit someone,

771
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.070
that means you got submitted thousands,
probably 500 times.

772
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.140
You think that's a good number five.
I bet if you,

773
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.210
by the time you submit what someone in Jujitsu,

774
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.950
you've probably been submitted 500 times.
Okay.
400 ten three hundred times.

775
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:55.810
300 times,
yeah.
Yeah.
If you go to Jujitsu academy as a white belt,

776
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.720
the zero training you're going to get submitted

777
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.210
four times,
five times,
six times a class.
Right.
Well,

778
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.920
it just depends if there's other white belts that are first,
second,
third,
fourth,

779
00:48:08.921 --> 00:48:10.670
fifth day for the first month.

780
00:48:10.671 --> 00:48:14.440
So he you could now,
yeah.

781
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:17.520
You could depend on and that you get it submitted.
Oh yeah.

782
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.920
Times 300 times.
Its 200 times.

783
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.610
It's definitely more than a hundred but I wouldn't say before a hundred times in

784
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:29.140
a week.
Wait,
before he was Dee Dee said times before you tap over to anybody.

785
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:33.580
Yes.
Yeah.
That's going to depend.
If you have other white belt in first day guys,

786
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:36.160
let's say you've,
yeah,
of course you've been training for three weeks.

787
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:37.910
You can tap out something that hasn't been training app.
Yeah.

788
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.690
That's how fast you can learn Jujitsu.
Yeah.
When I first,

789
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:42.010
the first moves that I learned,
I didn't,

790
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:44.230
I probably knew like a month's worth of Jujitsu,

791
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:47.950
but no one could hang with me because I knew like the basic stuff and no one

792
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:52.000
even knew what to do.
Yeah,
yeah.
Consider a rear naked choke.

793
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.840
All you have to do is you can learn the rear naked choke one day in the

794
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:59.350
beginning of class and all you have to figure out when you roll.

795
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.760
If a guy doesn't have much experience,

796
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:02.830
all you have to figure out is how to get on his back.

797
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.470
It's all you got to do is really cool when you teach kids Jujitsu,

798
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.270
like you can say something like,

799
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.250
you could give them the class on how to pass the guard.
Yeah.
Right.

800
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.810
And they would start to do what you told them to do.
Or You could say,
okay,

801
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:20.470
your goal is to get out of their legs and get around,
uh,

802
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.830
and they'll figure out how to do it and it's pretty awesome.

803
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.830
And then what you do is you give him a couple little planers yeah.

804
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.260
Because their instincts will be a little bit off,

805
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:30.430
but you come a couple little pointers,

806
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:33.160
a couple of things to work with and then they'll develop those into some really

807
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:37.480
cool stuff.
Yeah.
I don't know if I said this before,

808
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:39.940
but that even is true.
Not as much,

809
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.500
but it's still true with adults because if you teach them the technique first

810
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:46.660
and then,
then you say,
hey,
the those techniques that taught you,

811
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:51.130
that's passing the garden and it doesn't,
it's way easier to like get,

812
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:55.270
it's almost like getting a big piece of clay and being like,
okay,
make the head,

813
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.760
make the body,
make the arms.
That's it.
And then be like,
okay,

814
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.820
now you got the arms.
That's cool.
Now I'll make the fingers now,
make the,

815
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.151
you know,

816
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:04.930
and then start to go with the details there as far as the technical techniques

817
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:07.350
with like passing the guard.
But I,

818
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:12.570
that's how actually that's how I learned from Dean where he would teach stuff.

819
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:15.160
But I would just see him like getting past and I know,
okay,

820
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.100
when he gets passed to you,
that's like hard to get out of.

821
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:21.010
So that's what I wanted to try to do and when guys would get this affirmative.

822
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.010
Yeah.
So I thought,

823
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.310
I thought that it really worked better that way to just to teach that way if

824
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:29.450
someone's starting from zero,

825
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.660
because it's hard to put into context when you don't know anything.
You're like,

826
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:34.310
yeah,
I'm doing this cool lights.
Pretty cool.
Neat.

827
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:38.300
It's cool doing the intro class at the monster because you have a lot of people

828
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.030
that have never done did you two before?
Yeah.
Yeah.

829
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:44.180
And that's that the cow and how you're saying to teach is exactly how we teach

830
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:45.770
them the text.
Like,
Hey,
this is the concept.

831
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:48.140
And then we teach a couple little moves of like what to do there.

832
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.990
And then you watch people get after it and they do get it.
It's pretty cool.
Yeah.

833
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:57.620
But yes,
here,
the,
the reason for this,
and this goes for anything,
by the way,

834
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.920
if you are successful,
especially if they're all,
if they're kind of similar,

835
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.920
like in this case where he's like,
okay,
martial arts,
right?
Jujitsu,

836
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.650
I'm going to start Jujitsu way late.
Meanwhile,

837
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:11.651
I have experience doing when we timeboxing so if he has experience,

838
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:13.760
assuming he's been somewhat successful,

839
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:16.010
not necessarily competition but not not competition,

840
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:18.350
just so he knows what he's doing.
When he throws a punch,

841
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:23.210
he can have a level of success of that punch landing,
you know like,

842
00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:26.060
and it's going to be pretty often if he has 20 years experience,
give or take,

843
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:30.050
whatever.
So he's experiencing little,
how should I say,

844
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:34.550
a little micro successes when he jumps in the boxing situation and we tight and

845
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:38.300
you just use getting no failure,
micro failures all day,
all day.

846
00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:42.470
It's a huge chore and that's life.
So if you look,
if you're,

847
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:45.750
if you're going in with nothing,
you have no micro,
you know,

848
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.430
success is no nothing.
You're just going in.
I don't train anything.
I go in,

849
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:50.480
sure I'll take some hits,

850
00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:52.790
I'll take some failures because I'm learning this new thing.

851
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.220
But if you have it compared to,
look,
I'm going to come into victory MMA,

852
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.610
I'm going to see the kickboxing situation going on and said,

853
00:52:00.611 --> 00:52:04.070
you Jitsu situation quite on my brain is automatically going to be like,
okay,

854
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:06.490
what's going to be the best experience for me or any victories?

855
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:10.130
If I'm going to go where the victories are,
I'm going to go where the payoff is.

856
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.860
You know those payoffs where I can land punches,
I can do it,

857
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.950
I can know what I'm dulling.
Dang.
When I moved my body,

858
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:19.970
it does what I want it to do and it yields success.
Yeah,
it's effective.

859
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:25.360
Or I can go to Jujitsu and where everyone else has success.

860
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:28.970
Everyone else is getting their payoff,
not me.
By the way,
everyone else is.

861
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:32.270
I'm getting tapped out.
And that part in and of itself is like,
that's,

862
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.080
especially if you're a guidance,
is it a personality thing where some people,

863
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:40.220
as soon as they get,
as soon as they get tapped into just pseudo like,
oh my God,

864
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:41.800
I need to learn this immediately.
Like,

865
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.080
you know when you're young people get the Jujitsu bug.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah,

866
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:51.530
everyone else did.
You do to book,
right?
Not everyone.
A lot of people do.
Well,

867
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.620
what percentage of people get the Jujitsu book?
Dang,

868
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:58.280
I have no 20% 30% depends.

869
00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.800
Like 20% of who?
Of all people.

870
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.400
It was probably not even 20% think about it like it's weird as much as theirs

871
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:12.670
there is Jujitsu as much as we talk about it in a very positive way.

872
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.110
People,
normal people have a hard time with it.
It's weird for me to admit that.

873
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.890
It's weird for me to say that B,
but if I think about it,

874
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:22.671
I've talked about this before,

875
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:26.040
like of all the people that I've introduced to Jujitsu over the years,

876
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:27.783
<v 3>I,</v>

877
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:32.890
I think I have like maybe four black belts of people that I fully like they,

878
00:53:33.281 --> 00:53:34.560
they started,
you did too because of me.

879
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.290
I'm talking so that with those percentages,
it's a very,

880
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:40.890
very small people that actually stick with it and get the bug might not even

881
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:44.820
before and,
but you and you can get the bug and the bug kind of wear off.

882
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.680
You know?
That is where,
you know,
I,
I remember then that's not the bug.

883
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.120
That's not the real bugs.
That's like the,
the,

884
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.130
the Diet bug light.

885
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.090
Well,

886
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.790
it's a bug light because people gets purple belt and then they don't show up

887
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:04.280
anymore.
People that the brown belt,
they don't show up.

888
00:54:04.281 --> 00:54:07.540
People don't get the blue belt and they don't show up anymore.
Yeah.
It just,

889
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.000
they just keep training.
Yeah.
Basket blog.

890
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:16.560
That's the real bug fully.
I used to think like,
when you dream about it,

891
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:18.790
you know how like your dream,
you'll learn the move and you'll dream.

892
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.290
It'll just be kind of be a new thing in your mind.
You know?

893
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:24.510
It's the conscious and the subconscious.
I thought that that was kind of it,

894
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:26.610
but in my experience that that goes away sometimes.

895
00:54:26.611 --> 00:54:31.200
It depends on what you're into,
but I dunno.
Yeah.
But nonetheless,
he,

896
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.530
that's it.
That's what I think.
Cause that's pretty common.
Like

897
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.760
actual advice.
Yeah.

898
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:42.150
Like do you think you think that's so my answers are yes.

899
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:47.151
I would have stunned Jujitsu cause I would have had the bug and my advice is if

900
00:54:48.031 --> 00:54:51.720
it's a chore,
keep doing it until it's fun.
Yeah,

901
00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.560
I get it.
It is fun to get beat.

902
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.350
It's fun to get like it's fun.

903
00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:01.950
It's fun to have like my favorite people to train with other people that gave me

904
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:02.784
the hardest runs,

905
00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.930
absolute most favorite people to train with other people that actually can get

906
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:10.020
me,
you know.
But it's again,
when you have to have this,

907
00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:15.060
there's this third factor here where the kickboxing and boxing is right there.

908
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:19.140
I could be right there right now.
Meaning you know,

909
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.900
just doing it and,
but I'm not,

910
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.450
I'm over here and this guy's mounted on me and he's been,

911
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.680
he's choking me and stuff like it's man,
it's,
I date it and then it makes it,

912
00:55:28.681 --> 00:55:31.500
I guess we could reverse this question.
Say like,
okay Jocko then when,
why,

913
00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:35.460
why aren't you in boxing and striking all the time.
For me that's a pretty,

914
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.780
it's actually not that hard of an answer.
I've done boxing and stroking.

915
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:44.820
And the thing that is different is inboxing and striking.

916
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:49.500
Even though you're talking about Mike Rowe wins most of the nights of training,

917
00:55:49.501 --> 00:55:52.440
boxing or kickboxing there,

918
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.820
the micro winds are against pads and a bag.
Right?

919
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.850
Cause you're not sparring every night.
And if you are sparring every night,

920
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.710
you're,
you're making a mistake and you're not even going as hard as in,

921
00:56:03.711 --> 00:56:06.720
you're not going comparatively.
I mean,
you can have fun.
And we,
we do that too.

922
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:09.780
Like we call it playing tag where you're like,
you're like touching the person.

923
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:14.250
You're,
you're,
it's almost like a slap fight,
you know?
But you can't do that ever.

924
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:16.830
You can't spar every night and you shouldn't spar every night.

925
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:20.490
And if you are a sparring every night,
you're wrong.
But you can roll every night.

926
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.700
You can get,
you can get full victories,
not micro victories,

927
00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:29.250
full submissions.
So yeah.
Uh,
yeah.

928
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.330
And I agree.
And I think that if you

929
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:36.220
did say it really depends on who you are,
but to me that was the,
the,

930
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:41.221
the big time appeal and still is the legitimate appeal of Jujitsu where,

931
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.430
you know,
how like people even now they'll be like,
hey,

932
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:48.010
but this martial arts is superior because this and that.

933
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:53.010
But really Jujitsu's kind of being tested the best because it's point against

934
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:59.410
an enemy,
quote unquote enemy who's trying to,
it's funny when people are like,

935
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.670
how would you ever get someone's arm there?
You know what I mean?
We were like,

936
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:06.460
Oh yeah,
you get the good,
eat that on lock.
Try that on me.
It's like,
oh,
okay,
cool.

937
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:09.100
Yeah.
I'm gonna say just reading about it didn't,
um,

938
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.620
Gordon Ryan just beat somebody he like called it.
Yeah.

939
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.560
He called it [inaudible] seven.
He was like,
I'm going to beat you with this.

940
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.340
And he did it within this amount of time.
Did it that slide away.
Yeah.

941
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.250
And that's how it is men.
And that's against a high level guy.

942
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:28.420
What Gordon Ryan's obviously one of the best guys right now.
Um,

943
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:32.450
but that,
that is kind of how would you do to is,
you know,
unless it's like some,

944
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:36.940
that's huge giant football player,
just spasming and writing away the whole time.

945
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.120
If you're in someone's engaging you,
that's kind of how it is.
Where you're like,

946
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:44.740
oh,
I can choke if they don't know.
Do you get to,
and you know it's like,
yeah,

947
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.090
oh yeah,
for sure.
They're like,
how are you going to get my arm there?

948
00:57:47.091 --> 00:57:49.380
And Ryan did not do that to someone that didn't know Jujitsu.

949
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.740
I know some funny cause that's those,
those,
the Hixson stories,
you know,

950
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:58.270
like Hixson would be like,
I'm going to every,
all of you 14 black belts,

951
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:01.840
I'm going to arm lock your left arm,
all of you.
And He'd do it.

952
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:07.270
All of them black belts.
Yeah.
Damn.
You heard those stories,
right?
Yeah,

953
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.940
I rolled with Hixon.
I've talked about that before.
Yeah.

954
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.360
Hixon is really good at Jujitsu.
Sure.
Yeah.

955
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:18.670
But yes,
but I don't know though.
So what do you do though?
Like what,
what's the,

956
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:22.000
what's the advice back to the,
my advice is say,
like I said,

957
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:27.001
that's why I think my new rule is train until you submit someone that is

958
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:32.071
legitimately comparable to you and then if you don't like it still then don't

959
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:35.200
train.
Like I,
there was one guy on social media that like kept coming back to me.

960
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:38.830
Like I know I hate Jujitsu.
I hate it,
I hate it.
And I was like,

961
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:42.370
after awhile I'm like,
okay,
can you defend yourself against,
you know,
I take down,

962
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:43.840
can you get up from the bottom?
Okay.

963
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.540
Didn't go find something else to do and quit complaining to me about it.

964
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.170
Like everyone is not meant for Jujitsu.
I get it.
It's fine.
Yeah.
I almost,

965
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.430
but it's still is beneficial though.
Feels like it is for,

966
00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.550
it's what it feels like.
That's what it feels like.
That's what I'm saying.

967
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:00.730
That's what it feels like to you and me and to the people that we hang out with.

968
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:04.000
And that's why when I was saying like some people don't like Jujitsu is really

969
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:07.750
weird for me to understand that I have a hard time with their perspective.

970
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:13.160
That's fully Mr. Mr Understand their perspective and you tell me like I don't

971
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:17.380
really liked your did so it's like a why?
Why would you not like it?
Straight up.

972
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.900
I'm glad you don't like it makes life easier for me.

973
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.750
One person I don't have to worry about being able to choke me for sure.

974
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:29.570
Okay.
I would say this,
try this.
If you're in this situation,

975
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.433
this is what I would do.

976
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:36.290
Try to forget about like when you're like,
okay,
I'm gonna go do Jujitsu tonight.

977
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.310
Forget about boxing as a concept.
Forget about kickbox,
forget about it.

978
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.810
Like don't,
don't think about that.

979
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:46.010
Do you like your whole thing right now is like is just Jujitsu and learn or

980
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:49.280
think of it as like just this complete learning experience of course,

981
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.690
but forget about the boxing because anytime like that's hot,

982
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.930
that's what's going to happen.

983
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.990
When you keep that boxing on your mind or the kickboxing on your mind,

984
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:59.150
you're like,
why am I doing this when I could be doing boxing,

985
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:03.770
which was like bad ass anyway.
You know,
kind of thing,
but just forget about it.

986
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:09.140
Yeah.
I think that's the thing.
You know how like guys in the UFC that'll,

987
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.250
that'll happen sometimes where they're super good at Jujitsu and then they'll

988
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.970
train boxing aids and it's vice versa too.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

989
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.860
Like I was just saying like some people,

990
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:23.030
and this is true with fighters to some fighters don't like striking.

991
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.120
They don't like to get hit specifically.
No one minds punching people.

992
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.970
Some people like it,
some people like they,

993
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.570
they truly liked to punch someone else in the head.
Some people are good with it.

994
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:34.190
Most people are good with it cause it feels good.

995
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.910
Some people don't like to get hit.
They really don't like that.

996
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.870
Some people don't like to get smashed on the ground.

997
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.780
They get claustrophobic,
right?
They don't like that.

998
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.450
And so different people have little different,

999
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.030
I don't know if calm weaknesses but preferences.

1000
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.370
And you can see that very clearly,

1001
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.880
especially in the earlier you fcs nowadays you're not getting the UFC if you're

1002
01:00:55.881 --> 01:01:00.800
super uncomfortable in,
in any arena of martial arts,
if you're just,

1003
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:04.450
if you're just super uncomfortable,
stand up.
You,
you,
you know,

1004
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.000
maybe you might make an undercard barely,
but you don't see that on TV.

1005
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:12.890
You don't go as far for sure.
There you go.
I like that rule.

1006
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:18.030
Do it until you tap someone else who's like,
I'm legit comparable to you.
Cause,

1007
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.330
cause what I think happens once you do that and you're like,

1008
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:24.320
oh I want to do badly.
Yeah.
And you got the benefit of getting tapped out,

1009
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:27.110
which is a bet,
which to me motivates me more than just happened.
Someone out.

1010
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:28.910
Yeah.
Like how did someone control me?

1011
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.420
Think about that in another human being can control me completely.

1012
01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.930
Dean those that to me sometimes,
and I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

1013
01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:36.501
I'm like,
man,

1014
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:41.501
I've been training for a really long time and I'm a grown man in good physical

1015
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:44.870
condition,
relatively strong.

1016
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.360
And he can cold me in a position where I cannot do anything and I can actually

1017
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:53.180
do that to him too.
Not as clearly,
not as often,

1018
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.500
but he's got,
he's got three physicians,

1019
01:01:57.501 --> 01:02:00.110
he can do it to me and I think he can cross side mount

1020
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.400
and on all force.
Right.

1021
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.210
If I'm in one of those positions or he's one of those positions on me,

1022
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.090
the I'm doomed.
I deal for me,
it's only,
I don't have a mount on him,

1023
01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:15.890
but his mountain scape is awesome and my mounts not really good,
so he's,

1024
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.540
he can get out of that.
So it's no big deal,

1025
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.010
but cross eyed or when he's on all fours,

1026
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.640
<v 2>I'm going to torture him and we both know we're going to get tortured in those</v>

1027
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:26.160
positions for him.
It's too busy for him.
He,

1028
01:02:26.161 --> 01:02:27.630
there's two positions he's going to get tortured him for me,

1029
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.080
there's three positions I'm gonna get tortured,
tortured,
tortured.
Yes,
sir.

1030
01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:34.650
I would agree.
You've seen it.
It's torture.
Yeah.
You felt it too.

1031
01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.390
Both the examples,
all exam.
I can escape,

1032
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:45.270
escape,
escape,
but yeah.
No,
that's bad.
I dig it.

1033
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.460
That isn't that weird though.
You have,
you know,
25 over 25 years experience,

1034
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.390
train very strong and big by the way,
like compared to like a normal Jujitsu guy.

1035
01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.790
Like you're a big Europe thing.

1036
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.860
That huge play Jujitsu player,
big strong experience.
Know what to do,

1037
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.580
know what not to do all that doesn't mean anything guest for that moment doesn't

1038
01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:09.330
mean nothing yet.
Holy Cow.
That's a scary thing.
Yeah.

1039
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:12.030
Next question.
Good evening.

1040
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:17.550
I'm a firefighter paramedic and I'm still the rookie yet my station,

1041
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.350
the fire service is notorious for politics within the ranks and rookies often

1042
01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:24.240
get the worst of it.
My question is,

1043
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:28.560
how can I implement extreme ownership in a situation where the blame falls to me

1044
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.453
anyway,

1045
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:34.410
how can I have my superiors view this as a positive trait when every Ruki gets

1046
01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:38.490
the short end of the stick and when none of my superiors are willing to engage

1047
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:41.250
in extreme ownership,
I'm taking ownership.
However,

1048
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:45.180
the typical response along is along the lines of,
that's correct.

1049
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.740
It is your fault to hey,
yeah.

1050
01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.830
<v 1>You know what?
That's correct.
It is your fault.</v>

1051
01:03:55.970 --> 01:04:00.740
That's what extreme ownership is.
That's what it is.
That's what it is.

1052
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:02.980
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1053
01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.040
<v 1>That's what it is.
That's what extreme ownership it is.</v>

1054
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:09.010
You're saying it's your fault.
You're not just saying it so they leave you alone.

1055
01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:11.290
You're saying it because you're taking ownership of it.

1056
01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:15.340
Then you can fix what is wrong.
That's what it is.

1057
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.240
So I will tell you,
the boss will notice.

1058
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.310
He will,
he'll notice,

1059
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.680
and the people above you in the chain of command will notice.

1060
01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:25.480
They will notice that you are taking ownership.

1061
01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:26.860
Now notice that you're solving problems.

1062
01:04:26.861 --> 01:04:31.540
I notice that that will then give you a good reputation,

1063
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.320
but taking extreme ownership does not absolve you of the blame.

1064
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:39.940
That's the opposite of that.

1065
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:42.720
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1066
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.350
<v 1>you are at fault.
That's the whole point.
That's the whole point.</v>

1067
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.000
And this is one of those classic questions I get asked all the time.

1068
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.990
It's like,
what if they say the,
if they see right,
it is your fault.

1069
01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:56.700
That's what you're saying.
Yeah.

1070
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.700
So it doesn't matter.
It's true in business,
it's,

1071
01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.450
and it's true in life too.

1072
01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:06.330
If you're blaming other people for things that are going wrong,

1073
01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:07.164
you're not going to fix them.

1074
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:10.540
<v 2>You can't fix them because in your mind you don't control them.</v>

1075
01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:11.231
They're not your fault.

1076
01:05:11.231 --> 01:05:16.231
So if you want to take extreme ownership at work and in business and in stop

1077
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v 1>blaming other people and blame yourself and realize that it actually is your</v>

1078
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:28.190
fault at that,
correct.
Own it and do something about it.
But

1079
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.660
do you think that sometimes I'm like this,

1080
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.560
<v 2>you know how some people will at like at the muster,</v>

1081
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:40.480
some people say that ask you this and they'll say,

1082
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:42.820
it'll be similar to this where there'll be like,

1083
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.400
like I'm trying to take extreme ownership,
but you know,

1084
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:48.730
something like this happens and then you say,
well,
yeah,

1085
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.050
like you take extreme ownership,

1086
01:05:50.051 --> 01:05:53.740
you actually take the blame and then you talk about how you're going to fix the

1087
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:57.040
problem,
right?
Like that's how you know you don't just take,
do you don't say,
yes,

1088
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:00.220
my fault and then boom,
we're good,
we're done my bus kind of thing.

1089
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.900
<v 1>That's ego.
It's funny because your ego is like,</v>

1090
01:06:05.901 --> 01:06:10.880
if I say like echo,
this went wrong and it's my fault and then you go,
yeah,

1091
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.710
yeah,
you should have done a better job.
I get that.
That's my defense.
I'm like,
oh,

1092
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.630
what are you talking about?
Well,
you know,
I,
you know,

1093
01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.600
I would have been able to do it better if you have done blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1094
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:22.040
blah.
So even though I'm saying I'm taking ownership,

1095
01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:25.900
I'm not actually taking ownership.
So that was actually going to be my question.

1096
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.740
Uses people.
So it's almost like maybe it all the time,

1097
01:06:30.741 --> 01:06:32.420
but it's almost like,

1098
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.220
<v 2>like let's say I did something and I messed up,</v>

1099
01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:38.410
I caught my own mistake right in the middle of the day and I was like,
man,

1100
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.080
I'm so dumb.
And it was a domestic with,
oh,
I'm so dumb.
And you said,
yeah,

1101
01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.450
you are a dumpmen and be like,
wait,
don't call me dumb.
Right.

1102
01:06:43.451 --> 01:06:46.780
It's kind of like that,
right?
It's like,
man,
you just said you're dumb.

1103
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.960
<v 1>I think,
you know what else is funny is to,
as you hear people make excuses,</v>

1104
01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.910
like,
uh,
but instead of taking the blame,

1105
01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.380
instead of taking,
owning the excuse that they,
so like let's say,

1106
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:05.490
uh,
I wasn't prepared for a podcast or let's say no,
I said,
hey,
we're going to,

1107
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:07.340
we can try and record on Wednesday,

1108
01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:10.940
but I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it because I have this going on in my

1109
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:14.610
dog did this and my kid did that and I'm,

1110
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:18.680
I'm making excuses.
Instead of saying like,
Hey,

1111
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:23.270
I didn't plan well enough and I didn't anticipate some things that I should have

1112
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:28.040
anticipated and now I'm not going to be ready.
Right?
Yeah.
It's my fault.
Now,

1113
01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:31.160
if you get what this is,
what happens,
and this is the difference,
man,

1114
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.480
if you have the habit of actually saying like,
Hey,

1115
01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:40.220
I didn't anticipate this and it's actually my fault,
then you know what you do,

1116
01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:45.020
you plan better.
Yeah.
How many times have I called you up and said,
hey,
echo,

1117
01:07:45.021 --> 01:07:49.100
I'm not ready to record the podcast a few times.
No,

1118
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.190
actually no.
You said,
I might not be ready,

1119
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:56.100
and then he got mad at yourself.
Yeah,
got mad,

1120
01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.410
but I was actually giving you a warning of like,
Hey,
I'm going to be,

1121
01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:01.244
it's going to be tight,

1122
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:04.880
but I knew I was going to have to work to try and get it done.

1123
01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.120
What I'm saying is when you truly say like everything that's happening in my

1124
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:14.450
world is my fault,
you don't make excuses anymore upfront.
You,
you,

1125
01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:15.920
any ring a you do.
You say like,
Hey,

1126
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:18.320
here's what's going on and this is what I'm going to do to get over to them.

1127
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.180
Yeah.
It's a big difference,
man.

1128
01:08:20.181 --> 01:08:24.400
It has a huge impact when you're saying here's a good one.
I like,

1129
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.420
this is one of them.
Probably the most common thing of anything,

1130
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.690
any excuse is I don't have time.
That's the most.

1131
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:33.050
Is there any more common excuse that I don't have time besides the dog ate my

1132
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:36.170
homework,
right.
I don't.
Not that I know of.
No.
By the way,

1133
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:40.920
one time the dog literally ate my kid's homework.
It was all chewed up like,

1134
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.970
well I'll get your homework,
keep your,

1135
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.650
keep your ena dog secure area.
So there's no ego,

1136
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.860
there's no bigger excuse that gets used more common at least for like a long

1137
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:55.250
term goal.
Like,
Hey,
I want to do you name it,

1138
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.930
I want to go on to play piano and I play guitar,
I want to write a book,

1139
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:03.980
I want to just study,
I want to get my degree,
all this stuff.
Right.

1140
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.380
Anything is just,
I don't have to,
I want to get in shape.
Right.

1141
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.750
I want to run everyday.
It's all,
hey,

1142
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:11.550
even even I want to spend more time with my kids,
but I have time.
Yeah.

1143
01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.150
So that's the,
that's the pre given excuse.

1144
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:19.130
But when you blame all these other things,
the time,

1145
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.040
it's not your fault that you don't have time.

1146
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:26.510
It's the fault of the schedule.
It's the fault of the,

1147
01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.970
whether it's the fault of,
it's the lack of time.

1148
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:32.600
The fact of the matter is if you take ownership of that,

1149
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:38.060
if you take ownership of the time,
you will have time.

1150
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:41.270
Cause you'll make time.
Yeah.
And when I call you up and say,
Hey,

1151
01:09:41.271 --> 01:09:44.690
I might not be able to get ready what I'm doing.
It's like saying,
okay,

1152
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.390
I'm giving him a warning and then I'm looking at my schedule going,

1153
01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:50.600
where can I finish prep?
Or where can I prepare for this?
Yeah.

1154
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.000
When can I get this done?

1155
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.890
That's the ultimate excuse for so many people.
I don't have time.

1156
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:02.180
And the minute you say that you don't have control over the time you do have

1157
01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:04.850
control over the time,
guess what?
Hey,

1158
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.450
are there people that are working three jobs?
Yes,
there are.
And might they have,

1159
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.820
are there things that are going to have to edit out of their schedule?
Yes.

1160
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:14.150
There are one of the first things you should edit out of your schedule.
Youtube,

1161
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.180
Social Media,
Surfing,
Internet surfing,
right.
Uh,

1162
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.350
what else did we do to waste time?
You know what I mean?

1163
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.840
Like we wasted time doing things TV,

1164
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.040
so that way if you,
if you haven't,

1165
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:32.600
excuse s turn it back on yourself and take control of it.

1166
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.520
That's all I'm saying.
We got you.
Make the time.
Make the time.

1167
01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:43.160
Yeah.
Little set time saving element.
I don't even know if it's a tip.

1168
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.390
It's just a little thing to consider when you cruise cruise extra hard so you

1169
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:51.470
can get it done in half the time.
I'm disciplined with my time.

1170
01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:56.450
So like Ken crew sometimes discipline equals cruising.

1171
01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.380
Yes.
That's the freedom part of increasing the time is like a,

1172
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.200
it can be kind of like a balloon with like little leaks in it where you know you

1173
01:11:06.201 --> 01:11:10.400
want to like time we'll just kind of leak away.
Right?
So if you're not,

1174
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:13.530
you know how like I think you were the one who kind of told me where he's like

1175
01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:14.100
you should eat,

1176
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.380
<v 2>shouldn't like plan kind of everything.
You got to go,</v>

1177
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:17.970
just plan it all and get it done.

1178
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.790
And then the rest of that time is all is you're typing free.
Yeah.

1179
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.430
So if you're like,
okay,

1180
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:26.160
I have some stuff to do today but I'm not going to plan it necessarily.

1181
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:28.020
I'm just going to sort of get it done tomorrow.

1182
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:32.170
At some point you could get one thing done,
you could just be,
you know,

1183
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.340
messing around and whatever and then you get another thing done and you kind of

1184
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:37.450
like,
Dang,
that took me kind of all day.
A lot of times when,
you know,

1185
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:38.940
especially if you have like three or four things,

1186
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:43.410
but all those like little in between times if you can add them all up.
But sure.

1187
01:11:43.411 --> 01:11:46.110
Okay.
Workout takes,
let's say you really want to go hard and say,

1188
01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:47.690
I want to work off for an hour and a half every day,

1189
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.490
but I don't really have a free hour and a half in a row.
Right?

1190
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.430
Because I've got to go pick up my kids and I've got to go do this.

1191
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:57.720
I got to drop them off.
I had to do all this stuff.
But if most of the time,

1192
01:11:57.721 --> 01:11:58.351
if you're like,
okay,

1193
01:11:58.351 --> 01:12:01.020
I'm going to schedule all these things and I'm gonna pump them and get them all

1194
01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:02.610
done,
then it's almost like you're,

1195
01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:06.090
you're shifting your time so it doesn't just leak through the,

1196
01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:08.550
the little things that you have to do when you allow it to.

1197
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.850
I think it was you that originally talked about this.

1198
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.700
How much work do people get done before like vacation?

1199
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:20.130
Like they know where they're going on vacation.
Same Way I
do that every day.
Yes.

1200
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.670
More free time.
Yeah.
Just even like when you're leaving,

1201
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:27.360
had this sort of found myself,
I did this the other day.
I went,

1202
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.270
I actually went to 24 hour fitness,
got a good word compiler.

1203
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:35.160
So I went to,
Jennifer was got my workout or whatever,

1204
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:39.000
came out and came in my truck.
I was checking,
checking the crypto stuff,

1205
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:42.510
but so I got my truck checked it and I was checking it in,

1206
01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:47.210
in like check some other alerts,
you know,
check in and boom,
boom.
And then I,

1207
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:48.390
and then I left.

1208
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:51.660
So I remember when I put my phone down and I started it up and I left.

1209
01:12:51.661 --> 01:12:54.540
I kind of looked over it and you could see the window of 24 hour fitness and you

1210
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:58.200
know,
the people that work at the front desk are there.
So I,
for whatever reason,

1211
01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:00.780
I'm thinking to myself,
I wonder if they were watching me like,
oh,

1212
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:04.020
another person addicted to his phone in there.
Kind of just had that thought.

1213
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.050
You know,
I thought about,
I was like,
wait there.

1214
01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:12.051
That was like a good maybe 10 minutes that I just like let leak away right

1215
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:14.250
there.
Hey,
if,
if that was part of my schedule,

1216
01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:16.140
if I needed to check these things for sure.

1217
01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:19.920
I couldn't like if that was on some sort of a schedule or if I choose,

1218
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.410
if I chose to do that at a specific time,

1219
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:24.630
I would've got that 10 minutes back somehow.

1220
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.350
Like that 10 minutes when the leak to it.
No,
I actually,

1221
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.940
by the time he's left the gym at that particular time,

1222
01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.110
if I didn't let that 10 minutes,

1223
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.380
I would've been home already doing other stuff that I should have.
Schedules.

1224
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.270
Yeah,
work doing it.
Yeah,
exactly right and we do that all day.
That kind of stuff.

1225
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.910
Don't let your time,
but another thing,

1226
01:13:44.911 --> 01:13:48.120
we're another time more or another situation where this works.

1227
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:51.390
What you were saying about this,
I'm taking ownership in for real take ownership.

1228
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.200
Don't be like,
Hey,
you know,
you know,
oh it's my fault.

1229
01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:56.460
And then they said it's your fault and be like,
Ooh,

1230
01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:59.160
what are the ones who was white ball kind of thing.
I'm not saying he said that,

1231
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:03.270
but I'm saying that is apologizing when you apologize to someone you don't like.

1232
01:14:03.271 --> 01:14:07.950
Someone's like,
Hey,
hey,
look,
look mean you had a disagreement,
escalated,
whatever.

1233
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:12.190
Then the next day I'm like,
Hey man,
I'm sorry you but,
but you did kind

1234
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:15.580
<v 3>of say something,
you know,
but I,
but I am sorry.
You know kind of thing.
Yeah.</v>

1235
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:18.640
Right.
So you're putting a ball in there and you're like,
it's not real.

1236
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:21.650
It's not a true apology.
It's not affective at all like you.

1237
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:26.470
Or if you explain like,
but I was just feeling this or you know,
it's just,

1238
01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:26.770
you know,

1239
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:31.390
anytime there's not a like a full on 100% full speed apology towards someone.

1240
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.480
Like don't mention the reasons why you felt that way.

1241
01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:38.440
Don't mention any kind of justification on why you went there with your mind,

1242
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:39.880
who,
whatever.
It's all just like,

1243
01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:43.510
this is what it did is all like terrible and whatever.
And I'm straight up.
Sorry.

1244
01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:48.070
Yeah.
Speaking of apologies,
next question.

1245
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:52.180
I'm sorry for taking so long with that and you know,

1246
01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:55.720
but you were really egging me on.
I'm just saying.
Next question Jocko.

1247
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.360
The military taught me to never apologize.

1248
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.660
Speaking to which because it's a sign of weakness,

1249
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:06.100
had a conversation with a coworker who says that extreme ownership is the same

1250
01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:10.000
as apologizing.
So,
uh,
first of all,

1251
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:15.001
no apologizing is actually not a sign of weakness.

1252
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.920
And whoever was putting that out,

1253
01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:22.921
whoever taught that was actually too insecure about themselves and their

1254
01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:28.050
leadership capability to admit when they were wrong or made a mistake and,

1255
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.010
and really insecure about a lot of other things,
most likely people,

1256
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.970
it's actually the opposite.
People that can't admit their mistakes are weak.

1257
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.450
And people that can't apologize when they screw up our week,

1258
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.493
they're scared.

1259
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.260
They're scared to take ownership and they're protective of their ego.
Now,

1260
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:55.150
that being said,
extreme ownership is not the same as apologizing,

1261
01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.970
but they're definitely similar.
You know,

1262
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.130
extreme ownership means you're admitting that there's some kind of a problem and

1263
01:16:00.131 --> 01:16:03.610
you're taking ownership of that problem.
If it's something that you did wrong,

1264
01:16:03.611 --> 01:16:07.180
then you're,
you're taking ownership of that mistake.
The key part,

1265
01:16:07.181 --> 01:16:10.360
as you already said,
is not that you're just owning the problem.

1266
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.430
You're actually solving the problem.

1267
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.900
And Yeah,
if you screw something up or you make a mistake,

1268
01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:22.690
then apologize for it,
apologize for your shortfalls,

1269
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.620
and then you can move forward.
Uh,
Sarah Armstrong,

1270
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:30.010
she's set a couple times on Twitter when I'm said like,
yeah,
say you're sorry.

1271
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.350
She said ask for forgiveness too.
I haven't,
I haven't tried that one out,

1272
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:38.320
but she seems to see,
seems to think that that is another,

1273
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:42.280
and when she says things,
I listened to her.
She's smart.
I won't look,

1274
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:45.430
we talked about that.
I think it might've been Sarah Armstrong.
Oh wait,

1275
01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:47.860
she said that a long time ago.
Long.
Long.
Okay.
Yeah.
You see,

1276
01:16:47.861 --> 01:16:51.520
we've talked about this before.
And here's my take on that one.
Say it again.

1277
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:56.410
I'm not 100% on that one.
Well,
you asked for forgiveness.
This is why,

1278
01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:01.300
because it's this.
If someone,
I dig it as far as like doing it,

1279
01:17:01.301 --> 01:17:04.120
it feels like it does feel like a,
like a humble kind of approach,

1280
01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.860
but it can be taken like this.

1281
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:09.950
So I would take it and I don't think I'd be most of the time

1282
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.660
<v 2>where when it's like,
okay,
I'm,
I'm sorry,
you know,
I'm,</v>

1283
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:19.140
I'm,
I messed up.
It's all me or whatever.
Right?
So it's almost like he,

1284
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:23.060
you throw the ball in their court to be the bad guy.

1285
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.990
It's kind of like,
so it's a,
it's almost like a guaranteed way to get forgiven.

1286
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.230
That's what it is.
And it's kind of like,
I know that.
So it was like,

1287
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.720
this is me strong arming forgiveness from you.

1288
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.590
It's like shaming you into forgiveness.
So you're saying if you're like,
if I say,

1289
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:41.540
Hey Echo,
I'm really sorry about this.
Do you forgive me?
Yeah.
Oh,

1290
01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:45.160
I got to say yes.
No I'm not.
I'm posing,

1291
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:49.010
posing strong arming them.
It's interesting to get some feed bumps.
Sure.

1292
01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:51.880
Sarah will give you some feedback on yeah,
it's subtle,
but it,

1293
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.200
and I'm saying really the,
it's more prevalent,

1294
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.580
I don't think have ever asked for a person's forgiveness.
I've said that.

1295
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.850
I've said,
you know,

1296
01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:01.370
sorry and apologize for all kinds of stupid things that I've done,

1297
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:04.040
but I don't think I've ever asked for forgiveness.

1298
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:09.080
Maybe if this was something really big.
Yeah.
But even then,
man,

1299
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:12.500
yeah,
that's a tough one.
I am sure she has a little great reason behind it.

1300
01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:15.800
We'll have to give further explanations.
Yeah,

1301
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:21.140
I thought of that because I considered like saying that in some minor situation

1302
01:18:21.471 --> 01:18:24.990
whenever and then I'm like,
wait.
In minor situations it's too much.
Yeah.

1303
01:18:24.991 --> 01:18:29.560
Like you know,
a show to play,
man.
I'm sorry,
will you forgive me?
Like,
no,

1304
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:34.270
this is a little too much.
It's like saying,
Hey,
I know I,
you know,

1305
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.960
I know I made you bad,
or something like that.

1306
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:39.350
I know I made you mad and I'm sorry.
You know,
whatever.
Are you still mad?

1307
01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.830
It's kind of like that because if you say,
yeah,
I'm still mad.

1308
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.410
It's kind of like flight.
Hey,
I said my piece,

1309
01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:48.830
you chose not to be met or you chose to continue to be mad.

1310
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:53.840
That's your problem kind of thing.
It's like,
do you please forgive me?

1311
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:58.340
Please forgive me.
Like what kind of a Dick doesn't forgive someone?
You know?

1312
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:02.160
It's kind of like that and they're bringing that so it's like a little strong.

1313
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.220
I said,
we'll get feedback where it's,
it's an interesting,

1314
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.360
we'll get feedback from Sara.
I'm sure.

1315
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:09.620
It's interesting to think that there's people out there and you know,

1316
01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:12.350
they're out there that,
hey,
don't apologize.
It's a sign of weakness.

1317
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.120
It's just being dumb.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's,

1318
01:19:17.121 --> 01:19:21.060
here's the advice for today.
Don't be dumb.
Yeah.
It kind of goes the,

1319
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.950
the apologizing and taking extreme ownership.
I say nuts.
Similar.

1320
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:27.320
I think there's a big overlap there.
Oh,
there's huge it.

1321
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:30.770
I didn't say there were not similar.
Oh,
no,
no.
Not that.
Not the same thing.
Sorry.

1322
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:35.150
Yeah,
they're not,
they're not the same thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's like,
um,

1323
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.330
well back to the thing when you were like,
Yo,
if you don't apologize,

1324
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:41.870
that's weak or whatever.
That's kind of like the guy who says like,
Hey,

1325
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.430
this is how I am.
Take it or leave it kind of thing.
Yeah.
I mean,

1326
01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:48.110
if they're a dick,
you know,
or something like that and they're like,

1327
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:50.600
take it or leave it.
Some people love me,
some people hate me.
It's kind of thing.

1328
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:53.570
And by that doesn't bother you that people hate you because of how you are,

1329
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.090
you know,
kind of thing.
It's going to be gator.
Yeah.
You know,

1330
01:19:56.690 --> 01:20:00.260
so it's kind of weird.
I mean,
yeah,
I'd take it,
you know,
be you for sure.
But,
um,

1331
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:03.350
I think that's something,
it's not nothing if people hate you.

1332
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:07.980
Let's do one more question.
As person in a

1333
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.210
<v 1>leadership position,</v>

1334
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:14.730
what should I do if I consistently noticed one of my guys motivating the team

1335
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:18.870
and leading them successfully during projects emissions better than I can,

1336
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.990
the completion of the mission being the top priority,

1337
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.980
would it be better for me to back down and let my counterpart lead,

1338
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.770
which will benefit the company and its employees?

1339
01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:32.580
And how will I regain my status among them?

1340
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.700
I think this one's actually pretty straightforward.

1341
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:41.160
If you've got someone that's doing a better job leading,
then let him lead.

1342
01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:45.630
Let him lead.
Give him some room.
Learn from them,
support them the best you can.

1343
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.020
And the best way you can most likely support them is by getting out of the way

1344
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:53.580
and letting them do what they're doing and then get them the support that they

1345
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:54.001
need.

1346
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:58.710
And what this is going to give you the benefit of is now you can,

1347
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:03.150
instead of looking down and in and managing your team,

1348
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:07.860
you can look up and out and forward and see what is going on in the future and

1349
01:21:07.861 --> 01:21:12.861
prep the battlefield and in the future or prep the next market area or look for

1350
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:15.960
recruiting.
You know,
you can move,
you can lead,
you can actually lead

1351
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:21.750
and let that,
you know,
young buck,
handball,

1352
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:24.660
the things that are going on tax free on the battlefield right now.

1353
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:27.750
I used to say this to the,
to the see leadership.
I used to say,
Hey,

1354
01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:32.640
the enlisted seal leaders handle the problem that is in their face right now.

1355
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:34.170
The tackle promise interface right now,

1356
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.050
the officer should be looking at what we're going to do next.

1357
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:40.560
That's kind of a really simple,
it's not always like that,

1358
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:45.330
but that's a real good starting point,
and so in this position I'd be like,
oh,

1359
01:21:45.331 --> 01:21:47.700
I got a young buck that's coming up and leading.
Well,
cool.

1360
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:49.080
That's going to allow me,

1361
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.140
allow me to look up and out and be ready to move forward and plan the next move.

1362
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:58.260
Now,
as far as regaining your status as a leader,

1363
01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:03.261
you won't really need to because if you do this properly,

1364
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:09.080
you'll be seen as a leader who is confident enough to let a subordinate leaders

1365
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:11.310
step up and lead while I go and move forward.

1366
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:17.370
The w w you'd have to regain if you were there shutting this person down and

1367
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:20.730
trying to micromanage and doing a worse job than everyone on the team knows that

1368
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:25.320
that guy could do a good job,
let them do it.
Yeah,
that's true.

1369
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:30.690
That's about confidence really.
It's about like,
do you have,

1370
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:36.240
are you confident and are you secure in your leadership?
Oh yeah.
To step aside,

1371
01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.060
step aside that it's,
yes,
no problem.
We love it.
Hey,
you're,

1372
01:22:40.061 --> 01:22:41.910
you're really good at that school.
You,
you step in there and do it.

1373
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.090
I don't have a problem with that.
Will you get the occasional person that's like,

1374
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:46.651
Oh look,

1375
01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:49.080
Jack was jack was let that guy do it cause he doesn't know what he's doing

1376
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.230
occasionally.
Yeah.
One out of 20 people will be that big,
Mr. Negative.

1377
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.380
That's fine.
You know,
then,
then what's cool is when you're on the outside,

1378
01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:00.150
guess what you are,
when you're,
when you let someone else run the team,

1379
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:04.620
guess what you have.
Guess what you have detached.
Yes.
Oh,
Echo Charles.

1380
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:06.490
You have detachment.

1381
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.340
<v 3>And so now you're going to be able to see things that even that bleeder that's</v>

1382
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:11.650
better than you can't see.
And then when you come in,

1383
01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:14.170
you're gonna look like the tactical genius because you point something out.

1384
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:17.410
But they didn't notice cause they were in the firefight.
Tactical genius.

1385
01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:22.660
The way it works,
things get,
yeah.
That's hard to do that man.

1386
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:26.620
When someone's doing better than you,
you don't.
Oh Man.
Yeah,
that's right.

1387
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:29.140
I mean the OIC at kw takes confidence as what you say.

1388
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:33.700
This is such a good example of keeping your ego in check because what you just

1389
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:36.400
said,
everyone feels that and when you feel that,
that's when you go,
oh cool,

1390
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.080
my ego's getting out of control.
It's fine.

1391
01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.560
Just put it in check and let this person to lead and I'll move,
you know,

1392
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.230
check out what we're going to do next.
I'll look ahead on the battlefield.

1393
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:47.810
She don't want,
I'm trying to think like how you said there.

1394
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.930
Occasionally there'll be a guy,
it would be like,
oh,

1395
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:51.870
he doesn't know what he's doing.
So he's letting I,

1396
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.530
I've been in that situation where my boss actually,
I've been the guy who,

1397
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:02.110
my supervisor like said,
Oh yeah,
you like you to handle,
you take this,

1398
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:04.060
you know you got this one kind of thing.
And I'm like,
yeah,

1399
01:24:04.061 --> 01:24:05.680
you're doing it because you don't know what you're doing kind of thing.

1400
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:06.550
And everyone knew that.

1401
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:09.760
And so I've been in that situation where I'm looking at them,

1402
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:13.630
but now think about this,
think about if instead of him just saying,
Hey,

1403
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:16.240
you go on and run the same thing.
If he would've said,
hey,
echo,

1404
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.740
you're really good at this,
you're better than I am.
You step up,
run this.

1405
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.270
I'm going to be over here looking at where we're going next.

1406
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.510
What would you think then?
Yeah,

1407
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:27.190
so he's actually said that before like a couple times and it every single time

1408
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:31.060
it made me feel way better.
Like buddle um,
even the,
I mean,

1409
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:33.730
of course the truth will set you free.
Yeah.

1410
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:37.660
So I feel like if I was one of the only,
you know,

1411
01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:39.790
one of the top guys on the team's thinking that,

1412
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.890
I think I wouldn't think that if,
yeah,

1413
01:24:41.891 --> 01:24:46.030
if he did that kind of stuff now Turriff or if as long as he didn't act like

1414
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:54.910
counterintuitive,
you think that if you hide it,
it's better.

1415
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:58.090
And the better thing to do is be like,
hey,
echo is really good at this.

1416
01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:01.180
He's better than I am and he's going to step up and run this thing and people

1417
01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:03.250
are like,
oh wow.
Jack was super confident as leadership.
They don't,

1418
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.650
they don't verbalize in their head that,
right.
That's just the feeling,

1419
01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:11.390
the feeling that no Tacos,
Taco doesn't care who's running this thing.
He's just,

1420
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:16.420
yeah,
we're good.
It's good,
man.
Yeah.
So watch out for that Gatorade member though.

1421
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.260
Just keep your ego in check.
Yes,
sir.
At all times.
All right,

1422
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:25.030
let's have a podcast that's less than 19 hours long.

1423
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:27.363
So

1424
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.560
how can you maybe give us a hand with helping be prepared and getting better in

1425
01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:40.870
our lives?
Chapo,
Charles,
go be happy to do.
No problem.
Okay,
so we're working out.

1426
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:45.660
We're all working out.
Yes,
100% right every day.
Are we working on every day?

1427
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.150
So you don't have to,
not necessarily half do,
but a lot will say we recommend it.

1428
01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:53.260
Yeah.
We're not working out and then cruising for month.
So we're all working out.

1429
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:57.310
Look,
we're going to supplement our stuff.
Jocko does how supplements now,

1430
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:01.840
that was kind of the plan the plan has come to fruition.

1431
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:08.090
That's a word right?
Fruition.
So we used it correctly.
Yeah.
See.

1432
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:12.470
All right,
there you go.
So krill oil,
right?
That's the main one for our joints.

1433
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:15.020
Actually.
It's good for your eyes and brain too,
by the way.

1434
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.480
So worry.

1435
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:20.120
I'm not saying don't worry about your eyesight anymore after you take this.

1436
01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:24.470
I'm saying you can worry less to tell you that.
That's good.

1437
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:28.310
So yeah,
Jocko supercrew is what it's called and joint warfare.

1438
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:30.470
That one's obviously for the joint specifically,

1439
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.060
but I'm sure there's all kinds of other benefits.

1440
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.410
I've noticed my Ivan injured arm.
Sure.

1441
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:38.860
It's healing up quickly by no,

1442
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:43.100
like noticeably each day.
And I have to attribute,

1443
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:46.510
cause I've had this similar injuries before.
Right.
It's an unlock.
Right.

1444
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.830
And as bad as this one was little noises.

1445
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:57.920
It is noticeably,
I'm attributing that to joint warfare.
Yeah.

1446
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:01.550
And Dean told him the other day I,
Dean told me exactly like,

1447
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:05.180
like his version of what happened.
And I know that,

1448
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:08.660
I know that move that he shows even when he shows it on me,

1449
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:12.230
deans one on these guys were,
I think sometimes he doesn't know his own style.

1450
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:16.790
And what he's doing is super effective.
By the way.
It's like it's a Kimora.

1451
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:19.390
That's what he's doing.
It's like the,
the,

1452
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:24.080
what he did to me was I straight arm lock.
So that's what it ends up being.

1453
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.840
Just so everyone knows,
I'll just make this real clear.
This was,
uh,

1454
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:31.700
this was an accident.
Dean was actually showing a move.

1455
01:27:31.701 --> 01:27:34.340
He wasn't even,
we weren't rolling,
it wasn't live.

1456
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:39.341
Q was showing a move and he's shown 10,000 moves with me as the dummy.

1457
01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:44.030
And I'm shown many,
many moves on Dean with Dina's,
the dummy.

1458
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.990
And he got this position.
I had just arrived.

1459
01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.960
And I don't know if that makes it worse or not,

1460
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:52.670
but I was definitely what's called,
you know,

1461
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:57.110
so I was cold and no warm up and he was showing a moose.
So he's just highly,

1462
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.250
I want to show this thing.
I think it was like you jock,

1463
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:02.240
who's got a good defense here,
so you've gotta be ready if the guy does this.

1464
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.000
And then he's like,
as you were saying that,

1465
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.870
I think he thought I was going to attempt this movement and I didn't.

1466
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:12.080
And he just,
he just,
he meet in the arm.

1467
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:16.930
So is that pretty much how he debriefed it to you?
Yeah,
but the thing,

1468
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:19.520
the reason I understood it,
because more is that be this guy,
you know,

1469
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:23.920
he feels about it and then,
you know,
I mean,
it's a bummer.
Yeah.
This is not like,

1470
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:28.910
I know,
I know for a fact he didn't mean to do it.
Whatever.
Yeah.
It's one of the,

1471
01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:32.180
it's basically how he explained it and he's done this move.
Like I said,

1472
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:36.710
as me as the dummy,
and it hurts by the way.
You know what's funny?
He goes,

1473
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:41.090
he goes,
I didn't realize you weren't that flexible.
I go,
Bro,
it's my elbow.

1474
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:45.890
There's no flexibility in an elbow.
Well,
it must have been a miscommunication.

1475
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:48.260
Just like I said,
because this is what it was.
It's like,
Eh,
okay.

1476
01:28:48.261 --> 01:28:50.710
When you go in for the Kimora from across site,
these are,

1477
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.750
you want to get his arm behind his back,
bend his arm basically,

1478
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:55.020
and behind his back.
That's what he said.

1479
01:28:55.021 --> 01:28:57.860
And that's a move he's had showed it to me before it and it's one of his things,

1480
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:01.510
his tricks and he,
he said that like when he,
it

1481
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:06.180
just like a miss community,
you know,
like if you,
and if you do it,

1482
01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:07.170
it's kind of like you're just,

1483
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.400
it's just leverage to bend your arm behind your back.
But [inaudible] and it was,

1484
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.560
it wasn't your shoulder them jam,
notice your right elbow.

1485
01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:16.830
And I'm thankful about that.
Shoulder injuries are worse than elbows.

1486
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:20.540
Elbows is like the heel,
you know.
And even this one I can do like I'm,
I'm,

1487
01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:24.970
it'll be fine.
Yeah,
no factor.
Yeah.
You got the joint warfare.
Yup.
Yup.

1488
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.970
I attribute the quick healing to join warfare Krill oil,

1489
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:33.070
which I always take joint warfare.
Yeah.
And that's,

1490
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.600
and these are one of those ones that is kind of like,
man,

1491
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:41.280
I wish I would've,
it would've saved me a lot of pain in the past.

1492
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.330
Like if your joints are just holding up,
it's more of a big deal.
That's good.

1493
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:46.141
And it's like I said,

1494
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:51.141
I mean I had my shoulder where I couldn't do muscle ups for like six months and

1495
01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:54.000
then when we came out with their first like experimental,
no,

1496
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:58.680
like the second experimental uh,
joint warfare and I was on,

1497
01:29:58.681 --> 01:30:02.850
I was like all of a sudden I was doing muscle ups again,
which is,
that's awesome.

1498
01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.010
Right.
That's awesome.
Well shoot,

1499
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:08.880
doing muscle ups period is awesome cause I haven't Tang muscle ups,

1500
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:12.750
I haven't done muscle.
Ups were decades really my whole life.

1501
01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:15.900
I don't think I've ever done a muscle up before in for decades.

1502
01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:18.710
I think I've tried to do a muscle up probably like three times a week.

1503
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:21.390
As soon as we get done,
we're going to do some muscle ups.
Teach me the technique.

1504
01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.770
It's technique.
Well there's techniques,

1505
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:26.220
there's a little bit of strength obviously,
but if you know the false grip,

1506
01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.220
which is this main,
the main technique that needs to be learned,

1507
01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:34.310
keep it in tight to your chest,
pull it to your sternum,
boom,
boom,
throw it,

1508
01:30:34.311 --> 01:30:37.230
throw your chest forward and you're there.
All right,
cool.
She's new skill,

1509
01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:42.060
a muscle up.
But yeah,
if you want this a joint warfare and Jocko Super Krill.

1510
01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:47.061
It is@originmain.com main like the state or didn't mean.com also at origin main

1511
01:30:49.531 --> 01:30:52.860
is where you can get your geese.
Oh,
but before the geese I,

1512
01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:57.660
this is new so I can't tell this new supplement called the discipline.

1513
01:30:57.810 --> 01:31:02.490
Pre mission,
pre workout,
pre life activity,

1514
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.820
pre life supplement.
Um,
that's a good one.

1515
01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.980
Cognitive enhancements in there as well as physical pre mission.

1516
01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:15.120
You're going to need your brain and your body.
Boom for the mission.
Boom.

1517
01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.400
That's the one to take.
Yeah,
get down unknown's good.
By the way,

1518
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:21.910
it tastes good too.
Surprisingly actually made it tastes good.
Yeah.
Cool.

1519
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:25.200
Well because the big thing you got to watch out for is,
you know,

1520
01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:28.110
we don't want to spike our insulin level with sugar,

1521
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.080
but we have monk fruit,

1522
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:36.950
which is the sweetener and and monk fruit case.

1523
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.150
Good delish and,

1524
01:31:42.151 --> 01:31:46.980
and it also has some positive impact on your physiology as well.

1525
01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:49.890
So double two w we say there we say two birds.

1526
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:54.891
One stone industry ran on what those days?

1527
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:59.680
Good.
Yeah,
it's good.
Lemon or lime flavor.
Yeah,
there you go.
Get down.

1528
01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:03.580
But yeah,
that one to origin main.com real good.
Also at origin main,

1529
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:06.630
like I was going to say is gies for all the people who have been asking.

1530
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.510
Dave Burke today called me today about geese.
Like what up with the gays,

1531
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:12.250
I'm getting muggy and all this stuff you've been doing,

1532
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:17.350
which was even questioning,
he was actually asking more.
Well,
yeah,

1533
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.620
he did.
He was like,
what?
Gee should I get?
But then I was like,
well,
okay,

1534
01:32:20.621 --> 01:32:24.000
so you go hard Janie.
And he's like,
no,
no,
I know that.
But

1535
01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:29.980
the traditional geese sizes just like a one,
a two,
three boom,
you get it.

1536
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:34.100
But this one is kind of,
it's more suited for you.
So he had some questions.

1537
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:34.953
Skinny.

1538
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:41.530
I got a picture.
I got to post this picture.

1539
01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:46.170
I've got a picture of Dave Burke and me,
the commander.
I'm the commander of tea.

1540
01:32:46.171 --> 01:32:50.390
You bruiser.
He's the commander of lightening six.
His uh,

1541
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:55.530
Anglico team and I've got a picture of us in Ramadi together on a rooftop and

1542
01:32:57.671 --> 01:33:02.560
were both asleep.
He must've been,
I don't even know what it was taken,

1543
01:33:02.561 --> 01:33:07.300
but it's pretty awesome.
And it shows you like,
like you know it's eyes,
you know,

1544
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:08.470
it's awesome.
It's like we're both asleep.

1545
01:33:08.471 --> 01:33:11.410
We both have all of our gear on sitting on the side on a rooftop asleep.

1546
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:16.360
So what is that like?
You just got to,
I've got to catch her sleep when you can.

1547
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:19.660
Let me just keeps this quick.
Probably we,

1548
01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:24.660
my guess is we had moved into a position,
we'd stayed there,
we'd could,

1549
01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:29.020
a clearance was going on,
the clearance was done and now we were kind of,

1550
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.010
you know,
stand by situation and we're just like,
now we get a chance to do,

1551
01:33:33.011 --> 01:33:35.560
because before we'd go in the field,
he'd be asleep.

1552
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:39.460
You'd be awake for basically like 24 hours,

1553
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:41.890
then you go in the field better of fact,

1554
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.080
sometimes it's like when you go out in the field is when you got your first

1555
01:33:44.081 --> 01:33:46.930
sleep.
Like after you get the field and then you get your four hour of whatever,

1556
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:49.630
three hours,
someone,
you know,
you get your head down and you get some sleep.

1557
01:33:49.631 --> 01:33:53.810
Finally there's me and Dave Burke racked out barely.

1558
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:56.890
And it's not like you're like how you said three,
four hours.
I always,

1559
01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.440
especially after hearing you guys talk,
it's like man,

1560
01:33:59.441 --> 01:34:03.760
it's not like you're coming home from a hard day of work and you know,

1561
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:08.040
now you're,
you've clocked out and now you have some time to settle down,

1562
01:34:08.050 --> 01:34:10.970
watch the news and go sleep for the night and not like down on,
you know,

1563
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:14.140
going to catch some.
Yeah,
you're going to catch where you can.
So Dang,

1564
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:15.703
that's crazy.

1565
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.990
So it's not that you guys are just falling asleep on the job literally.
No,
no,
no,

1566
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.650
no.
Not at all.
Catch some,
some shuttle.

1567
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:27.280
What that means is we are probably on the tail end of a operation that we had

1568
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:32.281
conducted and we were now like in a stand down mode and maybe we are probably

1569
01:34:32.321 --> 01:34:36.100
getting ready to move to another,
you know,
another quadrant,

1570
01:34:36.101 --> 01:34:40.540
another sector and we're just catching some brack ops.
But it's an awesome,

1571
01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:43.870
it's an awesome picture cause it just tells you how like tired you,
you know,

1572
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.190
we're both sitting in chairs,

1573
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:49.690
all of our gear on holding our guns and we're asleep.
Both of us.
It's awesome.

1574
01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:53.140
And bed nonetheless.
Dave Burke.
Yeah he called me.
Nonetheless.

1575
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.860
That story doesn't matter.
You want to get a g you still looking to get a gig.

1576
01:34:56.861 --> 01:34:57.830
You want to get another geek,

1577
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.290
<v 2>get it from origin may not come made in America.</v>

1578
01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.290
Hundred percent made in made in America from the seeds of the cotton that said

1579
01:35:04.291 --> 01:35:07.880

1580
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:11.930
say cotton sure.
And they like when you say important,
important

1581
01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.000
in mountain cause you got about mountain.
Yeah.

1582
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:21.980
Breath cause you and I feel weird if I say mountain mountain or important,

1583
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.220
it's like I'm not important for me that's just like,

1584
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.700
yeah,
no I dig.
It doesn't sound weird when you do it.
It's,
it feels weird.

1585
01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.280
Let me do it.
Unless you or do you mean.com that's the goal there.

1586
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:38.060
They have a lot of cool stuff and it's all made in America.
That's the good part.

1587
01:35:38.061 --> 01:35:43.061
It's all made in America also for workout stuff.

1588
01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.630
Kettlebells,
battle ropes,
maces you're switching up your work.

1589
01:35:47.631 --> 01:35:50.840
Are you doing creative stuff?
Boom.
On it.
On dotcom.
Slash.

1590
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:55.760
Jocko that's where you go.
The kettle bells,
the artistic one,
primal bells,

1591
01:35:55.761 --> 01:35:57.320
demon bell's,

1592
01:35:57.321 --> 01:36:01.800
Zombie bells is what they're called and primal beltway prom.

1593
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.670
Zombied legend.
Yeah,
plenty to pick from.
What was the cool ones?

1594
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.390
I bought my daughter one a few months ago by the way.
She gets after.

1595
01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:12.890
That's where you get them.
A lot of cool stuff on there.

1596
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:17.240
A lot of good info as well on it.com/jocko that's the one also,

1597
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:21.260

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.570
The benefits of excerpts I think are kind of self explanatory and I've explained

01:37:18.571 --> 01:37:22.220

Subscribed.
Good way to support.
Also talk as a store.

1616
01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.290
It's called Jocko Jocko store.com.

1617
01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.220
This is where you can get the shirts.
Discipline equals freedom.

1618
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:45.170
A shirt with Jacola's head on it with the word good.

1619
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:48.980
Written backwards.
I'm not going to say why it's written backwards,

1620
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:52.400
but it is written backwards on purpose because people have been emailing you.

1621
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:56.340
And by the way,
if you see a shirt with the good written forward,

1622
01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.840
it's a fake shirt.
It's a knockoff.
It's what's called a counterfeit knockoff.

1623
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:05.040
It's bad.
Actually somebody posted a picture of,

1624
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:08.280
I forget what it's,
it's a Jocko Giacosa.
It's one of those,

1625
01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:12.870
you know those k there.
So there's like companies that they go,
you know,

1626
01:38:12.871 --> 01:38:14.850
they form stores on Amazon,

1627
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:20.430
see little something that might be computer thing and they'll they print shirt.

1628
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:23.730
They're like low quality one that said you wouldn't understand it.

1629
01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:27.000
It's junk junk thing.
That's the one I saw.
And they were like,
hey,
you know,

1630
01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:31.980
that could in being a cool hey man,
good meet some random dude out there.

1631
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:36.930
And I,
to me the quote was I,
I would never put that coat on there.

1632
01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.050
I don't think you would.
Doesn't seem like something you would put,

1633
01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:44.730
you will understand,
you know,
kind of the,
you know,

1634
01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:48.270
the guy looked cool in it and then I dig it.
But I'm good.
Nothing intention,

1635
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.630
good intention for sure.
100% and I'm signing on in that way.

1636
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.710
But I think again,
it's a situation where these comfort,

1637
01:38:56.711 --> 01:38:59.900
I'm assuming it's a company,
I'm sure it's not just one dude,
but it's companies,

1638
01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:04.910
they get trendy stuff and they just offer them for print in on Amazon or

1639
01:39:06.481 --> 01:39:09.150
wherever and that's different.

1640
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.940
That's what they called counterfeit knockoff John Lewis Store and then you're

1641
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:16.710
definitely supporting the podcast.
Yeah,
junk store.com that's it.

1642
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:20.490
And there's some origins of like a beck and origin may and they got the your

1643
01:39:20.491 --> 01:39:22.650
rash guard origins stuff,

1644
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:27.350
hundred percent in the game podcast legit.
Other than that,
it's good.

1645
01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:28.950
It's going to be kind of hard to find,

1646
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:33.120
well no the t Jocko white tea to supporting the podcast,

1647
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.390
but anything else is going to be not costing,
you know,

1648
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.820
kind of find that every once in a while.
So just be where if you care,

1649
01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:41.760
if you care a dig it because to me,
if,
if someone was wearing,

1650
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:44.130
it's a jungle thing,
you wouldn't understand.
They were like,
hey,

1651
01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.320
good evening or something like that.
I'd be done.
That'd be my new friend.
To me.

1652
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.960
So a day,
a hundred percent either way,
but I think that's more just info,

1653
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.550
you know,
information.
Yes.
It's one of,
back to [inaudible] story.

1654
01:39:56.551 --> 01:39:59.940
There's this women's stuff on their discipline equals from tee shirts,
hoodies,

1655
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:04.140
hats.
I don't think it beanies,
I didn't finish the beanies yet,

1656
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:08.320
but a meeting on Monday,
you know that,
you know,

1657
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:11.280
it's one of those things,
you know,
we're trying,

1658
01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:14.100
we're over here making sure you are aware of the seasons.

1659
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:19.090
They're the same every year.
Maybe we'll do like a spring beanie,
uh,

1660
01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.370
some rash codes on there right now since it's negative 40 degrees in New England

1661
01:40:23.371 --> 01:40:27.330
in Minnesota and an Oklahoma freezing Chicago.
Michigan.
Yeah.

1662
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:34.320
Sorry guys.
They're coming though.
It's all good.
Um,
also rash guards.

1663
01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.800
There's a new rash guard,
sodium one,

1664
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:41.160
the essence of Jujitsu,
small action.
Big Reaction.
You know,

1665
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.490
and that got pointed out to me after I started wearing it by the way.

1666
01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.800
Someone applied a layer.
A layer.
Yeah.
Black belt.

1667
01:40:49.110 --> 01:40:53.010
He was keeling Taylor who did it and he was like,
Oh,

1668
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:56.140
what is your restaurant say?
Says it's a small action,
big reaction.

1669
01:40:56.141 --> 01:41:01.141
And it goes to the essence of Jujitsu is the whole leverage and efficiencies

1670
01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:06.520
being.
I was like,
Dang,
Bro,
you're,
you're speaking of judo queuing.
Judo.
Keeling.

1671
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:10.990
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's black belts.
Do the original judo player.
Yeah.
Legit nonetheless.

1672
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.070
New rash out.
Oh,
it's cool.
It's cool.
Uh,

1673
01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.120
the word you'd rash guards are out and in circulation in the wild pig time of

1674
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:23.570
oil.
I haven't seen the person in the wild,
but I've seen them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Truly.

1675
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.380
Truly cyber cyber.
The cyber space.
Wild.
Yes.

1676
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.810
Yeah.
That's cool.
When people do that and send you the pictures,
but nonetheless.

1677
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:39.220
Yeah.
Jocko,
store.com.
That's a good one.
Also,
psychological warfare,

1678
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.860
of course.
If you didn't know what that is,

1679
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:44.920
I'm going to tell you it's an album with tracks,

1680
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:49.330
chocolate track and this is what it's for.
If you didn't know,

1681
01:41:49.331 --> 01:41:53.040
I'm going to explain it.
This is what it's for on your path to,

1682
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:56.260
I want to make it like concise.
Okay.
Here's a good way to say it.

1683
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:58.060
On Your path to greatness.

1684
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.660
It's a weapon against weakness.

1685
01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:04.990
It's kind of concise.
I'm still working on it.
I just made it up.

1686
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:09.820
Just not concise yet.
Cheesy.
Somehow have to greatness.
So cheesy.

1687
01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:13.750
Don't say it again,
Bro.
Yeah.
Cc.
This is the,
what do you call it?

1688
01:42:13.751 --> 01:42:17.530
The creative process.
Yeah.
This is like,
oh,
that was just cheesy.

1689
01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:22.300
There wasn't no awesome live on the podcast.
Just the worst.
Worst deal.
All right,

1690
01:42:22.301 --> 01:42:23.800
well,
hey,
look on your path.
How about that?

1691
01:42:23.801 --> 01:42:26.740
On the path you're on the path on the path.
We're working out,
we're working out.

1692
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:30.030
We're getting up early.
Some of us,
most of us,
some of us,
you know,
barely

1693
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:35.290
sticking with the dietary guidelines that didn't keep us in the game.

1694
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.220
Hopefully we better be nonetheless everyone.

1695
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:42.760
Every once in a while you'll hit that little roadblock.
Little speed bumps,

1696
01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:47.260
speed bump,
not roadblock,
speed,
bump moment of weakness.
All It is a distraction.

1697
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:50.230
Like can't.
When you get hungry,
you're on a fast or you're on,
you know,

1698
01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:53.020
like a really solid diet and maybe it's new or something

1699
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:59.740
you're thinking long term.
Hopefully you're thinking longterm,

1700
01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.680
longterm.
When my dad,
it's going to bring me my workout.

1701
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:06.010
My whole thing is going to bring me to this longterm goal.
Right.

1702
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:07.810
You keep your eyes in that goal.
You're going to stay on the path.

1703
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.980
You get distracted by the fact that you're hungry at one moment.

1704
01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:17.590
The fact that this thing right here,
donuts,
whatever tastes good,

1705
01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.980
you're distracted by that.
If you keep your eyes on the longterm goal,

1706
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:22.900
you won't be distracted and then it doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.
No,

1707
01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:25.060
I'm hungry right now.
I supposed to be hungry at night to meet.

1708
01:43:25.061 --> 01:43:28.750
Yet of course donuts tastes good.
They always taste good.
It has nothing to

1709
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:35.050
do with this pat.
That's why these are distractions.

1710
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.630
This psychological warfare is,

1711
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:42.690
it's like a little helper to keep you from being distracted and it's Jockos

1712
01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:47.860
telling us why we should not be distracted.
All right.
Thank you.

1713
01:43:47.861 --> 01:43:52.070
That was psychological warfare.
I do.
It is,

1714
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.330
<v 1>that's exactly what it is.
That's the best way to explain it.</v>

1715
01:43:54.331 --> 01:43:56.620
And you just explained it thoroughly.
I feel like you don't,
you don't.

1716
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.620
You know why you don't understand the value?
Because you don't listen to it.
No.

1717
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:03.300
Yeah,
I do know.
Because you've never,
yeah,

1718
01:44:03.301 --> 01:44:06.440
like the like you having to use it I think is like the kind of,

1719
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.890
oh you're just going to think it's Kinda,
it's just part of the game.
You know?

1720
01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.100
For us it's like have listened to it but I don't like to utilize it on the

1721
01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:17.730
regular tree.
Utilize something and get that little wind with it.
Your Brow,

1722
01:44:17.731 --> 01:44:19.970
you're going to be like,
okay,
this thing works.
This thing is legit.

1723
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.860
Just like Jujitsu.
It's an album on iTunes,
Amazon music,
Google play,

1724
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:27.560
that type of stuff.
That's where you can get it.
Speaking of Amazon,

1725
01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:31.040
also on Amazon you can get something called Jocko white tea,

1726
01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.840
which might sound like it's simple.
Drink.
Sure.
You put water,

1727
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:37.400
you put some tea in the water.

1728
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.400
What you don't know is that once you drink the tea,

1729
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.110
you now have a guaranteed deadlift of 8,000 pounds.

1730
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:48.620
So drink Jocko white tea and dead lift more.

1731
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:52.670
We've got some books way the warrior Kid Jujitsu,

1732
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:58.280
studying,
reading,
working out.
It's for kids,

1733
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:59.840
but adults can get something out of it to,

1734
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:05.020
somebody posted a straight up rocky training montage,

1735
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:09.590
but it was like an eight year old kid getting after it and it was all,

1736
01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.370
he's like sitting intensely reading warrior kid and then he's hitting mitts and

1737
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:17.460
he's intensely reading or your kid that he's doing pushups.
So yeah.
Uh,

1738
01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.030
you can get that book where the Warrior Kid,

1739
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:24.830
the next warrior kid book is coming out April 28th I'll tell y'all when it comes

1740
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:27.920
out and is available for preorder.
What's the name?
What's the name?

1741
01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:32.300
Can you tell us?
The name is,
the name is Wei.
The warrior kid.
Mark's mission.

1742
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:37.370
Yeah.
Mark.
Mark learned some new lessons.

1743
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.980
I'll read some excerpts from it on the podcast in the coming months.
Just,

1744
01:45:42.981 --> 01:45:47.840
you know,
some little tastes of Mark's mission.
Extreme ownership.

1745
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:52.460
Of course.
That is the book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin

1746
01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.860
combat leadership for business in life,
how to take ownership,

1747
01:45:57.861 --> 01:46:01.580
which I talked a little bit about today.
Discipline equals freedom.

1748
01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.720
The field manual,

1749
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.070
how to get after it mentally,

1750
01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:12.640
physically get some if you want the audio version of that.

1751
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:18.350
It is not on audible.
It is on MP3,
iTunes,

1752
01:46:18.351 --> 01:46:22.010
Amazon music,
Google play and other MP3 platforms.

1753
01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:26.390
Ashkelon Front is our leadership consultant company.

1754

It's Leif Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,

1759
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
emails info@echelonfrontdotcomoryoucangotoourwebsiteechelonfromdocfront.com if

1760
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.130
you want a keynote speech,

1761
01:46:59.190 --> 01:47:01.710
you don't need to go to a speaker's bureau.

1762
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.580
You can just contact us on front.com that's the more efficient,

1763
01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.450
effective way to make it happen.
On top of that,

1764
01:47:09.451 --> 01:47:13.870
we have the muster.
David,
we talked about it a little bit today.
Sure.

1765
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
The the muster is a leadership symposium where we talk about leadership.

1766
01:47:23.611 --> 01:47:27.480
We train leadership pragmatically tools.

1767
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.000
You will be,
you will.
This is pretty cool.

1768
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.640
You will be a better leader when you come out of the monster,

1769
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.870
you will be 100% I don't know if you'll be 100% better of a leader,

1770
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.200
you will have a hundred percent chance or 100% chance of becoming a battle

1771
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:47.610
better leader.
How much?
I'm not 100% sure on that figure,

1772
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.750
but you will definitely be a better leader.
And when we got done,

1773
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:52.830
I think I've talked about this before,

1774
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:57.630
but when we got done in Austin and we are at Jujitsu and we were teaching Jiu

1775
01:47:57.630 --> 01:47:59.940
Jitsu and I was like this is such a good deal yeah.

1776
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:02.850
To to get the information that comes at the muster,

1777
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:08.420
to have that opportunity to learn these lessons from the battlefield that you

1778
01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:13.080
can then take and apply to your business and your life.
And on top of that,

1779
01:48:13.081 --> 01:48:14.850
like the icing on the cake is,

1780
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:19.440
is going to Jujitsu and getting it in an introduction to that.
So the roster,

1781
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:20.303
it's been awesome.

1782
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:25.310
It's been awesome to see how it's affected people afterwards that have changed

1783
01:48:26.521 --> 01:48:29.340
their lives from coming to the monster.
So it's awesome.

1784
01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.380
Come and get some at the monster.
It is.
This year we're only doing two.

1785
01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.740
One is going to be in Washington DC,

1786
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:42.150
May 17th and 18th then there's going to be San Francisco,

1787
01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.180
October 17th and 18th we have had four of these events up until now.

1788
01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.810
They all sold out.
Visa will sell out.

1789
01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:56.580
So if you want to go,
a lot of times when people,
when companies,

1790
01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:01.410
companies have bureaucracies inside of them and so they're trying to get the

1791
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:03.490
approval for the,
you know,
hey we,

1792
01:49:03.491 --> 01:49:05.640
we need eight tickets and they're trying to run that through the chain of

1793
01:49:05.641 --> 01:49:07.850
command and get the funding for the eight tickets and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1794
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:10.890
And we've had companies that have started that process too late.

1795
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:14.640
And then we sell out and we're sitting here saying,
hey,
sorry,

1796
01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.700
the next muster's in six months you can come then.
You know what I mean?

1797
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:21.960
So get busy now takes while to get through your Burger cratic system at your

1798
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:25.500
company to get your team sent to the muster.
