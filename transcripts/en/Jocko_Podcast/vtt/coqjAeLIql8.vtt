00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.360
This is Jocko podcast number 67 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.743
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.680
We are soldiers,
marines,
grunts,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.040
ground pounders,
infantry men.

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.820
<v 0>Jarheads Tommy's doughboys Gis.</v>

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.350
We march,

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.670
we walk for miles.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.610
Miles that don't stop.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
Miles that don't end miles that are filled with fear,

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.563
<v 1>okay?</v>

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
<v 0>Fear of the unknown,
fear of the enemy,
fear of wounds,</v>

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.200
fear of death.

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.060
But we march on
our boots,

15
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.940
tried a stomp that fear into the ground.

16
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.700
People talk of glory on the battlefield,

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.710
but it is only talk

18
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.850
on the battlefield.

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.330
There is only guttural instinct to survive and protect your brother.

20
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.963
<v 1>Okay?</v>

21
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.380
<v 0>Things are done not for glory,</v>

22
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.560
<v 1>okay,</v>

23
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.760
<v 0>but for love,</v>

24
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.410
we march on

25
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.310
we march in the heat and the cold and the rain and the snow.

26
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.550
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.550
<v 0>we marched to deserts and streets and in the valleys and up the hills,</v>

28
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.470
every step we take is a new step into the unknown.

29
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.470
But at the same time

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.060
it is a step that has been taken thousands of times before by other soldiers and

31
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.110
all their times.

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.160
The names change.
The weapons change.
The cause is different,

33
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.330
but the faces,
the faces are the same.

34
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.090
The man does not change.

35
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.410
The fear is the same as is the will,

36
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.850
the hardened will to drive on to move forward.

37
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.253
Tomorrow

38
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.070
we close with the enemy,

39
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.390
<v 1>okay?</v>

40
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.190
<v 0>Be it swords or bayonets.
Rifles are machine guns,
spears,</v>

41
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:57.030
or grenades,
daggers,
or our bare hands,

42
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.440
<v 1>okay?</v>

43
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.150
<v 0>We bring our to bear</v>

44
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.250
<v 1>and on leash them with fury,
okay?</v>

45
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.150
<v 0>There is no crowd watching,</v>

46
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.290
<v 1>okay?</v>

47
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.510
<v 0>There are no admirers.</v>

48
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.680
It is only us.

49
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.380
And when one of our brothers is killed,
it rips us apart.

50
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.633
<v 1>Okay?</v>

51
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.460
<v 0>Magnificent men,</v>

52
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.920
the best of us,

53
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.370
beautiful human beings filled with hopes and dreams and filled with life,

54
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.660
Indian death,

55
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.340
all those hopes and all those dreams and all of that,

56
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:55.280
life is drained away,

57
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.420
taken away,
thrown away.

58
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.990
And in that moment

59
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.000
when a warrior falls,

60
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.110
the whole world should come to a standstill.

61
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.230
The whole world should stand and bow their heads and grieve the loss of that

62
00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:25.544
hero,

63
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.913
<v 1>okay?</v>

64
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240
<v 0>The whole world should stop and get on their knees and prays what that man has</v>

65
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:39.811
sacrificed and acknowledge this supreme made on corrupted eminence

66
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.060
of that soldier.

67
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.920
<v 0>Of that warrior,</v>

69
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.573
<v 1>okay?</v>

70
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.990
<v 0>But the world does not stop.</v>

71
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.980
The world carries on.

72
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.160
It is only we warriors that truly more.

73
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.710
It is us alone that bow our heads.

74
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.910
It is us alone that bow our heads and horn,

75
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.590
the loss of that fallen saint.

76
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.540
<v 0>The saint who has given everything</v>

78
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.333
for us.

79
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.840
Then
we warriors.

80
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.580
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.870
<v 0>we raise our heads,</v>

82
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.120
we raise our heads again in with fire in our hearts,

83
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.660
we lock and load our weapons and we march,

84
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.210
we march forward toward fear and toward evil and toward our fate.

85
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.570
We march forward without any question of what is at stake.

86
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.660
We march forward not for reward

87
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.710
but for duty,
not for ourselves

88
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.210
but for each other.

89
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.120
We march forward not for glory but for love

90
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.580
forward
forever.

91
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.410
We march on

92
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.630
good evening,
echo did evening.

93
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.270
I was asked the other day by a nother veteran how to cope with losing friends

94
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:14.924
and

95
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.160
I answered that question and in that answer

96
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.710
as I've thought about it afterwards,
no,
I,

97
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.690
I thought of this eternal warrior,

98
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.540
this warrior that's been around since man has existed,

99
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.170
hungry,
tired,
scared,

100
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.700
but heroic.

101
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.580
Heroic in his ability to put those discomforts aside in do,

102
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.080
but what he must do.

103
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.640
And tonight we're going to look

104
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.140
at another book about another band of brothers

105
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.440
going back once again to World War II,
back on the European continent,

106
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.230
a book by a guy by the name of Charles MacDonald,

107
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.790
who served as a company commander during the war and he actually went on to

108
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:35.020
become the deputy chief historian for the US army and author,

109
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.200
a bunch of books about the war.

110
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.050
But we're going to look at his first book today,

111
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.150
which is simply called company commander.

112
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.050
And he wrote this book just after the war in 1947 and you know,

113
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:59.010
I get a bunch of books
and I've,
I've talked about this,

114
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:03.330
like somebody tells me there's a good book out there and I don't even try and

115
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.410
read the reviews anymore.

116
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.400
I just order it because I figure there's a chance it's good.

117
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.370
And then when I get it,
I kind of,

118
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.140
you don't have to crack it open and see if it's the kind of thing that I'm going

119
00:09:15.141 --> 00:09:17.760
to cover that really suits the podcast.

120
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.290
And this book,
I just cracked it open direct to the preface,

121
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.120
which normally I go in the middle somewhere.

122
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:28.230
I might take a quick look at the preface,
but then I you know,

123
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.870
will look throughout the book and this preface,
as soon as I got the,

124
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.790
I got one sentence into this,
this preface donor,

125
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.510
I said the first paragraph under this,
into this preface and I was like,
okay,

126
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:40.440
we're doing this book.

127
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.540
So with that let's go to the book and start with a preface.

128
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.390
The once again,

129
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:58.390
this book is called company commander by Charles Be Macdonald written in 1947

130
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.253
here we go.

131
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.610
The characters in this story are not pretty characters.

132
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.960
They are not even her ROIC if lack of fear is a requisite for heroism.

133
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.580
They are cold,
dirty,
rough,
frightened,

134
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.990
miserable characters,
gis,
Johnny doughboys,

135
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.030
dog faces,
foot sluggers,

136
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.020
poor bloody infantry or as they like to call themselves,

137
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.240
combat infantry men,

138
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.410
but they win wars.

139
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.400
They are men from companies I and g 23rd infantry,

140
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.360
but they might as well be men from companies a and K,

141
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:52.361
16th infantry or they might be men from company C and e two o 254th infantry for

142
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:56.930
their stories are relatively the same.

143
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.070
Some may have fought the Germans longer than others or some may have fought the

144
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:06.071
Germans less for all it was an eternity.

145
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.280
The characters in my story or not fictional and any similarity between them and

146
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:16.960
persons living or dead is intentional than some of them are dead.

147
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.730
This is a personal story,
an authentic story,

148
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.770
and to make a story of war authentic,
you must see a war,

149
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.710
not a hasty taste of war,

150
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.490
but the dread knowing Daley died of war,

151
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.580
the horrors and fears that are at first blunt testimony that you are a novice

152
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:45.150
and then later become so much a part of you that only another veteran through

153
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:50.401
some sixth sense may know that those same horrors and fears are yet there.

154
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.650
<v 2>I was an officer in the war,
a captain and company commander of companies,</v>

155
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.890
I and g and because I was a captain,

156
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.070
my lot was easier sometimes than that of Joe private and Joe First Class and Joe

157
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.950
Sergeant and even Joe Lieutenant.

158
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.460
But when my lot was easier physically it might be harder mentally because I knew

159
00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:21.591
Joe private and Joe Private First Class and Joe Sergeant and Joe Lieutenant and

160
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:24.570
I could not suppress my love and admiration for them,

161
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:32.450
but physical suffering can be worse sometimes and when the Gis lot was harder

162
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:37.380
than mine.
I shall try and tell you that because I am not the hero of my story.

163
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.940
A heroes are the men from companies I and g,
the lead scouts,

164
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.180
the rifleman,
the machine gunners,
the messengers,

165
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.300
and the more Grumman companies I and g are called rifle companies in the army.

166
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.630
And when you call a company,
a rifle company,

167
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.080
you are speaking of the men who actually fight wars.

168
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.560
I did not fight the Germans as long as some of the characters in my story.

169
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.910
Some of them had been meeting the enemy since d plus one June 7th,

170
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.820
1944 when I joined them in September as replacement company commander,

171
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:22.390
they'd completed the capture of a stubborn enemy garrison at Brest France.

172
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.100
The day before I joined the join them.

173
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.530
They rested in an open field on the Brittany peninsula for five days and then

174
00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:35.300
they took a train ride on a French freight cars across France to meet the

175
00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:36.560
Germans again.

176
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.180
So there's the preface and you can see when he joins this company,

177
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.760
these guys have already been fighting for over three months,

178
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.780
close to four months when he shows up.
New Guy,
no combat experience.

179
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.680
He shows up and has to jump right into the game.

180
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.600
And here's some thoughts that he has coming fresh from the states company I 23rd

181
00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:00.961
Infantry.

182
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:05.961
I thought you fought your way assure in Normandy on d plus one you battled to

183
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:10.470
the hot top of hill one 92 to pave the way for the St Lo breakout.

184
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.270
You storm the ring,

185
00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:17.271
have pill boxes at breast and had your number of Deuce to 50 in the explosion as

186
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:22.821
the Germans blew them up in your faces and now they give you a company commander

187
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:27.630
fresh from the states.
They ask you to put your faith in me.

188
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.250
I felt weak and ineffectual.

189
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.590
My mind began to peruse the duties that were before me,

190
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.460
and this is when he's out on patrol.

191
00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:46.461
He's Kinda on his first patrol now in one day and at the most three I would be

192
00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:50.750
leading these men against a team of trained.

193
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.570
<v 0>I wondered how I would react.</v>

194
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.770
These men deserve the best leadership code I give it to them.

195
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.050
They could boast a glorious combat record already,
and I knew nothing.

196
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
Suddenly all my long hours of training for just such a role as this seemed

197
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:11.150
pitifully inadequate.

198
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.830
If only there were some way I could know just what it was like.

199
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.120
It seems incredible that this group of hardened combat veterans could accept me

200
00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:26.121
as an inexperienced youth of 21 to lead them into battle simply because he

201
00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:29.460
happened to come to them wearing a set of flashy bars on his shoulders.

202
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.390
If only I could look into their minds and see what they were thinking.

203
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.400
<v 0>So you can see this guy's definitely feeling what?</v>

205
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:42.280
Just about everyone moving into a leadership position and fuels,
which is,

206
00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:45.400
I'm not ready for this and I don't know everything.

207
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.850
And as I've said a bunch of times,
that's okay.

208
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.430
Everybody knows that you don't know everything.
Everything.

209
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.470
Everybody expects that you don't know everything.

210
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.500
What you don't want to do is go act like you know everything cause they're gonna

211
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.353
see right through it.

212
00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.463
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

213
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.050
<v 0>Now they're,
they're moving a little bit more and</v>

214
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.590
we're starting to get closer to combat.
My pulse quickens.
So this is it.

215
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.453
I said to myself,

216
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.180
using a phrase that every replacement uses a thousand times before he ever

217
00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:21.070
actually reaches combat.
I would soon know if I could take it.

218
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.940
I would soon know if I could justify the faith of the men of company I we

219
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:30.880
disbursed to our company areas in the darkness,
outside the tent.

220
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:36.040
I noticed flashes of artillery to the east and the deep rumbling of the big guns

221
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:40.330
came from the distance.
A voice in my brain kept repeating,
this is it,

222
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.403
this is it.

223
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.750
I stumbled blindly through the dark forest in the direction of the company.

224
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.860
So obviously I'm fast forwarding some stuff here and this is just him getting

225
00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:58.030
closer and closer to going into combat and you know,

226
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.940
every veteran now has that feel of,
you know,
since the wars for us started for,

227
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.160
for this generation star Dove,
this is it.
It's so true.

228
00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.370
Everyone's thinking that this is it,
this is it.
This is the big one.
This is,

229
00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:13.204
can I take it?

230
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.050
And so many guys will say that that's what drives them into the military for me.

231
00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:20.500
For sure.
You want that test and there's no,

232
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.490
there's no bigger test then hey there's other human beings that have tried to

233
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:29.020
kill me and I have to go kill them.
That's,
that's the biggest test of their is.

234
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.380
And guys want to know if they can take it.

235
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.310
Here's some of his thoughts.
Be Calm,

236
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.390
be businesslike.
This is the same as maneuvers,
maneuvers,
just meeting,

237
00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:44.850
training maneuvers.
Give some orders,
start things.

238
00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:47.790
Moving's you're going to have a look at the German army.
So this is,

239
00:17:47.791 --> 00:17:48.750
he's going out on a little

240
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.960
<v 2>and he now they're,</v>

241
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:02.850
they're getting in sort of a defensive position here and he says this back to

242
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:06.330
the book,
I decided to Dispo depose,
dispose my company.

243
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.660
Initially as lieutenant had done,
we could make changes later.

244
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.260
I would've preferred holding one of my rifle platoons and support position.

245
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.340
But it seemed unwise for our company.
Frontage was great.

246
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.610
So you can see he's already listening to like his lieutenant has his guys set up

247
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.810
a certain way.
He's going with it.

248
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.930
He's not going up there and changing everything right away cause he's just going

249
00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:30.920
to kind of set back and see how things go.
Now they're expecting to get attacked,

250
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.570
expecting to get attacked with,
with small arms fire.

251
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.650
But instead it ends up being some mortar fire.
Here we go back to the book,

252
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.370
but the sound of bullets did not come in good.

253
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:45.330
Stead came the sharp crack and heavy explosion that I knew must be mortar fire

254
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:46.380
falling behind me.

255
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.650
It sounded as if the shells were falling on the crest of the ridge that we had

256
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:52.530
so recently left.
But I took no time to look back.

257
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.280
I increased my speed and dived behind a clump of bushes.

258
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.380
There would be no protection protection from those bushes against the mortar

259
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:05.970
shells,
but I was comforted by their concealment.
I lay there panting,

260
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.990
so here's these in the first contact.
This is it.
This is it.

261
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.590
My brain kept repeatedly kept repeating madly over and over.

262
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.840
I must not appear afraid.

263
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.590
I must give these men confidence in me despite the fact that I,

264
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:23.040
they know I'm inexperienced.
They were playing their parts well.

265
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.750
I had been unable to detect any attitude of distrust in their actions and I had

266
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.070
searched their faces for long periods of time.
I must keep that confidence.

267
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:32.880
I must,

268
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.340
I must scared Campton sergeant savage asked,

269
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.200
so sergeant savages like his senior enlisted guy and he's looking at him and go

270
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.520
scared captain and he says a little,

271
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.180
I admitted I took a long slow drag on my cigarette.

272
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.790
We all are,
we all are savage said we always are.

273
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.140
Pretty a good vote of confidence and you can see the senior enlisted guy trying

274
00:20:03.131 --> 00:20:04.600
to make them feel comfortable with it.
Right?

275
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.790
That's a good senior enlisted guy that's not trying to make it,

276
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.420
not try to go ego.
Hey,
what do you use your problem when you look scared?

277
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.380
You know,
Captain No.
He said,
hey,
don't worry boss,
we're all scared.
No big deal.

278
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.390
We just got to stay professional.
So these guys end up in a,

279
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.940
in a,
you know,
hunkered down defensive position that he's got a man.

280
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.180
He ends up being there for quite a few days where it's,
it's a pill box,
you know,

281
00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:33.181
a bunker and his main control point or command point is inside one of these

282
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.960
pillboxes and they end up with a bunch of guys in this pill box and that he's

283
00:20:37.961 --> 00:20:42.100
got little foxholes dug out away from the pill box where there's a little

284
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:44.680
platoon guys and squads that are set up in these positions.

285
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.340
And so his task is to maintain the security positions and that's what he does.

286
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.560
Going back to the book,
I didn't plan to sleep at all the first night.

287
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.670
Now that we are in position and the difficulties of moving or moving in no

288
00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:58.600
longer word me,

289
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.050
I was filled with a growing fear that the Germans might hit us with a counter

290
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:02.884
attack.

291
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.880
I decided that the enemy must surely know that the troops were moving in and

292
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:11.320
would attempt to dislodge us.
While while we might still be disorganized,

293
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.530
11 men in a pillbox,
11 men who must live from day to day,

294
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.140
never thinking of the immediate future,

295
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:25.350
but only of the infinity when the war would someday be over.

296
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.610
There was sparky and First Sergeant Alvin savage,

297
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.070
Blackburn Cro to and me.

298
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.920
There was private first class Willy Haggen,

299
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.330
the tobacco chewing 39 year old army regular who kept us laughing with sage

300
00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:45.900
tactical wisdom,
wisdom and served as first platoon runner.

301
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.850
Then there was private first class Angelo Butare of Boston,

302
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.270
second platoon runner who had lost two brothers in the war already private first

303
00:21:56.541 --> 00:22:00.780
class,
Hubert Burger of Memphis,
Tennessee,

304
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.650
third platoon runner who's 18 years old and read his Bible every night.

305
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.690
Private FirstClass,
Caniff Lampton of Detroit,
Michigan weapons platoon runner,

306
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.720
who's also 18 and corresponded with college girls from Michigan and private

307
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.730
FirstClass,
Erling,
g Salberg of Fargo,

308
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:22.731
North Dakota who is 19 and cleanly good looking and the headquarters Bazooka

309
00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:26.820
man,
the cooks and jeep drivers,

310
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.060
the supply sergeant and the male orderly had been left behind with a service

311
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:31.440
company to keep us supplied.

312
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.360
The changing of the guard at four o'clock revealed that it was raining outside.

313
00:22:36.361 --> 00:22:38.400
A slow,
cold,
miserable drizzle.

314
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.410
<v 2>I thought of the men in the forward platoons and they're exposed foxholes with</v>

316
00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:47.630
no protection from the elements except shelter,

317
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:51.770
half stretched across their holes and nothing between them and the hostile

318
00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:54.770
killers in front of us,
but the muscles of their own rifles.

319
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.590
I had admired the unglamorous infantry soldier before,

320
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.890
but as the rain continued to fall and the night grew colder,

321
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.990
my pride at being a part of this dirty,

322
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:08.200
miserable infantry knew no bounds.

323
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:12.763
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.550
<v 2>Now,
like I said,
there was,
he was in this main pillbox,
which it has protection,</v>

325
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:20.400
right?
It's got a roof and their little bit relaxed in there a little bit.

326
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.520
You know,
they're,
they're protected not just from the enemy,

327
00:23:23.521 --> 00:23:26.100
but they're protected from the elements as well.
Somewhat.

328
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.390
So he goes out and he's going out to visit the guys that are in Fox holes that

329
00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:33.210
are just basically sitting out there bearing the elements.
You know,

330
00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:35.770
like you said,
nothing between them and the enemy,
but the,

331
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:37.830
the muzzle of the rifle back to the book.

332
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.880
Any idea that I might have entertained that my visit would bolster the morale of

333
00:23:41.881 --> 00:23:46.250
these men's was overshadowed by the effect of visit had on my own morale.

334
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.050
How cool,

335
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:53.050
how they could smile and laugh and joke in the present condition I could not

336
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:57.230
see,
but each man had a cheery word for me as I approached,

337
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.860
if I had possessed any misgivings that these men would weaken under the

338
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.010
hardships of their cramped position and the adverse weather,

339
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.720
they faded away into nothing.

340
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.010
Their courage and fortitude made me admiringly envious and brought a lump to my

341
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:17.470
throat,
so he's thinking I'm going to go out there and boost their morale.

342
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.440
The opposite happens.
The opposite happens.

343
00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:22.600
He's boosted by seeing them and seeing how,

344
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.960
how intact and motivated they were out there.

345
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:28.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.970
<v 2>Back to the book.
As we reached the right flank of the platoon,</v>

347
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:32.860
I noticed a man huddled in his foxhole,

348
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:35.560
trembling violently beneath a blanket which covered his head.

349
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.380
The Tena Anti grasped him by the shoulder.

350
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.490
I thought I told you to get digging this hole out deeper.
He said sternly,

351
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.590
the blanket came off the soldier's head.

352
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.670
You're putting me way off here by myself so I can be killed.

353
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.780
He shouted half Sabic you want me to be killed?
There's nobody over here,

354
00:24:52.781 --> 00:24:54.250
but shut up.
Sit.

355
00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:58.090
Auntie said you want the whole Goddamn German army to here.

356
00:24:58.091 --> 00:24:59.800
You get to digging that hole.

357
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.520
There's two men right here with you and the next holes,
10 feet away.

358
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.330
Nobody wants to see you killed.
We turned away.

359
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.850
I looked back over my shoulder at the soldier.

360
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.250
He's been like that ever since.
He's been with the pituitary.

361
00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:19.360
Auntie said uses every excuse he can get to go to the rear.

362
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.320
He won't work to get himself warm like I try and get him to,

363
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.650
if he doesn't come around tonight,
send them back to the CP.

364
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:29.980
I said we can keep him there for a night and see how he turns out.

365
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.460
So although some guys are clearly

366
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.430
in good spirits out there,

367
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.460
you still got guys that are breaking down and you got to deal with them and you

368
00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:44.680
can see he's going to pull them off the line,
get him back to CP.

369
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:46.600
And actually I don't go into this,

370
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.290
but he ends up getting evacuated and when they get it back they figured out that

371
00:25:50.291 --> 00:25:52.990
he's got appendicitis.
So he's in,
he's in rough shape,

372
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.390
but so some time passes and you know,

373
00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:03.100
they're dealing with sort of clandestine attacks are coming.

374
00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:05.830
The Germans will kind of pro bono or sometimes they're,
well they're,

375
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.430
they're receiving indirect fire and mortars and artillery on a fairly regular

376
00:26:09.431 --> 00:26:12.820
basis.
Back to the book,

377
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.910
I awoke at 10 for the start of the fourth day in the pillbox.

378
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.810
It was a day of k rations of glorious sunshine,
of adjusting artillery,

379
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:21.850
fire of testing,
telephone minds after enemies,

380
00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:25.330
shelling of signing ones names to our envelopes of countless letters of

381
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:30.280
requesting supplies from battalions of one and a hundred things that were

382
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:31.840
becoming more and more routine.

383
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.710
<v 2>But always there was the deep fearful dread of the enemy mortar shell that</v>

385
00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:43.380
dropped unheralded from the sky of the artillery round that screeched a fiendish

386
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:48.150
warning as it approached and the deep dread to of the darkness that would come

387
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:48.601
tonight,

388
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:52.470
just as it come last night and just as it would come the night next night and

389
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:57.471
the next and any night the darkness might release a hoard of fanatical German

390
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:03.480
soldiers eager to kill and drive us from our holes and pill boxes or perhaps a

391
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:08.430
flame throwing half tracks spouting it's flaming oily death into the deepest

392
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:10.920
recesses of the pill boxes.

393
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.300
The nervousness was like a malignant disease that ate itself up and down the

394
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:20.070
line and back again.

395
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.360
Hear about that stress.
You're about that constant,

396
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.130
constant stress and you notice it's the things that you can't control.
Yeah,

397
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.820
it's the things that you can't control.

398
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:36.170
That's the horrible things about the the mortar and the artillery fire.

399
00:27:36.171 --> 00:27:39.740
You can't control it.
Just random and you can't control where that round hits.

400
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.060
If it hits in your foxhole,
you're dead.

401
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.400
If it hits three feet away from Your Fox Hole,
you live

402
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.830
<v 1>okay.</v>

403
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.450
<v 2>And I think the,</v>

404
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.580
they had these flame throwing half tracks and I think just the,
the,

405
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:57.320
the to die by burning to death,
everybody knows that's a nightmare.

406
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.600
And so that's creeping in their minds as well.

407
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:06.860
Back to book,
it seemed that I'd only been asleep a few minutes when I awoke.

408
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.780
The pill box was a massive moving men with apparently no pattern.
A deep dull,

409
00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:15.740
throbbing filled my head accentuated by a fierce pounding that pushed

410
00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:19.730
relentlessly against my temples.
I jumped from the bunk with a start.

411
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:25.570
The throbbing in my head was a big gun firing the man seated there by the table

412
00:28:26.051 --> 00:28:28.010
is covered with a dull brown dust.

413
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.790
Blood was streaming from a gash in his forehead.
Uh,
tanks firing right at us.

414
00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:34.550
Captain Sparky said excitedly they hit the head,

415
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.350
they hit the shed with a mortar men in it.

416
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.330
Sergeant Paterson got a cut in the head.

417
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.640
I tried to shake the cobwebs of sleep from my brain.
I had been asleep for hours.

418
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:45.800
It was daylight.
It was eight o'clock in the morning.

419
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.190
I moved over to the wounded man.
He was sergeant Lee Patterson,

420
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.730
a North Carolinian and one of the squad leaders from the mortar section.

421
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.860
The wound is Bree bleeding profusely.

422
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.340
Another man held a handkerchief immediately below it to prevent blood from

423
00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:01.960
running into the sergeant's eyes.
It's not bad.
The sergeant said,

424
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.690
the sergeant said just to cut from some loose brick,

425
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.130
it was flying all around the seller when the shells hit looks worse than it is,

426
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.740
I guess.
So now they're,

427
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.470
they're under attack and you're going to notice a pattern.

428
00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:20.320
I don't know if I'll cover them enough,
but this poor guy,
this poor guy,
uh,

429
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.920
McDonald Cap Macdonald,

430
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.810
it seems like every time they get a major attack he's getting a woken from being

431
00:29:26.811 --> 00:29:30.280
asleep cause he's not sleeping very often,
but every time he puts his head down,

432
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.740
you see almost every time he gets awoken or every time they receive a major

433
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:36.470
attack it's because he's asleep and boom,
all of a sudden things start happening.

434
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.710
He must've been so paranoid to go to sleep knowing that this stuff was,

435
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.290
was hanging over his head.
So they're getting this pretty cool.

436
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.170
Pretty big coordinated attack.
And then some aircraft show up,
some,

437
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.630
some p 47 shows up,
uh,
like five p 47 shows up.

438
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.950
And here's the description of that.

439
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:57.220
Each plane circle high into the air and came down with a skill and grace have a

440
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:59.050
pair of wading dancer upon its target.

441
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:03.850
The bullets from it's Canon beating a staccato chance of death as it dived on

442
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:07.630
the Germans below.
Someone behind me said,
oh,

443
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.760
them goddamn beautiful birds.

444
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.410
We watched and silent admiration as the planes climbed once again.

445
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.250
Well their work's done for the day.
Someone said,
yeah,
I'm a mortar man.

446
00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:20.590
Answered reaching for a shovel.

447
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.000
They'll go home now and have a short scotch in a hot bath and shack up with some

448
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:29.650
Mademoiselle or some Limey wench.
What a life.
Yeah,

449
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.040
and draw double salary for it.
The headquarters man put in,

450
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.930
that's the life for me.
Willie Hagan said,
oh,
dry up.

451
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.650
You never had it.
So good.
So that's,
that's a common thing,
you know.

452
00:30:42.651 --> 00:30:46.090
And we're going to get Dave Burke on here and I'm sure we'll hassle him about

453
00:30:46.091 --> 00:30:48.520
being a pilot.
I mean that is you go,

454
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:51.040
you do your mission and then you're flying back to base.

455
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.440
The base is our in friendly areas and they're protected,

456
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:57.160
so you're going to get a short scotch and a law and on a hot bath

457
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.600
and again,

458
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.520
fast forward a little bit and also going back to him being asleep and being

459
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.910
rudely awakened.
Here we go.
Back to the book,
I was nodding off.

460
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.290
I was nodding often as the hands of my watch neared three o'clock awakening each

461
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:20.740
time with a start and shaking my head in an effort to clear it,

462
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.070
clear the sleep from my brain.
A shot rang out.

463
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.690
It seemed to come from the very entrance of the pill box and was the cue that

464
00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:33.691
set off of a fuselage of small arms that reverberated back and forth among the

465
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:38.500
hills.
I could discern the slow chatter of one of our heavy machine guns than the

466
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.600
intimidated,
guttural tone of a burp gun.

467
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:46.350
All the sounds seem to emanate from the area around the farm house as if every

468
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:51.670
conceivable type of small arms vied to be heard above the company noises.

469
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.190
The explosion of a German type concussion.

470
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:59.191
Grenade joined the uproar and American grenade exploded and it's fragments wine

471
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:04.390
through the year.
A few rounds of mortar fire exploded above the din.

472
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.870
I heard the guards scuffle and curse as they tripped on the entrance to the pill

473
00:32:08.871 --> 00:32:11.320
box.
I was suddenly afraid.

474
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.830
I was suddenly more afraid than I had ever been before.

475
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.360
My body seemed weak all over and I wondered if I had the strength to stand up.

476
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.380
I opened my mouth to sound the alarm and I wondered if anything would come out.

477
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:29.110
Wake up everybody.
I shouted,
surprise that the words actually came forth.

478
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.080
I don't want anybody caught sleeping in this damn pill box.

479
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.760
We had waited long enough.
The Germans had come.

480
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.870
The sound of small continued heightened by the explosions of dozens of light

481
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:46.220
mortar shells.
Fear gripped my body and left me trembling.

482
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.900
I was not so much afraid of what was happening as I was of the horrible visions

483
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:55.400
my mind had dreamed up of what would happen should we fail to repulse the
attack.

484
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.390
I visualize the mad dash dash to reach the engines to the pill box to escape and

485
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:06.440
trap me within only to be met by a hail of enemy fire or a hellish blast of a

486
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:10.610
flame thrower.
My imagination ran a gauntlet of evil.

487
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.800
So this is a counter attack.
Well,
this is what you've been waiting for.

488
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.940
Now the company veterans,
we'll find out what it has in this youthful,

489
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:23.060
inexperienced CEO.
Quit shaking.

490
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:26.480
God dammit stopped trembling all over.
Get control of yourself.

491
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.860
Act like a soldier.
God dammit.
At least you can impersonate.
An officer.

492
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.830
Savage tried the battalion phone,
the handle,
which should have produced a ring,

493
00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:40.570
made an unnatural grading,
sound the lines out.
He cried.
I'll try the other line.

494
00:33:40.571 --> 00:33:44.560
Blackburn,
I'll try the other line.
Blackburn,
get your radio set up outside.

495
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.650
So this is despite the fact that they'd been mortared and they've taken some

496
00:33:47.651 --> 00:33:50.560
fire and they've had some little probing attack.
This is the big one.
This is,

497
00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:51.311
this is it.

498
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:56.311
The Germans had come and it's interesting to hear his thoughts as this going on

499
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.900
and he's tying to tell himself,
stop shaking,
calm down.
Act like a soldier.
Hey,

500
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.590
if nothing else,
just pretend that you're a soldier right now.

501
00:34:05.591 --> 00:34:10.240
Just act like an officer should act right now.
Classic.

502
00:34:10.241 --> 00:34:15.241
So they start receiving this pretty intense attack and he gets on the radio,

503
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:21.490
eventually get the radio set up and he says,

504
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:24.070
attack is hitting my left flank and right flank of love company,

505
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:28.150
their lines must be out to fire us concentration two to one over.
So

506
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.150
what they do is,
and they get in these,

507
00:34:31.151 --> 00:34:36.040
these defensive positions they set up and they have predesignated firing areas

508
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.960
where they can have our friendly artillery or mortars bomb areas.

509
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.610
They already know where they are.
So they,

510
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:45.190
this one was called the concentration two to one.
That's wherever,

511
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.650
wherever the enemy's attacking from,
they have a name for it.

512
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.770
They say put bombs on two,
two,
one,
boom.
You can get it done really quick.

513
00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:54.460
And it's,
it pretty much,
uh,

514
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.350
almost immediately Holt's this attack.
And

515
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.900
of course that attack goes away.

516
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.510
They kind of get that one under control.

517
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.890
And now he's tired because he didn't get much sleep.
So he goes back to sleep.

518
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.440
And here we go.
Back to the book,

519
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:17.190
it seemed that I had been asleep for hours when I awoke suddenly with a start,

520
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.400
Sparky's voice came to me.
Some work from somewhere in the distance.

521
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.680
I'm trying to get the artillery.
I'm trying to get the artillery.

522
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:26.160
Blackburn's voice was somewhere else beside it.
Get me Captain Anderson.

523
00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:29.040
Give me Captain Anderson.
But what was the noise in the background?

524
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.120
What was that pounding?

525
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.390
Someone must be beating on the pill box with a sledge hammer.
What was that?

526
00:35:33.391 --> 00:35:35.910
Deafening noise.
I jumped from my bunk.

527
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.930
My feet stung from rough contact with the concrete floor.

528
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.520
That was artillery and mortars exploding,
exploding my head.
I couldn't think.

529
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.490
I shook my head sharply to clear the sleep from my brain.

530
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.350
The Germans had come again.
And what?
Mortars and artillery is good?

531
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:55.230
God,
they must be firing every weapon round from miles.

532
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.390
There was a wild looking Sparky's eyes.
They've hit all three platoons captain.

533
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:03.000
He cried head on.
They're pounding the hell out of them.

534
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.420
Worse barrage I ever heard.
Worst barrage I ever heard captain.

535
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.160
<v 2>So like I said,
whenever whenever Captain Mcdonald Falls Asleep,</v>

537
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.980
they're getting attacked and that's what they're receiving really heavy attack

538
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.551
again.

539
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:23.550
So they repulse that first attack and now they're coming back at him again.

540
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:27.000
And this time it's with some serious artillery.
For God's sake,

541
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:30.330
get a some artillery captain.
He cried.
They're knocking the hell out of us.

542
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:33.360
Small arms and Burp guns and this God damn mortar and artillery fire.

543
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.650
I never saw such a barrage.
We've got to get some help or we'll never stop them.

544
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.580
<v 1>Okay?</v>

545
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.940
<v 2>For God's sake,
captain hurry.
Middlebrook said his voice was half frantic.</v>

546
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.510
I got two wounded men here,
my pillbox.
Now God knows how many more are out there.

547
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:54.350
I suddenly remembered the one 50 fives that close in concentration.

548
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:59.850
We had zero on our front.
So one 55 is a bigger artillery shell.

549
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.850
It's the big,
big daddy.
And they had,

550
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.290
they had got a concentration of fire that was really close to them.
So Hey,

551
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.270
if we're getting like just about to get overrun,

552
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:12.600
we can call this this particular concentration of fire,

553
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.350
that close and concentration.
We had zeroed on her front.
What was it called?

554
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:20.340
Queen one 63 queen wants 63 Oh god,

555
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.920
let us get the one 50 fives
hello.
Tear one,

556
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.120
tear three.
Roger,
tell Tara to give us the one five fives.

557
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:32.660
Concentration queen one 63 and fast over.

558
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.390
So he calls in that concentration,
which is,

559
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.540
which is really close to them.

560
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.630
You're calling it 150 I think 155 millimeter mortar shell,

561
00:37:41.631 --> 00:37:46.070
I want to say it has like 25 or 30 pounds of explosives in it and they're

562
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:47.330
calling it a bunch of it.

563
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.050
And here we go.
My heart skipped a beat.

564
00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:57.620
Savage ran back inside to really relay the news to platoons and the big

565
00:37:57.621 --> 00:38:01.070
artillery shells whispered their messages of outgoing death.

566
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:05.940
Definitely explosions to our front were followed by the noise of shrapnel

567
00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:10.860
spraying the trees around the farm house and small pieces of spent shrapnel

568
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:13.080
fellow round us.
So they're called those bombs.

569
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:15.480
So close to third getting hit with the shrapnel from the bombs.

570
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:16.590
That's how close the enemy was.

571
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:18.090
And that's how close they're calling these bombs in.

572
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.160
I called for a repeat on the barrage and when the battalion said,

573
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.620
Roger,
we knew,
I knew we had one.

574
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.290
No attacking force could withstand the barrage like that.

575
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:30.480
So that's a command that you use when you're calling in artillery,

576
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:33.750
it's called repeat,
which is actually why you never say repeat on the radio.

577
00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:35.740
When you seen the movie,
someone says,
Oh,
can you repeat that?

578
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:36.670
You don't actually say that.

579
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:39.190
You don't say repeat unless you're specifically doing this.

580
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:43.120
Getting them to call more bombs it.
What'd he say then?
Say it again.

581
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.590
I'll say it again.
Say it again.

582
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:50.370
And so they call these big bombs come in and another couple of days go by.

583
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:55.300
They end up spending a total of nine days in the,

584
00:38:55.301 --> 00:39:00.040
in the pill box and in that position and who finally they get told,
okay,

585
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:03.040
we're going to pull you out of the pill boxes and we're going back to the book.

586
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.650
I tried to keep my voice in a normal pitch through the conversation,

587
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.110
but I wanted to jump and kick and scream with joy.

588
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:12.100
Tears came to my eyes and I thought I would choke with happiness.

589
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.470
It was almost too wonderful to be true.

590
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.400
My battalion runners would arrive around midnight leading the men of company B.

591
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.760
We were getting out of the pill boxes and tonight company I was to be relieved.

592
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.890
So there you go.
Nine days in the pill boxes.

593
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.900
The other company,
company B,

594
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.090
comes out to relieve them and they're doing a a turnover with company B.

595
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.660
So he sent in like one platoon back at a time and he's staying there with the

596
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:44.410
new company commander who's name is Captain Cowen and we're going back to the

597
00:39:44.411 --> 00:39:47.440
book.
A few minutes later,
call came for captain cower over the platoon phone.

598
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.050
A tenseness came over his face as he answered,

599
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.050
he handed the phone back to the soldier sitting at the table.

600
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.530
They just killed one of our own men.
He said to me,

601
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.160
one of my squad leaders was moving around to the front and was going back to his

602
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:03.760
whole one of the bar men,
let him have it,
thought he was a German.

603
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.950
I wondered how it would feel to have one of your own men killed by an accident.

604
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.250
Having a man killed by the enemy would be bad enough.

605
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:17.290
Although I've been mercifully speared that thus far I shuttered.

606
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.330
My men are nervous as hell.

607
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:23.350
Captain Callen said they've heard all sorts of rumors and stories about these

608
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:25.750
positions makes them trigger happy.

609
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.950
So we got a blue on blue guys the first night and position and they're freaked

610
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:34.360
out.
They've heard all these rumors,

611
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:37.720
they know that these guys are getting pounded by the enemy and the Germans keep

612
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:42.430
attacking and they'd get so paranoid that they accidentally shoot one of their

613
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.264
own guys.

614
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:49.000
Now these guys get moved to the rear company.
I kind of get some,

615
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.440
some they get moved back a little.
So a lot of the front line anymore,

616
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.660
and this was kind of an interesting look on that.

617
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:59.350
It seemed back to the book it seemed now we were in a quiet position.

618
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.120
Every officer in the division with rank of major above wanted to inspect the

619
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:05.050
company area.

620
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:10.170
They condemned the men for not having shaved or for wearing knit wool caps

621
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.260
without their helmets.

622
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:16.261
Evidently an unpardonable misdemeanor or for untidy areas around the dug outs.

623
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.910
These officers did not inspect my first book tune area.
However,

624
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.390
usually passing it over with the excuse that it was a bit far to walk,

625
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:30.391
but we laughed inwardly knowing that it was the threat of enemy shilling that

626
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:35.030
kept most of them away.
So,
oh,

627
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:36.080
you're back in the rear now.

628
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:39.380
Everyone wants to come and meet you and meet the boys cause there's no danger

629
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:42.920
there.
Well guess what?
The boys know.

630
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.810
The boys know what's up.

631
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:52.960
Now he's about to get an order to go out on the attack.

632
00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:55.730
So He's been in an event,
a position.
Now he's moving to TAC,
get set.

633
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:59.420
It's coming now at the attack order.
At last,
you're going to attack.

634
00:41:59.421 --> 00:42:01.340
There's no chance now for a reprieve.

635
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.790
The CEO of of the 393rd had insisted that we attack immediately to relieve the

636
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:10.430
besieged unit.
The colonel continued,

637
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.760
but he had succeeded in putting off the attack until morning.

638
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.110
We would jump off slightly before dawn.
At seven o'clock attacking astride,

639
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.160
the East West Highway Company,
I would attack on the left.

640
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.610
Additional ammunition would be available later at battalion.

641
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.690
The platoon leaders were assembled.
When I returned to the company,

642
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.030
I only had one map of the area and there was no place where we could have a

643
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:37.970
light to examine the map with the lieutenants.

644
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.780
Sergeant Alvin slit trench was deeper than the others,
but that's but,

645
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.040
but at that it amounted to a little more of an than the snow scraped from the

646
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:48.410
earth and a few inches of frozen earth removed.

647
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.060
The men hastily through dead branches across the makeshift hole and I wriggled

648
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:55.610
underneath with my map and a book of matches.

649
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.300
One puts one of the platoon leaders,
one by one.

650
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:01.400
The platoon leaders crawled under receive the order.

651
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.570
I would strike a match and give them a brief glance at the map.

652
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.330
Now wet and sodden from the melting snow.

653
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.070
I wondered if I could have drawn any worse conditions under which to issue my

654
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:16.340
first attack order.
So here are the,
they'd moved forward,

655
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.640
but now they're getting ready to attack and he's given his first briefing to his

656
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:22.640
platoon leaders.
He only has a one map,
which is completely ridiculous.

657
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:27.190
And I think about like every single guy when we would go out on the battlefield,

658
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:32.150
every single guy would have a battle map.
Every single guy,
if we take 30 guys,

659
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:34.490
they all are going to have a battle map with them.
So here we are,

660
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.600
we're a old company of 150 guys.
We've only got one map and he's got it.

661
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.060
And by the way,
it's soaking wet.
And by the way,

662
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.260
for your briefing nowadays we go into a big secure area with a PowerPoint and

663
00:43:45.261 --> 00:43:48.350
big projector up and we'd go through all of these slides that are well prepared.

664
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:53.530
He's got a match in a hole and he's given this brief is what I'm talking about.

665
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.383
So

666
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.000
they end up in a forward position and as this attack goes,

667
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.920
they end up now having to switch from attacking to a defensive position and

668
00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:13.550
things start to get go sideways really,
really quick.

669
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:17.930
And this ends up is actually the beginning of the battle of bulge to famous.

670
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.720
Obviously a famous battle and this is sort of the beginning of it,

671
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.140
although they did not know that at this time.
So here we go.
Back to the book,

672
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:26.030
I took stock of our defensive situation.

673
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.650
We were one rifle battalion thrust into a densely wooded area with no terrain

674
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:35.340
features that favored the defender with orders to hold at all costs.

675
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:36.931
We were hastily,

676
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:40.710
Doug in along the highway facing the direction from which we hope the enemy

677
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.570
would come if you had to come.

678
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.920
No company had been able to withhold a support platoon.

679
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.730
There was no support company.
Thus the defense was thin,

680
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.090
single line of riflemen so there's no backup.
That's the situation.

681
00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:59.091
They're in a shallow draw laid to the front of my rifle platoons with a higher

682
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:02.460
ridge rising beyond it over which the enemy would soon becoming.

683
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.500
Another draw led up to my left flank,

684
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:08.640
protected by two light machine guns and a few riflemen and position which no man

685
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:12.480
in his right mind would place machine guns unless he had no other method of

686
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:16.230
defending the probable enemy approach.
These guys are in a horrible situation.

687
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.920
Our right flank lacks our right flank,

688
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:24.840
lack 50 yards of tying in with k company along a firebreak which bisected the

689
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:25.674
highway.

690
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:30.180
We had no anti-tank defense except to Sherman tanks and a bazooka with three

691
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:31.260
rounds of ammunition.

692
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.820
We were being supported by 99th Division artillery and outfit about which we

693
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:39.660
knew nothing except this was their first action except for holding a quiet

694
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:43.770
defensive sector for a month,
but there was nothing that could be done now,

695
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.800
but wait at 10 30 a jeep loaded with men clip down the highway toward the rear

696
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.660
at break neck speed.

697
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.380
That would be the vanguard of the retreating battalion from the 99th the Germans

698
00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.040
would be here soon.

699
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:05.450
Just imagine that you're there to help out and defend this position and support

700
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:07.860
this battalion.

701
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:13.190
And the first thing you see coming from ahead of you is a jeep filled with rag

702
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:17.100
tag soldiers going as fast as they can away from the enemy

703
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.050
craziness,
craziness.
And here it continues.

704
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.800
A ragged column of troops appeared over the wooded ridge to the front of the

705
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:32.520
second and third platoons.
There were not over 200 men,

706
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.530
the remnants of 900 who had fought gallantly to our front since they were hit by

707
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:39.300
the German attack the preceding day.

708
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.320
Another group the size of a platoon withdrew along the highway,

709
00:46:43.321 --> 00:46:46.080
donating a few hand grenades and clips of ammunition,

710
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:51.120
which they pass to f my first platoon,
two men stayed to fight with my company.

711
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.640
It's a legit,
you just got overrun.

712
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:57.450
Some guys are given away ammunition given grenades away and these guys are,
hey,

713
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.400
where can I help out

714
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.470
to enlisted men carrying a badly wounded lieutenant stopped exhausted with my

715
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:08.190
third platoon.
They could carry him no further.
I called for a litter squad.

716
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.120
The rifleman could not be sure if the next troops that appeared over the ridge.

717
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:15.900
We're friendly.
Your enemy.
I alerted the artillery men to call for fire.

718
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.480
In the event the approaching troops were German.

719
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.790
Lieutenant Brock's call came a few minutes later,

720
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:23.640
scarcely proceeding a hail of small arms fire,

721
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.660
which sounded like the crack of thousands of rifles echoing through the forest.

722
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.530
There was no doubt my men could see the build caps of the approaching troops.

723
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.610
They were Germans
and you know,

724
00:47:37.611 --> 00:47:42.611
we're going to get to a point as I go through these books and I highlight little

725
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:44.690
sections and I read that little section.

726
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.230
I'm about to get to a point here shortly where I'm just going to read the whole

727
00:47:48.231 --> 00:47:50.540
damn section because it's,
it's so much.

728
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:54.620
It's a company that's about to get overrun,
right?

729
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.200
It's a company that's about to get overrun by Germans and it's,

730
00:47:57.201 --> 00:48:01.130
it's really interesting to hear what this looks like from the company commander,

731
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.630
company commander's perspective.
But this is,
I mean,
this is it.

732
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:10.170
This is,
you're losing the battle.
I mean,
he survives,
but it's,

733
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.410
it's as bad as it gets.
It's as bad as it gets back to the book.

734
00:48:15.411 --> 00:48:17.660
Any me bullets whistled through the trees around us.

735
00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:20.330
I jumped into the slit trench with savage and Blackburn.

736
00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.560
Request after request for artillery and mortar support came from the platoon

737
00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:25.040
leaders.

738
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.970
I called for every concentration listed on my overlay and for variations of
each.

739
00:48:28.971 --> 00:48:31.520
So that little thing I was talking about where you're calling for these

740
00:48:31.521 --> 00:48:34.400
concentrations,
you've got two to three and this one and that one.

741
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.780
He's just calling for all of them.

742
00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:38.090
Call them for all of them cause bomb everything.

743
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.720
The inevitable maddening three rounds fell each time.

744
00:48:42.721 --> 00:48:44.640
So they're trying to conserve in the rear.
They're trying to conserve,

745
00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.910
conserve ammunition.
So the lead,

746
00:48:46.911 --> 00:48:49.560
you're finding three rounds at a time and he's do it again,
do it again,

747
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:52.200
do it again.
But platoon leaders begged frantically for more.

748
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.760
I began on one side of the company area and called for concentrations all across

749
00:48:56.761 --> 00:48:58.610
our front and back again.
Lieutenant saw,

750
00:48:58.611 --> 00:49:02.550
you're called for barrage after barrage of 81 millimeter mortar fire.

751
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.910
The crack of small arms reached an ear splitting crescendo,

752
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.140
crescendo like static on a forgotten radio during an electric storm.

753
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:14.850
I lay flat on my back in the slit trench that will tune phone to one year.

754
00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:17.430
The receiver of the battalion radio on the other,

755
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.940
the chill from the frozen earth seep through my clothes and I shivered.

756
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.010
But I was surprised at my own calmness.

757
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.910
The long nights of shaking terror and the pillboxes convinced me that I would

758
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:28.380
never be calm and combat.

759
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.100
I did not know what possessed me to keep calm.

760
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.210
Surely this is the most serious situation which I had ever found myself.

761
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:40.620
The small arms fire reached another crackling,
crescendo,
Crescendo.

762
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.070
The small arms fire reached another crackling,

763
00:49:44.071 --> 00:49:49.071
crescendo long had several men wounded long as one of the other commanders.

764
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:55.050
He didn't know how many or how badly the enemy bullets were too thick to move

765
00:49:55.051 --> 00:49:59.250
around.
We're too thick to move around.
I called again for litter squads.

766
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.420
Wave after wave of frantically screaming German infantry storm.

767
00:50:03.421 --> 00:50:06.870
The slight tree covered rise held by three platoons.

768
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.190
A continuous hail of fire exuded from their weapons answered by volley after

769
00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:15.090
volley from the defenders,
Germans fell left and right.

770
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.310
A few rounds of artillery.

771
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.360
The few rounds of artillery we did succeed in bringing down caught the attackers

772
00:50:21.361 --> 00:50:25.050
and a draw to our front and we could hear their screams of pain when the small

773
00:50:25.051 --> 00:50:28.310
arms fire wood slacking,
but still they came.

774
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.150
Artillery and naval war refers,

775
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.390
which is like another kind of Canada German cannon with their accompanying

776
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.990
terrifying screams,
played a deep accompaniment in the background.

777
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.640
The shells exploded to our rear and around the road junction to our right.

778
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.530
We ignored they're crushing explosions,

779
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:49.250
thinking how thankful we were that their effects were reserved for others than

780
00:50:49.251 --> 00:50:50.120
ourselves.

781
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:55.220
The small arms fire rose and fail again and then again indicating that the

782
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:59.090
attacking troops withdrawn momentarily to the bottom of the draw to regroup

783
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:04.091
before launching another suicidal assault reinforcement streamed over the ridge

784
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:05.930
behind them to join the assaults.

785
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.810
The draw and the highway were littered with their dead and wounded,

786
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:12.560
but there seemed to be no end of their fanatical attacks.

787
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.460
Second Platoon reported as company soldier killed.

788
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.990
It was the first death and company I since I had taken command three months

789
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:25.250
before,
but the news was not so staggering as I had expected it would be.

790
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.080
There was too much other excitement.

791
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.710
The dead soldier was technician fifth grade,

792
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:33.500
Martin w Carlson from Pennsylvania.

793
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.410
He was an aid man whom the rifleman idolized who had jumped from his foxhole to

794
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:41.120
aid a wounded soldier nearby,

795
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:46.130
a bullet pierced his helmet and he fell face forward into a hole of the wounded

796
00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:48.260
rifleman.
He had sought to aid.

797
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:53.360
He was a noncombatant according to the rules of warfare and was denied the

798
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:58.361
privilege of wearing the combat infantry men badge and the $10 per month pitons

799
00:51:59.131 --> 00:52:03.620
for dangers and hardship endured,
but death made no distinction.

800
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.840
Message after message came over,
the platoon phone,

801
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:12.980
Lieutenant Wilson was badly wounded.
He could not walk and must have a litter.

802
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.870
Ammunition was running lower and lower.

803
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.690
The [inaudible] company machine gunners with the first platoon were out of

804
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:21.560
ammunition except but enough to keep one gun firing a few minutes longer.

805
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:26.270
The 60 millimeter mortars found their ammunition supply so low that they fired

806
00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:28.490
only when the enemy was actually assaulting.

807
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.930
Germans were being killed as close as 10 yards forward of the foxholes.

808
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.420
Hand grenades were practically all gone.

809
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.710
Yeah,
this is,
this is it.

810
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.520
There was no solace from the battalion,

811
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.200
each call for litter bearers or additional ammunition.

812
00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:52.520
It was met with the maddening words we're doing all we can.

813
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.500
I told them we could not hold out much longer unless we got additional

814
00:52:57.501 --> 00:53:00.740
ammunition.
Captain Montgomery said,
we must hold.

815
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.040
Our orders are to hold that all costs.
He said,

816
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.880
I wondered if he could possibly realize the meaning of those words we must hold

817
00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:14.840
until every last man was killed or captured company eyes last stand

818
00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:20.380
and what is to be gained.
Nothing but time.

819
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.820
Time born of the bodies of dead men.
Time.

820
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:26.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

821
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.130
<v 2>Seven times the enemy infantry,
assaulted,</v>

822
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.880
and seven times they were greeted by a hail of small arms fire and hand grenades

823
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:34.500
at sent them reeling down the hill,

824
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.770
leaving behind a growing pile of dead and wounded.

825
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:42.270
But with all the attacks seem poorly organized.

826
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.530
There was no supporting artillery or mortar fire on our positions and I wondered

827
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:49.320
why they had not yet found the open flank on our left.

828
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.150
There was only the suicidal wave of fanatical infantry men whooping and yelling

829
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:58.530
and brandishing their rifles like men possessed.
I looked at my watch,

830
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.310
it was three 30 in the afternoon.
Time was passing amazingly fast,

831
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.930
long again,
long was the,
uh,
was one of the other platoon commanders.

832
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.570
Long said he saw enemy tanks.
There were five of them.

833
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:13.290
Giant Tiger's lung blurring down the road,
300 yards away,

834
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.800
surrounded by over a hundred and enemy infantry men.

835
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:21.020
Get those Sherman into action.
Sherman,
who was our,
our us take,

836
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.820
get those Germans into action.
It's your only hope you might,

837
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.750
he's talking to himself.

838
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:28.140
You might hold off the infantry even with your ammunition,
practically exhausted,

839
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.920
but rifleman can't fight tiger tanks.
The first platoon has,

840
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:36.240
you're only three rounds of Bazooka ammo unless the Shermans can stop them.

841
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.020
Three rockets are all there is between you and company.

842
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:41.730
I and kingdom come.

843
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.840
So small arms.
Obviously machine goes,

844
00:54:46.841 --> 00:54:48.640
they don't do anything to attack and they only had,

845
00:54:48.641 --> 00:54:52.780
there's five enemy tanks coming and they only have three bazooka rounds,

846
00:54:52.781 --> 00:54:57.040
which a bazooka rounds can stop a tank,
but you know,
you got to hit.

847
00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:01.390
It's got to be a good hit and all that.
So he knows he's in big,
big trouble.

848
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.250
I called Sergeant Garcia to send a man to contact the tankers and tell them to

849
00:55:06.251 --> 00:55:08.770
move immediately to their foreign positions on the left flank.

850
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:13.510
This business of improved positions with so much Bosch Garcia,

851
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:17.200
his answer was stunning.
They're gone.
Captain,

852
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.470
they pulled back to k company 15 minutes ago,

853
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.520
so he's expecting the Sherman tanks or to be help out,
they're gone.

854
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:31.290
I did not take time for the full meaning of his words to sink in,
giving our,

855
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.180
giving her a call,
sign over the radio.

856
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:35.910
I asked Colonel Tuttle and told him my plight.

857
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:40.890
Either I get those tanks back to my left flank or I could not possibly hold the

858
00:55:40.891 --> 00:55:43.590
position while waiting for the colonel's answer.

859
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:48.270
I tried barrage after barrage to destroy the Tigers with artillery and mortars,

860
00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:52.020
but we made not a single hit and the near misses only stopped the infantry

861
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:56.460
temporarily not phasing the great steel monsters in the least they wattled

862
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:01.490
effortlessly on toward the hapless riflemen around of 88 millimeter snapped from

863
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:02.904
the top,

864
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:07.230
snap the top from a fir tree above our heads and fragments sprayed down in all

865
00:56:07.231 --> 00:56:09.210
directions.
There could be no doubt.

866
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:14.130
Now the Tigers had arrived round after round,
crashed into the area,

867
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.570
a momentary shrill whistle followed by Daphne explosion and a sharp thought of

868
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:22.590
the round being fired the ladder reaching us after we heard the shell explode.

869
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.370
For God's sake,
captain long screamed over,
the phone is half voice.

870
00:56:26.371 --> 00:56:29.920
Sabic get those tanks down here.
Do something for God's sake.

871
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:34.120
These bastards are sitting 75 yards away and pumping ADH into our fox holes like

872
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:38.380
we're sitting ducks for God's sakes.
Captain,
what about Your Bazooka?

873
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:43.510
He said a bullet had gone in one and and bent the tubes so the rocket would not

874
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:44.344
pass through.

875
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

876
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.740
<v 2>Colonel Tuttle was on the battalion radio.</v>

877
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.250
The tanker said it would be suicide for them to face the tiger tanks.

878
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.120
They would not move unless he gave them a direct order.

879
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.520
And then he was afraid they would disobey it.

880
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

881
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.930
<v 2>And he was inclined to agree that they stood no chance against the more heavily</v>

882
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:06.790
armored tigers and the 88 so these American tanks or they can't fight against

883
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:10.090
the Tigers.
And so they're backing up so that they can survive.

884
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:16.580
I burned with anger and I must have been insubordinate if my men could fight the

885
00:57:16.581 --> 00:57:20.510
armor plated monsters with nothing but rifles and die in the attempt to tankers

886
00:57:20.511 --> 00:57:24.860
could afford to try it with medium tanks.
If we don't get the tanks,

887
00:57:24.861 --> 00:57:27.710
we can't hold another five minutes.
I said slowly and finally,

888
00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.600
thank you Sir Roger Out.
And for those of you that don't know,

889
00:57:32.601 --> 00:57:35.930
I've explained this before,
out means you don't need to talk back to me.

890
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.430
You don't need to.
I'm not requesting a response out means I'm done.

891
00:57:40.431 --> 00:57:41.300
I'm hanging up the radio,

892
00:57:41.301 --> 00:57:46.301
which is interesting that normally the the junior person,

893
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.670
the says you know over and it's the senior person that says,
Hey,

894
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:55.910
don't talk to me anymore.
I'm done with you.
So he's saying to the,
to his leader,

895
00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.620
he's saying,
if we don't get the tanks,
we can't hold another five minutes.

896
00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.350
Thank you,
sir.
Roger out.

897
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

898
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.640
<v 2>Shades of general Custer company,
eyes last stand.
Hell.</v>

899
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:15.650
What does it matter?
You never expected to get out of this war alive anyway.

900
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.890
Not really.
I gave long the news.
He was frantic.

901
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.670
There was absolutely nothing he had his men could do a direct hated landed on

902
00:58:23.671 --> 00:58:26.740
one of the heavy machine guns.
Another it hit the technical hit.

903
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.350
Technical Sergeants,
smiths,
Foxhole Smith was the platoon sergeant long.

904
00:58:31.351 --> 00:58:32.700
Didn't know if he was dead or not.

905
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.940
The other machine gun crew is out of ammunition and was withdrawing.

906
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:38.070
He was powerless to stop them.

907
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.770
He was afraid his left flank and the draw was falling back,

908
00:58:40.771 --> 00:58:44.160
but he couldn't see to make sure hold long.

909
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.430
I cried for God's sakes.
Hold.
We've got to hold.

910
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.710
I wondered how I made my voice so convincing.
I wanted a throw away.

911
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:56.700
The platoon phone and the battalion radio and everything connected with the war

912
00:58:56.701 --> 00:59:00.150
and bury my head in my hands and cry.
Cry,
cry.

913
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:02.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

914
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.070
<v 2>The infantry assault upon the other platoons continued.</v>

915
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.310
The sound of the battle reached a height which I had never thought possible

916
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:13.510
before.
The burst of the 88 millimeter shells in the woods vied with the sound of

917
00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:16.210
hundreds of lesser weapons.
It couldn't last forever.

918
00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:20.260
I thought it must stop sometime.
It must stop,
but when and how?

919
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.170
I looked toward the draw between me and the highway,

920
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:26.900
about 20 men were walking down the draw toward the rear.

921
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.170
I recognize several men from the light machine gun section and a machine gun

922
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:33.440
crew from m company.
The other ones were riflemen from first platoon.

923
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.780
I did not know where they were going.

924
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:37.970
All I knew is that somehow I must stop them.

925
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.360
I jumped from the slit trench and ran toward them ignoring the crack of bolts

926
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:44.420
through the trees,
waving my arms and shouting for them to stop.

927
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:48.260
They turned to look at me with vague blank expressions.

928
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:52.070
They seem to wonder who was this crazy man who wanted them to do this foolish

929
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:56.300
thing.
I saw that it was the entire left flank of first platoon.

930
00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.530
The thin lines of the remainder of the platoons would soon be cut off from the

931
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:05.270
rear.
The 60 millimeter mortar man of few words away,
a few yards away.

932
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.950
We're dismantling their weapons.

933
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.420
I managed to get my mood to get the men to move to my CP,

934
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.700
but I could not step them that,
stop them there.

935
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.350
They walk slowly on towards the rear,
half dazed expressions on their faces.

936
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.210
So his guys are leaving and he's doing what he can to get them to stop and
fight,

937
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.290
but they're,
they're leaving.
This is,
it's not happening.
The guys know and,

938
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:31.610
and they're out.
I mean,
they're out of bullets right there out of bullets.

939
01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:35.420
They don't have any ammunition left with nothing to do,
so they're leaving.

940
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.430
I jumped into the slump slit trench and grasped the radio handpiece.

941
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.200
I sat on the edge of the trench ignoring the whistle bullets and the crash of

942
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:49.400
[inaudible] 88 millimeter shells around us as everyone seemed to be now doing

943
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.810
get the platoon leaders on the phone.
I called the savage
Hello Roger One.

944
01:00:54.811 --> 01:00:55.680
I said it to the radio,

945
01:00:55.681 --> 01:00:58.380
not waiting for my acknowledgement that they were receiving my message.

946
01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.980
This is Mac.
My left flank has fallen back.
I can't stop them.

947
01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:04.170
The Germans are overrunning my left platoon.

948
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:09.780
I'll try to build up another line along the firebreak.
We can't hold here.

949
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.640
There I had said it.
This was I company turning tail and running.

950
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.380
This was I company retreating.
This was I company hauling ass.

951
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.600
This was I company running like a son of a bitch.
Strangely,

952
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.130
I didn't give a damn.

953
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.170
I was utterly void of feeling savage held the platoon phone towards me.

954
01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:33.870
I can't get long.
He said,
and he's here with us now.

955
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:40.160
Don't sound afraid.
You've got to sound like you mean business.
Hello Brock.

956
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:43.160
I said calmly,
they've overall longs position.

957
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:47.360
Swing your platoon back to the left rear and we'll build up another long along

958
01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:51.800
the firebreak.
Did you get that?
Garcia pull back and we'll tie with K company.

959
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.190
My CPS pulling out now we've got a hold of the fire.
Blake,

960
01:01:55.191 --> 01:02:00.140
do you understand that we've got to hold the firebreak the men in my CP group,

961
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:02.870
we're already moving towards the rear.
I grabbed my,

962
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.740
my musette bag and my car been savaged took the phone,

963
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.410
Blackburn grabbed the radio.
We ran toward the rear.

964
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.670
We reached the north South firebreak and crossed it.
The foxholes.

965
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.450
Which battalion did aqua occupied.

966
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:18.650
We're fall along the far edge of the clearing and a patch of small firs who's

967
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:22.350
interwoven branch has formed a small dense green barrier.

968
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.490
I knew that any fight here would be at close quarters because the Germans would

969
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:30.480
be able to advanced unseen to the edge of the firebreak 15 yards from the

970
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:33.990
foxholes we would occupy,
but it was the only spot where we had to,

971
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:37.980
any possibility of holding.
I ran up and down the line shouting,

972
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.380
we've got to hold them here.
We've got to hold them here.

973
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.980
The men stared back at me unbelievably.

974
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:49.190
I was asking headquarters men armed with carbines and pistols to hold off a

975
01:02:49.191 --> 01:02:53.130
hordes of attacking Germans that had already broken through all our rifle

976
01:02:53.131 --> 01:02:57.150
platoons could offer.
There was only one machine gun,

977
01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.200
a light gun man by Private First Class Richard Cowan of Wichita,

978
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:04.920
Kansas set up five feet from the Fox hole,
which I occupied.

979
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:10.080
The Germans were almost upon us before we knew what was happening.

980
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:15.480
We could not see them for the low hanging branches of the fir trees across the

981
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.170
firebreak,
but we could hear their shouts and shrill whistle signals,

982
01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:21.000
which evidently came from their leaders.

983
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:26.370
I decided they were flanking group that was on its way unseen around our left

984
01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:28.680
flank.
Even as we left our former CP,

985
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.420
the attackers who had dislodged first platoon could not have reached us so

986
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:34.254
quickly.

987
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:40.020
Cowen began to spit machine gun fire across the north narrow firebreak and I

988
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:42.510
heard German heard a German scream with pain.

989
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.960
The headquarters men fired their carbines and pistols into the low hanging

990
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:46.680
branches.

991
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.920
The fir trees to the right were too thick to see the area where the rifle

992
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:52.350
platoons were supposed to be going into position.

993
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.330
I wonder if they had been able to build up any semblance of aligned around.

994
01:03:57.331 --> 01:03:58.710
Came from an enemy tank,

995
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.810
broke the top of the small for tree above.

996
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:05.880
Cowens had sending him reeling from the gun,

997
01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:07.980
but he jumped back and continue to fire.

998
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:10.840
I knew that the big tigers had reached the junction,

999
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.150
the firebreak and the highway.

1000
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.520
Hails of enemy bullets thrashed the snow and the fur and the trees around us.

1001
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:21.810
The fruit trees around us.
I ducked beneath the cover,

1002
01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:23.910
my foxhole trying to get battalion on the radio,

1003
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:27.720
but without success I stood up and looked out of the whole great God.

1004
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:31.500
There was no one left,
but Cowen,
the others had fallen back.

1005
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.720
I jumped from the foxhole and yelled,
the count,

1006
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.020
withdraw savage and Blackburn followed me.

1007
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.600
I left my my set bag lying on the ground,

1008
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:42.510
but my car been was over my shoulder absent mindedly.

1009
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.060
I screamed to get the radios.
Savage,

1010
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:49.740
jumped back into the foxhole and Blackburn and I turned and plunged through the

1011
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.410
thickly interlace branches of the little first.

1012
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:56.600
Bullet's followed us lashing the first on all sides and I wondered if maybe I'd

1013
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.830
been hit.
I felt no pain,

1014
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.280
but I could not see how any human being could endure those handles of bullets

1015
01:05:02.281 --> 01:05:03.210
and not be wounded.

1016
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:09.470
I stumbled blindly through the brush on heedful of the branches scratching at my

1017
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:10.620
face and hands.

1018
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.030
My overshoes were slick and I tripped and fell face downward in the snow.

1019
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.420
I rose again and stumbled on blindly as we punched through the first.

1020
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:23.410
I was separated from blackbird and the group that had held held briefly at the

1021
01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:28.180
firebreak.
I did not worry that savage or the others were not with me.

1022
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.760
They were at someplace else in the fir thicket.

1023
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:36.340
I came across Sergeant [inaudible] and Sergeant Walter l Dietrich of Cincinnati,

1024
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:38.140
Ohio or machine gun squad beater.

1025
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:43.230
We plowed through the first together until we came unexpectedly upon Ks,

1026
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.100
k companies CP,

1027
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.780
a series of half completed foxholes dug in the frozen red earth.

1028
01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1029
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:53.530
<v 2>Captain Howard see Wilson of Houston,
Texas.</v>

1030
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:57.550
The K company commander was talking frantically over 300 radio.

1031
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:02.440
He turned as I approached,
damn,
but I'm glad to see you.
He said,

1032
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:05.590
battalion lost contact with you and I haven't heard anything about how your

1033
01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:06.520
company's coming.

1034
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:11.740
He seemed more leave than perturbed at seeing me and I wondered what he thought

1035
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.870
brought me to his CP.
Perhaps it was the way I stood looking at him blankly.

1036
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:21.520
There must have been nothing in my face to tell him that my company was no more

1037
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:27.040
and that even now hordes of Germans were rushing toward us unchecked.

1038
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1039
01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:33.510
<v 2>Through my mind raised only one thought I had failed and failed miserably.</v>

1040
01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:38.850
My orders had been to hold that all costs and I personally had failed and

1041
01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:40.470
because of my failure,
the entire,

1042
01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:45.770
the entire battalion would be routed or annihilated it all from a local German

1043
01:06:46.621 --> 01:06:49.470
counter attack.
I company had fallen back,

1044
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.560
but I could not blame the men they had given in because I had some way not led

1045
01:06:54.661 --> 01:06:58.230
them correctly.
It was I who was responsible.

1046
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.490
I would turn in my captain's bars if I ever reach the rear or perhaps they would

1047
01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:04.740
court martial me.
I did not care.

1048
01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:10.310
There's nobody on your left flank.
I told Captain Wilson in a matter of fact,

1049
01:07:10.311 --> 01:07:12.710
voice that I hardly recognized as my own.

1050
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:16.040
They just knock the hell out of us and the whole company's falling back.

1051
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.790
I couldn't tell you where any of I companies right now except these two

1052
01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:24.640
sergeants and myself,
good God,
what can I do,

1053
01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:27.970
Mac?
I don't know.
I said,
you can't hold here.

1054
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.040
There's nothing on your left

1055
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:39.190
and then it continues.
My platoon has fallen back.
He cried.

1056
01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:42.790
It's those God damn tanks.
Yeah.
I said I had three rounds,

1057
01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:46.510
Bazooka ammo and then knock the bazooka out.
I've got sicked rounds.
Six rounds.

1058
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:49.690
Captain Wilson said two men grabbed a bazooka and disappeared into the

1059
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.280
underbrush and the direction the enemy.

1060
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.270
I thought how foolish it was to think of stopping 10 tiger tanks with one

1061
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:59.800
bazooka.
The two soldiers returned a moment later panting for breath.

1062
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:00.551
Good God,

1063
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:04.570
captain and one of them said the woods just a few yards away from here off full

1064
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:07.570
of the bastards.
We better get the hell out that settles it.

1065
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:11.080
Tell your other tunes to withdraw and to Creek Elton rocker shelf.

1066
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.320
Notify Battalion.
Tell them we're getting the hell out.

1067
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:19.870
We plunged again through the thick fur trees towards the rear.
I heard cap.

1068
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.990
I heard battalion on Captain Wilson's radio telling l company to withdrawn to

1069
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:28.370
Rosh wrath before the full force of the enemy's flanking drive could hit them.

1070
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:34.030
We reached the edge of the patch of small firs to our left.

1071
01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:39.180
Lay the explodes to highway leading up the hill into Roger Wrath to our right.

1072
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:44.080
The corner of the firth thicket joined the corner of a patch of larger trees

1073
01:08:44.081 --> 01:08:46.390
which extended out 200 yards up the hill.

1074
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.450
We chose the louder route without hesitation.

1075
01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.100
We ran halfway through the patch of woods before we came upon a group of

1076
01:08:54.101 --> 01:08:55.330
abandoned foxholes.

1077
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.110
Captain Wilson yelled the group to the Holt will hold up here.
He shouted.

1078
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:03.610
We may be able to hold them up for a while while some of the others get out.

1079
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.330
I could not see what good we could do from this position,

1080
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:11.740
but I was taking commands now and I took cover alone in a fox hole and the edge

1081
01:09:11.741 --> 01:09:13.570
of the woods facing the highway.

1082
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.960
It was good to let someone else do the thinking for awhile.

1083
01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:21.520
Even if I disagreed with the decision,
I was not afraid.
Instead,

1084
01:09:21.521 --> 01:09:26.410
I was strangely apathetic to the whole affair.
The Germans were hot on our tails,

1085
01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.610
so what?
They'd been a hot on my tail for almost as long as I can remember now,

1086
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.470
and they had cut my company to ribbons.
They might as well get me too.

1087
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.990
German infantry men who emerge from the thicket.

1088
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.680
We had left such a short time before and milled around to us,

1089
01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:48.710
abandoned US tanks parked in the open beside the forest accompany and machine

1090
01:09:49.471 --> 01:09:53.820
gunner private first class Jose M.
Lopez of Brownsville,
Texas.

1091
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:57.690
Set up his gun beside a hole five feet to my rear.

1092
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.260
He opened up on the German infantry with the blast of muzzle,

1093
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.740
the blast of muzzle forcing me to sink to the bottom of my whole for cover.

1094
01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.770
The Germans wasted no time in returning fire.

1095
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:12.210
Riddling the area around the machine gun in my foxhole with a burp gun and rifle

1096
01:10:12.211 --> 01:10:13.044
fire.

1097
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:17.940
A Tiger tank appeared at the road junction where where the battalion had been

1098
01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:22.200
shelled the night before and fired.
Point blank at Lopez is exposed position.

1099
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:27.000
The long barrel of the 88 on the tank seem to reach half the distance from the

1100
01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:31.080
hole to my foxhole.
Lopez continued to fire

1101
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.620
and American jeep with two aid men.
They're red.
Geneva crosses,

1102
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.540
painted on their helmets,

1103
01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:41.530
tore down the highway from the direction of Rosh giraffe toward the road

1104
01:10:41.531 --> 01:10:43.630
junction.
I held my breath.

1105
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:46.600
The Tiger tank would surely blast them from the road.

1106
01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.640
Couldn't they see the Germans were here.

1107
01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:51.760
Now they did with the jeep spinning on two wheels.

1108
01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:55.420
They turned around and tour back up the road.
The tank did not fire

1109
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.930
over the noise of Lopez,
his machine gun.

1110
01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.500
I could hear the Captain Wilson shouting to withdrawn to Roger Breath.

1111
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.210
I wanted to obey,

1112
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:08.050
but I was caught in the crossfire of the heavy machine gun and the attackers.

1113
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:12.370
I gritted my teeth and waited for a Lola in the firing.
None came.

1114
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.950
I jumped from the hole and ran blindly towards the rear bullets,

1115
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:18.180
snipped at my heels.

1116
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:21.480
The tank saw that we were running again and open with renewed vigor.

1117
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.770
The big shells snapping the tops from the trees around us as if they were

1118
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:26.604
matched sticks.

1119
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:31.730
But I saw no one fall dusk was approaching and it was difficult to see for any

1120
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.150
great distance.

1121
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.460
I could not make out the town of Rochester f that I knew it was high on the hail

1122
01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.510
to our left front,

1123
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:43.480
but we plunge blindly up the hill falling the thin hedge row that would be scam

1124
01:11:43.481 --> 01:11:47.820
protection against the Germans should the Germans elect to follow us with fire.

1125
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.410
I slipped and fell down,
fell face down in the snow.

1126
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.530
I cursed my slick overshoes I rose and fell again.

1127
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.170
I found myself not caring if the Germans did fire,

1128
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.020
snow had gotten inside my shoes and my feet were soaked,

1129
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.610
my clothes were drenched per perspiration covered my body and my mouth was dry.

1130
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:09.940
I wanted a cigarette.
I felt like we were helpless.

1131
01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:14.941
Little bugs scurrying blindly about now that some man monster had lifted the log

1132
01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:16.660
under,
which we had been hiding.

1133
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:22.830
I wondered if it would not be better to be killed and perhaps that would be an

1134
01:12:23.081 --> 01:12:24.610
end to everything

1135
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.530
and that's the,
that's the section right there that like I said,

1136
01:12:32.531 --> 01:12:35.020
I mean you just can't,
I couldn't skip anything in there.

1137
01:12:35.021 --> 01:12:39.610
Just too much stuff going on and to hear what it's like from his perspective of

1138
01:12:39.611 --> 01:12:44.611
being overrun and they continue to fall back as fast as they can and they're,

1139
01:12:45.421 --> 01:12:47.190
they're basically at an every man for himself.

1140
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.940
The for yourself situation at this point.

1141
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.360
They finally do get back and he ends up in sort of a compound and he tries to

1142
01:12:58.301 --> 01:13:02.770
find his battalion commander and so he does.
Going back to the book.

1143
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:06.100
We walked across the courtyard inn down the dark steps of the house into the

1144
01:13:06.101 --> 01:13:09.700
basement.
A group of enlisted men were eating k rations.

1145
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:13.360
Colonel Tuttle was quietly talking to a group of officers.

1146
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:17.800
A dim candle lit the room.
Nice work,
Mac.

1147
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:21.640
Colonel Tuttle said,
I couldn't control myself.

1148
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:26.530
I could control myself no longer the choking sensation in my throat became

1149
01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:28.810
racking sobs that I could not hold back.

1150
01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:32.230
The colonel tried to comfort me and I felt foolish and childish,

1151
01:13:32.231 --> 01:13:34.780
but I could not stop.
Someone gave me a cigarette.

1152
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.640
I held it with trembling fingers.

1153
01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.020
I was suddenly conscious that Colonel Tuttle was saying something to me,

1154
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.050
but at first I could not make any sense of what he was saying.

1155
01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.620
This had been no local German attack.

1156
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.520
The enemy had already broken through and taking bull again,

1157
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.960
catching the division quartermaster and the engineering troops unaware in the

1158
01:13:55.961 --> 01:13:57.190
undefended town.

1159
01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:03.430
The main supply route for crinkled to the rear through Bergen had thus been

1160
01:14:03.431 --> 01:14:04.264
severed.

1161
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:08.710
The two other battalions of our regiment had been thrown into the battle and the

1162
01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:13.711
division was abandoning all its gains in the offensive to hold this critical

1163
01:14:14.111 --> 01:14:14.740
area.

1164
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.740
Our battalion had held long enough for the ninth and 38th regiments to withdraw

1165
01:14:20.231 --> 01:14:24.760
past the vital crossroads guarded by two stone farm houses that I remembered

1166
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:25.720
from the trip forward.

1167
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:30.880
The ninth was setting up a line along our present location and the 38th had

1168
01:14:30.881 --> 01:14:32.570
taken over the defense of crinkled.

1169
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:37.690
There were unconfirmed rumors that this was a big German push all along the

1170
01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:42.430
first army front.
The news stunned me,
I stammered.

1171
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:47.260
You mean you mean?
I mean,
you did a good job,
Mac.
The colonel said,

1172
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.720
the Germans are throwing everything they've got.

1173
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:54.700
You held out much longer than I expected after I learned the true situation,

1174
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.650
so I had not failed and I company had not failed.

1175
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:03.640
I was almost happy that the German offensive was a large scale one.

1176
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:08.470
My men had done an excellent job against heavy odds and those who had died,

1177
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:11.260
we're not dead because of some personal failing of mine.

1178
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.920
The realization made me want to cry again.

1179
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.810
I still did not know what had happened to my company.

1180
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:24.460
So like I said,
this was the,
this was the massive,

1181
01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:28.780
massive German counter attack that he happened to bear the brunt of the

1182
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:33.100
beginning of the battle of bulge and well,

1183
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:37.990
you know,
you can hear clearly.
He just thought,
I just,
we just,

1184
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.960
it was a local little German attack and we folded,

1185
01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.430
but it was a massive German attack and they put up an incredible resistance.

1186
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.480
So now he starts,

1187
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.410
he links up with savage sergeant savages is senior enlisted guy.

1188
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.420
He sees him back to the book,

1189
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:56.440
savage and I ran for each other like two college girls suddenly reunited,
smiles,

1190
01:15:56.441 --> 01:16:00.460
read dark faces.
We both tried to talk at once.
He'd heard that I'd been killed.

1191
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.290
I had not known what had become of him.

1192
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.590
I jumped back when the foxhole after you said get the radios.

1193
01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:09.220
He explained at length.
First thing I knew there were Germans all over the place.

1194
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.440
They made me come out and took my watch and,

1195
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:15.070
and moved me over to the highway where they had two other gis.

1196
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:19.210
Then one of our artillery barrages started falling.
The crowds hit the dirt.

1197
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.990
I grab one of their burp guns and started spraying and we ran like hell.

1198
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:26.620
All three of us got away.
So that's,

1199
01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:30.970
that's how savage got out of there.
And a little more time passes.

1200
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.720
I began to evaluate our losses in the fierce opening day fight in the,

1201
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.720
in the Korean kilter evolved.

1202
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.220
Initially approximately 80 men were listed as missing,

1203
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.910
but each day brought a new list of names from the rear hospitals of men who had

1204
01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:50.290
been wounded in evacuated or were victims of trench foot bliss.

1205
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:54.340
The list of missing in action finally narrowed down to 24 men.

1206
01:16:55.930 --> 01:17:00.520
So even though you know they lost control and he didn't know who,

1207
01:17:00.521 --> 01:17:02.650
he didn't know where,
where everyone was.
I mean they were just gone.

1208
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:07.570
He was the only guy that he was alone when he came back or Oreos with one or two

1209
01:17:07.571 --> 01:17:11.960
other guys.
So that's out of 150 guys.
So eventually they realize or he comes to,

1210
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.750
there's only 24 guys that they don't know what happened to the rest of them.

1211
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.280
The rest of God out of there.

1212
01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:17.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1213
01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.980
<v 2>And this is what it looked like.
Overall back to the book,</v>

1214
01:17:19.981 --> 01:17:23.610
our battalion was awarded the distinguished unit citation for its defense in the

1215
01:17:23.611 --> 01:17:25.560
crank crank helter walled.

1216
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:29.910
And a number of men in the company were awarded bronze and silver stars for

1217
01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:34.050
Gallantry,
including silver stars for Lieutenant Golfing gun and me.

1218
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.400
All those were posthumous awards.
Private First Class Cowan,

1219
01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:41.940
the light machine gunner who had performed his duty so faithfully and fearlessly

1220
01:17:41.941 --> 01:17:44.310
at the firebreak was killed in action the next day.

1221
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.640
But he received the distinguished service cross that was later changed to the

1222
01:17:47.641 --> 01:17:51.360
metal of honor and private FirstClass Lopez,

1223
01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:56.520
the m company Machine Gunner attached to k company also received the nation's

1224
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.690
highest soldier honor the metal of honor.

1225
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:04.950
So in that one defense,
these guys,

1226
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:09.390
you know to medal of honors given out unbelievably.

1227
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:14.520
Now this is also kind of crazy.
So you go through that,

1228
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.950
right?
You go through that,
you,
you lose a bunch of guys,
you barely make it out,

1229
01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:25.140
your company's overrun.
Well guess what?
It's not over.
It's not over.

1230
01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:29.700
He's guys are right back at it again.
And the next thing they're at is they are,

1231
01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:33.300
they get tasked with doing another tax so they do recover a little bit,

1232
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:37.890
but they're getting told,
okay,
you good?
You got you got,
you got assembled again.

1233
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.210
Okay,
we got more work for you.

1234
01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:46.440
One of the men of woke me at six o'clock I blinked my eyes several times and

1235
01:18:46.441 --> 01:18:47.910
tried to realize where I was.

1236
01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:52.920
The realization came and with it a feeling of revulsion that the war still went

1237
01:18:52.921 --> 01:18:54.600
on and today we would attack.

1238
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:58.590
I wanted to turn my face back toward the wall and sleep on

1239
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.020
and they're planning this attack.

1240
01:19:04.021 --> 01:19:07.590
I was too busy with the various details of the movement to think much about
fear.

1241
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.310
I tried to recall the various phases of an attack that I had learned in
training,

1242
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:14.490
but I was fully conscious of my lack of experience.
So even after all this,

1243
01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:17.910
he still doesn't feel like she's experienced enough.
I looked at my watch,

1244
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.390
it was 15 minutes until four o'clock the artillery barrage will begin in five

1245
01:19:21.391 --> 01:19:22.300
minutes l company.

1246
01:19:22.301 --> 01:19:26.340
He was moving into position now the time was drawing near Oh God.

1247
01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:31.140
Be with us on this attack so the nerves don't go away.

1248
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:36.160
When we reached the railroad track,

1249
01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.700
the first and second platoon's jockeyed in a position in the open field,

1250
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.580
they moved quickly into an approach.
March formation,

1251
01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:47.500
small explosions that sent the snow cascading in all directions and little black

1252
01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:50.950
puffs of powder and noise appeared on pattern over the field.

1253
01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:55.360
The men fell face downward into snow and rose again with a barrage lifted.

1254
01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:00.280
The Germans were firing light mortars,
one man from the second platoon lane,

1255
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:02.830
a crumpled heap and did not rise.

1256
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.950
His face was buried impassively in the snow.
I looked at him as I passed.

1257
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.580
He was a new man,
a replacement received the week before.

1258
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:17.450
He was the first man from the company who might seen killed and a mixed feeling

1259
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:23.601
of honor had pity swept over me and it mixed feeling of horror and pity swept

1260
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:28.410
over me,
but there was no time to stop and think.

1261
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:33.030
I didn't even know the man's name.
How strange is war?

1262
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:38.520
Some of us can go for days and weeks and months in war and never be killed or

1263
01:20:38.521 --> 01:20:42.210
wounded.
But another man is killed and his first taste of war.

1264
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:51.980
So as they're doing this attack,
is a little tactical advice here from,

1265
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.490
from sergeant savage.
Goddammit.
Captain Savage said,

1266
01:20:55.491 --> 01:20:58.490
you've got to stay further back.
At least get some scouts out in front.

1267
01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:02.840
His admonition reminded me that it was foolish for me to lead the column,

1268
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.780
the foolish days of leading one troops into battle.

1269
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:10.460
We're passed even though correspondence persisted in telling of daring generals

1270
01:21:10.461 --> 01:21:14.270
who preceded their troops firing from the hip or brandishing a band net.

1271
01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.970
I had no feeling of bravado,

1272
01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:19.520
but it seemed obvious that the woods were undefended.

1273
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:24.260
I dropped back to the rear of first platoon.
So leadership position tactically,

1274
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.810
if you're too far forward,
number one,
you might get killed.
Number two,

1275
01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:28.030
you might just end up in a firefight.

1276
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.150
We're now you can't move and you can't make direction.

1277
01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.230
You can't even talk on the radio cause you're,
you're in the firefight.

1278
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:39.650
Fast forward a little bit and they're in a,

1279
01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:45.020
in a big firefight,
a burp gun stuttered,
a float of fiery tracer.

1280
01:21:45.021 --> 01:21:49.010
Bullets blazed along the trees.
We fail,
fell face brown downward into the snow.

1281
01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.370
The bullets traced a fiery path two feet above the ground.

1282
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:56.810
My men did not return fire and I was glad the confusion would be terrific if

1283
01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:00.110
they opened up.
The night was quiet again.

1284
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:03.740
I rose in motion for savage,
Sahlberg and Charles to follow.

1285
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:08.840
We had taken only a few steps.
When the BURP gun opened up again,
I'm hit captain.

1286
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:12.080
I heard Charles Scream and he dropped into this snow.
I'm hit.

1287
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:17.030
I was conscious of a sudden pain in the calf of my right leg as if someone had

1288
01:22:17.031 --> 01:22:20.060
hit me with a giant club swung by powerful arms.

1289
01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.250
I realized that I too was hit and a sudden flood of fear and Gulf to me.

1290
01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.500
We were 200 yards forward of any friendly troops and 800 yards inside the woods.

1291
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.490
A momentary vision of a night spent bleeding in the frozen forest,

1292
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:38.450
swept through my mind,
a warm liquid float over my leg and into my boat.

1293
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:43.220
That would be blood I fought.
I'm hit to Charles.

1294
01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.450
I said my leg felt numb and I dropped the ground.

1295
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:48.710
The firing ceased.

1296
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.560
Charles said he was hit through the right hip and could not walk.

1297
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:55.370
Savage took the battalion radio and I designated two men to carry Charles.

1298
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:59.270
We would have to get back to third platoon.
Now I believe that could walk.

1299
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:01.610
I just do it and put weight on my wounded leg.

1300
01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:05.470
A nauseated pain swept over me and I thought I was going to faint,

1301
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.730
but I tried keeping the leg stiff and found that I could walk.

1302
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:15.910
The men around us lay flat on the snow in little bunches as if gained some

1303
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:19.300
solace through sharing their fears with each other.

1304
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.250
My brain was whirling.
Should we continue the attack?
How badly was I heard?

1305
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:28.600
How do we hit a German patrol or an outpost outpost or stumbled upon a main line

1306
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:29.443
of defense?

1307
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:33.760
I hastily decided to continue to the rear out of the line of fire of the direct

1308
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:38.200
attack upon the German position from a less respect,
restricted spot,

1309
01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.840
we moved toward the rear two men supporting trolls with his arms about his,

1310
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.980
with his arms,
about their shoulders,
a sudden burst of small arms.

1311
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:52.981
Fire came from our right rear and the woods echoed to the crack of machine gun

1312
01:23:53.441 --> 01:23:54.070
rifles.

1313
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:57.730
The fire was coming from the direction of the defensive position at the junction

1314
01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:58.420
of the firebreaks,

1315
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.950
which we had left bullets wind low over our heads and buried themselves into the

1316
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:04.420
trees and snow around us.

1317
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:09.820
My first thought that was was that k company had contacted our rear elements and

1318
01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:11.710
thinking they were Germans had opened fire.

1319
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.640
We heard battalion talking on the radio asking k company what they,

1320
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:18.370
what time they wanted to pick up their bed rules for the night.

1321
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.720
We've got no use for bedding roles.
K Company answered,
it was Lieutenant flame.

1322
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:23.920
We're in a firefight.

1323
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:29.060
Savage turned the butterfly switch on the radio and broke the conversation with

1324
01:24:29.061 --> 01:24:32.560
the distressed voice.
Lieutenant flame.
He cried,
Lieutenant flame,

1325
01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:37.450
this is I company.
You're firing at us.
This is item company.
This is item company.

1326
01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:42.070
God dammit.
I said,
we're in a firefight.
We can't use any betting roles.
Now,

1327
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:46.090
lieutenant flames savage continued.
This is savage.
You're firing it.

1328
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:49.930
I company make your men quit firing.
You're firing an I company.

1329
01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:53.980
You're shooting the hell out of item company.
The radio was silent for a moment.

1330
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.130
The hell we are.
If we're firing an eye company,

1331
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.830
then why in the hell don't you quit firing back?

1332
01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.430
I was frightened with the realization of what he had said.

1333
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.930
We were receiving fire from K company,
but they were not firing at us.

1334
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:13.470
The enemy had slipped behind us for an for some unexplainable reason.

1335
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.920
My men had not opened fire and either a directions from which the bullets came.

1336
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.530
I thank God that they had not started shooting.

1337
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:25.770
The confusion would have been trebled and I could visualize gis firing at one

1338
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:31.000
another in the darkness
as the worst case scenario.

1339
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.830
You got bad guys in between you and other good guys.
It's,

1340
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.800
it's just a horrible situation and he,
I maybe,

1341
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:41.890
maybe it's hard for civilians to understand this.
When you're in a firefight,

1342
01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:43.990
you're not hitting all your targets.

1343
01:25:43.991 --> 01:25:48.730
You're shooting suppressive fire and so if I'm shooting in one direction,

1344
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:51.040
the bullets are not stopping where the enemy is,

1345
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:52.900
they're going to keep going indefinitely,
you know?

1346
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:57.940
So if there's friendlies behind the enemy,
you can't,
you basically can't shoot.

1347
01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.500
You basically can't shoot.

1348
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:06.950
So He McDonald gets,
they continue on,

1349
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:10.610
he continues on for a while trying to get them in a secure situation,

1350
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:13.160
but eventually he has to get extracted because of,

1351
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:16.280
because of his wound and he gets back

1352
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:18.763
what he gets.

1353
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:23.000
He's now like under warm blankets and stuff and they're these in the aid
station.

1354
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.720
I shuttered at the thought of the company.
Where were they now?

1355
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:28.220
Did Brock's platoon get out?

1356
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.730
Had I done the right thing and withdrawing or should I have stayed and fought it

1357
01:26:31.731 --> 01:26:35.510
out?
It seemed that I was always running.

1358
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.040
Perhaps it was all my fault.

1359
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:41.810
There had been a brief moment of exfiltration in the aid station when someone

1360
01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:45.350
had reminded me that now I could a nice rest in the hospital.

1361
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:50.780
But now a nausea fear for the welfare of the company envelop to me.

1362
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:55.280
I felt somehow like a dessert or,

1363
01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:00.263
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1364
01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.290
<v 2>you hear you.</v>

1365
01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:06.900
We've heard plenty of stories about guys looking for the million dollar wound.

1366
01:27:06.901 --> 01:27:09.840
It's going to get them back to the states and the million dollar wounds good for

1367
01:27:09.841 --> 01:27:12.750
about three minutes.
And then,
then,
then Mcdonald's says,
Hey,

1368
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:15.690
I feel,
I feel horrible.

1369
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:21.420
He eventually recovers from the wound.
Now you'd think,
hey,

1370
01:27:21.421 --> 01:27:23.070
you know the guys but thought a bunch of fighting.

1371
01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:25.230
He recovered from his wound but he got wounded.

1372
01:27:25.231 --> 01:27:27.330
But now he's in the rear and so you know,

1373
01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:31.860
he's probably gonna get whatever extracted,
maybe move to states,
maybe,
you know,

1374
01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.680
give him a nice cushy job.
No,
not happening.

1375
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:38.220
They don't give him I company back cause I company now as a new company

1376
01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:41.370
commander,
they give them a company G.
Hmm.

1377
01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:46.140
So now he's in company Ge and what are they doing?

1378
01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:50.400
Are they in the rear somewhere relaxing?
No,
it's attack time there going forward.

1379
01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.860
So here we go.
We were back to the book.

1380
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:58.790
We would attack the next morning at four 45 someone awakened me at three 30 the

1381
01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:01.250
next morning it was cold in the room and I shivered.

1382
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:02.780
As I climbed from my sleeping bag,

1383
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:06.200
my mind was doled with sleep and I wanted to climb back into the warm sleeping

1384
01:28:06.201 --> 01:28:07.700
bag and sleep on and on.

1385
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:11.600
I wanted to scream to hell with the war and go back to sleep.

1386
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.570
The sudden jolt of awakening was like emerging,
emerging from a wonderful,

1387
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:21.260
peaceful world into a world of forbidding reality.

1388
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:26.990
There'll be mad hurt today,
perhaps killed men from my own company.

1389
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.540
It could be me that seemed remote and impossible,

1390
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:37.670
but it did not remove by fear for the others.
There were many responsibilities.

1391
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.910
Had I given the platoon leaders all the information they would need.

1392
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:45.170
How was my attack plan?
Was there some important detail I'd forgotten?

1393
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.850
Would Haim back be defended?

1394
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.870
Would our attack be discovered as we crossed the flat open field towards the

1395
01:28:50.871 --> 01:28:53.270
town?
Oh God,
if we could,

1396
01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:56.690
but rush from the house into the attack without thinking again,

1397
01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:03.180
it was the waiting and the thinking and wondering that got you

1398
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:08.730
talked about that before.
That fear that you're feeling.

1399
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.230
It's the waiting.
It's the hesitation and he's saying,
Hey,

1400
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:14.970
if we could just go from this house that I'm sitting in right now,

1401
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.880
right into the attack.
That's what he'd prefer to do,

1402
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.763
<v 1>but he can't</v>

1403
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.400
<v 2>and now they're moving to the attack is,
is,</v>

1404
01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:32.630
is full on now the last man in the Ford positions crossed the crest of the small

1405
01:29:32.631 --> 01:29:36.710
hill.
They should be almost inside.
The first house is a Bendorf.
Now I thought,

1406
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:41.060
I hope that the CP group and assump can trail running across the crest of the

1407
01:29:41.061 --> 01:29:43.730
hill and told junior to ask for reports from the assault platoon.

1408
01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.170
Suddenly a tank fire from somewhere to a front and a big show,

1409
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:51.200
a shell word over low over our heads and machine gun.

1410
01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:56.180
Chattered around of tank fire.
Rip from the limb,
from a tree above our head.

1411
01:29:56.630 --> 01:30:00.590
A burp gun said Burp,
burp.
There was no question.

1412
01:30:00.591 --> 01:30:04.580
Now we had hit their defenses,
the Germans to had techs.

1413
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.970
I was trembling slightly from the excitement,

1414
01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:13.050
but I was not as deathly afraid as I had once been in a pillbox positions.

1415
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:18.530
The opinion often expressed amongst some gis that ev after any man was wounded

1416
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:23.760
once he was never any good in combat.
Again,
did not hold true.

1417
01:30:23.761 --> 01:30:27.420
In my case,
I was more calm than ever before,

1418
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.390
but I was also more cautious.

1419
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.000
Now they proceed with that attack in it again.
Obviously

1420
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:44.670
there's this book is just filled with tactical situation after tactical

1421
01:30:44.671 --> 01:30:47.760
situation,
after lesson learned,
after lesson learned after tackle situation,

1422
01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.960
and I'm not reading the entire book right now.
Uh,

1423
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:57.390
but that is why you get the book so that you can get all this information from

1424
01:30:57.391 --> 01:31:01.140
it.
I can't give it all to you on a podcast.
You have to read it.

1425
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:05.190
But fast forwarding through that assault,

1426
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:07.590
back to the book,

1427
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:11.940
I stopped longer at the house where the men from the squad of the sergeant who

1428
01:31:11.941 --> 01:31:13.770
had been killed.
We're preparing for the night.

1429
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:17.250
I not knowing the sergeant personally,
but to these men,

1430
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:21.990
he was an important character in the little war that revolved around themselves.

1431
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.790
There was an undertone of sadness as they talked,
but there was no bitterness.

1432
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:31.110
The sergeant had died,
like any one of them might die at any time.

1433
01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:36.860
There was a war on,
you know,
and what I like about that is he points out that,

1434
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:38.870
<v 1>okay,</v>

1435
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:41.990
<v 2>you know,
from his perspective,
all this stuff is going on.</v>

1436
01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:46.550
He realizes that these guys,
that's the whole world to them,
right?

1437
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:47.660
That sergeant that was killed,

1438
01:31:47.661 --> 01:31:52.661
that's their guy and their war is everything to them.

1439
01:31:53.211 --> 01:31:54.620
And it's just like when you meet people,
you know,

1440
01:31:54.621 --> 01:31:57.260
if you're in a business and you go and meet someone on the front lines,

1441
01:31:57.261 --> 01:31:59.350
like they don't care.
I'm not saying they don't care,

1442
01:31:59.351 --> 01:32:03.460
but they've got their whole world in what they're doing.

1443
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:06.970
So you gotta be cognizant of that.

1444
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.120
You got to understand that and you got to keep that perspective.

1445
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:15.370
When you go out and talk to people,
you can't be like,
oh,
you know,
hey,

1446
01:32:15.371 --> 01:32:16.720
there's a lot of people that got killed today.
No,

1447
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:20.290
it doesn't matter to these guys.
The only one guy that matters to these guys

1448
01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.313
<v 1>now,</v>

1449
01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:25.421
<v 2>like I said,</v>

1450
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:30.421
this book is covers a ton of different combat and they go while he's in charge

1451
01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:35.440
of g company,
they go through all these different towns.

1452
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:39.490
I mean they go through the town of hom breasts into across the Vesta river and

1453
01:32:39.491 --> 01:32:42.970
they go through El House and they go through Var Lawson and they go through

1454
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:48.010
varmints in and they go through mangere housing and geese smart and they're

1455
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:52.540
going just from,
from city to city.
They're going very quickly and the fighting,

1456
01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:57.850
it's becoming a little easier as they're going the defenses and you know,

1457
01:32:57.851 --> 01:33:02.320
the Germans are running out of,
out of people they're running out of um,

1458
01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.650
you know,
supplies as well.
So the fight is getting easier,

1459
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.350
but they're still meeting some hardcore,

1460
01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.690
some hardcore defenders.

1461
01:33:10.691 --> 01:33:15.210
And one of the things that's happened that's really horrible is the,

1462
01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:15.760
the,

1463
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.470
the Germans now are using anti aircraft weapons against the ground troops.

1464
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:25.090
So anti aircraft weapons make flack that goal for the year and they explode and

1465
01:33:25.091 --> 01:33:29.390
they are now using those against the ground troops.
And there's a,

1466
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:34.360
it just the way that these browns are coming in and exploding above them.

1467
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:37.570
It's a nightmare and it's really hard for them to fight.

1468
01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:40.630
So they've got some good efforts going on to go and take out these,

1469
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:44.680
these anti aircraft weapons and one of the,

1470
01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:48.580
one of the anti or one of the groups of anti aircraft weapons that they take
out,

1471
01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:50.553
they finally get,

1472
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:53.410
they finally take out these anti aircraft weapons through an assault.

1473
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.730
And when they get done with the assault,

1474
01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.850
Mcdonald comes up on the position and here we go.

1475
01:33:57.851 --> 01:34:01.330
Back to book Sergeant Patents said the Germans manning the position in the
field,

1476
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:06.190
which held them up were bastards.
They had to AA guns.

1477
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.470
He said some of them wanted to surrender,

1478
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.200
but every time a crowd would jump out of his hole to surrender,

1479
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:16.290
some other crowd sob would shoot him right in the back counting the ones they

1480
01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:18.280
killed.
And the ones we got to.

1481
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:23.170
There's 19 dead patent had one man slightly wounded in the arm,

1482
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.580
but he had already walked back to guys more to,
to the aid station.

1483
01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:33.900
My weapons platoon and platoon of heavy machine guns from h company arrived from

1484
01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.760
there supporting position outside guys.
Mark Sargent Mark Mitchell was killed.

1485
01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.460
One of the sergeant from the heavy machine gun told me,

1486
01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:47.700
I could not think of for a moment who sergeant Mitchell was that I remembered.

1487
01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.440
He was the pleasant perennial,

1488
01:34:49.441 --> 01:34:52.920
cheerful tech sergeant and command of the platoon who was to receive as

1489
01:34:52.921 --> 01:34:55.710
commission as a second lieutenant in a few days

1490
01:34:57.570 --> 01:34:58.120
and anti

1491
01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.860
<v 1>aircraft gun fired from the woods to the south.</v>

1492
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.950
The sergeant continued and Sergeant Mitchell got hit.

1493
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.720
He was unconscious and the aid man took him back to one of the tds to give them

1494
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:12.500
first aid.
Td is a tank destroyer.
It's like another tech,

1495
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:15.980
but they're specifically meant to fight other texts.

1496
01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:21.940
The aircraft gun fired again and the God TD backed up ran right over Sergeant

1497
01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.293
Mitchell.

1498
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.120
<v 2>So that's uh,
another thing that</v>

1499
01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.770
you have to train for is when you're working with armor where you were working

1500
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.690
at the tanks,
they don't know what's going on around them.

1501
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.790
They don't have like a rear view backup cameras.

1502
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.640
And so if you get in the way of a tank,
it's gonna run you over.

1503
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:44.390
And so that's something that we,
we,
we were lucky when we,

1504
01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.850
before we went on deployment,
we'd go work with tanks little bit.

1505
01:35:46.851 --> 01:35:49.670
And that's where we'd learned that lesson because you might think all take cover

1506
01:35:49.671 --> 01:35:51.500
behind this tank,
that tank could move at any moment.

1507
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:55.880
So you gotta be very careful of that young troopers out there.

1508
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:58.520
If you don't work with tanks often stay out of their way.

1509
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:03.320
Here's a,

1510
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.400
as they're continuing to press through and press through and press through from

1511
01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:10.790
village to village town to town again,
they're moving pretty rapidly.
Now

1512
01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.341
back to the book,

1513
01:36:13.341 --> 01:36:17.840
Colonel Smith rolled up beside me beside my tank and his jeep.

1514
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:22.280
Nice going Mac.
You said you're doing a really swell job.
Just keep them moving.

1515
01:36:22.281 --> 01:36:26.270
The faster the better.
Don't thank me colonel.
I said,

1516
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:30.110
meaning it and disgusted that it sounded melodramatic.

1517
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:35.840
Thank Lieutenant Bagby and the first platoon,
I'm just tagging along.

1518
01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:42.160
So you got a leader there that's not looking to grab all the credit himself but

1519
01:36:42.741 --> 01:36:47.270
give it to his troops.
Now,
like I said,
both the fighting

1520
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:53.610
continues to get easier and easier and they're starting to see,
you know,

1521
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.880
people surrender.

1522
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:59.000
They're also starting to see like young kids because you're starting to see the

1523
01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:02.330
Hitler youth that are being recruited.
They're 13 years old,
14 years old.

1524
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:03.380
Kids that are surrendering,

1525
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.630
they fight through core Beth and low pittson.

1526
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:12.840
Craig's dwarf,
and I apologize for my lack of German,
um,

1527
01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.170
speaking capability,

1528
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.130
but they get,

1529
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:25.810
they get into one town and one of the lieutenant's Lieutenant Whitman kind of

1530
01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:31.241
pushes into the town with a small team and he's in there,

1531
01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.520
he's in one of the buildings and all of a sudden,
like a massive group of,

1532
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:39.230
of German soldiers comes in and they're kind of stuck there.
So here we go.

1533
01:37:39.231 --> 01:37:40.064
Back to the book.

1534
01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:44.030
Lieutenant Whitman called suddenly over the radio and I knew by the excitement

1535
01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:46.580
in his voice that something had either happened or what's about to happen.

1536
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:48.920
You better get somebody else up here to help us out.

1537
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:52.490
Sounds like a whole regimen of crowds coming are common this way up the highway.

1538
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.360
So this,
he's trying to figure out what's happening.

1539
01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:02.700
And then the radio sputtered hello,
g g six this is wit.

1540
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:06.990
So g six is the call sign for Mcdonald's.
Hello g six this is whit.

1541
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.090
For God's sake.
Get someone up here to help.

1542
01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:11.220
There's Germans all over the goddamn place.

1543
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.690
I grasped the speaker from West Miller's outstretched hand wit.
This is Mac.

1544
01:38:15.691 --> 01:38:19.740
I said they caught us halfway across the open field.
The men have taken off.

1545
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:23.460
I'll have to go back and get them to come up over for God's sake.

1546
01:38:23.461 --> 01:38:27.930
Get us up some help quick.
We're completely surrounded Roger out.

1547
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.040
So now Whitman's in one of these buildings completely surrounded.

1548
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.880
This continues on.
The battalion radio was silent.

1549
01:38:36.881 --> 01:38:40.620
I called for Lieutenant Whitman and his voice came through weekly as though he

1550
01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:45.540
were speaking in a stage whisper back on the left side of the highway.

1551
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:50.280
He said,
in a house,
I've got nine men with me.
Germans are running all around,

1552
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:51.390
all over the place.

1553
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.720
I lost track of all the other men heard some of them surrendering,

1554
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:58.590
get us some help quick or they'll find out where we are when they start

1555
01:38:58.591 --> 01:38:59.760
searching the houses.

1556
01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:05.040
So Mcdonald tries to okay calls battalion,
Hey,
we needed some help.

1557
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.160
We need some help here.
No,
you don't get any help.

1558
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.440
And so he tells Whitman or Whitman,

1559
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:12.180
here's one of the radio that he's not going to get any help.

1560
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:15.120
He's not getting any support and this is what Whitman says,

1561
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:19.350
there's only one thing to do.
Then he continued.
If we have to wait that long,

1562
01:39:19.351 --> 01:39:20.460
they're sure to find us.

1563
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:24.630
We'll go down to the cellar and you start plastering us with artillery fire.

1564
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:27.270
We're inside in.
The crowds are out in the open.

1565
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.790
We'll help you direct fire from here.

1566
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.360
I knew his decision called for a generous amount of fortitude,

1567
01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:35.790
even though he would be partially protected in the cellar.

1568
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.810
Lieutenant reads set up as artillery radio and artillery gave us a priority

1569
01:39:39.811 --> 01:39:44.310
mission.
Sergeant Barnes arrived with his platoon and the machine gun section.

1570
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.910
I sent them into position along with a heavy a platoon of heavy machine guns

1571
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:51.060
from age company to hell with the ammunition.
I said,

1572
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:54.720
we'll get more from somewhere.
Spray the hell out of the whole area.

1573
01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:58.710
The machine guns opened up and artillery whistled overhead thundering into the

1574
01:39:58.711 --> 01:40:02.580
open field,
dangerously close to the paling fence.
At the end of the garden,

1575
01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:06.150
300 short lieutenant reedy yelled and do his radio.
300 short,

1576
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.390
the artillery whistled overhead again.

1577
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.640
Employment into the houses beyond us with a terrific roar.

1578
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.720
Orange flames let the darkness like flashes of lightning that's right on top of

1579
01:40:15.721 --> 01:40:18.810
us.
Co Whitman cried,
delighted,
let her go again.

1580
01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.690
We can hear Germans running all over the place outside.

1581
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:25.980
Lieutenant read called for barrage after barrage and the big shells roared into

1582
01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:26.814
the objective.

1583
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:30.720
The Germans made feeble efforts at retaliation with their machine guns,

1584
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:34.440
but the shots died away in the explosion of the big artillery shells.

1585
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.220
A direct hit transformed a house into a massive roaring flames.

1586
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:42.810
Is that your house?
I asked Whitman half fearfully.
No,
seems to be on our left.

1587
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:45.510
He answered,
gave us another volley in the same place.

1588
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:48.150
Sounds like a tank or some kind of armored car pulled up,

1589
01:40:48.610 --> 01:40:52.470
but 10 of read called for a repeat volley that hit just right.

1590
01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:55.630
Women said his voice,
scarcely audible over the radio.

1591
01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:59.320
I wondered what had happened to his radio and was afraid that perhaps the

1592
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:02.800
batteries were going dead and we would lose our only means of communication.

1593
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.240
I can't talk loud.
He said,

1594
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.870
I've got 15 crowd prisoners down here in the cellar with me and some Germans

1595
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:11.050
have come in upstairs.
We can hear them walking around.

1596
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:14.620
If one of these prisoners so much as opens his mouth,
I'll plug him.

1597
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:17.880
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1598
01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:22.530
<v 2>so there's another situation where you're calling in artillery to your position.</v>

1599
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:24.630
You just happened to be in the seller of a house.

1600
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:33.420
Crazy.
Here,
they're,

1601
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:38.790
they're doing a little assault and it's set up like a frontal assault,

1602
01:41:40.011 --> 01:41:41.780
but he wants to make a little adjustment here.

1603
01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:47.120
The obvious solution to being unable to advance frontally against the unseen

1604
01:41:47.121 --> 01:41:49.940
enemy was to send a flanking platoon around to the right,

1605
01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.970
having them enter the woods and come out,

1606
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:55.430
come in on the defenders from the flank and rear.

1607
01:41:55.670 --> 01:41:59.180
But I balked at the thought of sending one platoon such a great distance when

1608
01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:02.810
for all I knew the woods beyond the canals might be thick with enemy.

1609
01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:08.330
I decided to cover our front with artillery and have two platoons try to advance

1610
01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:09.860
frontally and notified.

1611
01:42:09.861 --> 01:42:13.130
Second and third platoon is to be ready to move forward under cover of artillery

1612
01:42:13.131 --> 01:42:13.964
barrage.

1613
01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.320
But the enemy came suddenly delight when the rifleman rose to go forward and

1614
01:42:18.321 --> 01:42:21.860
repulsed three efforts to advance.
So he wants to flank,

1615
01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:27.080
but he's weighing it in his head.
The the flanking positions through the woods.

1616
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.071
In order to flank,

1617
01:42:28.071 --> 01:42:30.920
he needs to put his guys through the woods through an area he doesn't know,

1618
01:42:30.921 --> 01:42:33.110
doesn't know how well it's defended.
So he says,
you know what?

1619
01:42:33.111 --> 01:42:35.090
Instead of doing a flank,
which is what I want to do,

1620
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.420
I'm just going to put down some artillery fire and we're going to do a frontal

1621
01:42:38.421 --> 01:42:42.530
assault.
They get shut down and eventually he does make the decision.

1622
01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:45.590
You know what the bet the decision now becomes,
okay,

1623
01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.990
frontal assault is not going to work.
Now I'm going to have to flank.

1624
01:42:47.991 --> 01:42:49.520
He goes back to that flank.

1625
01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:53.690
I sent Whitman with a spare 300 radio in order to across the canal.

1626
01:42:53.691 --> 01:42:55.400
He moved out quickly and far to the right.

1627
01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:58.610
I could see as men emerged from the woods and weight across the first canal,

1628
01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:00.920
the water coming to the next of the shorter men.

1629
01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:06.260
My fear of a larger enemy force in the woods overcame my fear for safety of our

1630
01:43:06.261 --> 01:43:10.070
left flank and I ordered lieutenant bag beets platoon to follow the flanking

1631
01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:10.904
force.

1632
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.860
We could see the little dots that were Whitman's man emerged from the woodline

1633
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:18.770
and double time towards the garden.
Lieutenant reads stopped the artillery fire.

1634
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:23.420
The third platoon to my front began to advance and I knew it was only a matter

1635
01:43:23.421 --> 01:43:25.580
of minutes until the objective would be ours.

1636
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:31.270
I singled the CP group and we moved to the railroad tracks on the and on toward

1637
01:43:32.241 --> 01:43:33.360
the bridge pass.

1638
01:43:33.361 --> 01:43:36.590
Three wounded Germans line helplessly in the goalie beside the tracks were

1639
01:43:36.591 --> 01:43:41.150
Barnes mended evidently shopped them earlier in the day.
The automatic,
the enemy,

1640
01:43:41.151 --> 01:43:44.150
automatic weapons suddenly opened up again at the third platoon,

1641
01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:48.980
but the men were close enough now to pick up the bush from which it was firing.

1642
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:53.060
They fired round after round into the clump of bushes and the weapon was silent.

1643
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.290
So eventually he gets his flake on and that's what,

1644
01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:01.640
that's what wins the day.
Now again,

1645
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.160
a lot is covered as they do this city by city.
Some of villages,

1646
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.710
some of the towns that they enter,
there's no resistance.

1647
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:13.610
Some of them there is massive resistance.
They pushed through it,

1648
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:18.020
they fight through it,
lots of lessons learned,
lots of incredible heroics,

1649
01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.930
and eventually they pushed through and they make it all the way into

1650
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:25.340
Czechoslovakia.

1651
01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.900
And we're now approaching the end,

1652
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:32.720
not only for Mcdonald,

1653
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:37.280
but at the end for the war as they go into liberate.

1654
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.980
Check is the you going back to the book,

1655
01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:45.340
our column continued forward and my company shifted to the lead position on the

1656
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:49.910
tanks I wrote behind the lead tank in the artillery jeep.

1657
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.780
The little country towns changed into industrial small industrial towns and we

1658
01:44:56.211 --> 01:44:58.220
began to notice a scattering of red,

1659
01:44:58.430 --> 01:45:03.430
white and Blue Czechoslovakia and flags in towns in place of the usual white

1660
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:05.090
flag of surrender.

1661
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:10.460
Civilians waved at US guardedly from behind closed windows.

1662
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.080
The scattering of check flags should have warned us,

1663
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:20.330
but we were totally unprepared for the mad celebration which greeted us in the

1664
01:45:20.331 --> 01:45:21.164
next town.

1665
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:26.840
We had suddenly crossed from the Sudeten land into Czechoslovakia proper.

1666
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:31.310
The houses were a riot of color with red,
white,
and blue,

1667
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.720
Czechoslovakia and flags.

1668
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:37.610
Civilians line the streets 10 deep cheering and waving their flags as if their

1669
01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:38.750
lives depended on it.

1670
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.490
Our column was forced to slow down and the happy civilians pushed into the

1671
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:46.250
street and showered us with flowers and cakes and cookies.

1672
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:49.940
One old woman throws to bake chicken to our jeep.

1673
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.760
Another old woman's stood behind the road beside the road,

1674
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:56.690
waving both hands in the air,
tears streaming down her wrinkled cheeks.

1675
01:45:57.650 --> 01:45:59.810
Little children were wild with joy.

1676
01:45:59.930 --> 01:46:04.010
Some of them had never known anything but six years of Nazi occupation,

1677
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:05.410
<v 1>okay?</v>

1678
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:06.970
<v 2>The young men wore red,
white,</v>

1679
01:46:06.971 --> 01:46:11.710
and blue arm bands and carry German weapons are part of the underground movement

1680
01:46:11.711 --> 01:46:12.544
that was now,

1681
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.750
it was even now struggling against superior German forces in the capital city of

1682
01:46:16.751 --> 01:46:17.584
Prague.

1683
01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:23.430
Everyone was screaming the check words Nazar Nazar and we wondered what they

1684
01:46:23.981 --> 01:46:28.930
meant.
I looked up and down the column at the soldiers and the company,

1685
01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:33.970
brilliant smiles to read their faces and they waved cheerfully at the shouting

1686
01:46:33.971 --> 01:46:36.340
crowds as if they had just won an election campaign.

1687
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:41.550
And this was a personal triumph hardened stubble faced bedrooms had on shame,

1688
01:46:42.891 --> 01:46:44.260
tears in their eyes.

1689
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:49.410
The unleashed joy of these oppressed people knew no bounds,

1690
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.150
and it was too much for us.

1691
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:52.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1692
01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:57.900
<v 2>Suddenly I began to realize what no one thus far had been able in the war to put</v>

1693
01:46:59.621 --> 01:47:03.250
into words what we were fighting for

1694
01:47:05.230 --> 01:47:09.220
and I found a lump in my throat,
which I could not swallow.

1695
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:17.743
Freedom.

1696
01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:18.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1697
01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.850
<v 2>Freedom.
Something we take for granted.</v>

1698
01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:27.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.650
<v 2>Back to the book,
the news came by radio,
not the war was over.</v>

1700
01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.700
There was no defining our joy.

1701
01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:42.460
Sergeant Quinn brought out a treasured keg of Cognac.

1702
01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:47.170
The next day,
May 8th would be v e day.

1703
01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:51.100
The town's people held a dance for us.

1704
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:54.700
The next night in the town guesthouse,

1705
01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:59.850
one of the artillery men was escorting a young girl whom he had met the night

1706
01:48:00.041 --> 01:48:03.760
before and she told him that her friend leap

1707
01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:07.860
would like very much to attend with the captain.

1708
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.550
The small guest house was crowded with dancers and the older men and women sat

1709
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:17.790
with the young children at tables around the sides of the room.

1710
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:23.190
Male dancers,
the male dancers were predominantly Gis,

1711
01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:27.420
but if you chuck check young men were present.

1712
01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.760
The Orchestra reminded me of the circus bands in the u s as they played the

1713
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:34.620
waltz,
the Polk us.

1714
01:48:35.730 --> 01:48:40.260
The checks would join it off and to sing the songs enthusiastically.

1715
01:48:40.261 --> 01:48:41.340
Even as they danced

1716
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:45.790
at the insistence of the band leader leap,

1717
01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:50.940
a grantas agreed to sing and the new notes came forth in a clear sparkling

1718
01:48:51.971 --> 01:48:56.750
soprano.
When she had finished,
she made a brief speech,

1719
01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:00.290
which the Slavic speaking soldier told me,

1720
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:04.220
said that the people would now sing their national anthem.

1721
01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:10.400
He would be the first time they had sung it in public.
In six years,

1722
01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:16.260
the people rose as one and every boy,
girl,

1723
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:21.350
man and woman join in the singing with clear lusty voices that made goose

1724
01:49:23.431 --> 01:49:25.650
pimples rise on my arms.

1725
01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1726
01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.630
<v 2>Some of the older people cried and it was all I could do to keep the tears from</v>

1727
01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:35.320
my eyes.
When it was over,

1728
01:49:35.650 --> 01:49:38.920
the soldiers began to cry.
Speech,
speech,

1729
01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:41.290
and the civilians caught on and applauded.

1730
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:44.710
I stood up on a chair in the center of the room trying to think of something to

1731
01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.720
say or mumbled,

1732
01:49:46.721 --> 01:49:50.560
a few of sincere gratitude for the wonderful reception these wonderful people

1733
01:49:50.561 --> 01:49:55.561
had given us and a soldier translated for leap that she told the people what I

1734
01:49:57.581 --> 01:50:00.820
had said.
They applauded warmly.

1735
01:50:01.770 --> 01:50:02.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1736
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:06.100
<v 2>Leib and I walked outside into the cool night air in the distance.</v>

1737
01:50:06.101 --> 01:50:09.970
We could see fireworks exploding in the air above Pilsen and we knew that they

1738
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:12.220
too are celebrating v e day.

1739
01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:14.463
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.170
<v 2>I looked around me and saw light streaming from the windows and army vehicles</v>

1741
01:50:19.171 --> 01:50:22.890
driving on the highway with their headlights on and I heard the gay music and

1742
01:50:22.891 --> 01:50:24.720
laughter from the dance in the background.

1743
01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:29.520
I suddenly realized that I could light a cigarette once again in the open and

1744
01:50:29.521 --> 01:50:33.480
not be afraid of drawing enemy fire.
And I did

1745
01:50:34.730 --> 01:50:35.400
<v 1>okay.</v>

1746
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:36.600
<v 2>It was a simple thing,</v>

1747
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:41.870
but it gave me a wonderful feeling that life was worth living again.

1748
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:50.790
I put my arm or about leaves waste and she pointed to the multicolored fireworks

1749
01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:53.650
display and laughed.
Dole,
Bree,
Doh,
Bri.

1750
01:50:54.970 --> 01:50:59.650
I had learned that debris was good and I said,

1751
01:51:00.230 --> 01:51:02.140
don't worry,
don't worry.

1752
01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:10.960
I looked away in the distance and I seem to see the faces of the men from

1753
01:51:11.511 --> 01:51:16.511
companies I and g who could not see this great day because they had died to

1754
01:51:17.091 --> 01:51:21.460
obtain it
and then their faces were gone.

1755
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:27.010
And I saw the mud and ice and snow of the secret Siegfried line.

1756
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:31.500
Then the exploding fireworks became bursting artillery shells and the are dense

1757
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:36.190
and bursting flack at be pets.
But then,

1758
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:37.590
<v 1>okay,</v>

1759
01:51:37.590 --> 01:51:42.590
<v 2>the terror was gone and I saw two companies of men marching by and there was I</v>

1760
01:51:43.921 --> 01:51:47.310
company and Ge Company,
tired,
dirty,

1761
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:52.550
weary but with smiling faces and somehow the faces of the men who had been

1762
01:51:54.481 --> 01:51:54.961
killed.

1763
01:51:54.961 --> 01:51:59.961
We're in the background smiling and waving bravely to those who marched on

1764
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:08.310
leave looked up at me as if to ask what I was thinking and I said,

1765
01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:10.290
don't worry,
dope,
worry

1766
01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:16.810
and lead squeezed my hand and laughed.
Yes.

1767
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:19.203
Dope.
Bri,

1768
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:24.640
that is the end of my story.

1769
01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:30.860
Or perhaps you would like to know that my company moved on five miles north of

1770
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:34.530
Pilsen to trim Olsa.

1771
01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.900
And there we met another group of dirty,

1772
01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:41.800
tired infantry men who called themselves Russians.

1773
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:44.383
A month later,

1774
01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:49.600
we were on a big boat at [inaudible] and on July 20th,

1775
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:55.870
1945 we sailed into New York harbor and received the cheers of a grateful

1776
01:52:56.210 --> 01:53:01.210
America and saw tall lady with a torch that brought tears to our eyes.

1777
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:07.900
The characters in my story,

1778
01:53:07.901 --> 01:53:12.100
we're destined to be sent to help to finish on another war.

1779
01:53:12.190 --> 01:53:16.330
And another part of the world where another group of American infantry men were

1780
01:53:16.331 --> 01:53:18.850
fighting a dirty,
miserable war.

1781
01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:25.240
But a miracle happened and the other war came to an end.

1782
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:34.070
Most of my characters are wearing civilian clothes again now,

1783
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.910
but I know that wherever they are,

1784
01:53:39.330 --> 01:53:44.330
they will have a hollow place in their hearts for those who will not be changing

1785
01:53:44.491 --> 01:53:47.550
into civilian clothes again,
ever

1786
01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:55.300
those Gis who that others may live

1787
01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:58.050
or cut down

1788
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:03.060
in a harvest for the devil.

1789
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:11.203
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1790
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:18.770
And that
is

1791
01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:24.100
<v 2>how this book wraps up.
Incredible book again.</v>

1792
01:54:24.101 --> 01:54:25.660
It's called company commander.

1793
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:28.263
<v 1>Bye</v>

1794
01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:32.710
<v 2>Charles B.
MacDonald and</v>

1795
01:54:37.130 --> 01:54:41.480
gold,
though that is the end of this book.

1796
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:48.190
Let it not be the end of our memory

1797
01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:56.170
and let us not forget these lessons and let us not forget the tyranny

1798
01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:04.290
and the oppression that was forced on to millions and millions of people

1799
01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.960
and let us not forget the millions and millions and millions of innocent people

1800
01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.550
murdered,
butchered,
frozen,

1801
01:55:20.610 --> 01:55:24.960
starved,
wasted,

1802
01:55:28.190 --> 01:55:30.980
wasted human lives

1803
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:36.770
to satisfy the twisted ego of a few.

1804
01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:46.530
<v 0>And let us never forget these men.</v>

1805
01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:50.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1806
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:55.790
<v 0>That fought hunger and fatigue and fear</v>

1807
01:55:59.330 --> 01:56:03.170
to face and to fight evil.

1808
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.153
Let us not

1809
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:15.060
forget those that sacrificed their youth and their health

1810
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:20.100
for the youth and the health of others.

1811
01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:32.370
They finally let us never ever forget those men and women

1812
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:39.860
who were cut down in this harvest for the devil to give other human beings the

1813
01:56:43.681 --> 01:56:46.650
most precious gift in the world.

1814
01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:52.043
Freedom.

1815
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.333
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1816
01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.190
<v 0>let us never forget them</v>

1817
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:04.300
or this gift

1818
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:10.333
freedom.

1819
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:17.700
Hey,
do I think that's

1820
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:25.520
all I've got for tonight?
Echo.
Charles,

1821
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:29.990
if you want to maybe take a minute here and explain,

1822
01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.120
give me a chance to decompress over here and maybe you can explain in the

1823
01:57:35.121 --> 01:57:40.121
meantime if somebody wants to support this particular podcast.

1824
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:44.300
Sure.
How they could do that.
It's crazy.
These books that don't

1825
01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:49.860
<v 3>like the effect of any,
obviously you didn't read the whole book,
but</v>

1826
01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:51.360
<v 1>okay.</v>

1827
01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.210
<v 3>Just what you read.
Like the way it affects you,
you know,</v>

1828
01:57:54.211 --> 01:57:58.200
it takes you there and just even like at the end when it's like the war was
over,

1829
01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:01.350
you feel all your like,
oh my gosh,
thank God that's over kind of thing.

1830
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:04.740
You have that feeling and it just never wears off.
It's crazy.

1831
01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.380
<v 0>Yeah.
Well I've said before,
you know when we,</v>

1832
01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:13.381
when we started and I wasn't sure if I would have enough books,

1833
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:18.010
right?
Yeah.
But we're going to have enough books.

1834
01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:22.090
Every single one of these stories is,

1835
01:58:22.150 --> 01:58:26.440
is its own incredible story.
And,
and,
and because what we just talked about,

1836
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:29.800
how you get this,
this war,

1837
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:34.030
World War Two for this guy was bisque here.
But you know,

1838
01:58:34.031 --> 01:58:36.610
you get someone that's in the Pacific and you take one.

1839
01:58:36.611 --> 01:58:40.570
If you were to take one of his platoon commanders,
it would be that war.

1840
01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:45.550
It's little tiny human experiences that are so incredible.

1841
01:58:45.610 --> 01:58:49.690
And each one of them is as just as incredible as the next one is just as

1842
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:53.940
incredible as the previous one.
And that's why you just,
I,

1843
01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:55.840
I just don't know if we'll ever get to them all.

1844
01:58:55.930 --> 01:59:00.370
And the other thing is that we have to remember is a tiny,
tiny,
tiny,

1845
01:59:00.371 --> 01:59:02.830
minuscule percentage of these people actually wrote a book.

1846
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:05.710
Most of these stories,
they just,

1847
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.650
they just happened to him and we don't know about him.
Yeah.
So crazy.

1848
01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:14.500
And each one is like,

1849
01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:17.080
it's so unique in their little perspective,

1850
01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:21.550
but at the same time it has so many similarities,
you know,
and it all sorta like,

1851
01:59:21.730 --> 01:59:24.040
as you gather,
you know,
one story,
two stories,
all these different,

1852
01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:28.270
it starts to tell this overall tail,
you know,
and this is the tale of,

1853
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:31.690
of humans.
It's a tale of human nature.
It's a tale of,

1854
01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:34.360
and it's the tale of overcoming,
right?
Yeah.

1855
01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.300
I mean just the things that these guys that were coming to take all these
things,

1856
01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:43.420
you know,
I've been,
I've been in some miserable places right in my time,
right?

1857
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:45.670
I mean,
every,
basically everybody has,

1858
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:49.630
you've been at some hard places in your life.
And then these guys,

1859
01:59:49.631 --> 01:59:52.630
they do that and they live that way.

1860
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:56.170
And then they get attacked and then they lose guys and they get wounded and then

1861
01:59:56.190 --> 01:59:58.390
they'd go right back out.
Right back on to the front.

1862
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:02.170
The limits of human nature or the limits of human,

1863
02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.140
the capacity of human beings to overcome

1864
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:10.330
obstacles is,
is,
is unbelievable.

1865
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:12.510
And if there's nothing else,
like I,

1866
02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.610
I know not everyone goes to war and not everyone should go to war.

1867
02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:17.710
And I don't want anyone to go to warf can help it.

1868
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:22.750
But at least we learn that whatever we're coming up against,
man,

1869
02:00:22.751 --> 02:00:23.740
we can deal with it.

1870
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:28.300
We can do so much more and be so much more uncomfortable and push yourself so

1871
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:30.400
much harder.
And you know,
that was one thing and I didn't,

1872
02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:33.220
I didn't do a good job today of portraying it,

1873
02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.210
but he's getting pushed.
And a lot of these situations,

1874
02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:39.100
I mean you can kind of hear it when he's getting woken up.

1875
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:43.150
Every time he wakes up his and his initial reaction is,
isn't cool.

1876
02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.750
I get to go fight now.
No.
His initial reaction every single time is like,

1877
02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.110
I want to go back to bed.
I want the war to be over.
I want to hide.
I want it.

1878
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.700
That's his reaction every single time.

1879
02:00:51.850 --> 02:00:55.480
And yet every single time he gets up and he does his job,

1880
02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:59.140
he does his duty and he does what he has to do.
That's,
that's the human spirit,

1881
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:01.720
right?
That's the thing that we should all capture.

1882
02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:05.200
I mean we have a hard time getting out of bed because it's going to be a tough

1883
02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:08.320
workout or cause we're gonna have a hard day at the Avinu.

1884
02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:11.140
We have the second week we're,
we're,
we're pathetic.

1885
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.930
We're pathetic compared to these guys that are,
oh it's,

1886
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:17.470
you know what's waking you up?
Mortar fire,
no machine gun,

1887
02:01:17.471 --> 02:01:21.790
fire people screaming that they're being overrun.
That's your wake up call.

1888
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:25.630
I think we can get out of bed in the morning cause we,
you know,
cause we got it,

1889
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:28.600
we're facing a tough workout or a hard day or we've got to get up early for

1890
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:32.950
travel or whatever situation you're in.
You can do it.

1891
02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:34.900
I can do what we can do it.

1892
02:01:35.050 --> 02:01:38.860
Look at what these guys went up against day after day,
after day,
after,

1893
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.220
after day after

1894
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:44.060
<v 3>day after day.
Just doesn't stop.
It just doesn't stop.</v>

1895
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:48.410
And the whole time,
by the way,
there's the threat of death by the way.

1896
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:50.360
The whole time freezing.
You know,

1897
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:52.880
I just thought about this like this is a book where he doesn't even talk about

1898
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:54.230
like his family.
Yeah.

1899
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.110
He doesn't talk about his love when he says not done know he's there.

1900
02:01:57.410 --> 02:02:00.040
He's just like detached from everything else.
He's got award it,

1901
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.920
he's got a war to fight.

1902
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:07.160
So thankfully we get these incredible memoirs.
This one here,

1903
02:02:07.161 --> 02:02:10.310
if you're looking at it on Youtube,
uh,
holding up the cover,

1904
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:13.430
I got the old school version,
it has illustrations in it.

1905
02:02:13.431 --> 02:02:18.431
Got some cool ink drawings of it's all of weapons just to kind of let you know

1906
02:02:18.681 --> 02:02:22.160
what these things look like,
but incredible stuff,

1907
02:02:22.730 --> 02:02:26.600
man.
So yeah,
support,
right?

1908
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:32.030
If you're in the mood.
Yeah.
Like for instance,

1909
02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.140
how much effort does it take to click through Amazon?
It does take a lot of,

1910
02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:41.030
you could do it if you want to support,
if you want support in that way.
Actually,

1911
02:02:41.031 --> 02:02:43.490
Dina,
hell,
let me go ahead and explain that.
The Amazon thing is cool.

1912
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:46.723
So

1913
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:52.850
you do you Amazon shopping like we always do daily for some of,

1914
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:57.140
uh,
instead of going to straight to Amazon,
just go to Jocko,

1915
02:02:57.141 --> 02:03:00.050
podcast.com little Amazon banner on the side.

1916
02:03:00.051 --> 02:03:03.490
You kind of got a scroll down if you want to hit the banner sometimes,

1917
02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:08.570
but I put it up in the top menu as well.
Boom.
Click on the Amazon banner.

1918
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:13.640
Dan,
do your shopping.
Good way to support.
Like chuck was said,

1919
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:16.040
just you know,
little actually do that if you want to,

1920
02:03:16.041 --> 02:03:18.060
if that's what you're doing.
If you're supporting the podcast,

1921
02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:21.380
are we asking them to assault a target?

1922
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:23.720
Are we asking them to flank and enemy or we,

1923
02:03:23.721 --> 02:03:28.250
are we asking them to come up against Panzer tanks or tiger tanks with one

1924
02:03:28.251 --> 02:03:31.690
bazooka in 10 days?
No,
no,
no one's asking for,
I let us have porch.

1925
02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:39.370
It's a good way to,
it's really good way.
It's,
well,

1926
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:43.190
I was going to make the comparison to the plane that comes in and then lease,

1927
02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.270
you know,
but meanwhile it's huge support.
But that's true.
Let's face it though,

1928
02:03:47.290 --> 02:03:51.380
those pilots,
that's death.
That's a lot of work for sure.
I mean,

1929
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.620
I don't know if that's a fair comparison,
but nonetheless,

1930
02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.750
let's stick with sodium on that one.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's like sodium,
you know,

1931
02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:03.920
little B sodium,
throw it in the fish.
You know what?
We should actually do that.

1932
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:08.120
Yeah.
We need to do it.
Actually.
We need to do Facebook live.

1933
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:12.740
We need to get some sodium and put it in a bucket of water so we can give

1934
02:04:12.741 --> 02:04:15.890
visuals.
Yeah.
Good.
Behind the situation that you're talking about.
Yeah.

1935
02:04:15.891 --> 02:04:20.870
We'll do it at your house.
Okay.
Bring it.
Where did he get sodium?

1936
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:24.550
I Dunno.
Like cvs.
You're the logistics guys.

1937
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:28.160
Go get some sodium.
Look into that one.
Anyway,

1938
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:32.480
that is a fair,
more fair analogy.
You're the sodium,

1939
02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.190
big reinforcement effects with Amazon.
Click through situation.

1940
02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:39.600
Also,
if you're into supplementation,

1941
02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:44.490
which I'm going to go ahead and recommend it now kicks me three years ago and

1942
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:46.680
you're not going to hear me recommending any supplements.

1943
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:51.090
Maybe it preworkout maybe,
and even then it's like caffeinated.

1944
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:54.450
I was thinking you don't care.
So on it,
right.

1945
02:04:54.451 --> 02:04:56.610
That's the supplements we're talking about.
If you didn't know

1946
02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:01.140
if you did know,
this is all familiar to you,

1947
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:03.340
but the preworkout that we talk about,

1948
02:05:03.341 --> 02:05:07.830
it's called total strength and performance.
You know,
weightlifting and whatnot.

1949
02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:11.190
It's preworkout.
It's not,
it's stimulant free.
Right.

1950
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:14.340
So you know what I was thinking?
I was like,
hey,
stimulant free.

1951
02:05:14.341 --> 02:05:16.800
Preworkout is kind of different than what I'm used to be.

1952
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.190
You know what it's like,
I don't,
but I forgot a few of them.

1953
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:25.860
But it's like,
it's like you ever watch movies and the good guy,
like,

1954
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:30.660
I dunno Clint Eastwood,
he's all calm.
He's like,

1955
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:35.400
he's not wired and he's all calm,
but one it goes down,
brought,

1956
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:39.190
he kills,
you know,
kicks ass.
That's what this pre workout is kind of like.

1957
02:05:39.191 --> 02:05:41.580
Like when you take it you're like,
oh I'm calm,

1958
02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.720
but on the inside so much protect and then when you get the work going it's like

1959
02:05:45.721 --> 02:05:49.680
boom.
So that they do studies on on it.
That's actually the good,

1960
02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:54.600
one of the good parts about it is like they do real like placebo test it like at

1961
02:05:54.601 --> 02:05:58.480
studies double blind placebo testing and stuff like that.
Sounds cool.

1962
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:02.850
But it is cool.
So with this pre workout one,

1963
02:06:02.851 --> 02:06:07.290
it's like over,
I think it was like a four week period,
it's like,

1964
02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:12.810
oh I want to say 6% improvement on like on air about,
you know,
and I'm thinking,

1965
02:06:12.811 --> 02:06:16.470
oh yeah,
6% was say,
okay cool.
Single digit percent.

1966
02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:19.200
Sometimes that can mean a lot.
So I'm like thinking,
okay,

1967
02:06:19.201 --> 02:06:22.820
what's 6% what does that look like?
You know?
So I'm thinking,

1968
02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:26.250
add that to your bench press number or whatever,
but this dead lift number,

1969
02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:30.960
subtract it.
So this is,
this is how it really needs to be negative.

1970
02:06:30.961 --> 02:06:35.820
But I know rob,
because I'm trying to prove up a real legitimate point.
Okay,

1971
02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:40.500
so let's say I'm doing some dumbbells,
right?

1972
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.280
I'm like,
okay,
I'm going to do a set of 10 on,
and I'm not saying me,

1973
02:06:44.281 --> 02:06:47.370
I'm just seeing anyone and I'm going to use the hundred pound dumbbells.

1974
02:06:47.371 --> 02:06:51.180
I'm going to do 10 of them curls,
we'll do,
how about this?

1975
02:06:51.181 --> 02:06:56.181
We'll do a bench press dumbbells and I'm 201 week I do,

1976
02:06:57.241 --> 02:07:00.090
you know,
set a 10 boom solid,
right?
And then whatever.

1977
02:07:00.091 --> 02:07:02.160
I finished my workout the next week,

1978
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.800
if I can do 6% less,
like that's my limit.
You know,

1979
02:07:07.801 --> 02:07:12.720
I'm,
I'm,
I'm feeling 6% weaker.
I can't do those hundreds of 10 times.

1980
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:17.270
No,
I got to go to the 95 bro,
you know,
whack.
That is a real way.

1981
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.310
So I'm saying if you don't take this pre workout over a month period of time,

1982
02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:26.400
this is just on average.
If you don't take this pre workout,

1983
02:07:26.401 --> 02:07:29.190
you're the guy who did the 90 fives if you do,

1984
02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:32.580
you're the guy who did the hundreds.
Actually it's less than 95 is really,

1985
02:07:32.581 --> 02:07:36.940
it's like 90 fours really on average.
Dang.
See,

1986
02:07:36.941 --> 02:07:40.510
so that's what if you're not taking the pre workout,
which I do now,
by the way,

1987
02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:45.010
if you're not taking it,
you're that guy.
No offense.
I mean that's cool,

1988
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.950
but I'm just saying you're missing out on gains.
Go Laura.
You know,

1989
02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.730
you can see what I'm saying.
Anyway.
And this is all proven stuff.

1990
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:54.160
This isn't just me making it up.
It's like proof they do.

1991
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:59.080
They did Florida State University against.
We'll see for yourself.
Yeah.

1992
02:07:59.081 --> 02:08:02.910
That part is up to you.
I mean it's,
it's up to you to go get after it.
You know?

1993
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:06.850
What about you personally?
Yeah,
I'm all up at fall upon it.

1994
02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:11.030
I didn't measure my results or nothing like that.
I didn't just do double blind.

1995
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.610
Yeah,
the pop remember.
Oh that's right.
Pop is real.
How they did it is,
you know,

1996
02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.480
you know even the word double blind,
placebo,

1997
02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:24.610
placebo situation,
whatever.
Like a lot of people,
they didn't know what that is.

1998
02:08:24.611 --> 02:08:27.760
What it is is they get a bunch of a group of people who are going to work out

1999
02:08:27.761 --> 02:08:29.980
hard,
going for gain straight up.

2000
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.910
They're going to give them all the supplement,
all of them,

2001
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:35.470
all of the people that are going to give this supplement.

2002
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:39.520
But half of those people,
it's actually not the supplement.
It's like nothing,

2003
02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:43.570
but they don't know that everyone thinks they're taking the supplement.

2004
02:08:43.571 --> 02:08:45.400
So they're all getting after it.
They're all,
you know what I mean?

2005
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.060
And then they say,
okay,
who's going to who,
who's gains are better?

2006
02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.510
And they monitor and all the people in the supplements,

2007
02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:54.370
their gains where you know,
on average and it's all these different lists,

2008
02:08:54.371 --> 02:08:57.670
back squat,
all this stuff.
So boom proofing.
Anyway,

2009
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.540
it tastes good that much.
I can actually attest to,
he does.
I was thinking about,

2010
02:09:01.610 --> 02:09:04.540
I can attest that it makes now I can't,

2011
02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:07.670
I haven't done a double blind placebo on myself.
I mean,

2012
02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:12.880
because I'd have to like mix it up and fake myself out.
I'm pretty hard to track.

2013
02:09:14.970 --> 02:09:19.090
But like I said,
I,
when I,
when I feel the need,

2014
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:25.280
I take not only shroom tech sport but also the pre yeah.

2015
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.440
And get after it.
Yet,

2016
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.220
if I know that the boys are waiting for me for those you shit to training.
Yeah.

2017
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:34.210
And I know it's going down.
I will.
If I'm not,

2018
02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.460
if I'm feeling any sort of hesitation,
I'll get after that.

2019
02:09:38.461 --> 02:09:40.300
So felt aggressive when in doubt.

2020
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.410
And it makes sense too because obviously Jujitsu specially when you're going

2021
02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:48.940
hard,
that's a workout that you need to recover from and you'll be,
you know,

2022
02:09:49.730 --> 02:09:54.730
so you'll get better results from recovering from even a Jujitsu workup.

2023
02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:58.150
You know,
I just worry about performance performance.

2024
02:09:58.151 --> 02:10:01.860
I'm not doing it for recovery to be honest with you,
with the Jujitsu workout.

2025
02:10:01.890 --> 02:10:05.760
But like it or not,
that's what you're getting
fully,

2026
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:10.570
fully is well,
but yeah.
So good.
Yeah.
You said it tastes good.
It does taste good.

2027
02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:13.540
It was weird because,
um,
as far as pre workouts go,

2028
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:16.060
like if you get a regular quote unquote regular preworkout,

2029
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:20.170
they tried to make it tastes like candy and Kool aid and lemonade and all this

2030
02:10:20.171 --> 02:10:23.980
stuff.
And I'm not mad at it.
It tastes good or whatever.
But yeah,
man,

2031
02:10:23.981 --> 02:10:27.850
let's face it.
I mean this is good.
So when I took this one,
it was kind of,

2032
02:10:27.851 --> 02:10:29.710
it had more of like a,
um,
you know,

2033
02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:33.520
like if you take like natural greens or something,
it kind of has those,
yeah.

2034
02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:38.390
Earthy,
earthy,
earthy.
There's earthy flavor to it,
which I was like,
oh,

2035
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:41.720
this is different.
It's not like candy.
And I was like,
okay.

2036
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:44.470
And then after a while you kind of get used to it and then you have that,

2037
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.240
you know how you have that association to certain tastes from like,

2038
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:51.050
then you go work out,
you get the pop in.
It's kind of part of the routine.

2039
02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:53.450
So it's like,
tastes all good now.
You know what I mean?

2040
02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:58.370
It's like through association.
Yeah.
Good.
Anyway,
it doesn't taste like Krill oil.

2041
02:10:58.371 --> 02:11:01.790
Like if you're chopping,
chomping Krill oil tablets.
Yeah.
You got to just swallow.

2042
02:11:01.791 --> 02:11:06.620
Those don't jump.
Those guys did not taste good.
Yeah.
So then cool.
So krill oil,

2043
02:11:06.621 --> 02:11:11.060
speaking of which is the go to in my opinion,

2044
02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:14.690
it's the go to,
I was talking to Greg train about what's today.

2045
02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:16.970
It was yesterday I was talking about.

2046
02:11:18.590 --> 02:11:22.280
And of course like okay,
if you're working out and you're like,
hey,

2047
02:11:22.281 --> 02:11:26.990
my joints are less sore,
that's good.
Of course.
But you don't,

2048
02:11:26.991 --> 02:11:27.920
when you do notice it,

2049
02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:32.921
and in my experience even more if you pay attention is like for example,

2050
02:11:33.321 --> 02:11:37.440
like a few days ago,
I'm sitting down in the living room with the kids.
You know,

2051
02:11:37.530 --> 02:11:39.840
we're seeing,
we're sitting there for a long time,
same positions,

2052
02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:44.030
like for 45 minutes,
usually after 45 minutes.
And then said,
okay,

2053
02:11:44.031 --> 02:11:47.390
it's time to get up.
Whatever you gotta do something,
you get up and you're like,

2054
02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:49.350
ah,
you know,
you get up,
you know,

2055
02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:52.700
and you make that noise mean no.

2056
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:57.110
But if I didn't take Krill oil,
I probably would have that.
And I have had that,

2057
02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.090
especially if you've worked out that day or something like that.
You know,

2058
02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:03.410
you just stiffen up.
I'm just saying,
then you feel it with the Krill.

2059
02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.550
It's almost like you're always warm,
not warm physically,
but you know,

2060
02:12:07.551 --> 02:12:10.970
like you've already warmed up.
That's kind of what you feel like.
It's good.

2061
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.740
I'm a supporter.
Yeah.
So I'm saying get the Krill oil.
Yeah.

2062
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:20.060
Like I said,
I had injuries and Cro oil.

2063
02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:21.440
That was a long time ago.

2064
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:24.080
Then I started taking her a lot and I haven't stopped in,
I'm not going to,
yeah,

2065
02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:29.030
yeah.
Cause even like,
like you say,
injuries,
which yeah,
of course legitimate,

2066
02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:31.430
but I never,
I mean I've had injuries but

2067
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:36.900
it more helps like the pre injury,
you know,
like,

2068
02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:41.760
yeah.
Something that's just Kinda just nagging you.
You know,

2069
02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:43.850
stuff you got to like battle through or something like that.

2070
02:12:43.851 --> 02:12:47.600
You don't have to battle through that anymore.
You got Omega threes.

2071
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:49.790
Excellent.

2072
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:54.050
Next time I'll go into the whole white fish oil or Krill oil is better than fish

2073
02:12:54.051 --> 02:12:56.810
oil because we talked about it.
It'll take too long.
It's kind of technical.

2074
02:12:56.811 --> 02:13:01.280
I'll put it into layman's terms some of the time.
Anyway,
Krill oil is dope.

2075
02:13:02.150 --> 02:13:06.560
Preworkouts dope.
Everything on it is good.
Actually,

2076
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:10.190
just depends on what kind of workout program,
what kind of lifestyle,
you know.

2077
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:13.550
But they have something for everybody,
like regardless of what you do,

2078
02:13:13.551 --> 02:13:15.560
even the Krill oil,
even if you're not that active,

2079
02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:18.230
it's just good for your joints,
you know,
as like,

2080
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:22.310
because over overtime you degenerate,
you know,
whatever.
Krill oil regenerate.

2081
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:28.870
Also another way to support his subscribe on iTunes or the various podcast

2082
02:13:30.411 --> 02:13:34.440
platforms.
Google play,
all these things.
If you subscribe,
if you haven't already,

2083
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:36.090
you know,
that's the good support,
you know,

2084
02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:41.250
get updates when new episodes come out.
Also on Youtube,

2085
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:43.440
we have a youtube channel,

2086
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:47.310
excerpts on there along with the video version of this podcast,

2087
02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:51.150
which helps if you need to know what echo looks like.

2088
02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.290
Because apparently echo does not look like what he sounds like.
Yeah.

2089
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.900
I've been told actually,
how's this?

2090
02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:00.450
So Paul

2091
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:06.960
knew friend Paul came in from Arizona,
visited,
came to the v victory,

2092
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:11.520
looked into some Jujitsu on that.
I was out of town.
You're out of town.
Yes.

2093
02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:15.390
To too bad.
So he goes,
he says,
when I walked in,
he's like,
Hey,
echo.
I was like,

2094
02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:20.250
I was like,
Hey,
what's up?
And he goes,
Oh,

2095
02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:25.350
you're for some reason I thought you'd be bigger.
He said,
I was like,
oh,

2096
02:14:25.351 --> 02:14:28.560
interesting.
I will say,
because typically people,

2097
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:30.240
if they haven't seen me or whatever,

2098
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:33.950
they think I'm smaller and you think I'm bigger.
So it's kind of,

2099
02:14:34.630 --> 02:14:35.490
it was just different.

2100
02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.930
He probably got that impression from reading on social media.
That echoes Jack.

2101
02:14:43.170 --> 02:14:47.550
Maybe a little echoes jacked or,
yeah.
Or maybe,

2102
02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.050
you know,
maybe he thought I was just taught like super tall or something.

2103
02:14:51.090 --> 02:14:54.330
Oh yeah.
Well maybe,
but you,
what are you,

2104
02:14:54.331 --> 02:14:59.110
five 1160 11
super tall.

2105
02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:04.680
I'm normal height.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
Either way.
Um,
what was the point there?

2106
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.420
Oh yeah.
If you want to watch youtube videos of,
of Jocko.

2107
02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:14.760
Yeah,
it's less about me,
I think.
Oh,
it's about,
it's about me a little bit.
Yeah.

2108
02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:18.090
So either of us.
Um,
and you want to watch a video version?
Go ahead.

2109
02:15:18.091 --> 02:15:20.940
Watch that man.
It's good.
It's on youtube.
And also,
uh,

2110
02:15:21.150 --> 02:15:22.800
I'll put some excerpts on there.
It does,

2111
02:15:22.801 --> 02:15:26.400
it gets you to want to watch the whole cause to sit in front of the computer and

2112
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:28.710
watch like for two hours,
three hours sometimes.
I mean,

2113
02:15:28.711 --> 02:15:33.510
that's kind of unrealistic unless you're allowing me to do it.
Yeah.
Well,
no.

2114
02:15:33.511 --> 02:15:38.070
What,
what,
and I've done this before too,
you just put it on like your TV,

2115
02:15:38.170 --> 02:15:39.000
the smart TV.

2116
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.440
Sometimes I want to see what is going on in the podcast.

2117
02:15:43.441 --> 02:15:47.010
I want to see the look on my own face or on your face when I say something,

2118
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:49.710
I Kinda wanna see what that looks like.
Yeah.
And that makes sense,

2119
02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:51.450
because when you figure,
I mean,

2120
02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:54.810
I feel like a lot of people will watch less TV,

2121
02:15:54.811 --> 02:15:58.600
but that could be just my little bubble.
But no one watches TV.
If we,
oh yeah,

2122
02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:02.390
I don't want to stall.
No,
but think about this.

2123
02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:09.300
Yeah,
that's a good for sure.
But let's say you watch it.
I Dunno,
Dr Phil,

2124
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:14.670
not that I watched Dr Phil,
but if you watch that,
that's all they're doing.

2125
02:16:14.671 --> 02:16:17.350
They're sitting,
this guy's talking to this person and you're just watching it.

2126
02:16:17.710 --> 02:16:19.070
You could listen to that.
You're saying,

2127
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:21.690
and I'm just saying if you're in deductr fill that,

2128
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.950
the difference between looking and and watching it and just listening to it,

2129
02:16:25.951 --> 02:16:30.430
like you understand that people actually do watch two people talk about stuff.

2130
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:35.080
It makes sense.
You kind of feel like you'd be more in the conversation in a way.

2131
02:16:35.081 --> 02:16:39.780
I don't know either way.
Yeah.
Youtube,
that's the,
that's the point there.
If he,

2132
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:43.450
if you want to watch this podcast or just the excerpts and you don't want to

2133
02:16:43.451 --> 02:16:45.760
watch the whole podcast,
there's little excerpts.

2134
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:49.600
He little lessons that I kind of separate from the podcast,
put them on.

2135
02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.210
They're shareable little nuggets.

2136
02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:55.270
Also we have a store Jocko,

2137
02:16:55.271 --> 02:16:59.350
store.com if you like shirts and whatnot.
New Designs.

2138
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:05.140
I Dunno,
a week,
next week we'll have them I think new designs.
Yeah.

2139
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.310
That's cool.
Yeah.
I kind of listened to the crowd a little bit.
You know,

2140
02:17:09.311 --> 02:17:13.750
people throw out suggestions all the time,
which,
you know,
listened to for sure.

2141
02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:16.540
And um,
kind of the,
the ones that,

2142
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:19.720
what do you hate the word percolate to the guy?
I mean,

2143
02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:22.270
I'd like the word percolate better than resonate.

2144
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:26.740
The ones that resonate with my soul.
You know,
that feeling.

2145
02:17:26.741 --> 02:17:31.300
That's the feeling I get when I say it.
When other people say it.

2146
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:34.630
It sounds cool.
I just say the ones that are good.
Yeah,

2147
02:17:34.631 --> 02:17:39.100
that makes more sense for sure.
All right.
Yeah.
The ones that we thought are good,

2148
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:44.610
we're starting to develop more and more designs and I'm have,
so yeah.

2149
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:48.340
[inaudible] dot com and you know,
women's stuff is on there.
Some patches,

2150
02:17:48.341 --> 02:17:49.840
some shirts of course,

2151
02:17:49.970 --> 02:17:52.610
<v 2>brash guard.
See,
this is what,
this is the thing.
See,</v>

2152
02:17:52.611 --> 02:17:57.230
I'm not good at recognizing like,
hey,

2153
02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:00.680
we should make more stuff.
Right.
Because I,

2154
02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:03.770
it's hard for me to recognize what's good and what's bad because my mind is

2155
02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:06.980
different than some peoples.
Yeah.
So,

2156
02:18:06.981 --> 02:18:11.420
but what's cool is when I do see something and I do think it's good,

2157
02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:16.430
it's pretty good.
Yeah.
Pretty good.
By the way.

2158
02:18:16.431 --> 02:18:20.810
I'm almost done with the Echo Charles tee shirt design by the way.
Yeah.

2159
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:24.620
Which I think people are going to like,
you know,

2160
02:18:24.621 --> 02:18:28.070
why they're going to like it because you designed it well.
Yeah.
But,

2161
02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.650
but that's not why they're going to like it because it's not just

2162
02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:33.940
straightforward,
right?
There's yes.

2163
02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:39.050
Some layers is there.
And how that one,
no,
I believe bright.
You're the,

2164
02:18:39.051 --> 02:18:43.490
you're the original layer creator really when it comes down to it,

2165
02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:47.150
no,
I think that is cause flooding.
So speaking of layers,

2166
02:18:47.151 --> 02:18:52.151
the day that echo asked me what font it was that I used to write Jocko podcast

2167
02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:57.770
and I was like,
yeah,
it's the OCR standards in.

2168
02:18:57.860 --> 02:18:59.030
Then he kind of looked at me and I said,

2169
02:18:59.150 --> 02:19:01.730
it's because it's a machine can read it and you know,

2170
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:06.050
this is like part machine here.
And he was all excited and laters right.
They're

2171
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.290
telling you the laser real

2172
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.050
<v 3>and I respect them.
Good.
So yeah,
there it is.
Jocko store.</v>

2173
02:19:14.051 --> 02:19:17.570
I'm also,
Oh yeah,
let's,
sorry Brett.

2174
02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:22.210
This rash guards on their alleged 19% straight up,

2175
02:19:22.211 --> 02:19:26.650
19% increase improvement performance,
um,
result,

2176
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:29.970
all that stuff.
Hoodies on there too.
And you know,
like I said,

2177
02:19:29.971 --> 02:19:32.330
it's more stuff that we have a travel mug coming out.

2178
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:33.164
That one's going to be good.

2179
02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:38.660
So I'll let you know when that's not a psycho psychological warfare.

2180
02:19:40.010 --> 02:19:42.830
I feel like I should talk about that right now.
I feel like we can't stop you.

2181
02:19:42.831 --> 02:19:45.380
So yeah,
I guess you can't stop me.

2182
02:19:46.450 --> 02:19:51.450
So psychological warfare on iTunes is an album with tracks

2183
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:58.820
and this is what it's for.
It's not music.
No,
this is what it's for.

2184
02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:04.430
It's technically,
it's considered spoken word is what it is.

2185
02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.770
If you're feeling a moment of weakness in your discourse,

2186
02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:13.970
did I use that word rate discourse is not really.
Yeah.
So in your course,

2187
02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:18.350
I don't know,
better closer in your journey,

2188
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:23.410
in your ambitious goals to stay on the program in whatever capacity.

2189
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:29.060
Wake up early,
get the workout in and hardware cut in.
Um,

2190
02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:33.740
you know,
create,
you know,
write your book,
your blog,

2191
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:37.790
your anything you're doing right,
more or less,
and you're feeling moments,

2192
02:20:37.791 --> 02:20:39.830
a weakness.
You're slipping from the path.

2193
02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:42.350
You're taking a break when you shouldn't be taking a break.

2194
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:46.730
Scheduling unscheduled rest days.
Yeah.

2195
02:20:46.731 --> 02:20:49.940
When you're feeling like that string from the warpath.
Yeah.

2196
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:56.030
You listened to one of these designated tracks and it'll help you get past that

2197
02:20:56.031 --> 02:20:57.350
weakness.
In that moment,

2198
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:04.190
I would say,
and I've said this before,
it is,

2199
02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:10.450
this is my guess 100% chance that it will get you through your weakness.

2200
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:13.790
100% chance.
And this is why I say that,
and I've said this before,

2201
02:21:13.791 --> 02:21:17.390
but I think it's worth saying again,
because if you,
let's say,
you know,

2202
02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:21.530
let's do the,
the awake though,
the workout one,
that's the most common went to me.

2203
02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:25.340
And I'm like,
okay,
I'm gonna work.
I don't feel like working out.
And I'm like,

2204
02:21:25.341 --> 02:21:25.670
okay,

2205
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:30.230
well I'm going to put it in workout and track whatever the one I listened to it

2206
02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:31.760
and after I'm done listening to,

2207
02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:36.620
it's like two minutes long and I still skip the workout.
That's like a shame.

2208
02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:39.890
That's an unbearable shame.
And it's all personal.

2209
02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:43.280
So that means it's not 100% of you still skip the workout.

2210
02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.120
I'm just trying to imagine if that were to happen.
I've never done it.

2211
02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:48.320
And the shame,

2212
02:21:48.321 --> 02:21:51.380
the unbearable shame is so unbearable that it just simply wouldn't happen.

2213
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:55.070
You know?
So that that's why I say 100% chance.
I don't think,

2214
02:21:55.071 --> 02:21:59.450
I can't imagine a person that would actually let that happen nonetheless.

2215
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.690
So whatever your would think your weakness is waking up early,
all this stuff.

2216
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:05.960
If you do the wake up early one and you set it as your alarm,

2217
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:08.600
which is a good idea by the way,
it's actually,

2218
02:22:08.601 --> 02:22:11.800
that's the perfect idea to just clear it with your,

2219
02:22:11.801 --> 02:22:15.410
your spouse,
significant other significant other.
Yeah.

2220
02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:18.140
If they're sleeping in the same bed or whatever and they have the potential to

2221
02:22:18.141 --> 02:22:20.390
hear it.
There's some dude in the bedroom.
Yeah.

2222
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:24.950
Just like all of a sudden starts talking and his Jocko,
it's like a spot,

2223
02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.740
you know,
it's good psychological warfare,
iTunes,

2224
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:31.140
Jocko Willink gets a also on Amazon music and all these other things.
So yeah,

2225
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:32.063
it's there.

2226
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:35.520
It's a good way to support and support yourself because it balances support

2227
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:40.320
yourself situation for sure.
Sure.
Um,
and actually what's going out right now?

2228
02:22:40.321 --> 02:22:45.321
We're getting requests for psychological warfare to what topics need to be

2229
02:22:47.131 --> 02:22:49.640
covered that I didn't cover on the first one.
Yeah.

2230
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.990
There's more weaknesses out there in the world.

2231
02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:56.010
Weaknesses that are creeping around and you're trying to get people.

2232
02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:57.420
But yeah,

2233
02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:00.120
we're going to drinking and go find some of them weaknesses and we're going to

2234
02:23:00.121 --> 02:23:03.690
smash him.
So yeah,
if you've got any more suggestions,
just hit it up,
you know,

2235
02:23:04.410 --> 02:23:07.680
quitting smoking.
How about that one?
Right.
That's a good one.

2236
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:09.780
Do people still smoke bro?

2237
02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:12.660
I that you know what I brought was thinking about that.
We live in California,

2238
02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:15.210
that's one of the things we live in California in California,

2239
02:23:15.211 --> 02:23:18.450
but a lot of people don't smoke anymore.
He's not real popular out here anymore.

2240
02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:21.360
Yeah.
So just like I'm pro,
I'm telling we live in a bubble,

2241
02:23:21.361 --> 02:23:23.010
not only being in California,

2242
02:23:23.011 --> 02:23:25.450
but just think about the people you hang around with.
You know,

2243
02:23:25.451 --> 02:23:27.530
it's like all navy seals,

2244
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:32.440
Gj guys who at the very least have like some level of health conscious.

2245
02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:37.200
Yes,
exactly.
So yeah,
it's weird.
I thought guys smoking in his car and I was like,

2246
02:23:37.330 --> 02:23:40.800
I ask the same thing.
I was like,
Dang,
I didn't know really people smoked anymore.

2247
02:23:40.801 --> 02:23:43.680
Really.
I realized that when I go to another state,
yes.

2248
02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:46.770
And you go into a restaurant or something cause it's legal here.

2249
02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:49.410
You can't smoke in a restaurant.
You can't smoke in a bar here.
You can't do it.

2250
02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:52.950
It's illegal.
It's literally illegal.
Yeah.
So yeah,

2251
02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:55.410
you go to another state and you and you smell cigarettes and go,
oh yeah,

2252
02:23:55.411 --> 02:24:00.270
I remember that back.
But yeah,
that'd be a good one I think.

2253
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.020
Okay,
well we'll,
we'll think about that one.
Craving.

2254
02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.990
I don't know if I could legally do it though,

2255
02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:09.750
because I didn't smoke and I don't know what it takes.

2256
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:12.510
I don't know if it's proper for me to do that.
I mean,

2257
02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:14.920
I guess I could just get nuts off smoke.
Yeah.

2258
02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:19.500
Cause I mean it's a horrible thing that kills you.
You shouldn't be doing it,
man.

2259
02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:22.530
I,
there's actually no benefit from it.
Right.
There's no,

2260
02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:27.450
I mean if you're doing steroids,
there's some benefit to it,
right.

2261
02:24:27.451 --> 02:24:30.540
You're going to get stronger.
If you're doing caffeine,

2262
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.880
you're going to be more awake.
So there's certain benefits.

2263
02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:35.510
Is there any benefits to smoking?
It depends on what you mean by,

2264
02:24:35.511 --> 02:24:36.360
do you ever smoke before?

2265
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:40.680
I've never even tried a puff of a cigarette before because you're from Hawaii.

2266
02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.880
Well that's not the reason people smoke.
It was the thing,

2267
02:24:44.881 --> 02:24:49.320
his thing with my dad,
he,
he,
he'd literally refer to it as the devil.

2268
02:24:49.530 --> 02:24:54.300
Like he'd be like,
fuck,
it's the devil.
And it was,
it was a shame thing too.

2269
02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:57.690
So the way he would talk about Spokane,
not necessarily the people that smoke,

2270
02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:02.430
but smoking.
Yeah.
It's just so it just to me,
in my mind,

2271
02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.910
according to his little,
that's cool.
Mess.

2272
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:09.360
So your dad has done a good job there and I had never checked anyway.

2273
02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:12.600
He should have told you sleep was the devil to get you out of the bed,

2274
02:25:13.210 --> 02:25:17.600
not the devil.
That's the thing.
I know.
I know.
Well,
yeah,
it's,

2275
02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:21.120
I think it's,
um,
there is benefits though.
Depends on when you're smoking.

2276
02:25:21.121 --> 02:25:24.040
It depends on what you mean by benefits.
The health benefits of any

2277
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.030
<v 2>guide.
It gives you like this,
this like buzz and alerting.</v>

2278
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:31.210
But here's the thing about her,
it's weird because if you say smoking,

2279
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:33.790
smoking cigarettes,

2280
02:25:33.970 --> 02:25:37.510
there's nicotine in it and there's benefits in nicotine.

2281
02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:40.870
But smoking also has all the carbon monoxide,
like tar,

2282
02:25:40.871 --> 02:25:44.770
all these carcinogens and stuff like that.
Yeah.
So smoking

2283
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:51.460
maybe not so much benefits.
Nicotine.
There are benefits.
Okay,

2284
02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:54.550
well let's just say no.
Just say no.
There are no better.

2285
02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:58.830
So that's net benefit.
No native.
Alright.

2286
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:04.210
And um,
let's see.
Also speaking of net benefit,

2287
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.620
you can get some net benefit if you want to try something called Jocko white
tea.

2288
02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:10.240
If you're worried,
if you're not a tea drinker,

2289
02:26:10.241 --> 02:26:14.410
don't worry cause it doesn't taste like tea.
Tastes like victory.
And you know,

2290
02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:17.740
don't take my word for it.
I got some reviews,
we got some,

2291
02:26:17.741 --> 02:26:20.620
we've got a bunch of reviews on Amazon and you know what?
They're all awesome.

2292
02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:25.960
They're all 12 star,
right?
So here's one.

2293
02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:28.720
After drinking one cup of this balanced and delicious tea,

2294
02:26:28.721 --> 02:26:31.960
I was able to execute a flying triangle on my black belt Jujitsu instructor

2295
02:26:31.961 --> 02:26:34.750
while discovering the mystery behind dark matter in the universe.

2296
02:26:34.930 --> 02:26:39.120
It actually isn't dark martyr.
It's a combination of Jockos Chan,

2297
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.930
Echo Charles,
his biceps,

2298
02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:45.700
altering the gravitational field from random celestial bodies.

2299
02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.150
So you know,
there's some good stuff here.
I can't speak to dead lift performance,

2300
02:26:52.151 --> 02:26:55.960
but what I can comment as a significant increase in production while performing

2301
02:26:55.961 --> 02:26:57.850
farm work.
Most noticeably,

2302
02:26:57.851 --> 02:27:02.530
I can dig postholes in hard southern clay and half the normal time while under

2303
02:27:02.531 --> 02:27:05.830
the influence of Jocko white tea tastes great and I highly recommend it for

2304
02:27:05.831 --> 02:27:07.450
farmers,
landscapers,

2305
02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.200
construction warders workers or anyone who wants to get after it.

2306
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:14.470
So I didn't,
you know,
I wasn't familiar with that.

2307
02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:17.980
But you do notice right now like the economy's improving a lot.
We'll look,

2308
02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:19.510
you know,
everything's getting better.

2309
02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:21.430
I think it's got a lot of people aren't drinking chocolate either.

2310
02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:25.740
Working harder so that you're seeing quarterly.
You're not necessarily saying,

2311
02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.610
I'm not saying it's a fact,
I'm just saying it's factual.

2312
02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:34.420
And you know this guy here bought this from my wife,
she's five,

2313
02:27:34.421 --> 02:27:38.920
220 pounds.
She was dead lifting 250 pounds by the way.

2314
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.990
That's double body weight already impressive.

2315
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:44.500
After a week of imbibing this fine product,

2316
02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:49.240
her dead lift suddenly increase to 1,250 pounds.

2317
02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:52.180
Now that might seem like a lot,

2318
02:27:54.310 --> 02:27:57.250
but it's,
it happens,
right?
It's right there.

2319
02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:00.950
I mean this has been documented on Amazon.
Reviews can't lie on those.

2320
02:28:03.250 --> 02:28:08.140
We started throwing Jocko white tea bags in 500 gallon water tank on the

2321
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:12.470
firetruck.
Little known fact Jocko white teeth,
three times a wetter.

2322
02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:18.640
You're now extinguishing fires three times faster.
And in the process,

2323
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:22.010
anyone on scene who gets sprayed immediately getting after it.

2324
02:28:22.011 --> 02:28:23.270
So there's a little side effect,

2325
02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:26.930
but it's a positive side effect or a negative that you're putting out the fire.

2326
02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:29.780
Someone say he gets hit with some water by accident,

2327
02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:33.770
they're not going to complain.
Then you started doing burpees.
Uh,

2328
02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:36.320
we got a warning here too aggressive,
do not drink at work.

2329
02:28:36.321 --> 02:28:40.910
Literally lip the ripped the door trim off the wall after consuming this victory

2330
02:28:40.911 --> 02:28:45.470
in a glass.
Luckily since getting after it is my new default mode,

2331
02:28:45.471 --> 02:28:50.090
I was able to repair the damage before the boss noticed.
Replaced pathetic.

2332
02:28:50.091 --> 02:28:52.100
This is my best part or the best part of this one.

2333
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:55.370
Replaced pathetic screws with lag bolts.

2334
02:28:55.410 --> 02:28:58.520
You know what lag bolts are there like instead of a screw,

2335
02:28:58.521 --> 02:29:02.390
which is like a little tiny pencil thing.
A lag bolt is a big bolt that you like.

2336
02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:05.760
Yeah,
that's your mind salt.

2337
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:11.530
Now I mentioned this before and I don't know if I should necessarily do this,

2338
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:14.520
but I kind of think I should.
Got It.

2339
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:19.990
There's a poem that someone wrote about Jocko white tea and it's based on the

2340
02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.180
poem infantry columns by Kipling.

2341
02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:28.640
This one is talking about Jocko white tea.
Probably worth talking about here.

2342
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:33.620
Yes,
so we'll go.
Here we go.
Jocko white tea.

2343
02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:35.173
I'm hot.

2344
02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:40.160
Bru Bru Bru Bru brewing up some Jocko tea.

2345
02:29:40.161 --> 02:29:45.020
Hot,

2346
02:29:45.021 --> 02:29:49.640

drink it down and brew again.

2347
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:52.010
There is no tea leaves in the poor.

2348
02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:58.180
Three to four five Tasty Cup of Dia de seven three five nine cups the day

2349
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:07.100
before.
Drink,

drink it down and brew again.

2350
02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:12.220
There's no tea leaves in the poor du Du du Du crush.

2351
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:17.270
What is in front of you.
Drink,

drink,

2352
02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:21.740
drink it down and brew again.
Good,
good,
good,
good.

2353
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:26.030
We'll answer everything.
There's no tea leaves in the poor.

2354
02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:30.320
I've drank whole box and getting after it,

2355
02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:34.910
press the lift squat role then right back to it again.

2356
02:30:34.911 --> 02:30:39.680
Drink,
drink,
drink,
drink,
drink it down on Bro.
Again,
hadn't,

2357
02:30:39.681 --> 02:30:42.290
there's no tea leaves in the pore.

2358
02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:49.010
So just when someone writes a review like that,

2359
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:52.850
I think that might be the best.
And matter of fact,
let's just face it.

2360
02:30:52.851 --> 02:30:56.900
That's the best review.
That's everything on Amazon.
So good on you.

2361
02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:02.130
That's the best review.
It was very impressive.
It's very impressive.
And uh,

2362
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:05.010
so that's that also if you want to preorder,
um,

2363
02:31:05.890 --> 02:31:07.570
a little book coming out called the way the war,

2364
02:31:07.571 --> 02:31:12.571
your kid and you can order it and I'll tell you why this book,

2365
02:31:13.671 --> 02:31:15.830
you might be wondering what this book is about.

2366
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:19.010
This book is about everything.

2367
02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:23.100
<v 0>So I want to read a little excerpt to you</v>

2368
02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:27.000
young mark.
Remember the beginning of the book,

2369
02:31:27.001 --> 02:31:29.580
he could do zero pullups doesn't know how to do any pull ups,

2370
02:31:29.581 --> 02:31:32.040
wasn't strong enough.
Now he works through the summer.

2371
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:37.130
His uncle Jake is shown him some good workout programs and finally he's built up

2372
02:31:37.681 --> 02:31:39.690
over the summer.
It goes through some plateaus,

2373
02:31:39.691 --> 02:31:42.180
gets through them getting after it,
training hard.

2374
02:31:42.181 --> 02:31:45.870
Finally towards the end of summer he gets his first day of doing 10 pull ups.

2375
02:31:46.350 --> 02:31:48.150
Right,
and so here's what happens.

2376
02:31:48.151 --> 02:31:51.600
We're going back to the book and that was it.

2377
02:31:52.290 --> 02:31:54.630
I was now officially a kid who can do 10 pull ups.

2378
02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:56.820
No more hiding from the pullup bar in school.

2379
02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:00.030
No more being embarrassed about being weak.
This was real.

2380
02:32:00.570 --> 02:32:03.780
As I thought about this,
I looked at uncle Jake and said,
thanks.

2381
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:08.220
No problem,
mark,
and I want you to remember something.

2382
02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:12.720
This isn't just about pull ups.
You know what else this is about,
right?

2383
02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:16.050
I wasn't quite sure.
I don't know.

2384
02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.550
Uncle Jake grabbed me by both shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes and

2385
02:32:20.551 --> 02:32:23.670
said,
gravely,
this is about everything.

2386
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:29.700
Everything.
Just think two months ago you couldn't do any pull ups at all.

2387
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:30.593
Zero.

2388
02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:36.140
Now you can do 10 all it took was a good plan and the discipline to execute that

2389
02:32:36.541 --> 02:32:40.080
plan to do it,
that's what it takes.

2390
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:44.820
And you can apply that to just about anything.
If you are willing to do the work,

2391
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:48.540
you can make things happen.
And like I told you,

2392
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:50.790
no one else is going to do the work for you.

2393
02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:53.970
Sure you might get some help along the way,
but you might not.

2394
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Who knows what we do know is this hard work and discipline are how you achieve

2395
02:32:59.221 --> 02:33:03.870
things.
You have to make things happen and that is exactly what you did here.

2396
02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:09.180
And you can do that with almost anything in life.
Remember that

2397
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:14.910
Uncle Jake's putting out some words,
the young mark.

2398
02:33:14.940 --> 02:33:18.840
So there's all kinds of good lessons for,
you know,

2399
02:33:18.841 --> 02:33:21.120
I'd love to say it's a kids book.
It's a kid's book basically.

2400
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:24.630
I'm going to tell you what you might want to order it for yourself.

2401
02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:29.580
It's everybody.
It's everybody book that just,
it's an everybody book.

2402
02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:31.140
So that's that.
Check out.

2403
02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:36.141
That book also just released discipline equals freedom field manual.

2404
02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.550
Sometimes we need to refer to the manual on how to do things right.

2405
02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.570
We need the manual if we're going to refer to it.
It's true.
Manuals coming.

2406
02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:49.830
You can preorder that one too.
It's about everything.

2407
02:33:50.490 --> 02:33:54.200
You know that one's more aimed at an adult audience.
Yeah,

2408
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:57.240
it is adult.
Yeah.
Dig.

2409
02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:00.330
Not that there's like bad words in it or anything like that.

2410
02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.360
There's no obscene topics unless you think donuts are a bad word because they're

2411
02:34:06.181 --> 02:34:10.470
in there.
We talk about them a little bit and their,
their evilness.
So yeah,

2412
02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:15.450
you can,
you can get that one too.
Of course you can get extreme ownership.

2413
02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:18.640
It's about leadership in combat.
In business,

2414
02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:22.210
it's about life and you know from what we learned in combat,

2415
02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:25.180
the lessons that we learned in combat,

2416
02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:30.550
they will help you in your business and they will help you in life.

2417
02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.690
So get a copy,
get a copy for your team and you know,

2418
02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.260
get up and down the chain of command up and down the chain of command.

2419
02:34:38.290 --> 02:34:43.210
They need it.
Also,
I wanted to mention this echelon front,
right?

2420
02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.560
This is the company Leif Babin and I who wrote the book extreme ownership with

2421
02:34:47.561 --> 02:34:51.460
me.
This is our company leadership and management consulting.
It's what we do.

2422
02:34:51.461 --> 02:34:54.050
We've also got JP Danelle onboard.

2423
02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:58.810
We got Dave Burke on board and we work with companies,

2424
02:34:58.870 --> 02:35:03.760
help them align their leadership around the principles from the book extreme

2425
02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:06.880
ownership of the things we learned in combat.
If you need this,

2426
02:35:06.910 --> 02:35:08.190
and this is the reason I'm saying this right now,

2427
02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:10.390
normally I don't talk about or I haven't talked about as much,

2428
02:35:10.391 --> 02:35:15.370
but people sometimes have a hard time figuring out how to get information on

2429
02:35:15.371 --> 02:35:17.590
front.com.
That's the business website.

2430
02:35:17.890 --> 02:35:22.890
If you want to bring us onboard info@echelonfront.com,

2431
02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.370
you can email at that address and then people can uh,
get there.

2432
02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:32.000
You don't need to go to a speaker's bureau if you want to hear me speak or if

2433
02:35:32.001 --> 02:35:35.530
you want to hear Lafe speaker,
if you want to hear cause a speakers bureau is,

2434
02:35:36.610 --> 02:35:39.160
um,
they are there companies that,

2435
02:35:39.370 --> 02:35:43.090
that facilitates speakers coming.
They're like an agent.

2436
02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:46.630
So if you don't know how to contact,
if you want to hear Jocko talk,

2437
02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:50.650
you want to have jack who come and talk at your company,
you type speaker,

2438
02:35:50.770 --> 02:35:55.390
Jocko Willink,
there's a good chance echelon front will come up and say,
Oh yeah,

2439
02:35:55.391 --> 02:35:58.480
you can call this number or you can email here and that'll hook it up.

2440
02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:00.790
Or there'll be someone else that says,
you know,

2441
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:05.500
Bill's speakers and they're advertising me,

2442
02:36:05.501 --> 02:36:08.360
their advertising everybody people.
And they said,
hey,
if you want it,

2443
02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:10.660
then they contact us.
But you got them.

2444
02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:13.780
You got yourself a middleman in that scenario.
So yeah.

2445
02:36:13.781 --> 02:36:18.130
Actually that's good because like people still email me.
Yeah.
Like,
Hey,
you know,

2446
02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:22.680
would you echo,
can you come and talk at our company?
No,
no.
Did you tell her?

2447
02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:26.870
Can you tell us about on it?
Yeah,
no,

2448
02:36:27.430 --> 02:36:31.570
I think yours,
you forward those those things to me too.

2449
02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:35.680
And I didn't know the inflight,
I'll send them to like Jamie or something.

2450
02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:40.040
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's uh,
that's,
but yeah,
so that's what you do.
Yes.

2451
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:44.500
Infomercial on front.com and you know,
between me,
between life,

2452
02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:46.990
JP,
Dave Burke,
and we do,

2453
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:53.160
we do programs like full programs at your company to get everybody aligned and

2454
02:36:53.351 --> 02:36:56.080
on the same page.
So that's what we do.
If you want to get some of that.

2455
02:36:56.650 --> 02:37:01.650
And also you can come to the muster in New York City,

2456
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:06.100
New York City,
right.
Can't be mad at New York City.

2457
02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:08.770
That's the place we're going to be.

2458
02:37:08.771 --> 02:37:11.950
May 4th or May 5th doing at the Marriott Grand Marquis.

2459
02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:17.030
Now a couple things about the muster,
okay.
This is,
this is different.
Okay?

2460
02:37:17.031 --> 02:37:20.090
This isn't a feel good seminar to like pump you up.

2461
02:37:20.091 --> 02:37:24.110
That is not what's happening at the muster if you want that don't come.
Yeah.

2462
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:27.530
I'm not saying you won't be pumped up.
I'm not saying you won't be motivated,

2463
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:29.660
but don't come if that's what you're looking for.

2464
02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:32.730
There's not going to be any chanting.
Okay.
Yeah.

2465
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:38.110
There's not going to be any like communal promises and that kind of stuff.

2466
02:37:39.351 --> 02:37:43.540
That's,
and that's not happening there.
You're not going to fill out,
um,
um,

2467
02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.950
a dream board.
Okay.
That's not happening.

2468
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.060
Don't come to the muster if that's what you want.
That's not what the muster is.

2469
02:37:51.350 --> 02:37:54.860
This is practical tactics,

2470
02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:57.350
tactics and strategies,

2471
02:37:58.770 --> 02:38:03.770
practical things that will help you lead your team and we'll help you lead

2472
02:38:05.331 --> 02:38:09.320
yourself.
So if that's what you want,

2473
02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:11.630
then come to the muster.

2474
02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:17.470
If you want to chance and promise and stuff like this don't come because that's

2475
02:38:19.281 --> 02:38:24.160
not what it is.
If you want to learn how to lead,
come.
Yeah,
yeah,

2476
02:38:24.210 --> 02:38:25.043
there,

2477
02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:27.780
<v 3>I mean I'm just obviously going on the last one,</v>

2478
02:38:27.781 --> 02:38:30.930
but like you learn like scenarios,

2479
02:38:30.931 --> 02:38:35.700
you know that the Q and a part is straight up golden because everyone comes
like,

2480
02:38:35.701 --> 02:38:35.881
Hey,

2481
02:38:35.881 --> 02:38:40.410
I had this scenario that's been basically plaguing me for a year and it's just

2482
02:38:40.411 --> 02:38:41.670
causing problems here and you know,

2483
02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:44.580
and everyone has their own one and while they're all unique,

2484
02:38:44.610 --> 02:38:47.910
they all kind of overlap with each other and,
and you guys were like,
okay,

2485
02:38:47.911 --> 02:38:50.550
this is what you do.
This will you do,
this is the answering.
It's like,
Dang,

2486
02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:53.190
we now we have an answer.
We go back to the work in it.

2487
02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:56.460
Like a lot of times it will just solve this one problem that affects all this

2488
02:38:56.461 --> 02:38:58.600
other stuff,
man.
It's,
it's so funny.

2489
02:38:58.940 --> 02:38:59.930
<v 0>It is.</v>

2490
02:38:59.931 --> 02:39:04.430
And when people come and they hear those questions get asked,
and,

2491
02:39:04.431 --> 02:39:08.210
and again,
they're all,
there's always an overlap on the questions,
right?
And,

2492
02:39:08.310 --> 02:39:12.920
and there's overlap on the principals as well,
you know,
covering,
move,
simple,

2493
02:39:12.921 --> 02:39:16.280
prioritize.
Next Xq decentralized command.
Those,

2494
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.250
the explanations can stand alone on themselves,

2495
02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:21.560
but you start getting into real world application,

2496
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:24.980
there's going to be other there.
They're gonna overlap you.

2497
02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:28.790
You need all four of them,
right?
You need all four of them to solve your problem.

2498
02:39:28.791 --> 02:39:32.480
You can't just solve a problem with decentralized command because if you try and

2499
02:39:32.481 --> 02:39:35.060
do that,
you'll make something too complex.
You've got to keep it simple.

2500
02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:35.960
And by the way,

2501
02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:38.390
there's gonna be multiple problems that you're gonna be trying to solve with

2502
02:39:38.391 --> 02:39:40.130
your decentralized command.
So you've got to prioritize and execute.

2503
02:39:40.131 --> 02:39:44.210
So that's the way it is for every,
every problem that you're,
you're suffering.

2504
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:45.141
And then there's,
you know,

2505
02:39:45.141 --> 02:39:49.130
there's obviously other other principles that we build upon that aren't just the

2506
02:39:49.131 --> 02:39:53.730
four laws of combat.
So you gotta get you gotta.

2507
02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.700
That's what's good is when people hear the way that you utilize these tools,

2508
02:39:59.750 --> 02:40:02.490
they learned to utilize them themselves,
right?
That's,

2509
02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:03.231
that's what you're trying to do.

2510
02:40:03.231 --> 02:40:07.480
It's like trying to teach someone to take pictures,
right?
You don't just you,

2511
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:09.470
and I'm saying this because you know I had been talking about cameras.

2512
02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:14.250
You don't just say,
okay,
here point this point.
Set the setting to this.

2513
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:17.400
Set the light over here.
Set this up,
press this button and there's your picture.

2514
02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:19.260
That's cool.
It works.
Now one time,

2515
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:22.530
what happens when I step outside and there's different lighting and what happens

2516
02:40:22.531 --> 02:40:25.680
when the subject is moving?
You got to teach me how to do the job.

2517
02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:29.400
You got to teach me the intricates,
Chrissy's intricacies of it.

2518
02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:30.690
You've got to show me all those things.

2519
02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:34.680
I got to learn how to use that tool and that's what we do at the monster.

2520
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:36.600
You get these various tools.

2521
02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:39.630
You don't just read about them and see what they are.
And say,
okay,

2522
02:40:39.631 --> 02:40:42.960
I understand what this tool is here.
I'm holding this tool in my hand,
it's sharp.

2523
02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:45.210
I can cut with it.
Well guess what else are you can do with this?

2524
02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:48.150
There's a lot of things you can do with these tools that we put out at the

2525
02:40:48.151 --> 02:40:51.810
muster.
We take it to the next level.
So if that's what you're looking for,

2526
02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.730
calm to the monster,
common,
the monster,

2527
02:40:53.731 --> 02:40:58.350
and we got great feedback across the board.
So yeah,
come and get that.

2528
02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:00.420
In the meantime also,

2529
02:41:00.450 --> 02:41:03.700
if there's something that you want to ask or you have a question or you want to

2530
02:41:03.701 --> 02:41:06.760
give some feedback or comment about what we're doing here,
or if you knew,

2531
02:41:06.761 --> 02:41:11.130
if you just want to cruise with Hito with Echo Charles primarily,

2532
02:41:11.131 --> 02:41:14.020
he's kind of the primary cruiser here.
Yes.
Uh,

2533
02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:18.390
we're on the interwebs right now,
today,
yesterday.
We'll be there tomorrow.

2534
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:21.870
Twitter,
Instagram.

2535
02:41:22.890 --> 02:41:24.570
And you know that we also,

2536
02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:27.630
we gotta be on that Facebook [inaudible] and you can get us there.

2537
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:29.190
Echo is at echo.

2538
02:41:29.191 --> 02:41:34.191
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and to close this out for the day,

2539
02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:43.040
thanks.
First of all,

2540
02:41:43.041 --> 02:41:48.041
to all the people in uniform that are out there holding the line against terror,

2541
02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:51.050
against extremism,
against criminals,

2542
02:41:51.051 --> 02:41:56.051
against fire and disaster against accidents and against the unexpected.

2543
02:41:58.040 --> 02:41:58.873
All of you.

2544
02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:03.860
Thank you for keeping us safe and everyone else out there.

2545
02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.210
Thank you for listening.

2546
02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.280
And I would also ask that you be thankful.

2547
02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:17.950
You be thankful for your freedom,

2548
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:20.703
<v 1>okay?</v>

2549
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:25.360
<v 0>Your precious and costly freedom.</v>

2550
02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.960
Because sometimes when something is given to us,
just given to us,

2551
02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:35.473
<v 1>okay,</v>

2552
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:40.250
<v 0>we forget what the cost was.
We'd forget the price that was paid,</v>

2553
02:42:41.470 --> 02:42:41.820
<v 1>okay?</v>

2554
02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:46.310
<v 0>Then there was a path,
a price paid for our freedom,</v>

2555
02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:48.270
a massive price.

2556
02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:52.053
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2557
02:42:52.510 --> 02:42:57.510
<v 0>there are those that paid everything they had for our freedom.</v>

2558
02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:04.420
So don't waste it.
Don't abuse it,

2559
02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:06.400
don't squander it.

2560
02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:11.240
Our time

2561
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:16.120
<v 1>is limited.
Your time here is limited</v>

2562
02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:21.640
and you have this freedom.
You have this gift.

2563
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.480
So what are you going to do with it?

2564
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:31.970
<v 0>What are you going to do with it today?
Right now?</v>

2565
02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:39.970
Ask yourself that question.
Ask

2566
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:44.140
and then go out

2567
02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:47.793
and get after it.

2568
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:52.970
So until next time,

2569
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:57.470
this is echo and Jocko out.
