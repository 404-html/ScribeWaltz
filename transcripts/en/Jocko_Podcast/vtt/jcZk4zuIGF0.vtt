00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.520
This is Jocko podcast number 19 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.820
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.960
<v 0>I want you to think about something</v>

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.910
and I want you to remember it in that is that these books that I review and go

6
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.474
through,

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.530
<v 1>they're written by people,</v>

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.123
real people.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.960
<v 0>They're not movies.</v>

10
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.430
And when you picture what's happening in the book,

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.490
don't picture it as a movie

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.030
cause we get inundated with so much.

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.403
<v 0>Imagery.</v>

15
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.680
<v 0>That we actually think the world is movies and television.</v>

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.110
But these books,

18
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.773
<v 1>they're not</v>

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.430
<v 0>movies.
They're not television,</v>

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.293
<v 1>they're real.</v>

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.320
<v 0>And these things really happened.</v>

22
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.440
They didn't happen on a screen or just in someone's mind and they weren't played

23
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.000
by some actor.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.490
And when I talk about that fear that a soldier and Grazi was feeling,

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.010
it's not part of some script.

26
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.920
<v 0>Isn't just a book.
It's real.</v>

28
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.020
That's a real person.
A person.

29
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
<v 0>Who really had those thoughts and those fears.</v>

31
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.880
And when I rattle off the figure of 800,000 Tutsis killed by the Hutus in the

32
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.110
Rwandan genocide,

33
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.280
that's not just a number.
Those weren't,

34
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.970
<v 1>yeah.</v>

35
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.800
<v 0>Extras in a movie.</v>

36
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.140
<v 1>They were people,</v>

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.240
<v 0>people like you.
And people like me,</v>

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.360
people with families and friends and hopes and dreams and jobs and lives

39
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.393
<v 1>people</v>

40
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.570
<v 0>and so remember that now
as we join [inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220
<v 0>United States Marine Corps recruit.</v>

43
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.960
<v 0>Chuck Tatum,</v>

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.550
November,

46
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.460
1943 at the Marine Corps recruit depot in San Diego,

47
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.743
California.

48
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.540
That bayonet training was a new experience.
None of us would forget.
It was tough,

49
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.660
rugged,
and required perfect physical conditioning.

50
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.090
After we read the bayonet chapter in our guidebook,

51
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.180
corporal leary marched us to the training range along the shore of San Diego Bay

52
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:27.610
to learn this lethal art of war.

53
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.140
I remember one paragraph in the bay in that chapter that got my attention.

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.320
The rifle and bayonet in the hands of a marine become a deadly combination of

55
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:43.150
Spear Sword,
club and shield at night.

56
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.570
This combination weapon could kill silently and with surprise in hand to hand

57
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.040
fighting when the rifle cannot be reloaded and the use of grenades would be

58
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:57.820
impractical,
impractical.
It is the decisive weapon

59
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.010
at these times.
The aggressive bayonet fighter will win.

60
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.390
Leary quietly explained an assault is the critical moment of any combat and a

61
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:15.560
bay and Neto salt executed by determine marines can turn the tide.

62
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.790
Men eager to engage an enemy with cold steel will strike terror in their ranks.

63
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.430
He emphasized four points.
One,

64
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.860
get the blade into the enemy.
It's the blade that kills

65
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.310
to be ruthless,
vicious and fast,

66
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:44.150
and your attack never paused and your attack until you have one.

67
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.500
There is only one winner and a band at fight.
Make sure it's you

68
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.150
seek vital areas,
but don't wait for an opening.

69
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.240
Make one the best killing zones are the throat and the belly are solid rifle

70
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:05.010
butts.
Stroke in the groin will open your enemies guard,
deliver it hard,

71
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.330
and then go for the kill

72
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.270
for protect yourself.
Your rifle and bayonet.

73
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.990
Make a good shield.
Use their protection by dodging and parrying.

74
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.040
But remember the best defense is to attack first,

75
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.920
strike the first blow and follow through.

76
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.980
So they're trained in these young marines,

77
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:29.100
obviously since 1943 they're getting ready to go and fight.

78
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.590
They know for a fact they're getting ready to go and fight.

79
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.580
And you can see the psychological aspect of bayonet training and you know it is

80
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.400
an absolute,
yeah,
sure you might get in a band that fight.

81
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:45.750
But this is a psychological training to get them aggressive,

82
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.040
to get them in the mindset of striking first to get them in the mindset of

83
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:50.870
killing.

84
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.703
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

85
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.640
<v 0>Cause that's what they're getting ready to go do.</v>

86
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.090
And as they continued to train,

87
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.170
this episode took place.
Now there,

88
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.440
there are a little bit further along and training and here we go.

89
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.990
During a marching break,
one hot afternoon,

90
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.060
a marine remarked screw all the training.

91
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.790
I'm sick and tired of all this pussy footing around.

92
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.220
I want to get overseas and slap me at Jap.

93
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.340
This remark was made in the presence of Sergeant George Lucas,

94
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.370
who immediately caught them off saying,
hold on,
sunny,

95
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.860
let me tell all of you a thing or two about the Japanese soldier.
Number one,

96
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.700
he's not the caricature you see in the newspapers with bombs,

97
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.380
sight glasses and buck teeth.

98
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.190
The average Japanese soldier has five or more years of combat experience.

99
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.190
Their army doesn't have a boot.
Does division like ours?

100
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.810
Don't forget the jabs of already conquered half of the nations in Asia.

101
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.210
Remember Pearl Harbor,
not only are they better trained than you are right now.

102
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
Many are old hands at combat fighting and have a strict military code.

103
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.670
They live and die by called Bushido.

104
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.800
Literally translated.

105
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.830
It means way of the warrior with their code combined with their pledge to die

106
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.940
for the emperor who they consider God.

107
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.430
They will die before surrendering.

108
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.650
JAP soldiers are well equipped and are experts with their weapons.

109
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.060
They are trained to endure hardships which would have most of you guys writing

110
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:32.510
your congressmen.
I don't like jabs,

111
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.030
but I respect them as fellow soldiers.

112
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.110
I learned my respect the hard way on Guadalcanal.

113
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.870
Jeff's Japs are the worst.

114
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.900
The world's best snipers experts at the art of camouflage and get by on a diet

115
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.860
of fish heads and rice.

116
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.990
They will never surrender and we'll commit Harry Carey rather than being taken

117
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.650
prisoner.
Heck,
they don't even have Korman.

118
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.250
If they are wounded,
they're considered damaged goods.

119
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.290
So Sunny,

120
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.590
mull that over and don't ever let me hear you complain about your training

121
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.494
again.

122
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.510
There'll be a time when your life will depend on what you learned in the days

123
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.343
ahead.

124
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.293
That's,

125
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.713
<v 1>yeah.</v>

126
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.720
<v 0>Obviously anyone that's listening that's in the military,</v>

127
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.460
that's in law enforcement.

128
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.850
That's a message you need to get to your younger troopers,

129
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.340
that the training that you're doing your life may very well depend on it at some

130
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:44.290
point in the,
in the future,
in the near future,
in the far future,
you don't know,

131
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.600
but you got to take advantage of it.

132
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.800
Now we get to win a chuck Tatum is done with bootcamp and he's checking in and

133
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:01.290
he meets a American hero on my third day at Pendleton.

134
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.630
This is Camp Pendleton.
For those of you that don't know what that is,

135
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.020
it's in southern California.
On my third day at Pendleton,

136
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:10.440
I was sitting on my bunk when I heard footsteps echoing through the empty

137
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:11.100
barracks.

138
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.760
I looked up and through the hallway came a cheerful looking marine in dress

139
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.900
greens on his arm where the Chevrons of a platoon sergeant,

140
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.790
a hash mark,
a dormed one sleeve and combat red ribbons decorated his left chest,

141
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.390
the lump.
This is his buddies called the lump.

142
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.690
The lump and I jumped to immediate attention after spotting the sergeant stripes

143
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:35.280
on his sleeve,
looking straight at us,
a smile crossing his lips.

144
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.460
The new rival said quietly and with authority.
Addys men.

145
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.320
How's everything going on platoon,
platoon sergeant John Baz alone.

146
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:44.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.860
<v 0>He was Husky with geneal,</v>

148
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.780
handsome looks and his uniform.
Had a comfortable traveled look.

149
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.060
I noticed strands of jet black curly hair peeking out from under his garrison

150
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:59.160
cap,
which was set at a cocky angle.

151
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

152
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.730
<v 0>While I responded to his greeting,
it hit me.</v>

153
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.070
I was in the presence of a Marine Corps legend Manila.

154
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:13.071
John Bows alone was the first marine enlisted man to receive the medal of honor

155
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.860
in World War II for actions on Guadalcanal.

156
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.320
We had heard about him in bootcamp.

157
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.310
<v 0>I never had the courage to ask basil loan directly why he had received the medal</v>

159
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:30.140
of honor on the canal.
I didn't have to ask.
I already knew.

160
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.590
All American knew his story was required reading in every red blooded household.

161
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.340
Sergeant John Basel loons metal of honor citation,

162
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:48.480
read while the enemy was hammering at the marines.
Defensive positions.

163
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.870
Sergeant Basil alone in charge of two sections of heavy machine guns,

164
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.650
fought valiantly to check the savage and determine result assault

165
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.660
witnesses who investigated the results of the night action during daylight.

166
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.690
Remarked on the gruesome evidence of wholesale slaughter of Japanese soldiers in

167
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:10.100
front of Basel owns position.

168
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.110
They counted 38 riddled and mangled enemy bodies and credited to the kills to

169
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:20.230
the fighting sergeant using a 45 caliber pistol and his faithful machine guns.

170
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.460
This remarkable feat was accomplished during the night when Basil alone was at

171
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:28.340
the same time changing spent machine gun barrels,

172
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.180
clearing jams and running barefoot for Ammo to keep his sections,

173
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:33.740
guns spitting death.

174
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.700
And so if you know anything about Basil,
Oh,
and after he did that on Guadalcanal,

175
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.500
he,
they pulled him back to America,
right?

176
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:46.930
And what they would pull them back to America,
it was,

177
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.810
was basically go around and make speeches.
And all this is documented very well,

178
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:53.000
uh,
or,
or imitated,
very,

179
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.590
or shown very well in the movie,

180
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.560
the Pacific or the series that Pacific.

181
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:02.350
So he gets pulled back to America and they make him go out.

182
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:06.580
And do these war bond speeches and ease.

183
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.750
He's not having a good time.
It's not who he is,
right?
He's,
he's just,
uh,

184
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.780
a guy that wants to get after it.

185
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.740
And so he literally goes to go to his commanders and says,
listen,

186
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.110
I want to go back to fight.
I want to go back to the war.
And by the way,

187
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:22.540
when he was doing those bond sales,
he was living,
you know,

188
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.680
a complete life of luxuries.

189
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:27.670
He was meeting movie stars and he was getting treated like a movie star and all

190
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:30.520
that did nothing for him.
He wanted to go back to the fight.

191
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.400
So he ends up going back.
Now some of the other training,

192
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.050
I had to throw this in there,

193
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.370
one of the other sergeants that was helping train them was a guy named Bissonnet

194
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.350
and among business other towns was it was his ability to instruct us in the art

195
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:52.351
of Jujitsu Beers taught us how to escape a half Nelson headlock by relaxing,

196
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.640
holding our arms straight and letting our body go limp.
Once out of the hold,

197
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.970
we could reach back and pull the legs out from underneath our attacker.

198
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.820
Then by pulling out a k bar knife biz showed us how to dispatch our assailant.

199
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.240
So what you back then learning a little bit of the Jujitsu.

200
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.530
All I know a lot of people will recognize that that move if you're trained,

201
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.120
and all of this of course was to prepare for this island hopping campaign in the

202
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:27.680
Pacific.
That's what it was.
And
for Chuck Tatum,

203
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.280
that started on the black sands of [inaudible].

204
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.070
So they hit the beach on the Jima,
you know,

205
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:47.280
after the workup going overseas,
more training in Hawaii,

206
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.680
they finally get to this point where they hit the beach

207
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.860
and here he is on the beach for the first time.
And here's what chuck Tatum says.

208
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.910
I noticed a loan marine walking back and forth on the shore among hundreds of

209
00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:04.470
preowned figures kicking behinds,
shouting,
crosswords and demanding move out,

210
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:06.060
get your butts off the beach.

211
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.310
He gave the Marine Corps hand signal for follow me.
A group of men responded,

212
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.330
fascinated.

213
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.480
I wondered why he wasn't digging in like the rest of us as he advanced as he

214
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:18.240
advanced.

215
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.240
I recognize that the solitary marine was none other than Gunnery Sergeant John

216
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.073
Basilone,

217
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.820
Charlie company's living legend and the Marine Corps icon was headed toward me

218
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:34.080
and Steve has dungarees were freshly washed and irons his helmet,

219
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.820
his helmet strap was on hooked.

220
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.630
He held a carb carbine in his left hand and he had already ditched his

221
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:41.010
cumbersome gas mask.

222
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.690
Moslem wore a light field pack and showed no fear as if this invasion was no

223
00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:47.760
more than a serious training maneuver.

224
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.120
I also saw Colonel Lewis Sea,
the 27th marines,

225
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.680
executive officer,
he and Basil Own.

226
00:14:55.681 --> 00:14:59.600
We're the only two men standing up shouting obscenity is in orders.

227
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.260
The forward surge of Basil ohms group carried them to our position.

228
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.970
Only bassline and plain defied the firestorm raging around us.

229
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.710
Move out,
move out,
get the hell off the beach.
You dumb sons of bitches.

230
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.160
They screamed,
kicking us,
running the butts right and left

231
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.590
what I thought was yet another mortar shell falling in the same spot as before.

232
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.990
Exploded 75 feet in front of Steve and me.

233
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.210
The blast shockwave whipped up black dirt that pushed its way into my eyes and

234
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:31.430
for sand into my mouth,
making me gag.

235
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.610
It was uncomfortable and nasty,
but my worry wasn't for myself.
I hope that dirt,

236
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:40.760
what wouldn't foul our weapon,
Basil and ran up,

237
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:44.090
whacked me on the helmet and pointed to the area where I thought the mortar

238
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:48.800
shells had been regularly hitting only when the sand and dust cleared.

239
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.370
I could see that Basil and was pointing at the aperture of a reinforced concrete

240
00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:54.290
bunker or block house.

241
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.920
The structure probably how's a 75 millimeter or larger cannon who's fueled the

242
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:01.040
fire,
was directed down the beach to our right.

243
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.510
It was a big bastard with incredible killing power.
It stills,

244
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:08.510
we're stalling the advance it by killing men of the fourth division.

245
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.420
It may have been firing tree bursts,

246
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
which is basically anti-personnel shrapnel that explodes in the sky and rains

247
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:18.921
down.

248
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:23.921
Hail on ground troops running 35 feet to the spot picked by basil,

249
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.800
and our field of fire was now diagonal to the aperture of the blockhouse cannon.

250
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.250
We opened fire again and the tracer rounds,
we're right on target now.

251
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:36.251
I was pleased my bullets forced the enemy gunners to close their gun port with

252
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.560
their arm report closed.
The front of the block house was blind,

253
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.510
even though it was temporarily out of commission.
I still wanted to fire at it,

254
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.120
Basil and signal to me to commence firing again and I directed.

255
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.410
And then he directed a flame thrower,
operator corporate,
William Peg,

256
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.670
a marine of imposing size to repeat their precarious path taken by the demo man

257
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:01.910
along our line of streaking bullets.
So you've got some cover and move going on.

258
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.600
You've got chuck Tatum laying down fire and now you've got to a flame thrower

259
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:08.120
operator.
And if you know anything about those flame throwers,

260
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:11.120
they're carrying big giant.
It looks like scuba tanks on their backs.

261
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.600
They weighed 70 or 80 pounds and obviously these are prime targets,

262
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.340
you know,
for the enemy because the enemy hates these things.

263
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.410
So if you're wearing one of these things on your back,
you're,

264
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.470
you're getting sniper shots at you and everyone's trying to kill you.

265
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.590
Basil and whacked me on the helmet to signal cease firing.
I didn't want to quit.

266
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.020
Everything was working perfectly.
Why stop?

267
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.170
I could see tracer rounds pounding into the building and left and felt extreme

268
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:38.960
satisfaction with my accomplishment.
Nevertheless,

269
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.770
I ceased firing is ordered and peg peg is the guy carrying the,

270
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.090
the flame thrower staggered under the 70 pound weight of his tanks and
equipment.

271
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.980
Cautiously moved toward the shattered bunkered walls,

272
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.400
sticking his flame thrower nozzle into the smoldering hole.

273
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.450
He ignited his napalm releasing 350 pounds per square inch of pressure in his

274
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.284
tanks.

275
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.110
There was a loud roar of the sound and it looked like a fire spitting dragons.

276
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:09.111
Jaw erupted the unsuspecting and stun men inside didn't know the horror that was

277
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.410
about to engulf them.

278
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:15.120
They were cast instantly in the center of a roaring inferno and incinerating

279
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:19.980
searing hell.
I felt a surge of elation when the flame shot inside.

280
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.960
It wasn't because the gruesome conflagration and agony that we're about to

281
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:27.510
overwhelm the enemy,
but because of our success,

282
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.660
no one could live through po pegs,
Napalm,
Pyre,
Sergeant Basil,

283
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.730
and had directed this operation by the book exactly the way we'd practice it at

284
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:39.780
Pendleton and Camp Tarawa.
So it's perfect covered move.

285
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.070
And the reason he sees his fire is because you have to cease fire so that the,

286
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.910
so that the guy with a flameflower can actually get close enough because when

287
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:49.080
you're shooting at that building,

288
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:52.260
there's ricochets going all over the place so that he has to cease fire at the

289
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:54.870
last moment so the guy can get right up close

290
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.630
as I lay prone again,
ready to fire basil and stood astride my back,

291
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:02.190
startling me bending over.

292
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:05.850
He grabbed the machine gun bail in one hand with a practice motion,

293
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.910
unlocked the tripod,
releasing the gun.
He screamed in my ear,

294
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.890
get the belt and follow me.
Basil own,
ran toward the roof of the old block house,

295
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.710
grabbed what was left of the cloth ammo belt,
my arms,

296
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.140
and I followed him at a gallop up the slopes of the ruined in placement standing

297
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.140
on top.
We could look down on the rear entrance.

298
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.520
This is the rear entrance of the pill box.
There was a low area,

299
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.630
30 feet in diameter where some of the Japanese defenders had run to escape the

300
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:38.490
blistering inferno inside Basil and cut them down.
Firing from the hip.

301
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.390
The machine gun vibrated it's powerful arms.
He sprayed the enemy.

302
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:44.970
Soldiers helped by the basil loan bail,

303
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.140
a wooden handle fascinated by wire to the barrel of the weapon that was inspired

304
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:52.200
by Basil owns metal of honor engagement on canal.

305
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.790
When he was burned carrying the hot machine gun.
Without the bail,

306
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:59.730
it would've been nearly impossible to control the blistering machine gun when

307
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.230
it's tripod was taken off.

308
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:07.310
Mowing down the screaming Japs was purely a mercy slang pitifully.

309
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.630
The men were frantically trying to wipe away the still flaming jelly gasoline

310
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:14.550
sticking to their tortured bodies.

311
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.110
The putrid smell of burning human flesh nearly made me want to vomit.

312
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.870
Basil loans,
eyes continue to fury I had never seen before.

313
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.240
His jaw was rigid,
clenched hard and sweat.
Glisten done his forehead.

314
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.880
He was not an executioner,

315
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.300
but a true marine performing his duty for me and others who saw Sergeant Basil

316
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:42.960
owns actions during our assault.
His leadership and courage were overwhelming.

317
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.660
Meanwhile,
Charlie Company,

318
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:49.630
riflemen and Steve Evanson shot the Japs is they screamed in agony.

319
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.930
Intense.
Oh,
salts.

320
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.320
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

321
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.700
<v 0>just completely intense.
And again,</v>

322
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.320
this is a guy that's already won the medal of honor and he's out there taking

323
00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:10.890
charge and leading troops.
He has no B,
had no,
um,

324
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.310
was not required to be there.
He could be back in the states with,
you know,

325
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:19.380
in Hollywood rubbing elbows with the,
with the,
with the movie stars.

326
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.360
But no,
there,
there he is back in combat.
Back on it.
You Owe Jima and leading.

327
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

328
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.850
<v 0>We came under intense fire from a gun,</v>

329
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.480
from gun placements on the slope of Mount Suribachi less than a mile away and

330
00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:37.860
took shelter in a crater made by one of our own 16 inch guns from a or a very

331
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:42.861
large bomb mortar rounds fired from enemy positions at the north end of the

332
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:47.790
runway.
Started to fall in our immediate area.
We knew someone was watching us.

333
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.530
On top of everything else,
we began receiving incoming fire from off shore,

334
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.700
US Navy vessels.
These were not misguided rounds.

335
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.650
We had moved so far and fast that this rolling barrage that was intended for the

336
00:22:01.651 --> 00:22:04.860
entrenched Japanese defenders was now hitting us.

337
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.620
So now we were bracketed by Sarah Bace,

338
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.640
by the enemy held high ground to the north and by our own navy.

339
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.420
I always want to bring up these points of of blue on blue and how chaotic it is.

340
00:22:20.421 --> 00:22:22.520
No one realizes that.

341
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.380
How hard it is to deconflict fires in combat.

342
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.310
<v 0>Back to the book of the three dangers we faced,
I feared our navy the most.</v>

344
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.210
I'd already seen the destructive power that their shells caused when they

345
00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:40.310
pounded the Japs beach defenses.

346
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:45.560
I firmly believed we'd be killed if we stayed inside our giant shell hole with

347
00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:48.140
what seemed to be an instant common consent.

348
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.720
Everyone in our small groups started to fall back.

349
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.130
Basil alone stopped the retrograde movement in our tracks by ordering.

350
00:22:55.131 --> 00:22:59.900
Dig in and hold this ground.
Come hell or high water.
I'll go back for more men.

351
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.060
<v 0>Manila.
John's perfect.
That was a John Basel.
His nickname was Manila.</v>

353
00:23:09.061 --> 00:23:10.500
John Manila.

354
00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:14.490
John's professional combat expertise had broken up a human log jam on the beach

355
00:23:14.491 --> 00:23:16.980
and wiped out a major Japanese defense position.

356
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.390
Now his moral leadership would hold together a small group of green troops and

357
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.500
advanced position.

358
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

359
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.070
<v 0>I gingerly peered from our position toward the landing beach 75 yards away.</v>

360
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.600
A group of Marines was advancing toward the runway with Baz alone in the lead.

361
00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.050
<v 1>Okay,</v>

362
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.270
<v 0>this is so,
so basil on it.
God back,</v>

363
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.090
get more troops and now they're coming back to their position.

364
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.650
I felt momentary elation,
gunny basil,
and was coming back with more men.

365
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.200
Then I heard enemy rounds falling to earth from the relative safety of our shell

366
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:56.060
hole.
I watched in horror as the explosions tour.
Basil owns body apart.

367
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.510
It was awful.
It looked like sergeant Baz loan was down.

368
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.183
<v 1>Okay?</v>

369
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.850
<v 0>Sometime that afternoon,
the word reached us basil loans,</v>

370
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:16.790
dead,
America's hero dead.

371
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.100
My own hero killed.
How could he be dead?

372
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

373
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.890
<v 0>I couldn't believe it.</v>

374
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.500
The legend of Basil alone alleging born in the jungles of Guata canal,

375
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.600
the hero I had read about and bootcamp who stature had grown larger on the black

376
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:39.260
and bloody sands of [inaudible].
As I held the machine gun belt for him,

377
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.420
<v 1>okay?</v>

378
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.380
<v 0>He was gone.
We will all miss you.</v>

379
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.450
I fought as tears cut paths down.
My grime covered face.

380
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.160
I thought of Basil owns cocky smile,
curly black hair,

381
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.150
and the way he wore his hat at a jaunty angle over one year,

382
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.290
he had a unique personal style and charisma

383
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.370
for me at least.
No one could ever be like Baz alone

384
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.830
America,
the United States Marine Corps and Charlie company.

385
00:25:13.831 --> 00:25:18.831
First Battalion 27th marines had lost a hero dead at 29

386
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.093
<v 1>okay.</v>

387
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.460
<v 0>Basil,
lonesome death strengthen our makeshift squad.</v>

388
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:35.010
Resolve showed on the faces of 17 marines,
told to hold our position,

389
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.810
come hell or high water.
We were receiving fire from all quarters.

390
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.070
The shells were pouring

391
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:42.740
<v 1>okay</v>

392
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.760
<v 0>in on us,
which shrieks and a house and shredding the earth around us.</v>

393
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.800
Enemy gunners on Suribachi now turned their ballistic attentions on us using

394
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.500
observed and directed fire from their lava layer.

395
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.170
Five inch shells from ships mingled in the brew of devastation smashing across

396
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:01.280
the La landscape.

397
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.920
Sarah bace defenders continued shooting at us while Japanese mortar men north of

398
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:10.730
the airfield pursued their deadly pounding of the marines along the beach.

399
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.040
The invasion area was a tangle of equipment and supplies,

400
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.130
smashed vehicles and sunken naval craft reserve and support units continue to

401
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:26.120
pile up and congested mess thousands of men.

402
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.950
The dead,
the wounded,

403
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.900
the terrified and those trying to unload supplies swarmed over the black sand.

404
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.010
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

405
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.770
<v 0>we are now targeted by our navy's gun fire.</v>

406
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.860
I wasn't sure of the size and bore of the projectiles or if emanated from a

407
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:45.300
battleship or destroyer,

408
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.950
but I did know that they chilled my blood as they came shrieking in.

409
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.330
We would be safer if we withdrew to establish lines so that we would be behind

410
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.940
incentive in front of the navy shells.

411
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:04.510
But sergeant Basilone had ordered us to stay and that alone was sufficient

412
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.830
enough reason to remain.
None of us would disobey his direct order.

413
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.540
We believed it was only a matter of time before others would reach us and we'd

414
00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:17.570
be free to move on.

415
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.443
Brutal.

416
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.290
<v 0>And and by the way,
this is,
this is an example,</v>

418
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:32.690
this is chuck Tatum's first combat experience.

419
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.420
His first combat experience you use out of boot camp,

420
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:39.230
did some training in Hawaii,
did some training on Tarawa and then boom,

421
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.390
here he is.
Back to the book.
Turning to my right,

422
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.330
I saw an inspiring sight,

423
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.640
survivors of our Bravo company with sergeant window out in front followed by

424
00:27:52.641 --> 00:27:55.850
Lloyd heard and the ammo carriers were approaching us.

425
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.420
What we were witnessing where the remnants of Baker company,

426
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.490
we were happily reunited with her.
And the other ammo carriers,

427
00:28:04.491 --> 00:28:07.880
but devastated by the news.
Our company,

428
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:10.970
it's suffered severe losses during the beach of salt.

429
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.830
We had 17 men killed and 51 wounded

430
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.370
couple hours in 17 killed and 51 wounded,

431
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.410
so now we're ease.
Reflecting on what this morning is feeling like.

432
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.510
Our first morning on [inaudible] when we were paying helplessly by mortar

433
00:28:38.511 --> 00:28:40.610
barrages on the black sand beaches,

434
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.290
we were reminded of warnings by veterans who said the Japs are the world's best

435
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:50.270
soldiers with a knee mortar though chilling those warnings worn,

436
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.290
exaggerated,

437
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.720
even the blunt advice of the vets didn't convey the pure horror of an enemy

438
00:28:56.721 --> 00:29:00.770
mortar attack.
It was pure hell to be caught in the open.

439
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.910
When the Japs opened up with a full mortar attack,

440
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.000
the sound of mortars,
Swish,
swishing through the air froze my blood

441
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.030
against these invisible missiles.
There was no defense.

442
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.610
If we were caught in the open,
all we could do is hit the deck.

443
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.160
A foxhole offered little protection from these high trajectory missiles because

444
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:29.200
they dropped straight down on us.

445
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.300
Again.
This is a lack of control of your environment.

446
00:29:35.301 --> 00:29:40.190
We've heard this over and over again.
The indirect fire,

447
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:41.030
the mortars,

448
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:46.050
the artillery that you can't control and it's random and that's the most

449
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:48.490
horrifying thing to everybody.

450
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.040
The rear areas,

451
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:57.510
particularly the eastern or landing beaches where support forces were working,

452
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:01.830
suffered a bloody pounding,
sunken broach,

453
00:30:01.831 --> 00:30:04.470
landing craft,
piled up along the beaches,

454
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.520
multimillions of dollars worth of valuable equipment and vessels had been

455
00:30:08.521 --> 00:30:13.521
systematically wrecked by deadly accurate Japanese shelling debris washed

456
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.420
ideally back and forth in the frothing surf human wreckage.

457
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.160
The wounded,
dead and dying littered the cold sand.

458
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

459
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.170
<v 0>engineers,</v>

460
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.940
CBS and shore party personnel struggled to create order from chaos.

461
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.350
Doctors and Korman too often fought a losing battle against a grim reach.

462
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.070
Reaper watching over our battlefield,

463
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.240
armed with simple field dressings and infusions of hold blood,

464
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.200
they tried to stem the tide of human suffering and life's blood pouring into

465
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.740
ilos lava hide

466
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.050
are Korman turned into angels of mercy.

467
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.990
They saved hundreds of marines daily and tried to ease the pain of the hopeless

468
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:04.870
cases with liberal injections of morphine.

469
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.673
<v 1>Now,</v>

470
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.010
<v 0>well,
there's obviously a famous picture from you.
Oh,</v>

471
00:31:11.011 --> 00:31:13.480
GM of the marines raising the flag on one on one corner.

472
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:16.410
And I think raising the flag Max,
it was a coreman raising the flag on it.

473
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:18.210
You Owe Jima and

474
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.770
this is what it looked like for him.

475
00:31:21.771 --> 00:31:25.550
And this does not mean you get the impression that the fighting was over with,

476
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:28.590
that the fighting was not over you when you look at the picture.
Yeah.

477
00:31:28.591 --> 00:31:32.060
When you looking at better.
Okay.
We won.
We hadn't,
we weren't even close yet.
Hmm.

478
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.620
But they did take a prominent terrain feature and this is what it was like for

479
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.860
Chuck Tatum as a 26 marines press their attack.

480
00:31:39.861 --> 00:31:42.350
Enemy mortars began falling in our rest area.

481
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.640
Japanese weapons were capable of firing from one end of the island to the other

482
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.300
with thousands of marines crawling around in concentrated areas.

483
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.390
It was an easy task to keep our advancing troops under fire from our reserve

484
00:31:55.761 --> 00:31:56.990
positions near the beach.

485
00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.820
It was possible to witness the battle raging for the possession of Mount

486
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.570
Suribachi through sergeant Windells field classes.

487
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.690
We took turns watching the upward progress of our men as they approached the

488
00:32:09.691 --> 00:32:11.600
steep rocky slopes.

489
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.560
It appeared that the 28th marines were at the base of the volcano haze from the

490
00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:19.520
battle obscured my vision,

491
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.250
but we could tell that it was one hell of a fight going on.

492
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:28.660
<v 0>It felt sickening to be in reserve watching a battle where men were dying almost</v>

494
00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:30.170
before our eyes.

495
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.440
<v 0>It kind of seemed like watching a motion picture from the wrong end of a</v>

497
00:32:34.441 --> 00:32:36.420
telescope,
if that makes any sense.

498
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.650
At about 10:00 AM Steve Slap

499
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.780
<v 1>me on the back and pointed Turd.
Suribachi shouting Tatum.
Do you see that?</v>

500
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.650
<v 0>I twist it around and saw the stars and stripes clearly on the peak waving in</v>

501
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.860
the breeze,
the 28th marines,

502
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.010
we're now king of [inaudible] was hill

503
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:04.620
cheers from thousands of marines and roared and reverberated across the island.

504
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.960
I felt a surge of pride.

505
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:11.790
I was proud to be a marine and proud to be an American fighting on he will,

506
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.760
but we weren't attending a picnic.

507
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.240
Live shells were still dropping on us throughout.
He,
well,

508
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:24.380
Steve and I soon forgot the flag raising as we Bisley re-engineered our fox

509
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:26.580
hole,
digging deeper into mother.

510
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.580
He because like it or not,

511
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.530
the word was that the Japanese still occupied more of the woe than the marines

512
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.600
to prove that they were still the main landlord.

513
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.340
The enemy sent a message via concentrated artillery and mortar attack.

514
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.540
Now a couple of days go by and

515
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:07.230
Chuck Tatum's feet are getting messed up from being in socks and dirt wet and so

516
00:34:09.211 --> 00:34:10.090
he need to get some,

517
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.070
some clean socks and there's basically one place to get them.

518
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:22.210
Given the condition of my feet,
I knew additional socks were imperative.

519
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.840
I asked sergeant window for permission to make a run to the dead man or casually

520
00:34:28.061 --> 00:34:29.470
pile to look for a pair.

521
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.580
The dead man or casually pile contained clothing,

522
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.090
equipment and weapons of dead or wounded marines.

523
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.320
I had to go a quarter of a mile and as I hobbled there,

524
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:46.090
I felt uneasy in a bit guilty about the prospect of being a scavenger,

525
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.350
but I had no choice.

526
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.330
The demands and horrors of elbows,
battlefield left,

527
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:57.390
no other ready solution to the problem of resupply.

528
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.100
I hesitantly picked up a pack only to drop it instantly.

529
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.770
There was a bullet hole straight through it.

530
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

531
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.570
<v 0>I found another one intact and solely lifted it.</v>

532
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.630
Trying to see the stenciled name of its previous owner.

533
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.570
Curiosity got the best of me.

534
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.500
It wasn't anyone I knew undoing the straps.

535
00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:21.540
I carefully remove the contents.

536
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.120
There were two perfectly clean and dry pair of green wool socks.
Uh,

537
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.650
so you Lloyd folder lay at the bottom of the pack and it felt the ground.

538
00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:35.700
As I shook out the contents,
I opened the folder.

539
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.450
A photo of a smiling girl beamed at me.

540
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.340
All my love to Joe Maryland

541
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.540
was neatly written across the bottom of the photograph.

542
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.810
I carefully replaced the folder in the pack instead of prayer for Joe and

543
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:55.644
Maryland.

544
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.553
Yeah,

545
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.900
you're taking gear from dead and wounded marines.

546
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.740
Now they're out continuing to press through.

547
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:26.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

548
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.260
<v 0>Continuing to make slow progress,</v>

549
00:36:29.261 --> 00:36:33.580
but they are making progress leaving or machine guns.

550
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.480
We spread out in an infantry style formation to comb the area.

551
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.420
Our search for snipers was fruitless,

552
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.500
but we did find a dead enemy soldier in a clump of bushes.

553
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.230
The smell rotting his corpse almost made me puke.

554
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.590
The stench could gag.
A maggot.

555
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:58.710
Steve said bloated the body was a spider trap

556
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.100
and almost unrecognizable as having been a human being.

557
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.130
His uniform was charred,
so I thought that it might have been,

558
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.990
he might have been hit by a flame thrower.

559
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.100
Bloating had caused the tunic buttons of the cadavers uniform to pop off there.

560
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.080
No,
it was no skin on what had been the face,

561
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.630
but the putrid flesh had scabbed over.

562
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.360
Swarms of flies were attacking the torso and maggots were wiggling in the eyes.

563
00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.980
I guess we were lucky you will had no buzzards a rifle lay beside the body.

564
00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.450
No one touched it.
They might be booby trap.

565
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.430
Don't screw with it.

566
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.100
Later resting in our reserve area.
I looked at my watch,

567
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.180
saw it was 3:30 PM and decided to eat a k ration.

568
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.090
Seeing the body of dead jabs had become so common place.

569
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.810
I could erase this one from my thoughts.
It had nothing to do with me.

570
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.570
I had become as hardened to death as an undertaker.

571
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.670
Moving on,
pausing to consolidate.

572
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.360
The men were hit with grenades,
mortars and machine gun fire.

573
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:24.730
From there explode flanks and rear

574
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.870
and this is taking place as there

575
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.960
performing an assault on a hill.
Cleverly,

576
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:43.020
the Japanese had sprung a trap mortar fire from behind three 62 alpha.

577
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.500
That's the name of the hill.

578
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.340
Caves in front of the cliff opened up and Alva companies.

579
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:49.870
First platoon was the hardest hit,

580
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:53.480
incurring heavy casualties at 1:30 PM uh,

581
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:58.180
Alpha company had to pull back as quickly as the hail of machine gun fire and

582
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:02.950
bullets would allow
more.
Men were lost trying to save the wounded.

583
00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:10.070
The work that had gone into arming and fortifying hit hill three 62 alpha.

584
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.870
The Japanese version of the Maginot Line in France was awesome and it was

585
00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:18.800
serving its designers purpose.
It was stopping the marines.

586
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.030
The trap sprang shut and we were in it.

587
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.960
Japanese mortars winged in greeting our attack.

588
00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.820
We took cover machine guns and rifle fire rep did from every crack and crevice

589
00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:33.440
and hill three 62 alpha.

590
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:38.390
The mountain was spewing death and destruction from every Fisher and his

591
00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:42.320
volcanic hide.
There was no way to fight back.

592
00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:45.950
We couldn't see our enemy,
but they could see us.

593
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.080
And they had us dead in their sites.

594
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.130
We scrambled over the rocky terrain without cover.

595
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:57.050
Steve and van carried our machine gun followed by pops with comb and Lloyd heard

596
00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.700
our ammo bearers and orchestra of marine and Jap mortars,

597
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.330
machine guns,
rifles and artillery creator roaring,
shrieking,

598
00:40:05.331 --> 00:40:09.560
clamor inducing terror throughout the ranks,

599
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.210
stopping our forward momentum

600
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.680
with mounting casualties at nightfall approaching.

601
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.550
We consolidated our positions and dug in.

602
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.820
We were literally nose to nose with our mortal enemies.

603
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.020
Some of the enemy physicians were less than 40 feet in front of us.

604
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.300
The days fight had cost.

605
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:34.301
The battalion an estimated 100 casualties for a gain of 200 yards.

606
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.870
A typical days fighting on a UL

607
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.050
going forward.
Continuing to push

608
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:51.580
back to the book mortar machine gun and targeted rifle fire torn to the company.

609
00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.560
Men started dropping on all sides,

610
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:59.000
dirt writ that my eyes and the clamor of explosions in bullets pounded against

611
00:40:59.001 --> 00:40:59.930
my ears.

612
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.490
The Ridge we faced a lot was alive with an enemy that was impossible to see or

613
00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:09.020
kill.
Captain May and shine kept forward,
crept forward.

614
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.500
He could see the chaos and disorder of our situation standing up with a cool,

615
00:41:14.751 --> 00:41:17.000
purposeful manner.
He took charge.

616
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.360
He looked as calm as though he were directing a training maneuver.

617
00:41:20.361 --> 00:41:23.570
At Camp Pendleton,
we organizing the company.

618
00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.330
He directed a withdrawal from our untenable position.

619
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.600
He seemed to be everywhere at the proper moment moment,

620
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.140
personally assisting wounded,
making sure everyone got out of the Japs.

621
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:40.880
Captain Jimmy May in shine,
never ran out of courage and his selfless,

622
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.180
heroic actions saved.
Bravo company from destruction,

623
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.940
but he did run out of luck.
He was the last man still in the trap.

624
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.090
When he attempted to withdrawal towards our line,

625
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.880
Japanese soldiers used him for target practice.

626
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.850
Riddling his chest with multiple bullet wounds,
killing him,

627
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.710
reacting to the loss of our favorite officer.

628
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.220
The company found a collective fury and determination.

629
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.290
We organized,

630
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:14.210
we rushed to the offensive because we were too close for artillery,

631
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:15.950
fire support or airstrikes.

632
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.390
The fight developed in a classic as a classic marine infantry attack,

633
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.910
small clusters of men advanced by fire and fast movement until they found an

634
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:29.990
obliterated each concealed strong point or individual enemy,
soldier

635
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.970
van's gun.
Suddenly stopped looking their way.

636
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.950
I saw that he and Steve were down.

637
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.700
Suddenly I was overwhelmed with rage and all the anger I had stored up against

638
00:42:44.221 --> 00:42:48.300
the Japanese burst out without fog or hesitation,

639
00:42:48.301 --> 00:42:50.850
I sprinted into vans position.

640
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.410
Van had been hitting the back near the right shoulder and the rounded exited his

641
00:42:55.411 --> 00:43:00.240
left side.
Steve had been gut shot twice and it was white with shock.

642
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:01.980
By reflex.

643
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:07.050
He was holding his hands to his stomach to stem the bleeding blood poured out

644
00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:11.460
around his fingers.
As he pulled his legs into the fetal position,

645
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.730
I could see the pain on his pinched face knowing that the Japs would shoot

646
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:20.130
Steven van as they rolled around on the ground.

647
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.050
I grabbed their machine gun into my arms and fired from the hip like Basilone

648
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.210
did.
Sending led into the cave to suppress enemy fire.

649
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.400
I was in a hot rage and swivel the gun about so it's bullets would ricochet

650
00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:35.880
throughout the cave and decimate those bastards who shot my friends.

651
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.500
Clouds of rock dust bill owed from the caves mouth.

652
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.720
I poured fire into the caves,

653
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:47.670
black mouth until the belt round out for a second.
I stood there,

654
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.400
the 30 cows barrel smoking,

655
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:56.490
the jabs who had shot Steve and van were silent.
Nothing came from the cave.

656
00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.820
No bonzai charges,
no moans,
nothing,

657
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.650
just smoke and dust.

658
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:10.070
My sense is returned,
dropping the gun.
I turned to Steve and van.

659
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.140
I knew they were dying.
I screamed.
Corpsman

660
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.660
with the cow with the cave suppressed and the area safe dock marsh ran to Steve

661
00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:21.590
and knelt over him.

662
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:26.090
Then turned to van seconds tick past seeming like hours.

663
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.290
I waited for docs,

664
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:32.291
orders her grant out to join us and me and marsh drag van and Steve to cover

665
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.050
marsh injected van with morphine.

666
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.200
While I broke open Steve Steve's first aid kit and handed the survey surette to

667
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:46.560
marsh,
he shoved the needle into Steve's flesh.
I screamed,

668
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:51.480
stretcher bearers
this day of violence,

669
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.310
fear killing,
and maiming left me on the edge of despair.

670
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.490
Sergeant Wyndell talk to me in a personal and marine way.

671
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.660
Tatum.
He said,
let's go.
We've got a job to do.

672
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:12.710
My mind slipped into a protective mode when events beyond my control took over.

673
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.870
From that afternoon on,

674
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:19.980
I purposely tried to avoid getting to know the replacement Ammo humper and the

675
00:45:19.981 --> 00:45:22.500
marines filling the slots of those we had lost.

676
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.560
I didn't want to know their names,

677
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.920
where they were from or to see their girlfriends pictures.

678
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.350
I didn't want to get attached to them and suffer through the loss of close

679
00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:35.184
friends again.

680
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.320
The war was still going on 30 feet ahead.

681
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.910
I wanted revenge

682
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.390
unseen.

683
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:53.390
Our enemy continued to punish us as we consolidated our gains for the day and

684
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:57.510
attempted to clear the newly seize territory.
A new private,

685
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.940
a replacement called me to the edge of a bluff.

686
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.380
He had spotted enemy soldiers clustered in a pill box and was trying to show me

687
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:05.214
their location.

688
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.920
I couldn't see what he had found and was siting down his arm while he pointed

689
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.190
our heads side by side.
All of a sudden a crack ring out.

690
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.820
He jerked forward and was dead before I could catch him.

691
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.210
A sniper's bullet had hit him between the eyes.

692
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:28.330
Instinctively.
I called for a corpsman,
although the man was beyond help

693
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.670
when the medic came up,
he said,
I can't take it anymore.

694
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.210
I can't go on if they want to,
they can just shoot me right now.

695
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.510
The blood that covered the medics uniform wasn't his own.

696
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.980
Medics are considered noncombatants under international law,

697
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.930
but the Japs didn't care about international law.
After 10 days on ie,
whoa,

698
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.000
he hadn't fired a shot.
He was too busy stopping the flow of other's blood.

699
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:01.780
I didn't know what to tell him.

700
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.050
I put my arm around his shoulders and said,
I understand

701
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:13.460
it didn't seem to help.
Staring straight ahead.
He cried.

702
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.020
I just want out of this war

703
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:22.940
than someone else yelled corpsman.
The medic dried his eyes,

704
00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:28.130
picked up as kit and left to go patch up another wounded marine.

705
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.310
Now it's 12 days into the invasion,

706
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:34.930
so d plus 12

707
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:43.160
March 3rd was a bad day for replacement officers.
Lieutenants,
Garcia,

708
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.870
Harrington,
and Leech.

709
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:49.070
All assigned from the 27th replacement draft were killed in action

710
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.730
with almost no experience commanding troops in combat or anywhere else.

711
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.900
Second lieutenants had been cranked out of officer candidate school in Quantico,

712
00:47:59.901 --> 00:48:01.340
Virginia wholesale.

713
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:06.320
The Marine Corps created it's new leaders with assembly line speed.

714
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:07.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

715
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:11.270
<v 0>Harrington and leach were commissioned officers for five months when they were</v>

716
00:48:11.271 --> 00:48:16.010
told to lead platoons and deadly combat.
Brave,

717
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.080
inexperienced pinch hitters or substitute quarter back's in a game of death.

718
00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.520
They never even knew the men they were trying to lead.

719
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.400
Now we get to the 14th day

720
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:37.150
by mid morning.
Word swept through our ranks.

721
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:39.940
Colonel Butler has been killed.

722
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.980
Butler had been riding in a jeep to a conference at the regimental command post

723
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:47.380
in order to save time.
Along the way,

724
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.490
he decided to check out the terrain he participated would be his men's next

725
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:56.110
objective when the vehicle approach to trail junction near our old sugar mill,

726
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:02.310
his party took a direct 47 millimeter round hit from a Japanese anti tank and he

727
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:06.430
was killed instantly.
The driver,

728
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.640
an NCO accompanying him were seriously wounded.

729
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.140
It was another [inaudible] tragedy,
but not the last.

730
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.320
Shortly after Colonel Butler's death,

731
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:22.380
a sniper killed my squad mate and Camp Toro or a placement PFC lavor Jenkins of

732
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:28.750
freedom.
Freedom,
Wyoming.
As he rested between assaults,

733
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:37.790
the war was 18 days short of celebrating his first year in the core

734
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.000
Jenkins loss meant the first squad was down to three members,

735
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:50.810
Billy Joe Cawthorne,
our baby face marine,

736
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:55.850
go for Gus Henderson and Ralph Jeffers.

737
00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:02.260
Now they were actually pulled off the line for a bit and had a little bit of a

738
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:03.094
rest.

739
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:11.540
During our day of rest.
My headache grew worse and I consulted a corpsman.

740
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:16.790
My ears ring.
I told him not impressed.
He answered,

741
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.890
it's normal for ears to ring in combat.

742
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:22.280
He gave me some aspirin for my headache and asked anything else wrong?

743
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.750
I showed him my leg wound.
He jokingly said,

744
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.090
too bad you're wound isn't deeper.
If it was,

745
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.220
you'd have a ticket off this damned island.

746
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.040
The aspirin didn't touch my headache.
It grew worse.

747
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.880
My ears rang constantly and I felt nauseous.

748
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.570
I was getting weaker and I knew it,

749
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.230
and so what we've got now is the initial stages of combat fatigue.

750
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.430
He starting to feel it

751
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.140
when Charmella says one of his other guys.

752
00:50:57.141 --> 00:51:00.260
When trellis gave me hell about something or another,

753
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.090
my mind was hazy and numb.
I didn't answer him

754
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.010
about mid day.
The word came down.
Move out.

755
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:11.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

756
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:13.650
<v 0>Our Day of rest was over,
I reckon.</v>

757
00:51:13.651 --> 00:51:18.600
Ruefully we formed up to move out in a spread formation and immediately began

758
00:51:18.601 --> 00:51:23.220
taking mortar fire.
I mean,
it's just a nightmare.
Take cover.

759
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:28.370
Window hollered has and we scattered like a Covey of quail seeking refuge

760
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.990
around,
hit a few yards from me.

761
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.920
My pulse raced and my battle senses told me to move,
sprinting.

762
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:39.240
I ran for a rock outcropping 30 yards away when I was halfway to safety.

763
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.870
A close round knocked me to the ground more than an artillery shelling.

764
00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:44.640
It scared the hell out of me since d day,

765
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.620
but their fear I felt now was different.
My hands trembled.

766
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:49.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

767
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:52.300
<v 0>Fortunately the barrage stopped quickly.</v>

768
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.060
I chain smoke to settle down.

769
00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.840
My head pounded and I go down canteen,

770
00:52:01.841 --> 00:52:03.880
water until my stomach was upset.

771
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:09.810
My legs felt paralyzed like a childhood nightmare in which I wanted to run but

772
00:52:09.941 --> 00:52:10.774
couldn't.

773
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:11.810
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

774
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:14.750
<v 0>the company moved out,
but I stayed where I was.</v>

775
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.880
All I could think was fuck the war.

776
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.060
Fuck the Japs and fuck this whole island,

777
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:28.120
a flood of ever have other fuck everything searched through my tangled thinking

778
00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:28.990
process.

779
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.520
Then awareness that I was alone and the fear of becoming a snipers,

780
00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.780
snipers target prompted me to move.
There was another conclusion.

781
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.540
If I stayed where I was,
the Marine Corps would shoot me as a dessert.

782
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

783
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.350
<v 0>Self preservation instincts kicking in.
I told myself,</v>

784
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.030
get off your butt and start moving.
I looked for my vanished company.

785
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.760
Eventually I heard someone calling my name

786
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.040
through the hazy vision.
I saw sergeant window walking toward me

787
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.060
when he was close enough.
He looked at me,
date him,
are you okay?
He asked,

788
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:10.260
let's join the company and don't worry.
You're going to be okay.

789
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.820
You're gonna make it.

790
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.470
I followed him without argument or objection

791
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:25.030
before we sat in for the evening at 3:30 PM window said to me,

792
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:29.250
Tatum,
I'm sending you back.
Glancing at Trellis.

793
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.200
He added,
you're Outta here too.
You're both finished.

794
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.090
Get the hell back.
Both of you.

795
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:43.120
The trek to the rear at Red Beach to our starting point 15 days ago,

796
00:53:43.121 --> 00:53:46.900
took an hour.
There were no tears in my eyes.

797
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.870
I had combat fatigue.

798
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.333
<v 1>Okay,</v>

799
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.303
<v 0>so</v>

800
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:08.410
they're done and they get pulled off the island.

801
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:16.030
They get put onto a ship so they can recover mentally from what they've been

802
00:54:18.441 --> 00:54:19.274
through.

803
00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.840
So they're out there on this ship and obviously they're out there with a bunch

804
00:54:25.841 --> 00:54:27.730
of other marines.
Been wounded

805
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.910
back to the book.
Tremendous.
And I felt completely out of place.

806
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.160
We were among seriously wounded marines and I almost felt guilty that I wasn't

807
00:54:40.161 --> 00:54:41.120
wounded physically.

808
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.660
Our wounds were to our minds and there were no bandages that could be applied to

809
00:54:47.661 --> 00:54:48.494
them.

810
00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.760
There were no drugs that we could take that would erase the images of war that

811
00:54:52.761 --> 00:54:56.180
filled our heads.
Mother Nature,

812
00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.780
with assistance from modern medicine,
could he all the flesh,

813
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:02.180
but the mind is different.

814
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:07.310
You can never forget the pain you suffered in a place like he will Jima and the

815
00:55:07.311 --> 00:55:11.170
scars will always be there.
Tremendous.

816
00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:16.180
And I had been labeled s s c f or shell shocked.

817
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.920
Combat Fatigue.

818
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

819
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:25.010
<v 0>This label had a negative connotation.
I suppose.</v>

820
00:55:25.011 --> 00:55:29.000
This was the result of the general misunderstanding of this type of condition.

821
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:35.170
It did not denote a lack of courage or resolve to fight who was a condition

822
00:55:35.841 --> 00:55:40.841
caused by the inability to continue past physical or mental exhaustion.

823
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.960
Most marines who suffered combat fatigue,

824
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:50.290
we're the ones who had survived to fight another day and another day and another

825
00:55:50.621 --> 00:55:51.454
day.

826
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.110
The lucky ones got the million dollar wound on the first day and live to

827
00:55:57.111 --> 00:55:57.944
recover.

828
00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.750
They didn't go back into the siege time and time again as tremendous and I had

829
00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:06.800
done each day to see the decimation of young lives.

830
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.410
The deaths of buddies who were closer than brothers,

831
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:14.030
boys who's parents hopes would be dashed by a message from the navy saying,

832
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.700
we regret to inform you.

833
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.340
Most people never have to witness the killing of someone are close to a loved

834
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:26.440
one who was shot or decapitated.

835
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.730
Watch a brother whose face is filled by the look of deep shock that proceeds

836
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:31.564
death.

837
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.710
They never feel the helplessness of watching life bleed out of a mortal being.

838
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:42.020
Okay.
Those who know war,

839
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:44.030
no of what I speak.

840
00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:51.290
I decided on side Pan that I would never apologize for my actions on Evil Jima

841
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.420
or for falling prey to combat fatigue.

842
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:58.870
I gave it my all.

843
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.433
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

844
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:16.390
<v 0>Obviously in this day and age we've been dealing with a lot of combat fatigue,</v>

845
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:18.800
PTSD

846
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.800
and I think one thing is I,
as I read through this,

847
00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.620
I thought back to

848
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:34.510
Colonel Hackworth Book and about face and one of the ways that he describes it

849
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:40.550
is he says that basically people have a cup

850
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.910
and different size cups.

851
00:57:43.911 --> 00:57:48.590
Different people have different sized cups and the Cup starts to get filled up

852
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.590
and if it gets filled up,
it's done.
You're done.

853
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.310
You can't take anymore and you just got to go away.

854
00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.170
And this was the first time as I read this,

855
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:06.160
obviously chuck Tatum showed extreme courage over and over again and he points

856
00:58:06.681 --> 00:58:11.681
out the fact that there's not that many guys that went day after day after day

857
00:58:11.871 --> 00:58:16.871
after day and we're lucky enough to not get wounded or I guess you could say

858
00:58:17.061 --> 00:58:21.640
unlucky enough.
Yeah.
It eventually they reach,

859
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.480
they reach a point where they can't take anymore.

860
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:27.260
Now you do get some guys that can handle more,
and I thought of this today,

861
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:28.763
<v 1>okay.</v>

862
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.290
<v 0>It's each just nature,
right?</v>

863
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:36.020
It's just how you're,
how you're formed.

864
00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:41.620
And I'm not going to be mad at someone because they can't bench press 500

865
00:58:43.911 --> 00:58:46.490
pounds,
right?
Some people don't have that.

866
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.530
That's not part of their physical makeup.

867
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:53.510
That's not far to their part of their physical constitution or their mental

868
00:58:53.511 --> 00:58:55.610
constitution.
And it's the same thing here.

869
00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.640
Some people just have a higher propensity for this type of mental stress so they

870
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:02.060
can handle it more.

871
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.073
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

872
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:08.700
<v 0>And that doesn't mean that you know someone that can't bench press 500 pounds</v>

873
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.980
like me doesn't mean I'm a pathetic person.
No,

874
00:59:12.981 --> 00:59:13.970
it just means that I don't,

875
00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:17.930
I just didn't naturally inherit those genetics that give me the ability to bench

876
00:59:17.931 --> 00:59:19.160
press 500 pounds.

877
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.690
Now it's the same thing with what you inherit mentally.

878
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:27.980
In some people,
their cup gets filled up,

879
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.430
especially when they are lucky or unlucky enough.

880
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:35.510
As we just discussed to survive day after day,

881
00:59:35.511 --> 00:59:37.280
after day after day,

882
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:42.430
and 14 days of thinking that you're going to die than seeing your friends get

883
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.710
wounded or killed.
Yeah.
And even back,

884
00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:48.680
uh,
back then.

885
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

886
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:51.710
<v 0>How he said it had a negative connotation,</v>

887
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.320
almost like you weren't mentally tough enough.
Right.

888
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:58.040
Like you had the luxury of not getting shot and all this stuff.
Right.

889
00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:02.540
And you still couldn't hack it.
Almost in my point is number one,

890
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:03.740
to support what he says.

891
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

892
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.490
<v 0>You've taken anybody,
anybody's going to have a breaking point.
Yeah.</v>

893
01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:11.710
And the breaking points are going to be at different spots.
And he was like,

894
01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.140
like we're saying,
he was either unlucky or lucky enough,

895
01:00:14.141 --> 01:00:19.141
depending on how you look at it to survive 14 straight days of this.

896
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.920
Yep.
And that was where he wrote some people would reach a breaking point in five

897
01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:27.670
days,
but we never would know that.
Yeah.
Some people would last a hundred days,

898
01:00:27.671 --> 01:00:30.760
but we wouldn't know that because they got killed.
Yeah.
Meanwhile,
the,

899
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.940
when you get hit,
how you called it,
the million dollar wound white.

900
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.060
So when you get hit,
everyone's gonna recover,
recover from that,

901
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.270
the flash and modern medicine,
you know,
it heals it.
So yeah,
they,

902
01:00:40.271 --> 01:00:41.900
that's why he called it the million dollar wound.

903
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.530
Cause it's like in a way you locked out.
Yup.
You know,

904
01:00:44.531 --> 01:00:45.740
you didn't have to face these

905
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:52.550
terrible horrors that light beyond day 10 day 11 for 1415 you know?

906
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.930
Yup.
And then it,
and it just keeps going until you fall off.
Yeah.
Daddy.

907
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:00.610
And you're going to break at some point,
you know,
and everyone is,

908
01:01:00.611 --> 01:01:01.440
and like I said,

909
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.730
it's just the way you're made up as your genetic code.

910
01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.780
Maybe you can take it for seven days,
maybe you can take it for 28 days.

911
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:14.220
But the most important thing that he says that if there's vets out there that

912
01:01:14.221 --> 01:01:18.960
think,
man,
I didn't do enough wrong.
Listen to what he says.

913
01:01:18.961 --> 01:01:21.240
I decided on side and that's where they were now to recover.

914
01:01:21.241 --> 01:01:25.860
I decided on Psi pawn that I would never apologize for my actions on an owe Jima

915
01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.560
or for falling prey to combat fatigue.

916
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.230
I gave it my all

917
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.900
and that's all anybody could ask.

918
01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.950
Now he dedicates to this book.

919
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.493
<v 1>Cool.</v>

920
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.120
<v 0>And here's the book,
dedication.</v>

921
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.450
This book is dedicated to my brothers,
the marines,

922
01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:03.920
who fought the Japanese army on one of the darkest islands on earth.

923
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.983
[inaudible]

924
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:07.583
<v 1>yeah.</v>

925
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.700
<v 0>On our voyage to iie.
Whoa.
We had dreams and plans for our futures.</v>

926
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.770
We were young and buoyant.
Our hearts were filled with love for our families,

927
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.570
our buddies,
our country.

928
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.590
We want it to survive,
to come home together.

929
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:33.720
Then we felt the flames of that Pacific inferno

930
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.010
to my marine brothers who fell on that rock

931
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:48.910
I owe every day of the life.
I've led to you

932
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:53.080
semper fi.

933
01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.420
And here is

934
01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:04.210
a roster of some of the people that he knew.

<v 1>okay.</v>

which was a quarter of all the medal of honors that were awarded during World

967
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.963
War II.

968
01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:59.190
I didn't want to close this out.
Not with a medal of honor citation,

969
01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.180
but with a silver star citation.

970
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:04.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

971
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:07.150
<v 0>For Pfc Edward J.
Tucker</v>

972
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:17.220
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepid as a squad leader serving April tune of

973
01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:23.230
company Bravo First Battalion 27th Marines,

974
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:29.100
Fifth Marine Division in action against Japanese enemy forces on the woe Jima

975
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.270
volcano islands 14 March,
1945

976
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:41.300
he lists of his own painful wounds and refusing evacuation in order to remain

977
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:48.450
with his men in continuance of an assault against the bitterly defending

978
01:06:48.451 --> 01:06:50.470
Japanese private FirstClass.

979
01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.520
Tucker on hesitatingly braved a deadly hail of hostile fought rifle.

980
01:06:55.621 --> 01:07:00.570
Fire and machine gun fire to rescue a wounded marine lying in an exposed

981
01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:01.404
position,

982
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:08.370
although mortally wounded while administering first aid to is stricken comrade

983
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:14.370
private first class Tucker by his unselfishness courage and devotion to duty had

984
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:19.150
strengthened in a morale and fighting spirit of his entire company,

985
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.530
thereby reflecting great credit upon himself

986
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:27.980
and the United States naval service.

987
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.673
<v 1>So</v>

988
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.350
<v 0>as I have said,
and as I always say,</v>

989
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.550
war brings out the worst in us,

990
01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:51.570
but it can also bring out the best.

991
01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.510
And there are thousands and thousands of heroes

992
01:07:56.690 --> 01:08:01.100
like PFC Edward J.
Tucker,
known and unknown

993
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.200
that have made the ultimate sacrifice

994
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:13.330
for our country,
for the Marine Corps,
for their battalion,
their company,

995
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:16.040
their platoon squad,

996
01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.600
and for their friends.

997
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:28.110
And I want you to remember that too,

998
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.030
that in all that darkness,

999
01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:37.150
in that black sand and all that evil in the world,

1000
01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.260
they are our heroes and brave men and men that don't take lives

1001
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.560
but give their lives for their friends.

1002
01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:56.820
And while we do talk about evil,
also always remember

1003
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:03.370
that the world is also filled more filled with good men and good women and good

1004
01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:06.214
people.

1005
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.070
And remember those people

1006
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:19.670
in moments of darkness and temptation,

1007
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.080
let them

1008
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.870
inspire you to follow in their footsteps

1009
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:31.690
because there's no doubt

1010
01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:40.970
that the example
has been set.

1011
01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:44.813
So

1012
01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.613
it's,

1013
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.170
it's really just a,
uh,

1014
01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.700
another situation when I,

1015
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:04.730
when I think about the dichotomy of war and the dichotomy,

1016
01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:05.570
a combat

1017
01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:13.130
and how it brings out the worst in people,

1018
01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.240
but it also brings out the best in people.

1019
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:26.430
And I think that in order to appreciate the best in people,

1020
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:32.540
you got to recognize what they're up against.

1021
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.410
Got to recognize what we're up against.

1022
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.300
And you got to see that example,

1023
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:48.200
that example of people that shine,
they shine

1024
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.050
in those circumstances.

1025
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:59.300
And if they can rise like that in those circumstances,

1026
01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:04.200
in those situations facing such horror.

1027
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.233
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1028
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:13.530
<v 0>well then maybe we can rise a little too.</v>

1029
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:18.210
<v 2>It may be we can shine just a little bit brighter</v>

1030
01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:24.880
and bring a little bit more light
into the world.

1031
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:37.410
And I'd say,
Echo,
it looks like I set us up for another rough transition here.

1032
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.170
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
My apologies.

1033
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:49.590
But it'll offer a bit of a contrast,
right?
Yes.
We will,
uh,

1034
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.270
like I said,
this reflects life.
Yeah.

1035
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:59.930
And you go through horrible things and you'll be facing some tough times.

1036
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.900
That's what life does to you.
You know,

1037
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.160
and then a little while later you'll be laughing,
you know?

1038
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.900
And that's the way life is.
Yeah.

1039
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:16.770
That's the way this podcast seems to go to.
Yeah.
You have a bad day at work.

1040
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:21.300
You come home,
boom,
your son and daughter's got straight A's.

1041
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:26.130
There you go.
We've got their report card.
Right.
Okay.
You got to dig that.
Yeah.

1042
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.520
Let's go to the interweb questions.
Cool.

1043
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.640
But before that,
I do have to let you know Jocko,

1044
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.720
just in case you didn't know what we are sponsored by on it.
I like that.

1045
01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:43.740
If you didn't know what that is,
that's where I get my Alpha Bri.

1046
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.840
I'm so smart.
I'm good memory.
Um,
on it.com/jocko,

1047
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.160
if you want 10% off your on it stuff,

1048
01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:58.290
and that's Alpha brain warrior bars.
If you didn't know what that is,

1049
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.480
Krill oil,
Krill oil,

1050
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:04.440
keep your joints working as time goes on.

1051
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.270
Strong bone.
Don't forget about that.
What,
what is strong?

1052
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.420
Just some Krill or stuff for your joints where you joined.

1053
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:15.120
You should know addition to,
yeah,
I liked the Alpha brain worry bars.

1054
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:19.830
Just do your feet.
Just try that.
Beet juice.
Try.

1068

Or if you want some shirts that I v I think they're cool.

1069
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1070
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:17.591
<v 2>Jocko,</v>

1071
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:21.970
store.com get some shirts if you think they're even half as cool as I think they

1072
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:23.890
are,
or a coffee Mug,

1073
01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.780
it says up before the enemy on it.
It's pretty cool.
Anyway,
in that question,

1074
01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.453
let's do it.

1075
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.730
Alpha brain gives you a weird dreams,
by the way,

1076
01:14:37.731 --> 01:14:39.650
if you take it before you get to sleep,
I take it,

1077
01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.460
I have weird dreams regardless of Ray Ray.
Okay.
Actually,
you know what?

1078
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:46.970
They don't give you weird dreams.
They give you a weird awareness of your dreams.

1079
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:49.550
Oh,
I'm not making that as like an official claim.

1080
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.220
I'm saying that's what happens with me and that's what I hear.

1081
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.850
Literally everyone else who takes before they go to bed.
Yeah.

1082
01:14:55.851 --> 01:14:57.920
That doesn't really happen to me for some reason because it's not,

1083
01:14:57.921 --> 01:15:01.550
it's not a stimulant.
By the way.
You still go to sleep.
Good.

1084
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.720
Yeah.
I take it before I go to bed.
Cool.
You know,
that's why you're so smart.

1085
01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:10.340
Jocko.
I want to hear your thoughts on over detachment.

1086
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1087
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.520
<v 2>I'm a police officer and I'm sure military personnel experience the same over</v>

1088
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:20.521
detachment defined as emotional separation from moments which requires emotional

1089
01:15:20.591 --> 01:15:23.050
response in family and profession.

1090
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.630
So what are you thoughts on over detachment?

1091
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:26.880
<v 0>Yeah,
this is definitely,</v>

1092
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
obviously I'm always encouraging people to be able to detach,
right?

1093
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.870
Because that's how you get your emotions out of a situation.

1094
01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:38.340
But this happens to what my brother right here is talking about this police

1095
01:15:38.341 --> 01:15:41.730
officer's saying,
hey,
sometimes you know,
we think about being over detached

1096
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.930
and is something you need to watch out for because you don't want to go through

1097
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:48.120
your life where you have no more emotions.

1098
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.410
Cause then you're not living your life.
Then you're a robot or a machine and,

1099
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.750
and you don't,
you need to have emotions.

1100
01:15:56.010 --> 01:16:00.300
So what as I thought about this,
I thought,

1101
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.810
how did I watch out for that?

1102
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.490
And it's something that creeps in on anybody that does anything.
We could,

1103
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:10.440
you don't even have to be a cop or a or military personnel.
I mean you could do,

1104
01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:13.890
if you're any job that you have where you have free,

1105
01:16:13.891 --> 01:16:17.790
can't just get all emotional about stuff.
Um,
if you're in finance,

1106
01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:21.110
if you're anything you could just become detached.
So how do you do,

1107
01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:24.450
what do you look out for?
What one thing that I did,

1108
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.410
<v 1>okay,</v>

1109
01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:30.410
<v 0>it's still do is compartmentalize and draw little segregation between work and</v>

1110
01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:35.590
home.
Um,

1111
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.930
and there's a really easy way to do that,

1112
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:40.990
especially for people that are cops or it doesn't matter what you do.

1113
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:42.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1114
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.250
<v 0>Whatever that uniform is that you wear at work.</v>

1115
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1116
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.040
<v 0>Whether you're a cop,
whether you're military,</v>

1117
01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.290
whether you're wearing a business suit at work,
when you get home,

1118
01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:55.490
take off that uniform,
take it off.
Matter of fact,

1119
01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.690
if you can't take it off before you get home,
you know,
leave it at the office.

1120
01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:04.760
Yeah.
Cause you want to leave that there.
And when you get home,

1121
01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.560
put on the home clothes,
right?
The t shirt,
the comfortable t shirt,

1122
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:09.980
the flip

1123
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.830
<v 3>flops,
the the shorts B,</v>

1124
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.200
be relaxed at home,

1125
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.180
but be physically in a different uniform at home.

1126
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.200
Not even a uniform in a different change your change your appearance and

1127
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:28.250
therefore change your state of mind a little bit different music,
right?

1128
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.780
Whatever it is that you're listened to at work,

1129
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.760
go to something different at home.
Yeah.
You know when you're going into work,

1130
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:38.050
listen to the first hour of Jocko podcasts when you're coming home,

1131
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.590
he listened to the second hour,
right?
That's how we do it.
Yo,

1132
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.290
you want to have a different attitude,
a different language,
right?

1133
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:49.120
Don't come home thrown around the anachronisms from work.
And you know what?

1134
01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:53.630
I've talked about this before.
I never swore at home.
I swore like hell at work,

1135
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.680
but it never swore at him.

1136
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:58.370
So I was using a different language than I was completely compartmentalizing

1137
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.860
what I was doing at work and when I was doing at home.

1138
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.450
And then check out your posture.
What are you standing around your house like?

1139
01:18:05.451 --> 01:18:09.170
Are you stand in all cross armed and glaring at people?

1140
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1141
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.900
<v 3>Let's just ask the question.</v>

1142
01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:15.270
Are you in a modified weaver stance when you're talking to your wife,

1143
01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:19.130
getting ready to do a quick drawing?
It's like a pistol shooting stance.
That's,

1144
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.890
no,
no.
You know,
are you,

1145
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.980
are you digging for under hooks?
If your kids give you a hug,

1146
01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:30.090
you know what I mean?
Are you looking to get the tape down?
No.
You want to relax,

1147
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.540
right?
And another thing is to find some,
uh,
you know,

1148
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.500
what's maybe maybe group of people that aren't involved in your work.

1149
01:18:37.501 --> 01:18:40.470
And that can be hard.
I mean,
and,
and luckily for me,

1150
01:18:40.471 --> 01:18:44.760
my wife made friends that were outside of the seal community.

1151
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:47.580
And so I got a bunch of buddies that were,

1152
01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:51.600
had nothing to do with the seal teams because they were friends of the friends

1153
01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:54.470
of my wife's friends and husbands of my wife's friends.

1154
01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:57.780
So I had a whole group of people that are still hanging out with all the time.

1155
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:01.620
They have nothing to do with the military at all.
In fact,

1156
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:05.370
many of them are as bad as far as you could get from military personnel as one

1157
01:19:05.371 --> 01:19:07.800
could imagine.
And,

1158
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.790
but that's another thing that helped me segregate the two.
Now,
of course,

1159
01:19:11.791 --> 01:19:13.980
I'm not saying you've got to let your guard down 100%,

1160
01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:14.850
cause you shouldn't do that,

1161
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:20.300
but you should let it down enough that you can enjoy life.

1162
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.600
<v 1>Um,
and uh,</v>

1163
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:31.610
<v 3>you got it attached sometimes.
Now that being said,
cause it's Kinda,
hey,</v>

1164
01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.110
it is going to help you make good decisions.

1165
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:38.630
But there are also times where it's not good and if you're detached and your

1166
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:42.560
wife's trying to talk to you,
it's not going to be good.
Yup.
So open up,

1167
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:46.730
you got to show some emotions.
And one of the things about being detached,

1168
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.650
here's a,
here's a paradox.

1169
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.810
You gotta be detached enough so that you recognize when you're not showing

1170
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:56.090
enough emotion.
You know what I'm saying?
If you're,

1171
01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.710
if you're so detached that you being detached,

1172
01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:03.860
it allow you to realize that,
oh my God,
I'm not showing any emotions at all.

1173
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.980
I'm too detached.
Yeah.
So don't try and be a tough guy that's just

1174
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.660
<v 2>been detached.
Cause if you're detached enough,</v>

1175
01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:12.270
you'll realize that you're being too detached.
Yep.
Yeah.

1176
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:15.740
And there is two d the wall obviously like if you're,
you know,

1177
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.540
you're in a debate argument,
fight,
whatever with your girlfriend wife,
right?

1178
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:25.290
And you're detached,
let's say,
you know you're right.
Let's say you are right.

1179
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:29.420
That has nothing to do with anything when you're arguing with you.

1180
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:32.250
Generally speaking though,
in my experience,

1181
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:36.150
yes I would agree with that in my experience.
But here's the thing though,

1182
01:20:36.151 --> 01:20:39.390
because you're looking at a certain way.
I just want to make that same again.

1183
01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.660
When you're an argument with your wife or your close friend or any east to your

1184
01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:50.790
boss or your subordinate,
whether you're right or not is almost,

1185
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.260
doesn't matter at all.

1186
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:55.830
What matters is what you're trying to do,

1187
01:20:55.831 --> 01:21:00.450
what the direction you're trying to move and is winning the argument being right

1188
01:21:00.451 --> 01:21:02.600
or wrong,
going to help you move in the direction where I'm moving.

1189
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:03.860
That's the real question.
Yeah.

1190
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:07.800
So detach for a minute and figure out the answer to that question.
Yes.

1191
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:11.150
Cause I never care if I'm right or wrong.
That's not never my goal.
Well,

1192
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.430
in an argument with something,
did I say never?

1193
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:19.830
I usually don't care the most for the most park.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

1194
01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:21.390
and I think a lot of times,

1195
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.910
a lot of times people do care whether right or wrong.
Oh my God,

1196
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:30.330
do they care who can go psycho,
right?
Being right or wrong,

1197
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:35.550
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
All questions denied.

1198
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.360
I'm 100% right.
You're wrong.
And so even when people are wrong,

1199
01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:43.020
they'll still want to just win the argument,
right?
So that's,
that's,
that's bad.

1200
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.260
What can be even worse is when you are right,

1201
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.930
yet the other person is a it,

1202
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.280
let's say your wife has emotional cause and this is a known thing that

1203
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.020
the girls generally speaking,
they,

1204
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.970
they want to know that you care more so than they want you to fix their problem.

1205
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.380
Like if someone has,
if your wife is having a problem at work or something,
right?

1206
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.810
They just want you to care that that's going on with them.

1207
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:13.980
They don't want like all this tricky advice.
You know,
generally speaking,

1208
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:16.290
I'm not going to categories there is not black and white,
but generally speaking,

1209
01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:20.690
so let's say you're in a debate or something.
I say you're in an argument,

1210
01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.490
you're in a fight and you know you're right and let's say you are right.

1211
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.440
If you're all detached and being like,
well,

1212
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:29.910
here's the logic behind why I'm right and you have this airtight case that's not

1213
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:33.570
going to help your relationship.
She wants to know first off that you care.

1214
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:38.220
She's mad.
She said she's whatever.
Do you care about that?
That's the way you win,

1215
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:41.010
not the argument.
That's the way you win the situation.
Yes.
You know?

1216
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:43.110
And so not only are you,

1217
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.870
not only do you get out of the fight intact as a relationship,

1218
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:52.470
but you're the good guy.
And really that's part of the reason why she likes you,

1219
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:56.580
because you're the good guy.
That's a win win.
So yeah,
that,

1220
01:22:56.581 --> 01:22:58.850
that's just something I'm questioning why my wife likes me.

1221
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.160
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
that's,
that's a,
that's it.
But yeah,
so,
so you see that,

1222
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:11.020
<v 3>but be attached because you care.
Yes.
Yes.</v>

1223
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:16.090
And show that you care.
And then when you go back to work,

1224
01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.540
you're your comp Europe military person.

1225
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.310
You're a businessperson.
Put your uniform back on,
put your boots back on.

1226
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:29.311
Put your body armor back on lock and load and get back into detachment zone

1227
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:34.900
and move forward.
Now at the question kind of implies this too.

1228
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.980
And I will point this out.

1229
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:40.810
I mean at work you also can't just be detached all the time cause you're,

1230
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:41.440
you're a leader,

1231
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.140
you're in a leadership position and so you can't just walk around just detached

1232
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:45.400
from every,
no.
You got to show emotions.

1233
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:47.680
You've got to relate to the people you're working with.

1234
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:51.070
You've got to be a human so that they follow you or you follow them or whatever

1235
01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:53.140
the case may be.
So the detachment,

1236
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:56.290
you have to be detached enough to recognize when you're being too detached,

1237
01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:00.910
less hair.
And the question

1238
01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:07.030
I was hoping to get your thoughts on bullying.
If your child is being bullied,

1239
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:11.080
what would you tell him or her?
This is,

1240
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:15.650
I guess a little bit of a softball for me to throw this question out of it.

1241
01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:18.120
Cause I,
you know what I'm going to say,
get your kid into Jitsu.

1242
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:20.360
You couldn't it to immediately,
um,

1243
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:26.190
get them in there and let them start to learn what it's like to deal with people

1244
01:24:26.741 --> 01:24:31.000
physically and it will build up their confidence and it won't be a false

1245
01:24:31.001 --> 01:24:31.421
confidence.

1246
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:34.120
It'll be a real confidence because they will know how to handle themselves.

1247
01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.800
They will have people that are trying to take them down to the ground and trying

1248
01:24:38.801 --> 01:24:41.650
to choke them and they will learn to stop that from happening and they will

1249
01:24:41.651 --> 01:24:44.690
learn to do it to other people when warranted,
you know?

1250
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.650
So that's how you prevent bullying in my opinion.

1251
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:52.930
You also get him to start doing pullups pushups,
dips.

1252
01:24:52.931 --> 01:24:55.930
You get them to do a little bit of boxing,
maybe even a little more tight.

1253
01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:57.761
I'll tell you,

1254
01:24:57.761 --> 01:25:02.761
at our gym over the years we've probably had half a dozen kids that have come in

1255
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.260
specifically because they were getting bullied at school.

1256
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:13.600
And every one of those cases within three months,

1257
01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:16.120
four months,
maybe six months at the outset,

1258
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.600
the parents are coming to me and saying he's not getting bullied anymore.

1259
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.660
And there sometimes there's that,
that,

1260
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.690
that incident where I've had a few students that have,
you know,

1261
01:25:26.691 --> 01:25:29.440
and these are kids are 10 years old getting picked on,
getting picked on,

1262
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:33.880
getting picked on and all of a sudden they started training Jujitsu and then one

1263
01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:37.560
day they choke out the bully.
Hmm.
And they never get picked on again.
Yep.

1264
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:40.390
And they're confident and they're not jerks about it.

1265
01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:42.790
They become defenders cause they know what it's like to be bullied.

1266
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:45.270
So they don't like to see other people get bullied,
you know?

1267
01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.430
So I would say,
you know,

1268
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:52.900
get your kids into Jujitsu if they're getting bullied and it will not only teach

1269
01:25:52.901 --> 01:25:55.180
them to prevent themselves from being bullied,

1270
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.420
it will prevent them from becoming a bully.
Yeah.

1271
01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.660
Because they'll recognize what it's like and what the power of physical

1272
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.090
<v 2>intimidation is.
Yeah.
And they will not like it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,</v>

1273
01:26:09.091 --> 01:26:12.140
and I would say it would help them not become a bully because a lot of stuff

1274
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:16.190
that goes on at home,
you know,
everyone's different.

1275
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:19.110
Everyone's family is different.
But a lot of times bullies,
people,

1276
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.620
kids that become beliefs,
they're bullied at home.

1277
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:26.120
So being a bully is just a result of something else,
you know?
So yeah,

1278
01:26:26.121 --> 01:26:30.980
Jude too,
because it helps your cut your confidence in your security as a kid.

1279
01:26:30.981 --> 01:26:33.740
So you will feel less insecure if you're an insecure kit.

1280
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:37.400
So that alone is really powerful.
Even if you are prone to becoming a bully.

1281
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.090
And this is kind of this kind of well known,

1282
01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:44.300
I think it's pretty well known that usually when you're bullied,

1283
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:46.730
like when someone's bullying someone else,
even adults,

1284
01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.090
it's not necessarily about beating them up and picking on him,
beating him up.

1285
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:50.510
It's,

1286
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:54.140
it's less about the physical part of it and more about just the mental power

1287
01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:57.500
with the power trip.
So when you learn Jujitsu,
and man,

1288
01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.440
I'm telling you I wasn't really bullied or nothing like that,

1289
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:05.050
but when you start to know Jujitsu,
you have it in your head.
It's,

1290
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:10.090
it's almost like you can't help but just radiate that kind of secure confidence.

1291
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.180
So when if you like,
if you're,

1292
01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:17.250
if you roll in and you know Jujitsu now and a bully tries to believe,

1293
01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:21.410
he will gather immediately and there's programs like specific programs having to

1294
01:27:21.411 --> 01:27:24.010
do what you did to cope,
you know,
bulletproof and all the stunt men.

1295
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.490
Just generally speaking,
you learned this in Jujitsu where you just basically,

1296
01:27:28.491 --> 01:27:31.750
you just stand your ground and you basically,
you can,

1297
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.280
there's all these different ways to do it,
but you call out the bullied,
like,

1298
01:27:34.281 --> 01:27:37.910
are you,
are you trying to fight me right now?
And just standing up to them,

1299
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.760
we'll usually stop the bullying because if they believe you in,
you're like,
oh,

1300
01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.090
and I'll tell you this.

1301
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.400
Even though a majority of the bullying is verbal or mental or psychological,

1302
01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.980
yeah,
it's all on the premise.

1303
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:56.690
All the bullying is built on the premise most of the time that I can physically

1304
01:27:56.691 --> 01:27:58.930
beat you,
so therefore you can't do anything.
Yeah.

1305
01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:01.300
Occasionally you'll get some young,

1306
01:28:01.301 --> 01:28:04.970
keep scrappy little loud mouth kid that just bullies people just on the fact

1307
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:09.740
that they just don't care.
Right.
That's a rare,
that's a rare breed.
Most bullies.

1308
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.790
They feel like they can physically when and therefore they can mentally abuse

1309
01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:17.480
people.
Yep.
And once that,
once the,

1310
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:21.980
once the victim realizes,
you know what,
I can actually take this person out.

1311
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:25.570
The whole dynamic changes.
Yeah.
And just that,
that,

1312
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.550
that first stage of standing up to him just even verbally,

1313
01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.870
that's only in the belief of mine.

1314
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.930
That's a little indicator I carried him only the sky,

1315
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.300
but some believes they might be like,
hey,
a size advantage.

1316
01:28:35.301 --> 01:28:39.260
This guy's just feeling a little triumphant today and he's going to try to stand

1317
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:40.790
up to me and then they'll,

1318
01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:45.080
they'll push it and then when you know that you Jitsu it,
man,

1319
01:28:45.081 --> 01:28:49.730
you can deal with bullies really easy.
As a kid.
W leg take down mount.

1320
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:54.080
Yeah.
Slap to the faces.
Men Naked.
Choke.
I wish I knew it when,

1321
01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:55.520
when I was a little kid.

1322
01:28:55.521 --> 01:28:58.610
It teaches you perfectly where to be and where not to be,

1323
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:02.280
where you just control the fight.
Okay.
Can Be big and Oh man,

1324
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:05.280
I wish I started when I was,
I wish he was around on us.
Yeah.

1325
01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:08.063
<v 1>Next question.</v>

1326
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:18.550
<v 2>How do I deal with being in an environment I'm forced to be in many,</v>

1327
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.330
I'm 1818 years old and I have one year of school left.

1328
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:27.440
High School is just a place I perish in.
It kills creativity.

1329
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:31.160
All of the information taught is easily obtainable on the Internet.

1330
01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:34.250
I don't feel like I have any purpose in school.

1331
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.640
Learning things that oh be of that will be little of little to no use in my life

1332
01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.600
for eight hours a day.

1333
01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:47.060
Just seems dumb in having Asperger's and Adhd doesn't make sitting in a math

1334
01:29:47.061 --> 01:29:50.500
class for 90 minutes easier.
Also,
most people are in,

1335
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:53.810
are not about achievement,
motivation or anything,

1336
01:29:53.811 --> 01:29:58.670
but would rather play it safe and stay in our small town all their life.

1337
01:29:59.390 --> 01:30:01.820
We'd love to hear your thoughts on a forced environment.

1338
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.833
<v 1>Well,</v>

1339
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:10.580
<v 0>I will tell you that the thoughts contained in that paragraph probably</v>

1340
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:15.570
encapsulate a large,
large number of humans in,

1341
01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.810
you know,
high school,
myself being included in that group.
Myself and my buddies,

1342
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:24.090
when we were growing up,
we didn't want to be in high school.

1343
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.790
We wanted to get out.
We want to get after it.
We want to do,

1344
01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:29.850
whether we want to see the world,
we wanted to make things happen,
right?

1345
01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:33.810
Not necessarily good things either,
but just things sneak it out.

1346
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:38.160
We just wanted to make stuff happen.
And you know,
when I hear this,

1347
01:30:38.161 --> 01:30:41.130
this is kind of very normal.
So first of all,
I'd be like,
hey man,

1348
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.810
you're just feeling what normal people feel.
I mean,
not everybody,

1349
01:30:45.811 --> 01:30:48.720
because some people really enjoy high school,
they enjoy education.

1350
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.500
Not a large number,
but some people recognize that it's a,

1351
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:54.800
it's an opportunity.
You know,

1352
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.350
high school is an opportunity and it's an opportunity to learn and it's an

1353
01:30:58.351 --> 01:31:03.351
opportunity to hang out and meet people and you know,

1354
01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:05.820
kind of live that part of your life.
I mean,

1355
01:31:05.821 --> 01:31:08.580
it is one of the most relaxing things.

1356
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.870
It's one of the most relaxing phases of life,
right?
You just have nothing,

1357
01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:16.760
you know,
pressure.
Um,
and a,

1358
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:19.530
I say no pressure.
And when you're in high school,
you're like,
well,
no,

1359
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:23.880
I had to take a test or homework.
Exactly the same.
Right?
Uh,

1360
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.180
this is another thing that I always think about with forced environment.
So I,

1361
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:33.420
when I was a kid,
I worked construction and you know,
uh,

1362
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:36.240
some of the guys I work construction with were pretty rough characters and one

1363
01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:40.500
of them had dona fair amount of time in prison in one of the things that he said

1364
01:31:40.501 --> 01:31:43.080
to me was,
you know,
when you're in prison,

1365
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:50.160
if you stand right next to the bars in your cell,
if you stand right next to him

1366
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.513
<v 1>then</v>

1367
01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.160
<v 0>you're locked in there.</v>

1368
01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:00.010
But if you walk back away from the bars and you see

1369
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.070
<v 3>what kind of freedom you got inside that cell,
even though it's small,</v>

1370
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.940
it's bigger than when you stand right next to the bars.

1371
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.300
So I always had this feeling of,
you know,

1372
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.070
just step back from the bars a little bit.

1373
01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.500
And I've actually explained that to some of buddies of mine when we,

1374
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.640
they would feel trapped in the navy,
you know,
cause even the seal teams,

1375
01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:21.820
I love that,
you know,
but guys would sometimes start feeling trapped in them,

1376
01:32:21.821 --> 01:32:26.350
that navy and I'd say,
I'd say,
we know what,
if you want to get out,

1377
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:29.380
get out,
give yourself an out if you want to.

1378
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.960
But just then assess it from a position where you say,
you know what,

1379
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:34.720
I could get out if I want it to.
So don't stand so close to the parts,

1380
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:37.060
like I'm stuck in the navy step back and go,
you know what?

1381
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.190
If I want to get out and look it out,
and then they look at it and they go,

1382
01:32:39.191 --> 01:32:41.980
you know what?
Actually it's not a bad,
it's not a bad deal.

1383
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:45.790
It's a pretty good deal.
And that's what I would do in a situation like this.

1384
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:49.870
You look at going to high school,
I mean,
yeah,

1385
01:32:49.871 --> 01:32:51.490
you're trapped in school for eight hours a day,

1386
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:55.720
but eight hours a day in school plus eight hours a day of sleep.

1387
01:32:55.721 --> 01:32:57.280
If you sleep that much,

1388
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:02.230
that leaves you eight hours a day of doing whatever you want.
Right?

1389
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.900
And that's awesome.
Plus you got weekends thrown in there,

1390
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:09.820
so you got a lot of opportunity to do all kinds of things.

1391
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:14.830
Going to high school for eight hours a day is a small price to pay for the

1392
01:33:14.831 --> 01:33:18.100
opportunities that you have while you're in high school.
So it's,

1393
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:23.200
I don't view it really as a,
as a forced environment.

1394
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:26.650
I viewed as an opportunity.
I mean,
do they got a gym there?
What?

1395
01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.210
You're going to learn something,

1396
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.940
even if it's stuff that you could learn it on the Internet,

1397
01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:35.890
why not have a human teach it to you?
That's pretty cool.
You know,
you know,

1398
01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:40.180
just sit in that class and learn what you can get if you got eight ADHD and

1399
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:41.020
Aspbergers okay,

1400
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:46.021
let's see how our discipline can get control over that and we challenged

1401
01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:49.420
ourselves to work on the patients and work on paying attention.

1402
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:53.170
Paying attention is a skill I learned that well in college.
It's a skill.

1403
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:57.850
It's a skill to be able to sit down and read something that you do not want to

1404
01:33:57.851 --> 01:33:59.320
read.
It's a skill.

1405
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:02.680
It's a skill to be able to sit into a class and listen to a lecture on the

1406
01:34:02.681 --> 01:34:05.530
subject that you do not want to listen to.
That takes me.

1407
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.360
I just got a cool a Twitter that next time I'll try and remember it,
read it.

1408
01:34:10.361 --> 01:34:11.560
But it's a guy that was like,
hey,

1409
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:16.120
I hated school and I'm going through this class right now and I got to write

1410
01:34:16.121 --> 01:34:20.530
these responses to these,
to these uh,
uh,
reading assignments that we've got.

1411
01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:22.330
And it was really bothering me.
And he said,

1412
01:34:22.450 --> 01:34:25.930
I was listening to podcasts and you're fired up about linguistics and fired up.

1413
01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:27.790
And so I said,
you know what?
I'm going to own this.

1414
01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:30.880
And now he's totally fired up to tear those,

1415
01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:34.360
tear those reading assignments apart and dig into and find out what the words

1416
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:38.050
mean and he's killing it.
Now I'm in the same built by the way,
Jack,

1417
01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:41.980
that's outstanding.
So again,

1418
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.230
you're not trapped unless you stand right next to those bars that are in front

1419
01:34:47.231 --> 01:34:49.540
of your face.
Step back away from the bars,

1420
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:51.670
look around and see what kind of freedom you actually have.

1421
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:54.180
And you've got a lot of freedom.
May Not feel like it.
Right,

1422
01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.920
but you got a lot of freedom,
you a lot of things to advantage of

1423
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.600
<v 2>from time to equipment to education.
Take advantage of all that stuff.</v>

1424
01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:05.510
You've got another year left,
kill it,
make it happen.

1425
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:12.250
And that's my advice to the senior in high school where you mentioned reading or

1426
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.370
paying attention is a skill,
the skill,

1427
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.920
and you mentioned reading stuff that you don't want to read.

1428
01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.820
And remember how I said it a few times back where

1429
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.700
that's not that,
that's a common thing.
People would just,
I don't want to read,

1430
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:32.540
I don't want to read a book.
You know that's not like that.
That's pretty common.

1431
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.870
A lot of people would prefer not to read audio looks or whatever,

1432
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.090
but if you're willing to read or you like to read,

1433
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:44.510
I would even go beyond that.
Almost call that as a superpower.

1434
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:47.450
Not like a super power,
like it's superhuman or anything,

1435
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:50.240
but that's like an ed major advantage.

1436
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:54.320
And I mentioned this where all the information you ever want to know is out

1437
01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:58.910
there and it you can access it.

1438
01:35:58.911 --> 01:36:01.880
If you know how to read,
you can access it,
but here's the thing like,
well then,

1439
01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:04.910
and everyone kind of knows that and one way or another people,

1440
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:08.500
especially here in the u s you kind of know that information is ever all their

1441
01:36:08.501 --> 01:36:11.450
information.
Whether you understand it or not,
does a different thing.

1442
01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:18.820
This information can help you in probably 90 to 99% of anything you want to do.

1443
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:25.370
It can help you become that,
achieve that,
all this information,
all you need,

1444
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:27.800
this information and then you just act on it and do it right.

1445
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:31.700
Then why isn't,
why aren't,

1446
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:34.730
why isn't everyone just successful in everything they want to do and every

1447
01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:36.530
single way you can learn all the information,

1448
01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:39.470
you can learn all the skills by reading about it.
All of it right now,

1449
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:42.380
lack of discipline because they'd want to read it.

1450
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:45.620
Who wants to go to the library or get a book and read it?

1451
01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:50.660
2000 page book on economics,
even though if they were just to read that,

1452
01:36:50.661 --> 01:36:54.530
read it three times,
they would know exactly what to do,
what to invest in,

1453
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:59.360
where the truck,
you'd know a lot,
you'd have some powerful information to become,

1454
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:02.120
I don't know,
rich or,
or just make more money or whatever.

1455
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:08.450
So the reason that people don't is because they don't want to read.
That's it.

1456
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.800
Meanwhile,
and we've talked about this before,
meanwhile you have time,

1457
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.920
you have time to read.
If you have time to watch TV,
you have time to read.

1458
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.610
If you have time to,
I dunno,
go to the beach or I dunno,

1459
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:24.890
whatever you do in your spare time,
you have time to read.
Going to the,

1460
01:37:24.891 --> 01:37:29.240
going to the beach won't help you in ways that reading can help you and watching

1461
01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:32.270
reality TV can't help you as much as reading can help you.

1462
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.180
But it's one of the things that it's viewed as such a chore,

1463
01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:37.670
I think for a lot of people.
Yeah.

1464
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:41.480
It's viewed as a chore instead of being viewed as an opportunity.
Yeah.

1465
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.580
And I think the reading,

1466
01:37:43.581 --> 01:37:47.250
like if someone could just inject all the information into your brain matrix and

1467
01:37:47.251 --> 01:37:50.330
people would do it,
you know,
but it's that reading.
That's the chore.

1468
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:53.210
That's what they don't want to do.
So consider that.
Right.

1469
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:56.640
He mentioned that all this is available on the Internet,
right?

1470
01:37:57.930 --> 01:38:01.200
But in school you,
you have a teacher who knows this information.

1471
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:05.160
You can ask questions about it.
You can make w I've read stuff that I'm like,

1472
01:38:05.161 --> 01:38:08.520
well,
I don't really get what he means right there.
I'll read again.

1473
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.040
I don't really get what they really get it.

1474
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:12.420
I still didn't get what it means when it,
he means by this,

1475
01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:15.240
but at school you just raise your hand,
ask a question,
he'll explain it.

1476
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:16.470
You don't,
I'm sorry.
Raise your hand again.

1477
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:18.960
You can raise your hand out after everything the teacher says.

1478
01:38:18.961 --> 01:38:21.090
You can raise your hand and tell him.
Explain it again.
He's right there.

1479
01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.073
Every class.

1480
01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.270
<v 3>Here's your opportunity right there.
Indeed,
sir.</v>

1481
01:38:27.710 --> 01:38:32.620
Excellent Echo.
Fired up for the reading.
I like that.
I'm telling you man,
it's

1482
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:36.870
<v 2>flake.
One day is the light,
the lights on kind of new,
right?
It's new.
Yes.</v>

1483
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:40.800
This is post Jocko podcast because this post Jocko podcast and now you're just

1484
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:42.270
absorbing information.
Right,

1485
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.070
and it's not this thing where I started to start to get into reading it.

1486
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:49.980
It was like,
like when you walk into the room,
the lights are off.
It's like,
oh,

1487
01:38:49.981 --> 01:38:52.920
there's nothing really in this room.
I don't see anything in this room.

1488
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:54.960
You turn on the light,
you're like,
oh my gosh,

1489
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.860
the all this was here this whole time.
I'm over here at this age.

1490
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.230
I could've been doing this the whole time.
This reading.

1491
01:39:01.231 --> 01:39:04.890
You know where I'd be if I started doing this?
Oh,
I like,
oh my gosh,

1492
01:39:05.530 --> 01:39:09.300
this guy's an 18 denying it.
Keeping the light off.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

1493
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:11.160
You don't have to do that.
Just all you got to just turn it on.

1494
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:14.370
<v 3>Good.
That's all you gotta do.
Good advice.</v>

1495
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:17.303
Jocko.

1496
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:22.590
<v 2>Does leadership required the atrics or acting skill in the case of an</v>

1497
01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.930
underperforming subordinate?

1498
01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.590
<v 3>I mean,
obviously in a way,
yes it does it,</v>

1499
01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.950
but it's definitely more complicated in that as well because,

1500
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:40.420
and we've talked about this before,
you know I've talked about like when,
if,

1501
01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:43.030
if you want to make an impression to your kids,

1502
01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:47.070
they haven't listened to you when you've told him 14 times in finally,
you know,

1503
01:39:47.071 --> 01:39:49.570
you've been all calm and detach and be like,
hey,
this is it.

1504
01:39:49.571 --> 01:39:54.010
This is why you give it down to everything you're supposed to do in the extreme

1505
01:39:54.011 --> 01:39:57.580
ownership hand handbook of leadership and they're still not listening to you and

1506
01:39:57.581 --> 01:40:01.020
you go,
you know what,
I've got to show some zoom anger here,
right?

1507
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:02.500
So they realized that I'm really serious.

1508
01:40:02.501 --> 01:40:05.740
So that's a time where you might have to flip the switch and act right,

1509
01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:09.160
like your angry for instance.

1510
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:13.880
You know,

1511
01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:18.470
this is part of detachment because if you are controlling your emotions and you

1512
01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.540
decide you need to show some emotions,

1513
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.690
then you're going to need to do some sort of,

1514
01:40:23.691 --> 01:40:25.790
I guess it would be considered acting,

1515
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.490
Beatrice some theatrical [inaudible] too

1516
01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.680
<v 2>to make that clear now.</v>

1517
01:40:32.681 --> 01:40:34.810
And also might go in the other direction where you don't want to show that

1518
01:40:34.811 --> 01:40:37.690
you're frustrated or you don't want to show that you're angry or you don't want

1519
01:40:37.691 --> 01:40:38.524
to shoot.
You know,
if you're,

1520
01:40:38.650 --> 01:40:40.590
if you got your team looking at you and you and your,

1521
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:45.020
you don't want to show that you're frustrated or Colombia.
Yeah.

1522
01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:45.970
So you've got to act.
Okay,

1523
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.620
<v 3>I'm just,
you know,
I've got to act cool.</v>

1524
01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.500
I've got to detach a little bit and just act cool.
And so

1525
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:58.780
those are both,
I guess those could be considered acting,

1526
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:05.200
but at the same time,
I don't think it's disingenuous.
And I will tell you why.

1527
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:07.480
The reason I'll tell you why is because,

1528
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.660
remember when I was on Sam Harris and we were talking about being brave and he,

1529
01:41:13.661 --> 01:41:15.070
I think it was,
he said,

1530
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:18.670
if you pretend to be brave,

1531
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:22.510
well then you are in fact being brave.
So if,
if,

1532
01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:27.280
if you're wounded in the street and there's machine gun fire going on and I say,

1533
01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:28.660
you know what?
I don't want to do this,

1534
01:41:28.661 --> 01:41:31.120
but I'm just going to pretend to be brave right now and I run out and grab you,

1535
01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:34.060
pull you out of the street.
Even though I was pretending to be brave,

1536
01:41:34.090 --> 01:41:38.980
I was brave because that's what I did.
I did the action.
It's the same thing here.

1537
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:42.940
If I'm really angry at you,
but I decided,
you know what?

1538
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.520
I got to keep that inside and I've got to act like I'm calm.
Well,
guess what?

1539
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:52.750
What I did was that calm,
so therefore it's not acting.

1540
01:41:52.751 --> 01:41:54.490
That's what I did as a person.

1541
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.410
So I guess I'm really not acting at all because I'm being,

1542
01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:04.411
me and me is detached and acting like I'm calm even though I'm super angry.

1543
01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:06.003
Yeah.

1544
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.950
<v 2>You are at kind of a weird paradox technique,</v>

1545
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:12.450
and I thought about this before you are acting,

1546
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:15.480
but like just like are you saying it's not disingenuous because there's a

1547
01:42:15.481 --> 01:42:19.380
difference between what you feel and how you behave like feelings and behavior.

1548
01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:24.740
So if I'm mad at you for something and I don't yell at you and be all it,

1549
01:42:25.261 --> 01:42:28.620
does that mean I'm not mad at you?
It doesn't mean that.
Right?

1550
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:34.230
But what if I,
I am mad at you and I did and I do my aim,

1551
01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:37.350
my madness,
my anger makes me yell at,
at you.

1552
01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.080
All that means is my feelings are driving my behavior.

1553
01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:42.330
Just because your feelings aren't driving your behavior,

1554
01:42:42.331 --> 01:42:47.190
it doesn't mean it's disingenuous.
You know?
So you can still be mad.

1555
01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:52.700
You can still yell even though the yelling isn't because you're a mad.

1556
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:56.280
The yelling is for a specific result.

1557
01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:59.640
So we'll just like how you're saying you're still stand con.
Yes,
you're acting,

1558
01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:02.940
you're acting,
but you're acting because you want a certain result.
Yes.

1559
01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:05.610
That's what I say.
You are acting because you're,
you're gonna.
If,

1560
01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:08.580
if you're not acting,
that means that your anger is driving your behavior,

1561
01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.000
your feeling is driving your behavior behavior.
Otherwise you're just,
yeah,

1562
01:43:12.001 --> 01:43:12.510
you're acting.

1563
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:16.050
But I think I agree with you when we were talking about it before it.

1564
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:18.330
That's a good thing you're going for results here.

1565
01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.360
<v 3>Yeah,
and that's the question.
The actual question is,</v>

1566
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.520
it specifically says under po underperforming subordinate and so clearly,
yeah,

1567
01:43:26.521 --> 01:43:30.180
you might have to show some anger so then they realize that you're really

1568
01:43:30.181 --> 01:43:32.700
serious that they may get fired,
that they need to improve,

1569
01:43:32.701 --> 01:43:34.560
that they need to whatever the case may be.

1570
01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.960
<v 2>Yeah.
And yeah,
if it's with your girlfriend and wife,</v>

1571
01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.950
it shows me you care a lot of times.
You know how like you'll be like,
hey,

1572
01:43:40.951 --> 01:43:43.260
you know,
say something and you're saying it.
Then I'll call him or whatever.

1573
01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:44.730
And caring,

1574
01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:49.140
knowing you care about or someone knowing that you care about them,

1575
01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:51.650
that is a big deal.
Versus

1576
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:55.650
<v 3>if they suspect,
I mean he doesn't care about the situation of Jelly.</v>

1577
01:43:56.530 --> 01:44:00.480
No,
you're right to care.
People want you to care.

1578
01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.610
Jocko,
you got to care.

1579
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.853
<v 2>Next question.</v>

1580
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:12.280
At what point does loyalty and what could become martyrdom for a human that you

1581
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:18.560
care about?
Become out,
waited with the desire to improve oneself,

1582
01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.940
put differently,
loyal to be there for loyal,

1583
01:44:23.941 --> 01:44:27.480
to be there for a loved one teammate,
employee,
et Cetera,

1584
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.810
in a tough situation or downward spiral isn't important and admire bill train.

1585
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:38.230
But when does it go too far that wants you to become selfish and begin to cut

1586
01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.093
<v 3>those types?</v>

1587
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:44.980
This is a question that everybody's got to deal with at some point in their
life.

1588
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:45.730
Yeah.
As soon as they do.

1589
01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:50.050
Obviously I'm all about helping people and doing everything you can to help

1590
01:44:50.051 --> 01:44:51.880
people out.
Right?
That's great.
Sure.

1591
01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:55.750
But you got to take care of yourself first.
And I think,

1592
01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.770
I think the thing that I think of is when you go on an airplane and they say,

1593
01:44:59.771 --> 01:45:03.370
Hey,
if we lose pressure in the cabin,
oxygen masks drop down.

1594
01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.610
And if you're with a child,
take care of yourself first,

1595
01:45:06.611 --> 01:45:07.780
then you can take your child.

1596
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.880
So what happens if you don't take care of yourself first?

1597
01:45:09.881 --> 01:45:13.030
Then you pass out and now your child doesn't get helped.

1598
01:45:13.031 --> 01:45:15.820
And now you both die from lack of oxygen.

1599
01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:18.610
So that's sort of like life,
right?

1600
01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.640
If you've got somebody that's dragging that's going down a downward spiral and

1601
01:45:23.771 --> 01:45:26.590
you decide that you're just going to pour everything into them,

1602
01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:29.200
well then you're going to go down that downward spiral as well,

1603
01:45:29.201 --> 01:45:30.610
and now you're not going to be able to help him.

1604
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:35.080
So I think you definitely have to get yourself.

1605
01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:40.110
You have to take care of yourself as a person so that you have the platform to

1606
01:45:41.981 --> 01:45:44.830
take care of someone else and help someone move in the right direction.

1607
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:50.790
And so I don't think you can let yourself get dragged down too far right down

1608
01:45:50.981 --> 01:45:51.521
these paths.

1609
01:45:51.521 --> 01:45:55.810
You have to get the oxygen mask on yourself and stabilize yourself and have a

1610
01:45:55.811 --> 01:45:59.500
platform to help other people without getting dragged down.

1611
01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.780
And I'll tell you something else,
by the way,

1612
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:06.070
oftentimes when you think you're helping someone,

1613
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:07.263
<v 2>mm hmm.</v>

1614
01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:11.770
<v 3>You really just enabling them and you know,
you see that with the addictive,</v>

1615
01:46:11.890 --> 01:46:14.920
you know when people are in the case of addiction.
Yeah.
It's awful.

1616
01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.190
And the people that are trying to loved ones that are trying to help them by

1617
01:46:18.191 --> 01:46:19.300
saying,
okay,
look,
I'll,

1618
01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.910
I'm going to help you through them to give you a little bit more money right
now,

1619
01:46:21.911 --> 01:46:24.400
but this is the last time.
And then the next week it's,

1620
01:46:24.401 --> 01:46:25.600
I'll give you a little bit more money.

1621
01:46:25.601 --> 01:46:29.740
And all they're doing is buying booze or drugs or whatever addiction that they

1622
01:46:29.741 --> 01:46:32.440
have.
And it's horrible to see it.
You are actually,

1623
01:46:32.441 --> 01:46:36.100
even though you think you're helping them,
you're actually hurting them.

1624
01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:38.540
And so I think of,

1625
01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:42.100
I guess it's the big night for a detachment on the podcast here,

1626
01:46:42.101 --> 01:46:45.100
but you got to detach.
You've got to make sure you're not becoming an emotional,

1627
01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.410
you got to make sure that you're seeing the person and the situation for what it

1628
01:46:49.411 --> 01:46:50.250
really is,

1629
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.630
<v 0>not what you want it to be,
but what it really is,</v>

1630
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:59.160
who they really are,
what they are really doing.
And then when you're detached,

1631
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:04.161
you got to make logical decisions from that point of detachment to decide

1632
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:11.390
whether this person can be helped and how far you're willing to go to help them.

1633
01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.080
And you got to remember,
you can't be a hero to everybody.
Yeah.

1634
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:22.180
And you can't help everybody all the time.
And again,

1635
01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.900
I want to help people out when they're in trouble,

1636
01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:31.440
but you need to maintain your own stability in life so that you have a platform

1637
01:47:33.851 --> 01:47:35.260
that you can help people.

1638
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:38.950
Because if you burn down your platform and you throw away your stability,

1639
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:41.260
not only will you not be able to help that person,

1640
01:47:41.261 --> 01:47:43.960
but you won't be able to help anybody,
including yourself eventually.

1641
01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.230
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
And you,</v>

1642
01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:51.240
you say like you want to help them without letting them them drag you down too

1643
01:47:51.821 --> 01:47:54.190
far.
So that point,

1644
01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:58.750
that too far point is going to be different for everybody and every
relationship.

1645
01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.160
So I think you'd be kind of get a handle on that.
Like what is too far away?

1646
01:48:02.190 --> 01:48:04.480
What is being dragged down too far?

1647
01:48:04.481 --> 01:48:07.760
Is it getting in the way of these important things in my life?
Because yeah,

1648
01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.200
he's talking about when do you cut those ties?
That's,
you know,

1649
01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:16.400
that means you've been dragged down too far where you got to cut those ties.
Oh,

1650
01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.470
so I think,
I think that's important.
Um,
some people,
they're just,

1651
01:48:21.471 --> 01:48:24.830
that's kind of their thing.
You know,
they'll get dragged all the way down.

1652
01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:29.750
Some people like my work time to help you.
Yes.
Yes,
exactly.
Which can be fine,

1653
01:48:29.751 --> 01:48:33.950
I think.
I think if that,
that's people's kind of thing.
I think,
you know,

1654
01:48:33.951 --> 01:48:35.910
there's all kinds of different people and I think that that,

1655
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:42.650
because I think it drags both parties into the,
into the darkness.
Yeah.

1656
01:48:42.651 --> 01:48:44.390
If they go all the way down,
like,
you know,

1657
01:48:44.391 --> 01:48:49.190
they lose some important stuff in their life.
But at jobs,
finances,

1658
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:52.730
yeah.
Uh,
stability,
but some people they,
they,
you know,

1659
01:48:52.731 --> 01:48:54.080
it's like that's kind of there.

1660
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:56.960
I don't want to see their lot in life cause it sounds kind of like it's a bad

1661
01:48:56.961 --> 01:49:00.560
thing.
It's their addiction.
Yeah.
It's like the thing they like it.

1662
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.780
So there's that.
Um,
so helping versus enabling,
right.

1663
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:09.830
So there's two kinds of like,
correction,
and I might get the terms wrong,

1664
01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:14.480
but it's,
it's direct help in the systemic help.

1665
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:18.530
So direct help is like the sort of superficial obvious health,
like take the,

1666
01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:22.940
take the consideration of um,
like giving money to a homeless person,
right?

1667
01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.190
Where if you,
if someone who has a cup and it's like,
you know,
help me,
you know,

1668
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:31.910
give me,
give me money.
Basically I put five bucks in the house in the cup.
Right?

1669
01:49:31.911 --> 01:49:36.740
So that's,
that's direct versus systemic.

1670
01:49:36.741 --> 01:49:38.090
Systemic would be,
okay,

1671
01:49:38.091 --> 01:49:42.950
I'm going to contribute to a soup kitchen.
Yeah.

1672
01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:46.790
Or no more.
No.
Even go more systemic than that.
So I'm going to contribute to a,

1673
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.120
that gets people on their feet basically giving people the tools to help

1674
01:49:52.121 --> 01:49:55.350
themselves.
Right?
So that's systemic that that goes,

1675
01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.910
that doesn't solve the superficial problem.
It's like,

1676
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.210
it's like instead of watering the leaves you out of the roots,
it's that.

1677
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.260
So instead of giving money to a homeless person,

1678
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.890
which can potentially the worse.
Yes.

1679
01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.880
Because just like what enabling is,
look,
if I'm a homeless guy,
I'm like,
hey look,

1680
01:50:12.881 --> 01:50:17.170
I'm whatever,
whatever my situation,
I'm a homeless guy and bay asking for money.

1681
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.050
I make 50 bucks today at this corner.

1682
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:25.960
I'm going to come back tomorrow and make my 50 bucks.
I have no other skills.

1683
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.760
If I,
if you want to help them,
if you,

1684
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:31.450
what if someone came and instead of 50 bucks or five bucks or dollar,
whatever,

1685
01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:35.440
they gave me some skills.
However they did,
I don't know,

1686
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:39.670
a magical pill and it gave me some skills.
So I dunno,

1687
01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:42.130
I knew how to sell real estate or something.
I Dunno.

1688
01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.030
I'd go use those skills and boom,
then I'm helped,
you know.

1689
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.510
So yeah,
the helping versus enabling.

1690
01:50:49.511 --> 01:50:54.160
I think he got to put it into perspective and give it a lot of thought when you

1691
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:55.060
help someone.

1692
01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:59.440
And I think that people who enable people or who accidentally enabled people,

1693
01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:02.710
all that is them not putting enough thought into it,
how to help them.

1694
01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:04.180
Cause a lot of times they really care.

1695
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.920
But they ended up enabling them and on top of it with,

1696
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:11.380
which makes it more of a challenge for people,

1697
01:51:11.381 --> 01:51:16.381
enabling the people they care about is they get a payoff from giving them,

1698
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:18.490
you know,
whatever it is,

1699
01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.910
they give them more or lying for him or doing this other stuff's like I helped

1700
01:51:21.911 --> 01:51:25.690
him for that day.
So it gives them that,
that payoff a little feel good.
Yeah.

1701
01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.560
I helped him that day.
I gave the home l man,
he's so nice he gave that,

1702
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.820
that homeless guy five bucks.
Oh Dang.
Everyone's giving change.

1703
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:37.720
He's over here giving them five bucks when really,
I'm not saying all the time,

1704
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:38.620
I'm not saying all the time,

1705
01:51:38.621 --> 01:51:43.150
but potentially you could have basically just made that corner more valuable for

1706
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:47.890
him to work.
Potentially say it all the time.
So like I said,

1707
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:53.130
I think something that would help is put in the thought with how you want to

1708
01:51:53.621 --> 01:51:57.190
help.
So if you can help systemically,
that's um,

1709
01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:02.200
that's the way to help better,
it's a better way to help in my opinion.

1710
01:52:04.610 --> 01:52:06.760
All right,
next question Jocko.

1711
01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:12.340
How do you get over feeling like an imposter?
As a new manager,

1712
01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.220
I feel like I'm about to get found out.
Welcome to leadership,

1713
01:52:18.221 --> 01:52:21.760
my friend.
Here's the thing,
here's what you're actually scared of.

1714
01:52:21.761 --> 01:52:26.761
What you're scared of most likely is them knowing and finding out that you don't

1715
01:52:28.271 --> 01:52:29.740
know everything.
Right?
Right.

1716
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.590
That's what people don't like to admit when they're wrong.
Yeah.
Yes,
yes,

1717
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:36.010
and the thing that you need to know is it's okay.

1718
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.470
It's okay not to know everything.

1719
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:42.730
It's perfectly normal to be in a leadership position and not know everything in

1720
01:52:42.731 --> 01:52:46.580
the world.
You don't have to know everything about this particular

1721
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:49.010
<v 3>job that you're going into or what you don't need to know.</v>

1722
01:52:49.011 --> 01:52:53.030
Everything you don't need to,
which you need to do is go in,

1723
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.300
ask questions,
listen to people in and say,

1724
01:52:58.330 --> 01:53:00.590
anal,
I have done this procedure before.
I've never,

1725
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:02.410
I never worked with this piece of equipment for,
can you show up?

1726
01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.920
Can you walk me through it?
Can you show me how to do it?

1727
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.540
I just want to make sure I understand what you're doing.
Make sure I get it.

1728
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.393
Oh,
okay.

1729
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:15.980
Now it's not an excuse to not know anything because if you're in a leadership

1730
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:16.311
position,

1731
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:20.780
you should be studying and reading and learning about whatever the role you're

1732
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:22.730
in is that you can understand it all.

1733
01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.080
Study the manuals and the regulations and the procedures,

1734
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:31.940
and I'm not saying to follow all those things blindly without common sense.
No,

1735
01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:35.000
that's not what I'm saying,
but there's a knowledge base that you should,

1736
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:39.140
you should acquire very quickly when you roll into a leadership position.

1737
01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.810
So put the work in and then apply common sense,

1738
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:45.170
but this is the same thing that I say every time somebody asks me about how do

1739
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:47.750
you lead this or how do you lead that?
Or how do you lead New People?

1740
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:51.530
Or how do you lead senior people?
It's the same answer every time.
Be Humble.

1741
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:56.240
Listen to them beyond time.
Work hard,

1742
01:53:56.450 --> 01:54:01.190
treat people with respect,
way the decisions.

1743
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:04.700
Carefully talk to people and then make a good decision.

1744
01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:10.760
Empower your folks to lead.
Don't micromanage them,

1745
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:14.420
but give them at the same time clear guidance about what the expectations are.

1746
01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.520
It's just leadership.
And when you're a new leader,
it's all good.

1747
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:21.290
You don't need to know everything.

1748
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:26.330
You're not expected to know everything and showing that you could admit that you

1749
01:54:26.331 --> 01:54:29.000
don't know everything isn't going to hurt your reputation.

1750
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:33.200
It's actually gonna help you reputation.
Some go in,
be humble,

1751
01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.960
ask some good questions,
learn as fast as you can,

1752
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:41.360
and it's okay.
And you know,
I was thinking about this,

1753
01:54:41.361 --> 01:54:43.760
um,
in the 80s,

1754
01:54:43.761 --> 01:54:48.761
and perhaps even in the 90s when guys were losing their hair and going bald,

1755
01:54:50.871 --> 01:54:55.430
right?
They do a comb over,
so they'd try and pull their hair over there,

1756
01:54:55.431 --> 01:54:59.180
balding scalp.
So it did look like they were going bald.
Right,
right.

1757
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:01.400
And I'm telling you as a leader,

1758
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:05.450
don't do a leadership comb-over do what guys do now,

1759
01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:07.880
which is they just shaved their head.
Right.
Okay,
good.
You know what?

1760
01:55:08.370 --> 01:55:12.380
I'm going a little fed up top.
All good.
Just going to shave it off.
Hey,

1761
01:55:12.381 --> 01:55:15.740
I'm your new leader.
Don't know everything.
It's all good.
Here's where,

1762
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:20.570
here's where I'm weak.
Give me a hand.
Yeah,
no big deal.
That's a good analogy,

1763
01:55:20.571 --> 01:55:25.280
by the way.
I don't do the leadership over,
go over.
Um,

1764
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.560
what,
tell me if you would agree with this,
generally speaking.
Um,

1765
01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.750
you've watched some movie demolition man with the bus alone,
Wesley Snipes.

1766
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:38.990
Negative.
Anyway,
Dennis,
he's name is Denis leary.

1767
01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:42.380
It doesn't seem like you're kind of movie,
but maybe it would be,
I don't know.

1768
01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.040
Anyway,
Denis leary,
he's this kind of

1769
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v 2>underground rebel because basically La is a long explanation,</v>

1770
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:53.810
but I'm making sure I don't eat shit.
It has to do with leadership though for,

1771
01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:57.480
okay,
I'm ready.
So mobile leadership,
basically the,
the,
you know,

1772
01:55:57.481 --> 01:56:00.330
it's in the future,
whatever.
And um,
the,

1773
01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:04.650
the world is turning into this like over sensitized.
Like you can't swear,

1774
01:56:04.651 --> 01:56:06.960
he can't eat junk food.
It's the law.
Like,
you know,

1775
01:56:06.961 --> 01:56:09.690
so everyone's all nice and real weak and stuff like that.

1776
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:13.620
But there was a group of people who rebelled against it,
went underground,
right.

1777
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:16.950
And the leader of those guys is called egg Edgar friendly.
Right.

1778
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:19.960
And so they go down and he's regarded as his huge criminal.
Right.

1779
01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:23.520
So the demolition comes back the long story about him.
But anyway,

1780
01:56:23.521 --> 01:56:27.660
he's back to help rid the world of these criminals.
So he goes in,

1781
01:56:27.661 --> 01:56:30.300
he encounters Edgar friendly and they're not rebel.

1782
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.250
They're not these evil people.
They're just like,

1783
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:36.540
just trying to live basically a freedom of free life,
you know?
And they're like,

1784
01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.620
oh,
he's like,
Hey,
well why don't you lead these people out of here?
Right?

1785
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:42.750
And he's like,
I'm the leader.

1786
01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:47.630
Sometimes I do some shit and people come with me.
Right.

1787
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.470
That's kind of what he says.
So isn't this,
so here's the question.

1788
01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:53.970
Sorry for long explanation.

1789
01:56:58.230 --> 01:56:58.920
How this guy's,

1790
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.660
he's kind of like worried about people finding him out that he's not a leader.

1791
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:07.980
Right?
Isn't that like a huge sign of humility that he's like on the inside,

1792
01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:11.220
he's not.
I know everything,
you know,
and that's kind of like,
man,

1793
01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:13.740
I don't know it all,
you know,
and I'm worried about this.

1794
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.420
It's actually a good sign.
You are correct.

1795
01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:17.750
It's a good sign when you got someone who's like,
man,
I want to do good.

1796
01:57:17.751 --> 01:57:20.490
He wants to do a good job.
He wants,
he wants to do good job.

1797
01:57:20.491 --> 01:57:23.820
And he's like worried about it.
So that's,
that is good.
That is a good thing.
Yeah.

1798
01:57:23.821 --> 01:57:24.780
It's like his humility.

1799
01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:29.760
It's like it's so genuine that that's one of his many worries of being a leader.

1800
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:32.880
You know that it's a good sign.
It's better than someone says,

1801
01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:36.340
you know what I'm about to take over as a new leader.
Yeah.

1802
01:57:36.341 --> 01:57:38.390
And I'm gonna own this thing.
I'm going to own them and I just,

1803
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:43.500
everything and no one knows anything that I know.
So it's going to,
right.

1804
01:57:43.610 --> 01:57:44.810
<v 0>Yeah.
You don't wanna be that guy.</v>

1805
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:51.820
This next one is sort of a statement and sort of a question wrapped in there.

1806
01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:57.650
Somebody's calling from law enforcement and I thought it was pretty informative

1807
01:57:57.651 --> 01:58:02.651
statement based on one of the other podcasts that we did and it says this,

1808
01:58:02.751 --> 01:58:04.730
I currently work a vice,

1809
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:08.510
but I've had my share of use of force on the job.

1810
01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:13.070
I quickly learned that you can't knock everyone out and then applying Jujitsu

1811
01:58:13.190 --> 01:58:16.160
will reduce injuries to you and the suspect.

1812
01:58:16.161 --> 01:58:18.860
So this is what we talked about last time.
Whereas if I,
if,

1813
01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.530
if my method of controlling you is to strike you,

1814
01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:26.860
I'm going to have to beat you over and over again to get you to submit.

1815
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:31.670
Whereas if I know how to do a chokehold,
boom,
you're good.
Back to the quote,

1816
01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.450
the choke hold or carotid as we called it,

1817
01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:38.000
is still permitted in our force policy,

1818
01:58:38.090 --> 01:58:41.650
but only in an immediate defense of life situation.

1819
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:47.130
Basically using a choke hold is considered deadly force and equivalent with

1820
01:58:47.651 --> 01:58:48.700
shooting someone.

1821
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:54.870
There was a time when the LAPD saying was when in doubt choke him out in the 80s

1822
01:58:56.231 --> 01:59:01.231
during the PCP era officers we're applying the carotid choke on PCP suspects

1823
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:05.320
daily.
During one of those incidents,
uh,

1824
01:59:05.321 --> 01:59:09.460
male black died from the choke being improperly applied.

1825
01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:15.060
Chief Gates made the mistake of going on national television and saying that

1826
01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:19.450
male blacks had a higher chance of dying from the choke due to their physical

1827
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:21.970
make and larger Adam's apple.

1828
01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:23.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1829
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:26.310
<v 0>As you can imagine,
this caused an outrage,</v>

1830
01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:31.020
which in turn caused the department to fall to political pressure and make the

1831
01:59:31.021 --> 01:59:33.990
carotid choke almost impossible to use.

1832
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:41.610
So when I kind of alluded to this on that last podcast that there's the,

1833
01:59:42.061 --> 01:59:44.800
there's exactly what happened.
A guy got choked to death,

1834
01:59:45.070 --> 01:59:48.820
there was political pressure.
Chief Gates comes out and says that.

1835
01:59:50.170 --> 01:59:52.930
And actually I went,
I went online and researched this a little bit.

1836
01:59:52.931 --> 01:59:57.931
He made like every classic mistake you could make on this.

1837
01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:03.190
And that's why they outlawed using choke holds.

1838
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:07.590
And,
and actually,
uh,
as I read through it,
they,

1839
02:00:07.930 --> 02:00:11.590
a bunch of them kind of how I referred to Rodney King beating and said,

1840
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:16.300
here you had guys just wailing on this,
this individual with,

1841
02:00:16.630 --> 02:00:19.690
with bats and sticks and Billy clubs or whatever.

1842
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:23.710
And it didn't stop him.
And they referred to that,

1843
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:26.740
that when they looked at the choke hold being used,

1844
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:28.720
that's one of the major cases that they say,
man,

1845
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:33.660
let us let people use the choke hold so this doesn't happen.
Mm.
Uh,

1846
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:36.160
this guy goes on as a certified our con,

1847
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:39.760
which is our constants for arrest and control.
Our con instructor,

1848
02:00:40.090 --> 02:00:44.110
I feel the department taking away our ability to use a rear naked choke has

1849
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:48.340
caused many unnecessary shootings and injuries to suspects.

1850
02:00:49.210 --> 02:00:50.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1851
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:54.370
<v 0>It saddens me to work for a department that is being run like a poor corporation</v>

1852
02:00:54.371 --> 02:00:58.660
instead of a police department.
So that's kind of the buildup.
Right.

1853
02:00:58.661 --> 02:01:01.840
And that's why I wanted to read it because there was just good information in

1854
02:01:01.841 --> 02:01:02.260
there and it,

1855
02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:07.260
it is very much in line with what we talked about last time and in police work

1856
02:01:09.071 --> 02:01:11.680
and,
and also in,
you know,
uh,

1857
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:15.430
combat situations where you're dealing with non combative people in a hostile

1858
02:01:15.431 --> 02:01:16.450
environment.
In other words,

1859
02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.850
you go into a building to capture a terrorist and there's a,

1860
02:01:19.210 --> 02:01:21.040
there's a women in there or there's kids in there,

1861
02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:24.340
there's teenagers in there that are not combative,

1862
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:26.890
but they're not compliant either.
So they don't have a gun.

1863
02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:29.210
You're not going to shoot him,
but you got to get control of him.

1864
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.490
Now it gets into the sort of the leadership question here.

1865
02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:39.060
How do I keep morale up and stay motivated when I no faith in

1866
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:44.540
<v 3>the leaders and when the leadership has turned its back on you time after time,</v>

1867
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.360
the morale is at its lowest point,

1868
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:50.660
even lower than post 92 riots.

1869
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.210
According to the old timers,

1870
02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:57.860
we were trained in the academy to be warriors.

1871
02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:03.010
Now the department doesn't allow us to call ourselves warriors only guardians.

1872
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:08.770
This change in mentality will sadly cause only more bad shootings and more

1873
02:02:08.961 --> 02:02:10.100
officers getting hurt.

1874
02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:15.870
<v 1>So
that's a,</v>

1875
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:19.400
<v 3>you know,
obviously tough situation and like I said,</v>

1876
02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:22.130
for the Jujitsu versus striking,
I think this is spot on.

1877
02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:25.850
The jujitsu in the grappling is,
is a far superior way.
Like I said,

1878
02:02:25.851 --> 02:02:29.060
if controlling people than striking is,
that's just a reality.

1879
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:32.600
Now on the leadership front,
that leadership question

1880
02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:39.550
<v 1>for me,
I,</v>

1881
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:46.370
<v 3>I have my own team,
right?
I got my people,</v>

1882
02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.110
the people that are around me,

1883
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.610
the I'm going to buffer all this bad morale and all this stuff.

1884
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.990
I'm going to buffer it away from my team.
I'm going to make their lives good.

1885
02:02:57.150 --> 02:03:01.430
That's my goal and I'm going to lead toward what my ideal is,

1886
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:06.470
right?
I'm going to lead toward what my ideal is.
Now,
in order to do that,
well,

1887
02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:11.540
you got to play the game so that you can get more influence.

1888
02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:13.880
If you don't go play the game,
you say,
Hey,

1889
02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.070
the the bosses don't know what they're talking about.

1890
02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:20.560
Bosses don't know what they're talking about and we need to,
uh,

1891
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:30.850
you got to play the game you so that you can get more influence

1892
02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:32.680
<v 1>and,
and</v>

1893
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:38.150
<v 3>that means doing what you have to do.
That that means not saying,
Hey,</v>

1894
02:03:38.151 --> 02:03:42.140
our morale socks and we don't have good leadership.
No,
it means going,
okay,

1895
02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.020
we're gonna move.
We're going to move forward.
Here's the goal.

1896
02:03:45.021 --> 02:03:47.840
Here's what I think.
Here's what I believe.
Hey,
by the way,

1897
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:49.430
I'm going to run this up the chain of command.

1898
02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:53.840
I'm going to gather the data myself.
I'm going to do the research.

1899
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:56.900
I'm going to do the administrative work.
I'm going to study the cases.

1900
02:03:56.901 --> 02:03:59.330
I'm going to present them and say,
hey,
here's what's happening.

1901
02:04:00.210 --> 02:04:05.090
I'm going to do that from an unemotional situation just from pure logic.
Hey,

1902
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:08.510
we've had this many shootings,
we've had this many incidents,
we've had this many,

1903
02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:13.010
we've had this many suspects turn up with

1904
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.140
<v 1>with concussions,</v>

1905
02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:20.040
<v 3>there's only one thing that causes a concussion to a suspect.</v>

1906
02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:23.550
It's getting hit in the head.
So if we're having,
you know,

1907
02:04:23.551 --> 02:04:25.770
42% concussion rate,

1908
02:04:26.370 --> 02:04:29.610
maybe we could drop that down if we use something that doesn't cause concussions

1909
02:04:29.611 --> 02:04:32.940
but still gives us control.
You got to,
you got to do that legwork

1910
02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.100
and make life good for the,
that work for you.

1911
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:42.690
And that's,
that's back deck can be a little bit hard to do,

1912
02:04:42.691 --> 02:04:45.060
but it's not that hard.
You know,
they,

1913
02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.960
your subordinates look at you as the guy.

1914
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:52.860
And so the way you carry yourself on the way you present yourself and the morale

1915
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:54.630
that you have is the morale that they're going to have.

1916
02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.210
That's what they're going to see as the way it is.

1917
02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.620
And I've always viewed in a single team that would the seal teams to have

1918
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:04.800
different vibes in them,
good and bad.

1919
02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.080
Someone have good commands and there's a,

1920
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:09.450
there's a new commanding officer every two years at a seal team.

1921
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:13.530
So you get a new guy that comes in and he might be a lot different than the last

1922
02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:17.820
guy.
He might be really good,
he might be really bad.
And you know what?

1923
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:19.020
It doesn't matter.

1924
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:22.800
It doesn't matter to me in a seal platoon as a platoon commander or even as a

1925
02:05:22.801 --> 02:05:25.740
squad commander or even as an e five and a seal platoon,

1926
02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:30.720
meaning just one of the sled dogs.
I don't care what the upper chain of command,

1927
02:05:30.721 --> 02:05:32.670
because guess what?
We're going to do things right?

1928
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:36.930
We're going to make things happen.
Now we're not gonna disobey what's being told,

1929
02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.770
but if we're being told something that's wrong,
guess what?

1930
02:05:38.771 --> 02:05:40.620
We're going to try and get it.
We're going to run up the chain of command.

1931
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:41.490
We're going to be squared away.

1932
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:44.760
We're going to play the game so that we can make the changes that need to be

1933
02:05:44.761 --> 02:05:49.440
made.
Because I care about the teams,
just like this guy cares about the,

1934
02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:52.380
the police department wants it to be a great force,

1935
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.850
wants it to do the right thing.

1936
02:05:55.290 --> 02:06:00.290
And so you got to take that attitude that you control your part of the world.

1937
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:07.830
And the more you improve your part of the world and the more influence you gain,

1938
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:10.440
the more you'll have control over the big picture as well.

1939
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:13.800
There's no company,

1940
02:06:13.801 --> 02:06:18.090
no corporation that maintains just superb morale all the time.

1941
02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:22.950
It doesn't happen,
you know,
peep every company,
every business,

1942
02:06:22.951 --> 02:06:26.520
every unit,
every force,
every team has ups and downs.

1943
02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:30.210
And they have leadership that comes in and takes over in that everyone considers

1944
02:06:30.211 --> 02:06:34.140
to be bad.
And that's,
that's the way it is.

1945
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:36.930
But you got to own your little piece of the world.

1946
02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:41.250
And then as you own your priest of the world,
guess what?

1947
02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:45.510
Everyone starts performing well.
And as you perform well,
you gain more clout.

1948
02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:48.930
And as you gained more clout,
you can influence real change.

1949
02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:52.230
And that's what you're looking to do.
So don't let,

1950
02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:57.360
don't let that leadership that bad,

1951
02:06:57.361 --> 02:06:59.130
what you consider to be bad leadership.

1952
02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:02.430
Just don't let that permeate into your head and your world.

1953
02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.410
Buffer your people from it,

1954
02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:08.430
and then do what you can to build the best team you can get so that you can have

1955
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:13.431
more influence so that you can change that policies and the procedures that you

1956
02:07:13.921 --> 02:07:17.330
don't agree with.
It's a long haul.
I know it.
Yeah.

1957
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:21.200
I don't have a miracle solution for you,
man.
It's tough.
It's tough.
But that's,

1958
02:07:21.201 --> 02:07:26.140
that's,
that's the world.
That's the world.
Yeah.
Especially when,

1959
02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:28.350
when you're dealing with the political elements of it.

1960
02:07:28.530 --> 02:07:32.880
And then at the same time you have the public eye on you,
you know?
So

1961
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:35.883
as far as

1962
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:39.420
<v 2>exposure and stuff like that,
it's the newsman in,
in just,</v>

1963
02:07:39.490 --> 02:07:44.230
I think media in general,
it's easy to,
to spread all this negative stuff.

1964
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:48.880
It's easy,
you know?
So it's like one of those jobs were in a big way.

1965
02:07:48.881 --> 02:07:53.050
It's,
um,
it only gets attention when something's wrong is going on,
you know?

1966
02:07:53.130 --> 02:07:53.401
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1967
02:07:53.401 --> 02:07:56.310
And I would take advantage of a lot of this negative press because a lot of this

1968
02:07:56.311 --> 02:08:00.060
negative press like you like this guy saying,
hey,
we're getting more shootings.

1969
02:08:00.061 --> 02:08:03.590
We're getting more beatings.
Well,
why is that?
Let's look at our procedures.

1970
02:08:03.690 --> 02:08:04.800
Hey boss,
you know what?

1971
02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.700
We used to use this choke hold and we had x amount of concussions.

1972
02:08:08.701 --> 02:08:10.350
We had x amount of shootings.

1973
02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:15.540
You could present the information in a logical way that proves what I know to be

1974
02:08:15.541 --> 02:08:16.920
true.
What this guy knows to be true,

1975
02:08:16.921 --> 02:08:21.390
what anybody that's ever done this type of work before knows to be true,

1976
02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:25.920
right?
That is that there are certain techniques that work better than others,

1977
02:08:26.190 --> 02:08:31.190
and a choke hold and a grappling type scenario definitely works better to subdue

1978
02:08:31.231 --> 02:08:35.670
somebody then striking them in the head repeatedly until they're knocked

1979
02:08:35.671 --> 02:08:38.190
unconscious.
Yeah.
That's just the reality of it.

1980
02:08:38.190 --> 02:08:41.610
And no one can argue with that and the only reason that they went against it

1981
02:08:41.611 --> 02:08:46.320
just for political pressure.
So how do we,
how do we defeat that?
We gain clout.

1982
02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.850
We move,
we continue to get influenced.
We grow our power,
we,

1983
02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:55.800
we strengthen our allies.
We build a coalition and we go forward.
And we went,

1984
02:08:56.370 --> 02:08:59.670
and it might take three years,
it might take three months,

1985
02:08:59.790 --> 02:09:01.440
it might take six years.

1986
02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:05.220
This guy right here that wrote this might need to be the chief of police himself

1987
02:09:05.221 --> 02:09:09.300
before he gets it done.
But he,
that's what he does.
He keep,

1988
02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:12.990
keeps on the right path and keeps moving in the right direction and does the

1989
02:09:12.991 --> 02:09:14.820
right thing so that he can get advanced.

1990
02:09:14.821 --> 02:09:18.900
He doesn't make a bunch of emotional arguments against people that have a bunch

1991
02:09:18.901 --> 02:09:22.770
of power and he put himself in a bad seat for them where they're looking at him

1992
02:09:22.771 --> 02:09:27.360
like he's a rabble rouser.
No,
not a good thing.
You got to build.

1993
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:30.210
You've got to build the relationships up the chain of command so that you become

1994
02:09:30.211 --> 02:09:33.570
respected so that people do listen to you.
That's what you gotta do.

1995
02:09:33.571 --> 02:09:34.860
That's how you make it happen.

1996
02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:38.230
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah,
man.
And on a,</v>

1997
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:43.410
on a side note that the chokehold,
well,
Jiu Jitsu overall isn't just submission.

1998
02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:47.470
Hold that.
That's kind of in my being in one of the great things about Jujitsu.

1999
02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:52.690
It's like,
I know it kind of seems that way sometimes if you're not,

2000
02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:55.660
if you don't do,
do get through whatever you think,
oh,
this guy knows Jujitsu.
Oh,

2001
02:09:55.661 --> 02:09:58.450
he'll choke you up,
he'll break your arm,
you know,
um,

2002
02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:02.590
the kind of the glamorous part of it is the submission for sure.

2003
02:10:02.591 --> 02:10:05.770
But the every other part of it is control,

2004
02:10:05.771 --> 02:10:08.650
controlling the situation all the way down to controlling the other guys.

2005
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:11.460
So when you,
when you consider like just,
just an,
uh,

2006
02:10:11.490 --> 02:10:15.760
a concept of risk control in Jujitsu,
when you're rolling us on risk control,

2007
02:10:16.090 --> 02:10:19.960
just that alone will help,
will help you in law enforcement.
Just that alone,

2008
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:25.630
let alone the whole of Jujitsu.
Just risk control.
That'll help you alone.

2009
02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:27.580
So you don't need to necessarily,

2010
02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:30.880
and I'm not saying so the chokehold should remain bad.
I'm not saying that,

2011
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:34.130
I mean for someone to die.
I mean,
I know this guy died,
the chocolate was

2012
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:35.450
<v 3>applied incorrectly,</v>

2013
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:38.620
so I dunno if he broke his neck or his Adam's apple or something like this.

2014
02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:42.740
And by the way,
if he had,
if he was better at Jujitsu,
right,

2015
02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:43.640
he would have applied it,

2016
02:10:43.641 --> 02:10:46.520
put the guy to sleep and then cuffed him and it all bring good to go.

2017
02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:48.440
Which happens all the time in class.
By the way,

2018
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:51.020
in training guys get put to sleep all the time.
I get put to sleep.

2019
02:10:51.021 --> 02:10:52.970
I don't even know how many times,
a bunch of time.

2020
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:57.550
For someone to die from a choke,
from a regular normal chocolate,

2021
02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:01.040
you got to choke him for a long time where your arms would be so tired just from

2022
02:11:01.041 --> 02:11:03.470
choking him after he goes unconscious.
You have to keep choking,

2023
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.830
choking him for a long time,
so it takes a lot.
The real,

2024
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.290
this is probably what you said,
it probably,
you're crushed her.
A hyoid bone,

2025
02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:12.290
I think it's called [inaudible].
It's basically your Adam's apple crushes.

2026
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:15.080
You shut your windpipe and the guy didn't get a tracheotomy in time.

2027
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:20.020
That is very,
very rare if ever in Jujitsu.

2028
02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:22.190
Now I've had,
I've,
I've seen it happen.

2029
02:11:22.191 --> 02:11:26.750
One time a guy passed out and went to sleep and someone was gay choking him.

2030
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.190
And so just kept cranking,

2031
02:11:28.191 --> 02:11:32.510
didn't realize that he was out for a couple seconds and it ended,
uh,
hurt him.

2032
02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:36.260
So you do have to watch out for it.
But I mean,

2033
02:11:36.261 --> 02:11:39.890
that is so rare compared to the amount of times that someone gets hit in the

2034
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:43.570
head and gets brain damage.
I mean,
that just happens all the time.
Yeah.

2035
02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:49.040
Holy jokes that you can actually do that does,
does that kind of stuff.
But again,

2036
02:11:49.041 --> 02:11:52.190
if you know what you did too,
you know the positions,
you know the moves,

2037
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:53.910
you know this submissions,
if you can do some mission,

2038
02:11:54.090 --> 02:11:57.170
you're not panicking yet to feel very comfortable on the ground.

2039
02:11:57.170 --> 02:11:59.390
You feel very comfortable engaging in combat.

2040
02:11:59.391 --> 02:12:03.380
You feel very comfortable engaging in this struggle.
You know,
you're used to it,

2041
02:12:03.381 --> 02:12:05.540
you do it all the time,
so you're not freaking out.

2042
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:11.140
You're not adrenaline just cranking a guy in the head with a Billy club over and

2043
02:12:11.631 --> 02:12:15.170
over again.
And what does he do?
He puts his hands up.
Why?

2044
02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:17.960
Because he's trying to fight me.
No,
he's just trying to protect his head.

2045
02:12:17.961 --> 02:12:21.110
But you think he's trying to fight you and that's why you're hitting him even

2046
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:24.800
harder.
Yeah.
So yeah,
it's uh,

2047
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:28.540
it's definitely a tough situation.
And,

2048
02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:33.680
and the way you win on the ground in is what you do too.

2049
02:12:33.681 --> 02:12:37.970
And the way you win this leadership situation is also with Jujitsu.

2050
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:41.600
You don't go and bang heads with the chain of command.

2051
02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.640
That's not how you're going to win this fight.

2052
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:46.700
The way you win this fight is by doing Jujitsu against the leadership.

2053
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:51.410
And you get in with them and you gain their trust and you make them think that

2054
02:12:51.411 --> 02:12:55.220
you're the man and your team is awesome.
And all,
by the way,

2055
02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:58.520
I know our team is awesome and we're totally agree with this policy and we've

2056
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:01.610
supported only this policy's working great and this other policy,
oh,
you know,

2057
02:13:01.611 --> 02:13:03.410
when you've got this one policy or that's not so good,

2058
02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:06.110
maybe we could do something to fix that.
Let me do some research.

2059
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.870
That's how you win.
You got to play the long game.

2060
02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.120
It's so funny that that analogy like,
dude,

2061
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:15.980
you get to it because really what did you do to is establishing a good position.

2062
02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:19.610
Right?
That was a good position.
Knowing where to be and where not to be.
You know,

2063
02:13:19.611 --> 02:13:23.540
where to put your weight or where to put your force and where not to put your

2064
02:13:23.541 --> 02:13:24.680
force,
you know?
Yeah.

2065
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:29.450
And the other big pieces that in Jujitsu that I was more referring to,

2066
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:33.240
although those are all correct and you have to those,
but it's also a,

2067
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:36.320
you think I'm going to choke you,
but I'm actually going arm lock.
Right,
right,

2068
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:40.980
right.
That's the setup that you flank people in new tack them indirectly.
Right.

2069
02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.040
You infiltrate and you,

2070
02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.160
you do things indirectly instead of going and just fisticuffs banging each other

2071
02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:51.690
war of attrition.
Right.
Don't do that.
So true.

2072
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:54.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2073
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:58.890
<v 3>Yeah.
Leading up the chain of command,
I think that's kind of a new concept.</v>

2074
02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.890
Not In new ways.
We get,
Oh,
you know,
that's a,
that's a chapter in the book.
Yeah.

2075
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:05.640
Or It's actually a sub chapter in the book,

2076
02:14:05.641 --> 02:14:08.940
but it's one that people are always have a hard time getting their head around

2077
02:14:08.941 --> 02:14:13.580
because I always said like,
my boss did whatever I want them to do.
Yeah.

2078
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:16.320
If people don't understand that that's the way it is.

2079
02:14:16.321 --> 02:14:20.340
When you build trust and you take the time and you build the relationship and

2080
02:14:20.341 --> 02:14:23.040
you prove over and over again that you're going to do the right thing and the

2081
02:14:23.041 --> 02:14:23.910
right situation,

2082
02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:26.520
and that you're going to take accountability and responsibility when something

2083
02:14:26.521 --> 02:14:30.000
goes wrong and that you have a good head on your shoulders and that you're not

2084
02:14:30.001 --> 02:14:33.720
going to get emotional about things and you do all those things and that you're

2085
02:14:33.721 --> 02:14:35.700
driving and supporting the mission,
guess what you're gonna get.

2086
02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.610
You're gonna get support it.
Yeah.

2087
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:39.720
Which means your boss is going to do what you want him to do.
Meanwhile,

2088
02:14:39.721 --> 02:14:42.900
you doing the same thing with down the chain of command,
that down Zach list.

2089
02:14:42.901 --> 02:14:46.240
You're doing that same thing.
It's crazy cause he just,
I dunno it today,

2090
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:48.620
it doesn't seem as intuitive.
You know,

2091
02:14:49.650 --> 02:14:54.330
easiest excuse that anyone could ever have is,
hey,
you know what?

2092
02:14:54.331 --> 02:14:57.510
My boss didn't give me what I needed.
That's why I failed.
Yup.
Hey,
you know what?

2093
02:14:57.870 --> 02:15:00.780
Our bosses won't let us use choke holds,
right?

2094
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:03.380
And therefore we can't accomplish our mission as well.
No.

2095
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:05.740
Guess what I'm going to make?
I'm going to,

2096
02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.120
I'm going to lead up the chain of command and I'm going to get my superiors to

2097
02:15:09.121 --> 02:15:12.060
let us do what we need to do to do it effectively.
Because guess what?

2098
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.460
The leadership is aligned.

2099
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:17.010
Your leadership is going to be aligned with what you want to do.

2100
02:15:17.130 --> 02:15:21.750
Do you think that the leadership of the LAPD wants,
you know,
uh,

2101
02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:22.960
Victoria,
uh,

2102
02:15:23.010 --> 02:15:27.900
suspects at perps to get your brain damage and killed?
No,
they didn't want that.

2103
02:15:28.110 --> 02:15:29.790
They want it.
They want them to be arrested properly.

2104
02:15:29.791 --> 02:15:31.470
They don't want to have lawsuits,
the whole nine yards.

2105
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.920
So if you're presenting something to them that's going to improve them and move

2106
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:39.030
them towards the mission and support the ideals of what they're trying to get

2107
02:15:39.031 --> 02:15:40.840
accomplished,
of course you're going to get supported.

2108
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:42.930
Now you're going to get these little political battles,

2109
02:15:42.931 --> 02:15:44.430
but those are just part of the challenge.

2110
02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:48.660
It's bare just part of making it happen.
That's part of the Jujitsu.

2111
02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:53.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
When you run with a guy that don't expect them not to fight back,

2112
02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:58.260
fight back.
Exactly right.
Last question,

2113
02:16:00.090 --> 02:16:00.923
<v 1>Jacqueline,</v>

2114
02:16:01.230 --> 02:16:05.790
<v 3>do you think having an aggressive mindset is the same as being a proactive?</v>

2115
02:16:09.110 --> 02:16:13.970
So I actually looked up the definition for these two words,

2116
02:16:13.971 --> 02:16:15.230
aggressive and proactive.

2117
02:16:15.231 --> 02:16:20.231
So proactive is creating or controlling a situation by causing something to

2118
02:16:20.721 --> 02:16:25.550
happen rather than responding to it after it has happened

2119
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:32.290
and aggressive is ready or likely to attack or confront.

2120
02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:34.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2121
02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:38.170
<v 3>Characterized by or resulting from aggression.</v>

2122
02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:45.020
So you can see that the,
the meanings,

2123
02:16:45.050 --> 02:16:50.050
there's certainly the similar and I definitely think you have to be proactive in

2124
02:16:51.951 --> 02:16:56.350
the world.
You know,

2125
02:16:56.351 --> 02:17:01.090
you want to be you and be dictating what happens,
not responding to it.
And

2126
02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:07.720
yeah,
that means creating or controlling a situation as much as you can.

2127
02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:11.020
Right.
So that's,
that's proactive,

2128
02:17:12.550 --> 02:17:13.780
but being aggressive,

2129
02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:19.090
that means you're ready to attack.

2130
02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:21.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2131
02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:22.790
<v 3>Is it?
As I always point out,</v>

2132
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:26.420
that doesn't mean that you walk around with your chest puffed out,

2133
02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:29.840
ready to bang heads with everyone around you.

2134
02:17:29.930 --> 02:17:34.930
It doesn't mean you confront people all the time physically or mentally head on

2135
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:41.120
without a tactically superior plan.

2136
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:49.200
It doesn't mean you go straight forward into conflict without fought and without

2137
02:17:49.601 --> 02:17:53.860
reason.
Doesn't mean you engage in attrition warfare.

2138
02:17:55.550 --> 02:17:56.383
<v 1>No,</v>

2139
02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:00.910
<v 3>that is almost never smart.</v>

2140
02:18:04.130 --> 02:18:07.100
But what it does mean,
what aggression does mean

2141
02:18:09.930 --> 02:18:14.910
is that you're going to get after it.
You're going to move fast,

2142
02:18:14.911 --> 02:18:19.620
you're going to think fast.
You're going to out thinking out,
maneuver the enemy.

2143
02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.780
If I think the enemy is going to attack me,
I'm gonna attack him first.

2144
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:30.720
If I think the enemy's gonna seize a piece of terrain,

2145
02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:33.840
I'm going to be there waiting for him,

2146
02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:40.660
and if the enemy's going to try and flank me too late,

2147
02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.120
I'm already going to be flanking him.

2148
02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:51.380
So I don't view aggression

2149
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:54.980
as an outward attitude,

2150
02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:57.200
<v 1>okay?</v>

2151
02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.240
<v 3>I view aggression as an internal character trait.</v>

2152
02:19:02.630 --> 02:19:06.230
A fire in your mind that says,

2153
02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.990
I am going to win.

2154
02:19:10.590 --> 02:19:14.900
I'm going to fight and I'm going to battle and I'm going to use every tool I

2155
02:19:14.901 --> 02:19:16.670
have to crush my enemy.

2156
02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.420
And that tool,
it might be fists,

2157
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:25.400
but it also might be guile.

2158
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.860
It could be a frontal attack,

2159
02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:37.820
but it also might be a covert assassination.

2160
02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:44.330
And it could be a vulgar display of power,

2161
02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:48.580
but just as likely

2162
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:54.370
it could be a subtle political maneuver.

2163
02:19:57.930 --> 02:20:02.820
That's what aggression is to me.
The on the spot bubble fighting spirit,

2164
02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:03.990
the drive,

2165
02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:09.200
the burning desire to achieve mission success using every possible tool,

2166
02:20:10.530 --> 02:20:15.420
every asset,
and every strategy and tactic to bring about victory.

2167
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:23.010
To me,
aggression is the will to win.

2168
02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:31.380
And if that kind of internal and relentless aggression

2169
02:20:33.430 --> 02:20:36.070
is your deep fault mode,

2170
02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:41.080
then you will win.

2171
02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:51.340
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2172
02:20:53.410 --> 02:20:57.700
So
it's all you troopers out there.

2173
02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:02.380
Thanks for joining us in this conversation.

2174
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:07.720
Thanks for listening.
And subscribing end.
If you like it,

2175
02:21:09.010 --> 02:21:13.660
go through a little review on iTunes or posted on your social media

2176
02:21:15.250 --> 02:21:20.250
so you do what you can to spread the word so we can get more people out of the

2177
02:21:22.601 --> 02:21:23.770
darkness.

2178
02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:25.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2179
02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.200
<v 3>And into the light.</v>

2180
02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.960
Thanks for connecting with us through the interwebs.

2181
02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:34.120
And if you don't know on Twitter,

2182
02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:39.460
I'm at Jocko Willink and echo is at Echo Charles.

2183
02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:42.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2184
02:21:42.430 --> 02:21:47.430
<v 3>Give us a shout out there or ask us any questions you might have and of course</v>

2185
02:21:48.730 --> 02:21:52.330
thanks to the companies that support us

2186
02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:58.570
and please support the companies that support us.
How can they do that echo?

2187
02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:03.490
It's true.
I'm actually back to the Twitter thing.
I that's your surprisingly

2188
02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:09.460
in like easy to talk to on Twitter,
you know,

2189
02:22:09.461 --> 02:22:11.080
so I know like a lot of people,

2190
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:14.260
there'll be like maybe a follow up question to some questions on here or

2191
02:22:14.261 --> 02:22:15.280
something that they've heard,

2192
02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:19.900
something that won't require a big long extended answer.
And um,
that's,
uh,
that's,

2193
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:22.300
I think from what I've seen and what I've experienced,

2194
02:22:22.301 --> 02:22:25.030
that's a good place to ask.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

2195
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:28.620
If you've got a question to ask on Twitter,
I might just respond and say,
no,

2196
02:22:28.621 --> 02:22:31.950
I would never do that.
Right.
Or,
yes,
that's an excellent idea,

2197
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:36.960
or whatever.
Or I might say,
Hey,
I'm just gonna answer that in a podcast.
Yeah.

2198
02:22:36.961 --> 02:22:38.070
That it's a good spot though.

2199
02:22:38.071 --> 02:22:40.230
I think it's not one of these things where you'll just be like,

2200
02:22:40.231 --> 02:22:43.350
hey Jocko this and then it goes ignored.

2201
02:22:43.970 --> 02:22:46.290
I mean how long I'll be able to keep this up for,

2202
02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:49.140
I mean there's starting to be a lot of people on there which is awesome,

2203
02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:54.450
but I definitely will like anybody that puts something pertinent.

2204
02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:57.600
Yeah.
Yeah man.
Somebody is taking some time to talk to me.

2205
02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:00.450
I'm going to take some time to talk to him back.
Yeah,
that's good man.

2206
02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:03.780
I tried to do the same thing even though people are more just making jokes to
me,

2207
02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.440
which actually I'd prefer cause my answers there may or may not be reliable.

2208
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:10.883
We'll just say that,

2209
02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:14.340
but if you want to support the podcast in other ways of course,

2210
02:23:14.341 --> 02:23:16.890
and you want to get some solid supplements,

2211
02:23:17.010 --> 02:23:21.120
the only supplement that you take,
right?
Yes.

2212
02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:23.040
India actually.
Yeah,
me too.

2213
02:23:23.041 --> 02:23:26.190
Aside from like weird preworkout that is sometimes they can only supplement.

2214
02:23:26.191 --> 02:23:31.140
They take us from audit quality is guaranteed.
Anyway,

2215
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:35.520
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko get a warrior.
Bart,
do yourself that favor.

2216
02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:38.320
I would say shroom tech now for Britain,
but the worry bar,

2217
02:23:38.321 --> 02:23:40.350
that might be the new stuff,
you know.
Anyway,

2218
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:44.290
do that or go to Amazon or before you go to Amazon,

2219
02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:48.960
go to Jocko podcast.com or Jocko store.com and click through the link that you

2220
02:23:48.961 --> 02:23:53.640
can support.
That way it's pretty cool.
Kind of passively support with one click.

2221
02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:57.370
Boom.
That's all you gotta do or get a shirt while you're on there.
Jocko.

2222
02:23:57.371 --> 02:24:00.800
store.com if you like them,
you don't have to put it.
Yeah,
if you like them.
Good.

2223
02:24:00.801 --> 02:24:05.330
I do that.
Can we go bumper stickers and mugs to now,
by the way,
Keith,

2224
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:09.290
you didn't know that chocolate has one on his Korean most outlandish uh,

2225
02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.400
product that we can make.
We'll have to figure that out.

2226
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:16.401
What's the most outlandish Jocko product that we could come up with?

2227
02:24:18.570 --> 02:24:23.320
Hit us up on Twitter.
No,
what outlandish product you on an echo.

2228
02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:28.230
Create this big old mirror and that create it.
Yeah.
I'm going to create it.

2229
02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:31.380
And I think I will also,
if you want to read about these principles,

2230
02:24:31.381 --> 02:24:32.430
if you want to read about them,

2231
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.780
these principles in a more official manner,

2232
02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:39.390
you can check out the book extreme ownership that Leif Babin and I wrote

2233
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:43.530
hardcover kindle audio book.

2234
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:47.880
The audio book is read by myself and life.
So you can,
uh,

2235
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:52.350
you can hear us talk more.
And then finally,

2236
02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:55.260
and most important,

2237
02:24:55.290 --> 02:25:00.290
thanks to everybody for getting aggressive as you attack your weaknesses and you

2238
02:25:05.281 --> 02:25:09.720
make yourself better,
faster,
stronger,
smarter,

2239
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:13.590
healthier.
And of course,

2240
02:25:14.430 --> 02:25:18.600
thanks to everyone out there for setting that alarm clock,

2241
02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:23.160
opening your eyes,
springing out of bed

2242
02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:26.410
<v 1>and getting after it.</v>

2243
02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:34.420
And until next time,
this is Jocko and echo out.
