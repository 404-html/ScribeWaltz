This is Jocko podcast number 58 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.370
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.280
No,
a couple of shows ago when Dr Peter Attia was on,

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.370
he mentioned an article,

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.050
and I hesitate to call it an article because it is actually much more than just

6
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:27.431
an article.

7
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:32.431
It's an elegant piece that was published in the New York Times written by his

8
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.370
friend and the daughter of one of his mentors,

9
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.220
a woman named Naomi Rosenberg,

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.230
Dr Naomi Rosenberg,
who is a doctor at Temple University.

11
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.580
And Peter said that this article truly captured the emotions and the struggle

12
00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:01.441
and the methodology for delivering the worst news to a parent that their child

13
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.693
had died.

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.740
<v 0>And I of course read the article and I found it incredible and I wanted to share</v>

16
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.070
it with you

17
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.750
in case you didn't have a chance to read it yourself yet.

18
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.360
So here it is from the opinion section of the New York Times on September 3rd,

19
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.960
2016 by Dr Naomi Rosenberg,

20
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.960
how to tell a mother her child is dead

21
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.480
first.
You get your coat.

22
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.670
I don't care if you don't remember where you left it,
you find it.

23
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.690
If there was a lot of blood,

24
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.830
you ask someone to go quickly to the basement to get you a new set of scrubs.

25
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.970
You put on your coat and you go into the bathroom.

26
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.590
You look into the mirror and you say it.

27
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.330
You use the mother's name and you use her child's name.

28
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.480
You may not adjust this part in any way.

29
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.540
I will show you.
If it were my mother,
you would say,
Mrs Rosenberg,

30
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.590
I have terrible,
terrible news.
Naomi died today.

31
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.870
You say it out loud until you can say it clearly and loudly.

32
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.220
How loudly
loud enough.

33
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.990
If it takes you fewer than five tries,

34
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.540
you are rushing it and you will not do it right.

35
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.730
You take your time
after the bathroom,

36
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.570
you do nothing before you go to her.
You don't make a phone call.

37
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.750
You do talk to the medical student.
You do not put in an order.

38
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.080
You'll never make her wait.
She is his mother.

39
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.260
When you get inside the room,
you will know who the mother is.
Yes,

40
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.490
I am very sure.

41
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.120
<v 1>Okay,</v>

42
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.430
<v 0>shake her hand and tell her who you are.</v>

43
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.500
If there is time you shake everyone's hand.
Yes,

44
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.130
you will know if there is time
you never stand.

45
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.670
If there are no seats left,
the couches have arms on them,

46
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.090
you will have a decision to make about whether you will ask her what she already

47
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:42.770
knows.
If you were the one to call her and tell her that her son had been shot,

48
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.900
then you already have done part of it,

49
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.110
but you have not done it yet.

50
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.100
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.890
<v 0>you are about to do it now.
You never make her wait.</v>

52
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.040
She is his mother

53
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.100
now.
You explode the world.

54
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.570
Yes,
you have to.

55
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.300
You say something like,
Mrs. Booker,
I have terrible,

56
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.320
terrible news.
Earnest died today.

57
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.093
<v 1>Then you wait.</v>

58
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.610
<v 0>You will not stand up.</v>

59
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.170
You may leave yourself in the heaviness of your breath or the racing of your

60
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:35.870
pulse or the site of your shoe laces on your shoe,

61
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.760
but you will not stand up.

62
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.690
You are here for her.

63
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.420
She is his mother.

64
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.800
If the mother has another son with her and he has punched the wall or broken the

65
00:04:54.801 --> 00:04:56.270
chair,
do not be worried.

66
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.280
The one that punched a wall or broke the chair will be better than the one who

67
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:04.860
looks down and refuses to cry.

68
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.310
The one who punched the wall or broke the chair will be much easier than the

69
00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:17.891
sister who looks up and closes her eyes as they fill.

70
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 0>Security is already outside the room and when they hear the first loud noise,</v>

72
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.690
they will know to come in.

73
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.500
<v 0>No,
you will not have to tell them.</v>

75
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.440
They know about the family room in the emergency department in summer in North

76
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.770
Philadelphia.
It is all right.

77
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.440
They will be kind.

78
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.090
If the chair cannot be sat in again.
That is all right.

79
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.200
We have money for new chairs every summer.

80
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.570
If he does not break your chair,
you stay in your chair.
If he does,

81
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.250
you find a new place to sit.

82
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.390
You are here for the mother and you have more to do.

83
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.190
If she asks you,
you were teller.

84
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.310
What you know you do not lie,

85
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.740
but do not say he was murdered or he was killed.
Yes,

86
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.950
I know that he was,
but that is not what you say.

87
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.870
You say that he died.

88
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.950
That is the part that you saw and that you know

89
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.110
when she asks if he felt any pain,
you must be very careful

90
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.450
if he did not.
You assure her quickly.

91
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.090
If he did,
you do not lie,
but his pain is over.

92
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:53.924
Now

93
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.320
do not ever say he was lucky that he did not feel pain.

94
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.200
He was not lucky.
She is not lucky.

95
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.660
Don't make that face.

96
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.920
The depth of the stupidity of the things you will say sometimes is unimaginable

97
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.360
before you leave.

98
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.920
You break her heart one more time.
No,

99
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.820
I'm sorry,
but you cannot see him.
There are strict rules.

100
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:42.420
When a person dies this way and the police have to take him first.

101
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.990
We cannot let you in.
I'm so sorry.

102
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.630
You do not ever say the body.

103
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.870
It is not a body.
It is her son.

104
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.730
You want to tell her that you know that he was hers,

105
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.620
but she knows that and she does not need for you to tell her.

106
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.560
Instead,
tell her you will give her time and come back in case she has questions,

107
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.680
more questions or questions for the first time.

108
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.940
If she has no questions,

109
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.620
you do not give her the answers to the questions she has not asked.

110
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.613
<v 1>Okay?</v>

111
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.860
<v 0>When you leave the room,</v>

112
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.990
do not yell at the medical student who has a question.

113
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.670
When you get home,
do not yell at your husband

114
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.350
if he left his socks on the floor again today.
