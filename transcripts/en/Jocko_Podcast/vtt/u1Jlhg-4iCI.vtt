00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.270
This is Jocko podcast number 10 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.820
Jocko Willink.
Oh,

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.390
salt into hell.

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.210
We waited a seeming eternity for the signal to start towards the beach.

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.790
The suspense was almost more than I could bear.
Weeding is a major part of war,

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.530
but I never experienced any more supreme Lee agonizing suspense in the
extrusion,

7
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.700
creating torture of those moments before we received the signal to begin the

8
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.200
assault on Pellalou.

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.180
I broke out in a cold sweat as the tension mounted with the intensity of the

10
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:44.810
bombardment.
My stomach was tied in knots.

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.770
I had a lump in my throat and swallowed only with great difficulty.

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.590
My knees nearly buckled,
so I Clung weekly to the side of the tractor.

13
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.020
I felt nauseated in feared that my bladder would surely empty itself and reveal

14
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.090
me to be the coward I was,

15
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.820
but the men around me look just about the same way I felt.
Finally,

16
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.770
with a sense of fatalistic relief mixed with a flash of anger at a navy officer

17
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.690
who was our wave commander.

18
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
I saw him waving his flag toward the beach are dry.

19
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.330
Our driver rev the engine,

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.230
the treads churned up the water and we started in the second wave is shore.

21
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.110
We moved ahead watching the frightful spectacle,

22
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.920
huge geysers of water rose around the amtraks ahead of us as they approached the

23
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.304
reef.

24
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.350
The beach was now marked along its length by a continuous sheet of flame backed

25
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:44.060
by a thick wall of smoke.

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.310
It seemed as though a huge volcano had erupted from the sea and rather than

27
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.510
heading for an island,

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.490
we were being drawn into the vortex of a flaming a bis.
For many,

29
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.380
it was to be oblivion.

30
00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.740
<v 0>Suddenly a large shell exploded with a terrific concussion and a huge geyser are</v>

32
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.920
up right next to our front.
It barely missed us.

33
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.240
The engine stalled the front of the tractor lurch to the left and bumped hard

34
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.750
against the rear of another ramp track that was either stalled or hit.

35
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.940
I never knew which.

36
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.640
We sat stalled floating in the water for some terrifying moments.

37
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.790
We were sitting ducks for the enemy gunners.

38
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.760
I look forward through their hatch behind the driver.

39
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.220
He was wrestling frantically with the control levers.

40
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.970
Japanese shells were screaming into the year and exploding all around us.

41
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.170
Sergeant Johnny Marr met,
leaned toward the driver and yelled something,

42
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.190
whatever it was.
It seemed to calm the driver because he got the engine started.

43
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.270
We moved forward again amid the geysers of exploding shells are bombardment,

44
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.460
began to lift off the beach and move inland.

45
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.820
Our dive bombers also moved inland with their strafing and bombing.

46
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.300
The Japanese increased their volume of fire against the waves of Amtrak's above

47
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.121
the din.

48
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.720
I could hear the ominous sound of shell fragments humming and grounding through

49
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.840
the air stand by someone yelled,

50
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.720
hit the beach Yeldon NCO moments before the machine lurch to a shop.

51
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.990
The men piled over the sides as fast as they could.
I followed Snafu,

52
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.340
climbed up and planted both feet firmly on the left side so as to leap as far

53
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:28.890
away from it as possible.
At that incident,

54
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.670
a burst of machine gun fire with white hot tracer snap through the air at eye

55
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:37.290
level,
almost grazing my face.
I pulled back like a turtle,

56
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.320
lost my balance and fell awkwardly forward down under the sand in a tangle of

57
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:45.390
ammo bag pack,
helmet,
car being gas,
mass,

58
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:50.280
cartridge belt and flopping canteens.
Get off the beach,
get off the beach,

59
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:55.260
race through my mind.
She else crashed all around fragments,

60
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:59.940
Tor and word slapping on the sand and splashing in the water a few yards behind

61
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:04.680
us.
The Japanese were recovering from the shock of our pre landing bombardment.

62
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.310
Their machine gun and rifle fire got thicker,

63
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.550
snapping viciously overhead in an increasing volume up and down the beach and

64
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:16.920
out on the reef.
A number of Amtrak's.

65
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.921
We're burning Japanese machine gun burst made long splashes on the water as

66
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.390
though flying it with some giant whip.

67
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.340
The geysers belched up relentlessly where the mortar and artillery shells hit.

68
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I caught a fleeting glimpse of a group of Marines leaving a smoking Amtrak on

69
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:35.904
the reef.

70
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Some fell as bullets and fragments splashed among them are buddies,

71
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:47.820
tried to help them as they struggled in knee deep water.

72
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.610
I shuttered and choked a while.
Desperate feeling of anger,

73
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.860
frustration,
and PD gripped me.

74
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.660
It was an emotion that would always torture my mind when I saw men trapped and

75
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:04.480
was unable to do anything but watch as they were,

76
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:08.290
hit my own plight,
forgotten momentarily.

77
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.880
I felt sick into the depths of my soul.
I ask God,

78
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.920
why,
why,
why?

79
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.570
I turned my face away and wish that I were imagining it at all.

80
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.770
I tasted the bitterest essence of war,

81
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.160
the site of helpless comrades being slaughtered,

82
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.080
and it filled me with disgust.

83
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.770
That right there is

84
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.293
from a book,

85
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.500
an absolutely incredible book called with the old breed by Eugene sledge.

86
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.500
<v 0>Eugene sledge was a</v>

88
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.283
marine.

89
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.700
He was a marine in World II and he ended up being a university professor and an

90
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.430
author.
When he got done,
he wrote this book.

91
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.260
I read this book for the first time when I was on deployment to Iraq,

92
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.090
my first deployment to Iraq.
And it,
it definitely,

93
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.710
it definitely kept me in check
because it,

94
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.740
it made me always remember that what we were experiencing this,

95
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.430
this war that we were in was

96
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.580
something that men had always experienced.

97
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.560
And actually they have experienced much,

98
00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:43.290
much worse than I ever experienced.

99
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600
And this book was later used to make the documentary a PBS documentary called

100
00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:57.270
the war.
And in 2000,

101
00:06:57.271 --> 00:07:01.980
I think it came out in 2010 was the Hbo Mini Series called the Pacific,

102
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.880
which is just an absolutely epic,

103
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.230
epic series.
And if you haven't watched the Pacific,
it's,

104
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.470
it's phenomenal.
Get it and watch it.

105
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.620
It's completely realistic.

106
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:23.150
One of the things that struck me when I watched it for the first time was,

107
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.130
you know,
he talks about the waiting and the very first episode of the Pacific,

108
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.370
you,
you're waiting for something happened.

109
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:35.450
They're showing the guys prep and then they actually land in n you'll waiting
in,

110
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.140
waiting for something to happen.
And it,
and it doesn't end.

111
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.780
It has this,
uh,
this feeling.
And I remember that feeling,

112
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.640
especially being in Ramadi when you'd be out in the streets and no shooting and

113
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:53.780
started yet.
And I would be,
you know,
everyone would have this feeling,

114
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:57.260
you waiting for it to start in every step.
You're waiting for it to start.

115
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:01.070
So it does a very,
a very,

116
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.650
it doesn't incredible job of portraying that and giving you that feeling.

117
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.390
Now what's important to remember about Eugene Sledge and,

118
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.260
and that's another great thing about the,

119
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.653
<v 1>the,</v>

120
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.090
<v 0>the Pacific is that they do interviews with these guys.</v>

121
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.200
They do interviews with them.
And you can see when you watch this,

122
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:27.600
you will see that Eugene sledge.

123
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.550
And as I thought about how I would describe Eugene Sledge,
he's,
yes,

124
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:33.840
he's a marine and you,
you know,

125
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:38.730
you get whatever ideas you get in your mind of what a Marine is.
You know,

126
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:41.850
a tough guy,
a,
a brief,
a guy filled with bravado.

127
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.990
Eugene sledge just will destroy that image because Eugene Sledge and,

128
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.600
and if,
if I think of the way I would describe him,

129
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.380
<v 2>it would be to simply,
he's a good man.</v>

130
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.640
And you can tell when he talks that he's an upright man and that he's a moral

131
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.740
man and he's a gentle in a kind person.

132
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.480
I mean it is his gentleness and his kindness oozes out of him.

133
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.470
And He seems like,
and I don't use this word very often,

134
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.830
but I will use it because this is how I would describe it.

135
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.840
He seems like a lovely human being.
I mean,

136
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:27.690
he just seems like a lovely person.

137
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.893
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

138
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.320
<v 2>And so as we go into this book,</v>

139
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.090
remember that this guy who went through this was just an absolutely incredibly

140
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:47.620
good
human

141
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.920
and also an incredible warrior.
Now,

142
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.320
the last podcast we talked about Patton and war as I knew it.

143
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.420
And that is a general's view.

144
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:06.410
And if you remember when we talked about when we went to Sri Lanka,

145
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.970
that was that that guy describe the,

146
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.070
the foot soldiers view as being a worm's view because you're so in the front

147
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:19.880
line that it's like a worm.
And that's what this is.
This is a soldier's book.

148
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:23.510
This is the troopers book.
This is the absolute front lines.

149
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.860
And it is a book that really unveils a lot about will and survival and the

150
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:41.081
psychological nature of war and what it does to people

151
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.490
and what people are capable of doing.

152
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.140
And also I think it makes it very clear why we fight against evil.

153
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.250
And I think that

154
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.930
it's something that makes me think always about where we are in the world

155
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.620
in a,
in a war

156
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.210
against evil.
So going back to the book,

157
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.210
we started to move inland.

158
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.640
We had gone only a few yards when an enemy machine gun opened up from a scrub

159
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:24.641
thicket to our right Japanese 81 millimeter in 90 millimeter mortars then opened

160
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:29.300
up on us.
Everyone hit the deck.
I dove into a shallow crater.

161
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.850
The company was completely pinned down.
All movements ceased.

162
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.590
The shells fell faster until I couldn't make out individual explosions.

163
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.680
Just continuous crashing rumbles with an occasional ripping sound of shrapnel

164
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:50.051
tearing low through the air overhead a month the roar,

165
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.100
the air was murky with smoking dust.
Every muscle

166
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.560
<v 0>in my body was as tight as a piano wire.</v>

167
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.110
I shuttered and shook as though we're having a mile.
Mild convulsion.

168
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.500
Sweat flowed profusely.
I prayed,
clenched my teeth,
squeezed my car,

169
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:11.950
buying stock and curse.
The Japanese are lieutenant,
a Cape,

170
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.220
a Cape Gloucester veteran who was nearby seem to be in about the same shape from

171
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:20.650
the meager protection of my shallow crater.

172
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.800
I pitied him or anyone out on that flat coral.

173
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.470
The heavy mortar barrage went on without slacking.
I thought it would never stop.

174
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.730
I was terrified by the big shells arching down all around us.

175
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.690
One was a bound to fall directly into my hole.

176
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:43.691
I thought if any orders were passed along or if anyone yelled for a corpsman,

177
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.640
I never heard it in all the noise.

178
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.020
It was as though I were out there on the battlefield all by myself,

179
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.820
utterly for Lorne and helpless in a tempest of violent explosions.

180
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.580
All any men could do was sweated out and pray for survival.

181
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.810
They would have been sure suicide to stand up in that firestorm

182
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.890
under my first barrage.
Since the fast moving events of hitting the beach,

183
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.630
I learned a new sensation,

184
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.930
other and absolute helplessness.

185
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.570
The shelling lifted in about a half an hour,

186
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:23.980
although it seemed to me to have crashed on for hours,
time had no meaning.

187
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.420
This was particularly true when under heavy shelling I could never judge how

188
00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:33.840
long it lasted.
Orders then came to move up,

189
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.620
move out and I got up covered by a layer of coral dust.

190
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.780
I felt like jelly and couldn't believe any of us had survived that barrage.

191
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.890
So that feeling of helplessness and that is something that is,

192
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.370
is the w is one of the worst things for huge.

193
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.990
It's one of the worst human emotions,
right?
Helplessness.
And

194
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.880
I have,
I've,

195
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:12.881
I've experienced just a minor amount of shelling of being mortared and it is

196
00:14:17.721 --> 00:14:18.321
definitely,

197
00:14:18.321 --> 00:14:23.321
I was in a is in Iraq and my first deployment and we were on a fire base and we

198
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:29.150
were trying to help with some sniper Overwatch because this place had been being

199
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:33.980
attacked.
And we,
you know,
we,
this was early,

200
00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:35.870
this is early in my first deployment.

201
00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:40.220
My first time going to war and you know,
we're thinking,
Hey,

202
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.810
these guys are getting mortared.
Cool.

203
00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:46.010
We'll go out there and just kill these people that are more room and we're,

204
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.030
we'll take care of it.

205
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.450
So we went out to this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and

206
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.990
sure enough,
we started getting mortared and the God,

207
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.290
the insurgents that were firing the mortars and knew exactly what they were

208
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.310
doing.
And it was,

209
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.960
it was horrible because it was in the city.

210
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.500
And so the mortars were being shot at us from three or 400 meters away,

211
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.950
but they were from behind the buildings and we could actually,

212
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.750
we could actually hear the mortars being launched.
So you would hear the home,

213
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.500
you'd hear the noise,

214
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.270
and you could actually see the fire trail of the launch.

215
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:40.250
So you knew.
So now there you are and you're sitting there and you,

216
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.450
you're just waiting to get to get blown up.
And it was,

217
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.300
it's interesting because if you have overhead cover,

218
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.460
which means if you have some kind of a strong roof over your head,

219
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:51.950
if you're inside of a building,
a strong building that's made of concrete,

220
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.310
it doesn't have to be a bunk or anything for,
for smaller mortars,

221
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.880
you're basically safe.
You know,
you're,
you're fine.

222
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.070
And we didn't really understand that yet.
So we had guys,

223
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.880
myself included,
that were exposed,
that were outside,
that were on rooftops.

224
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.130
And this is again,
I want to emphasize,

225
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.080
this is nothing,

226
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.970
this is nothing compared to what Eugene Sledge's talking about.

227
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.880
The only reason I'm bringing up is because I did experience it.

228
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:28.210
And my point is that even through one night where we took maybe,

229
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.360
I dunno,
maybe 10 mortar rounds in a night,

230
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.880
it actually affected the guys a little bit.
One night,

231
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.740
one night and you could see it actually when we got back to our compound,

232
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.650
we had a door on our tactical operation center that was a old piece of plywood

233
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.011
and it,

234
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:51.740
somebody had mounted a spring on there to keep it shut because it was hot and it

235
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:55.790
was air conditioning in there.
And it was a,
I was a strong spring.

236
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.980
And so when you walked out and you let that go,

237
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:01.700
it would slap and it would make a very loud bang.
And I literally,

238
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:05.810
after one measly night of getting mortared,

239
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.760
I watched guys shutter and at this flap of that noise.

240
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.770
And so to imagine what it was like for these guys for,

241
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.040
you know,
a half an hour of continuous shelling is,

242
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.880
it's just,
it's unbelievable.
And I'll tell you something else.

243
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.790
If you go back further than that,

244
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.820
and you go to world war one where those soldiers were in the trenches and they

245
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:40.490
got bombarded for months,

246
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.640
and if you want to know what that does to a human,

247
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.420
go on to youtube and Google World War One or going to youtube and search world

248
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:53.130
war one shell shock.

249
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.970
And it is horrendous to see the psychological damage that it did to these guys.

250
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.510
And the worst part of it was was that today we understand that we understand

251
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.210
what it does to people psychologically and we understand that it's,

252
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.900
it's,
it's a psychological damage.

253
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.430
And in World War One,
they didn't know that.

254
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.250
So these guys that broke,

255
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.220
they were cowards,
they were called cowards.

256
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.790
And to think about that is sickening to me knowing that my guys,

257
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.530
after like I said,

258
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:45.531
a minuscule amount of receiving mortar and artillery fire is mortar fire.

259
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.610
But it's the same thing.

260
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:52.611
It's indirect fire that didn't know that that already had a little bit of effect

261
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.570
to imagine.
What that did over time was,

262
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:02.310
was crazy.
And I was,
I got,

263
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.370
I got two moments in time that I remember that the,

264
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.700
that I had the feeling of helplessness we were on,

265
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.020
I was on the rooftop and again this was in Baghdad and we'd gone to the space to

266
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:19.860
set up some sniper positions and help them eliminate their problem.

267
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.300
Boy were we wrong.

268
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.440
So this rooftop was kind of divided up by concrete walls.

269
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.780
And to get to this,
to the furthest part away on the roof,

270
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.500
you had to go jump a bunch of these walls and you,
you know,

271
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.510
you were traveling probably,
I dunno,

272
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.750
50 meters across this rooftop to get to one of the corners.

273
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.910
And so I had,
you know,

274
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:48.060
I was checking the positions of all the guys and walking from position to

275
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.180
position to see where they are and see what their field of fire was and make any

276
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.430
adjustments if needed,
check in with them,
et cetera.

277
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.910
So I get up to this,
I climb out,
get on the roof,

278
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:04.680
climb up this,
climb up the stairs to the roof,
jump a bunch of these,

279
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.570
you know,
little four foot walls.

280
00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:10.950
Just kind of getting over him takes two or three minutes to get,

281
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.680
and I finally get to this position where there's a,
one of the,

282
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.940
one of the gunners is sitting there and as I get there,
hey,
how's it going?

283
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:18.774
What are you seeing?

284
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.300
We're having our little discussion and all of a sudden we hear the mortar launch

285
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.940
shoom shoom and one of the other guys in the platoon gets on the radio and he

286
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:35.220
says,
uh,
he says,
that's three boys.
Count them out,

287
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.800
meaning okay,
there's going to be three booms.
And again,

288
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:45.450
we have no overhead cover cause I'm on the roof.
And I look at,

289
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.740
I look at the guy I'm with and he says,

290
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.880
you think we can make it back inside because you have time.
You know the,
the,

291
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.220
the mortar rounds going way up in the air.
He says,

292
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:58.840
do you think we can make it back inside?
And I said,
nope.
Then he says,

293
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.280
what should we do?
And I said,

294
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.030
hope it doesn't land in our quadrant,

295
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.640
meaning this little area that we actually the land in there,
we'd be dead.

296
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.020
But that's the feeling of helping us,
that,
that you have.
And,

297
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.980
and luckily that didn't land in our quadrant.
I was in another situation,

298
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.660
this was now on the,

299
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.890
on the Baghdad International Airport where our base was.

300
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.410
And there was an attack on,
on one of the gates.

301
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.710
And we went there as a quick reaction force and we get out there and as the

302
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:36.040
attacks happening and we're kind of showing up to see what we can do to help out

303
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.640
all of a sudden mortar start coming in.
And again,

304
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.200
I get down behind a,
just a normal,
like a Jersey barrier,

305
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.650
a concrete jersey barrier.
And,

306
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.600
but we're in a pretty open area other than this jersey barrier.

307
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.153
And again,
I'm,

308
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.190
I'm hunkered down with a one other seal and he looks at me and he goes,

309
00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.310
what should we do?
And I go,

310
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.130
there's nothing we can do but sit here and suck it up.

311
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.320
And that's really all you can do.

312
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.930
And it's easy to look back and be like that.
That was funny,
you know,
but,

313
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.910
but that was,
that was,
uh,
three minutes of mortar bombardment,
right?
Yeah.

314
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.890
And,
and so just to imagine the psychological trauma that these guys experienced,

315
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:25.210
it was,
uh,
it was just,

316
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.030
it's,
it's horrible to imagine.
And the key point of all this,
I think,

317
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.470
is to think about as,

318
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.690
as it pertains to people as it pertains to individuals as it pertains to us now

319
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.100
to people in the civilian world,

320
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
what causes this intense anxiety and fear is the complete lack of control.

321
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.670
That's what causes it.
See,
when you're in a firefight or you're getting shot at,

322
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.460
it's coming from somewhere and you can hide from it and you can get down and you

323
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:58.300
can maneuver on it.
When it's,
when it's not that,

324
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:02.680
when it's just random death that you cannot control,

325
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.990
it's,
it's psychologically much,
much harder to deal with.

326
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.500
And thank God we didn't have to deal with it very often.

327
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.080
Now again,
when we were in Ramadi,

328
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.640
the guys that were over with the first of the five oh six on camp Corregidor,

329
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.310
those guys were getting mortared all the time.
I mean,
they were,

330
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.660
they were feeling it.
You don't get,
not as bad,
not world war one style,

331
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.360
but you know they were getting mortared every day.

332
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.330
There was mortars hit in the buildings.
So that,

333
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:36.630
that just randomness is what makes things so difficult.

334
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.740
He,
those mortars,
when you hear that first ignition of them,

335
00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:44.770
how long does it take to,
it depends on how far away they were.
But you know,

336
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:47.990
in this it was probably like a minute,
maybe,
maybe a little less than that.

337
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.630
I'd have to sit here and think about it,
but it was like a minute,

338
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.330
maybe 30 seconds.
It might've been,
it might've been,

339
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.360
it might've been shorter than that,
but it seemed like a wall,

340
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.800
cause you're sitting there waiting for it to hit you.

341
00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.010
And that was another eye on the one that was in Baghdad.

342
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.750
I was sitting there in a Humvee and we had this,

343
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.870
we had weapons on the Humvee that could reach across the river.

344
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.620
So we are by a river and we were looking at,

345
00:24:11.621 --> 00:24:13.940
we could see some activity over across the river.

346
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:19.100
And so as we sat there are gunner,
I said,
hey,
can you see this?
And he's a guy,

347
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.100
I can,
I can kind of see it and I go,
do you have a shot?
And he goes,
no,

348
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:27.050
because we were behind a behind a bunk,
uh,
some kind of wall.
I go,

349
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:31.100
do you have a shot?
He goes,
no,
I can't.
I don't have a shot yet.
So I said,
hey,

350
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.130
pull the Humvee forward.
So I told the driver,
we pulled the Humvee for like,

351
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.500
I dunno,
30 feet,

352
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.620
maybe 35 feet and a minute later a mortar hit exactly where that only was.

353
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.090
Oh,
luckily it was only a 60 millimeter one,

354
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:49.810
which is a tiny little tiny little mortar and no one even got frack.

355
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.220
But I mean,
you know,
we were,

356
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.540
we were 30 seconds away or a minute away from just taking a mortar round right

357
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.570
in the Humvee that we were all in.
So yeah,
it's a,

358
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.620
it's
again,

359
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.890
I don't want to put anything that I experienced on any level with what these

360
00:25:10.651 --> 00:25:11.880
guys experienced.
Yeah.

361
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.380
The only reason I'm saying is to give a miniscule psychological impact that it

362
00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:21.381
has and just multiply that times a billion to get to where these guys were and,

363
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.940
and what they went through.
Yeah.

364
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.390
So going back to the book here,
after the fighting had kind of settled,

365
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.440
um,
sledge,

366
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.810
Eugene sledge comes across some dead Japanese soldiers.

367
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:44.811
So now they're kind of patrolling and there's some other veterans that were with

368
00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:50.421
them and he standing there looking at these dead Japanese bodies and a guy comes

369
00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:52.500
over and says,
sledgehammer,

370
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.660
don't stand there with your mouth open when there's all these good souvenirs

371
00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:58.380
laying around.

372
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.960
So he sees these dead Japanese and he's going to get some war booty.

373
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.310
He then removed a Nambuu pistol,

374
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.030
slip the belt off the corpse and took the leather holster.

375
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.770
He pulled off the steel helmet,

376
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.250
reached inside and took out a neatly folded Japanese flag,

377
00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:16.620
covered it with writing the veteran,

378
00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:19.530
pitched the helmet on the coral where clanked and rattled,

379
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.060
rolled the corpse over and started pawing through the combat pack.

380
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.740
The veterans buddy came up and started stripping the other Japanese corpses.

381
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.650
His take was a flag and other items.

382
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.520
He then remove the bolts from the Japanese rifles and broke the stocks against

383
00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:38.250
the coral to render them useless to infiltrators.

384
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:39.933
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

385
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.980
<v 0>I hadn't budged or said a word just stood glued to the spot,</v>

386
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.330
almost in a trance.

387
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.950
The corpses were sprawled where the veteran to drag them around to get into

388
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:51.570
their pacs and pockets.

389
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.510
Would I become this casual and Callista about enemy dead?
I wondered,

390
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.080
would the ward dehumanize me so that I too could field strip enemy dead with

391
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.970
such nonchalance?

392
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.920
The time soon came when it didn't bother me a bit.

393
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.530
I think again,
it's,
it's important to remember that this guy is a gentleman,

394
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.800
a kind soul and he knows and he's admitting that it came to a point where this,

395
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.700
this did not bother him at all.
Back to the book,

396
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.560
within a few yards of this scene,
one of our hospital corpsman worked in a small,

397
00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:37.080
shallow,
deaf,
deaf,
all defile,

398
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.960
treating marine wounded.

399
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.030
I went over and sat on the hot coral by him.

400
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.260
The corpsman was on his knees bending over to young marine who had just died.

401
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:50.094
On a stretcher.

402
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:55.530
A blood soaked battle dressing was on the side of the Marines of the dead man's

403
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:59.730
neck.
His fine,
handsome boy,
his face was Ashen.

404
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.560
What a pitiful waste.
I thought he can't be a day over 17 years old.

405
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.140
I thank God his mother couldn't see him.

406
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:12.360
The corpsman held the dead Marines Chin tenderly between the thumb and fingers

407
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:16.350
of his left hand left hand and made the sign of the cross with his right hand.

408
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.600
Tears streamed down his dusty tanned grief,

409
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:24.960
contorted face while he sobbed quietly.

410
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:43.670
Obviously again,
we have a vision in our mind of what,

411
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.500
uh,
service men is like,
what a marine is like.

412
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.240
And certainly that picture of um,

413
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.360
of a corpsman,
which is actually a navy corpsman.

414
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.160
If you don't know navy corpsman,

415
00:29:02.161 --> 00:29:06.120
work with the Marines and go into the field with marines and train as Marines.

416
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.590
But you picture this navy corpsman in

417
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.380
trying to treat this man and losing him and out there in the middle of the bad

418
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:19.890
field battlefield with tears streaming down his face.

419
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.660
That's what combat is.

420
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.940
Moving to another section where you're about to see

421
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.570
some near friendly fire.

422
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.560
Here it is just then a marine tank took to our rear,

423
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.400
sorry,
just then a marine tank to our rear.

424
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:50.590
Must Miss Mistook us for enemy troops.

425
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.920
As soon as my hand went up to drop the round down the tube,

426
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:55.570
a machine gun cut loose.

427
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.560
It sounded like one of ours and from the rear of all places.

428
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.290
As I peeked over the edge of the crater through the dust and smoke and saw a

429
00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:05.440
Sherman tank in the clearing behind us,

430
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.220
the tank fired it's 75 millimeter gun off to our right rear.

431
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.570
The shell exploded nearby around a bend in the same trail we were on.

432
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.640
I then heard the report of a Japanese field gun located there as it returned

433
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.470
fire on the tank.
Again,

434
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:23.680
I tried to fire but the machine gun opened up on us is before

435
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.780
a surge of panic rose within me.
In a brief moment,

436
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.930
our tank had reduced me to from a well trained determined assistant mortar

437
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:36.820
gunner to a quivering mass of terror.

438
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.520
It was not just that I was being fired at by a machine gun that unnerved me so

439
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:43.354
terribly,

440
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.540
but that it was one of ours to be killed by the enemy was bad enough.

441
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
That was a real possibility I prepared myself for but to be killed by mistake by

442
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:58.330
my own comrades was something I found hard to accept.

443
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.080
It was just too much and that is what we call a blue on blue when friendlies

444
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.010
shoot at friendlies and fratricide is when it's what it's called when brother

445
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:16.351
kills brother and you know this is actually the opening

446
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.570
of the book that Leif and I wrote extreme ownership.

447
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.530
The opening chapter is about this,

448
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.860
this happening and happening under my command to my guys when I'm the senior guy

449
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.990
and that's why this idea that to be killed by mistake by my own comrades was

450
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.130
something I found hard to accept.
This is the,

451
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:50.970
this is the mortal sin of combat in sometimes when I talk about my deployment to

452
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:55.990
Ramadi and what it was like for us,
I,

453
00:31:56.170 --> 00:32:01.170
I say that basically every bad thing that could happen happened,

454
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.490
and this is definitely one of them,
is,

455
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.670
is being in a situation where there was friendly fire and we were in a number of

456
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:10.630
situations like this.

457
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.190
None of them were as bad as I as the first one I talk about in the book and

458
00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:16.960
here's how these guys get it solved.

459
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.160
A volunteer crawled off to the left and soon the tank ceased firing on us.

460
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.850
We learned later that our tankers were firing on us because we had moved too far

461
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:31.780
ahead.
They thought we were enemy support for the field gun.

462
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.430
This also explained why the enemy's shelling was passing over an exploding

463
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.710
behind us.
Tragically,

464
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.740
the marine who saved us by identifying us to the tanker was shot off the tank

465
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.860
and killed by a sniper.
Definitely one of the worst things in war.

466
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:54.010
You think you have to worry about the enemy and things are so confusing and

467
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.780
there's such mayhem out there that you,

468
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.900
you have to spend at least as much time if not more deconflict thing with your

469
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:05.210
friendly troops as you do.

470
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.350
Trying to figure out where the enemy is and killed him.
It,
it's,
it's,

471
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.380
it was definitely a fast learning curve for us in Ramadi learning and

472
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:19.931
understanding and deconflict and wanting to be so absolutely certain of where

473
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:28.931
everybody was and the term we would use and is using the military as front line

474
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:33.010
trace.
Where are your guys?
Where's the most forward that they are?

475
00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:36.920
And everybody needs to know that.
In fact,

476
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.440
and this might sound crazy,
so we'd have,
you know,

477
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.700
people have in their minds of um,
of a sniper position being,
you know,

478
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.730
two or three guys hidden very tactically and clandestine mine in Ramadi.

479
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.380
Sometimes for our sniper,
Overwatch positions.
First of all,

480
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:59.150
sometimes we have 20 or 30 guys in there to secure a building so that the

481
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:02.450
snipers and the machine gunners could work.
But on top of that,

482
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.870
in order to avoid there being a blue on blue,

483
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:10.700
we had giant aircraft marking panels.

484
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.040
So fluorescent orange,

485
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.270
10 by 10 pieces of material that we would literally,

486
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.140
the guys would literally hang them over the side of the Overwatch positions to

487
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.520
say,
here we are,
everyone don't shoot us.
Oh bad guys,

488
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:29.060
you want to shoot us,
bring it and we'll kill you.
But that's,

489
00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:30.710
that's the extent that,

490
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:35.740
that we would go to to ensure that you weren't going to get shot by American

491
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:38.450
forces.
And there's,
you know,
life's got a,
uh,

492
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.790
a vignette in the book as well.
A story about that almost happening.

493
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:47.570
And I tell another one that blue on blue stuff was a nightmare.

494
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.750
It was a nightmare to deal with.
And you know,

495
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.740
one thing I will say is we had that horrible one that resulted in a,

496
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:56.930
in an Iraqi soldier killed,

497
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.990
a friendly Iraqi soldier killed very early on in our deployment.

498
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.250
But we learned so much from it that we,
we,

499
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.910
there was blue and blue's that happened after that.

500
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:09.911
But then we never had them get out of control like that first event.

501
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.440
But again,
for those people that have never been in combat before,

502
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.070
and it was weird when Lafe and I write in the book,
you know,
we got done,
I said,

503
00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:19.281
man,

504
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:23.270
we've got three stories that are based on some sort of blue on blue happening.

505
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.320
And we didn't plan it that way.
But again,
just to realize,

506
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.070
you know,
that's,
that's how much we were thinking about it,

507
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.390
that when we wrote about it,
three of the stories were uh,
just about,
hey,

508
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.590
preventing blue on blues,

509
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.270
having a blue on blue and then two of them run by preventing blue on blues.

510
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.610
And if you've never been into combat,
you would,
you wouldn't think about that.

511
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:46.380
It's so confusing.

512
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.550
It's so confusing that there were situations in Ramadi where Humvees fired on

513
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.520
other humvees.
So,

514
00:35:56.521 --> 00:36:00.060
so this is an American vehicle and it's not like the,
uh,

515
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.730
the insurgents had humvees.
I mean,

516
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.070
a Humvee is a very distinctive looking vehicle.

517
00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:09.090
And there was situations where in the confusion and the mayhem and with you
know,

518
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.920
muzzle flashes,
Humvees shot at other humvees.
That's how,

519
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.630
that's how crazy and chaotic combat can get

520
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.350
back to the book.
Moving forward,

521
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.700
and this is going to go back into the shelling and I almost wasn't going to talk

522
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:31.830
about this,
but I had to.

523
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:38.270
There was nothing subtle or intimate about the approach and explosion of an

524
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:43.140
artillery shell.
When I heard the whistle of an approaching one in the distance,

525
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.570
every muscle in my body contracted,

526
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.780
I braced myself in a puny effort to keep from being swept away.

527
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.600
I felt utterly helpless as the fiendish whistle grew louder my teeth ground

528
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:03.510
against each other.
My heart pounded,
my mouth dried,
my eyes narrowed,

529
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.530
sweat poured over me.
My breath came in short,

530
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:12.590
irregular gasps and I was afraid to swallow lest I choke.

531
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.320
I always prayed sometimes out loud under certain conditions of range and

532
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:23.430
terrain,
I could hear the shell approaching from a considerable distance,

533
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:28.490
thus prolonging the suspense into seemingly unending torture.

534
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.390
At the instant,
the voice of the shell grew the loudest.

535
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.420
It terminated in a flash and a definitely explosion similar to the crash of a

536
00:37:38.451 --> 00:37:43.380
loud clap of thunder.
The ground shook and the concussion hurt my ears.

537
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.570
Shell fragments tore through the air toward the air apart as they rushed out,

538
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.750
worrying and ripping rocks and dirt clattered onto the deck as as smoke of the

539
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.570
exploded shell dissipated.

540
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.030
And this is something I need to point out when you w w w when I,

541
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.590
when I,

542
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:09.270
before I was ever in combat and ever saw what mortars really did.

543
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.810
When you think of shrapnel,
when people think of shrapnel,
like,

544
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.310
like how big do you think of a piece of shrapnel list?
Just take a guess.

545
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.640
This big,
so echos,
action and a half,
two inches.

546
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:22.140
Hechos holding up an inch and a half,
two inches.

547
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.850
I actually thought smaller than that.
I thought,
you know what?

548
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.750
It's a little tiny thing and you know,
you gotta be scared.

549
00:38:26.751 --> 00:38:31.751
You got to watch out these little tiny things on bigger artillery shells or

550
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:34.810
mortar shells.
The F,

551
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.990
the frag that comes off of them is a half an inch thick and it can be nine

552
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.930
inches long by 12 inches long,

553
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.100
jagged shards of metal.
You know,

554
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.420
they're just evil thing.
And,
and,

555
00:38:54.421 --> 00:38:58.570
and that's why what's scary is the shrapnel.
Oh yeah.
It can,

556
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.670
it can hit you in like puncture you like a bullet,

557
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:05.350
but it can also take your leg clean off or take your arm thing off for just,

558
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:09.160
just completely,
I mean,
just kill you instantly if it hits you in the torso.

559
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.800
But it's a,
it's a Blim remover.

560
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.200
So it's much more horrifying than,
than what I ever envisioned it to be.

561
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.800
And the reason that,

562
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.620
one of the reasons this sticks in my mind so well is getting mortared.
Uh,

563
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:28.650
we were at in combat outpost Falcon in downtown Ramadi and we took some hundred

564
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:32.260
and 20 millimeter mortar shells in there.
And we,
you know,

565
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:36.550
the company commander who is a awesome,
unbelievable guy,

566
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.970
he,
he brought in a piece of frack.
And the thing was,

567
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.810
I couldn't believe it when I saw that,
I was shocked at how huge it was.

568
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.673
Do you mean a piece of,

569
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.770
and like a random piece of piece of frag that had come in off the mortar shells

570
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.710
blew off and you know,
bounce down the street,

571
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:54.070
didn't hit anybody and he picked it up and brought it in and said here's what's

572
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:57.700
flying around the air wait till or these things that they load into the,

573
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.760
to the shell or the shell shell is the show is encased in metal and that's what

574
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:07.140
the metal is for.
That when it blows up,
it just rips apart and gets people.
Yeah.

575
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.780
You when like when you see on TV about these,
I don't know,

576
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:14.920
these criminals or whatever,
they said pipe bombs.
You put that up,
nails,
nails,

577
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:19.600
screws.
Yeah.
You'd think so.
This is like that times 10.
Yeah.

578
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.750
It's big and it's freaking horrifying.
Dang.

579
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.970
That's another one.
I remember one of those same situation,

580
00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:32.971
we got hit with some mortars in Cop Falcon and Lafe and his,

581
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.360
his team were like 300 meters away on a rooftop of a building and frag landed on

582
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:45.100
them.
You know it,
it wasn't a,
it didn't have the philosophy to hurt anybody,

583
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:49.970
but it was raining down on them,
so it's probably all hot too.
Oh yeah.

584
00:40:49.971 --> 00:40:51.730
It looks horrible.

585
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.780
Back to the book to be under a barrage of prolonged shelling simply magnified

586
00:40:58.031 --> 00:41:01.810
all the terrible physical and emotional effects of one shell.

587
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.620
To me,
artillery was an invention of hell.

588
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.400
The onrushing whistle and scream of the big steel package of destruction was the

589
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:15.700
pinnacle of violent fury and the embodiment of pent up evil.

590
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:22.660
It was the essence of violence and of man's inhumanity to man.

591
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.880
I developed a passion,

592
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:30.060
a passionate hatred for shells to be killed by a bullet seemed so clear and

593
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:34.820
surgical,
but shells would not only and rip the body,

594
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.080
they tortured one's mind almost beyond the brink of sanity.

595
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:44.960
After each shell was wrung out,
after each shell,
I was rung out,

596
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.610
limp and exhausted.
During prolonged shelling,

597
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.300
I often had to restrain myself and fight back a wild,

598
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.700
inexorable urge to scream,

599
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:59.390
to sob and to cry as pell Lou dragged on.

600
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.520
I feared that if I ever lost control of myself under shell fire,

601
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.230
my mind would be shattered.

602
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.680
I hated shells as much for their damage to the mind as to the body to be under

603
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:16.931
heavy shell fire was to me by far the most terrifying combat experiences.

604
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.940
Each time it left me feeling more for Lauren and helpless,

605
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.740
more fatalistic and with less confidence that I could escape the dreadful law of

606
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:30.770
averages that reduced our numbers.

607
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.180
Fear is many faceted and has many sub subtle nuances,

608
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.430
but the terror and desperation and dirt under heavy shelling are by far the most

609
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:44.084
unbearable.

610
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.830
<v 2>And I think
again,</v>

611
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.780
the key point of that,

612
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.490
if you want to take something from that and apply it to life,

613
00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.610
because most people that are listening to this podcast won't have to endure

614
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.510
showing other than those troopers that are out there on the front lines today.

615
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.510
God bless him.
Those guys are out there.

616
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.390
They may have to deal with us and they will.

617
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.160
But for civilians,
for normal people,

618
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.350
it's the feeling of helplessness.

619
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:23.351
It's the feeling of lack of control that makes it so horrifying.

620
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.430
And so when you come up against things that you cannot control,

621
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.870
that's something to recognize that it is something that you cannot control and

622
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.820
that's what's scaring you.

623
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:40.180
That's what the fear is coming from and making it infinitely worse than

624
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:43.490
something that you can control.
Yeah.

625
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.870
You know another thing that they had to help them deal with the fear was the

626
00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:56.294
comradery

627
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.160
and he talks a little bit about this,

628
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.490
<v 0>talking about his company.
I realized that company K we'll kilo,</v>

629
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.270
I realized that company K had become my home.

630
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.440
No matter how bad a situation was in the company,

631
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.150
it was still home to me.

632
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.960
It was not just a lettered company in a number of battalion and a number of

633
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:25.010
regimen in a number of division.
It meant far more than that.

634
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.880
It was home.
It was my company.

635
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.980
I belonged in it and no else.

636
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.110
Most marines I knew felt the same about their companies and whatever battalion

637
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:41.400
regiment or Marine Division they happen to be in.
This was the result of,

638
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.600
or maybe a cause for our strong esprit de Corps.

639
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.410
The Marine Corps wisely acknowledged this unit attachment.

640
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.420
Men who recovered from wounds and return to duty nearly always came home to

641
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:58.500
their old company.
This was not misplaced sentimentality,

642
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.160
but a strong contributor to high morale.

643
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.850
A man felt that he belonged to his unit and had a niche among his buddies whom

644
00:45:08.761 --> 00:45:13.761
he knew and with whom he shared a mutual respect welded in combat.

645
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.060
This sense of family.

646
00:45:16.061 --> 00:45:21.061
It was particularly important in the infantry where survival and combat

647
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:26.610
efficiency often hinged on how well men could depend on one another,

648
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.550
a spree decor.

649
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:39.260
And now there's a section that I'm moving forward to and this section is called

650
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.350
the stench of battle.

651
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.180
The Sun board down on us like a giant heat lamp.

652
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.330
Occasional rains fell on the hawk.

653
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:54.960
Coral merely evaporated like steam off hot pavement.

654
00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:00.660
The air hung heavy and muggy.
Everywhere we went on the ridges,

655
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.800
the hot humid air wheat with the stench of death,

656
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.010
a strong wind was no relief.

657
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.700
It simply brought the horde odor from an adjacent area.

658
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.860
Japanese corpses lay where they fell among the rocks and on the slopes.

659
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:18.450
It was impossible to cover them.

660
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.050
Usually there was no soil that could be spaded over them.

661
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.750
Just the hard jagged coil coral,

662
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.920
the enemy dead simply rotted where they had fallen.

663
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.510
They lay all over the place and grotesque positions with puffy faces and

664
00:46:33.511 --> 00:46:35.760
grinning buck tooth expressions.

665
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.590
It was difficult to convey to anyone who is not experienced it.

666
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:45.890
The gas leak horror of having your sense of smell saturated constantly with the

667
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:50.460
putrid odor of rotting human flesh day after day,

668
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.050
night after night.

669
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:57.490
<v 0>This was something that men have an infantry battalion got a horrifying dose of</v>

671
00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:02.710
during the long protracted battle such as Pella Pellalou in the tropics.

672
00:47:02.711 --> 00:47:07.711
The dead became bloated and gave off a terrific stench within a few hours after

673
00:47:08.081 --> 00:47:12.210
death.
Whenever possible.

674
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:17.220
We remember we removed marine dead to the rear of the company's position there.

675
00:47:17.221 --> 00:47:21.300
They were usually laid on stretchers and covered with ponchos which stretched

676
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:23.340
over the head of the corpse down to the ankles.

677
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.230
I rarely saw dead marine left on covered with his face exposed to the sun,

678
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:33.370
rain and flies.
Somehow it seemed in decent not to cover our dead.

679
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.300
Often though the dead might lie on the stretchers for some time and decompose

680
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:41.200
badly before the breeze.

681
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.820
Busy grave registration crews could take them for burial in the division

682
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:47.680
cemetery near the airfield

683
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:55.330
added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides was the repulsive odor of

684
00:47:55.611 --> 00:48:00.110
human excrement everywhere.
It was all but impossible to practice.

685
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:04.730
Simple elemental field sanitation on most areas of Palu because of the rocky

686
00:48:04.731 --> 00:48:06.900
surface field.

687
00:48:06.901 --> 00:48:10.610
Sanitation during maneuvers and combat was the responsibility of each man.

688
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.100
In short,
under normal conditions,

689
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.270
he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil at night.

690
00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.640
When he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole,

691
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.110
he simply used to empty grenade canister or ration cans and threw it out of his

692
00:48:24.111 --> 00:48:27.890
hole and scooped out dirt over it the next day.
If he wasn't under enemy fire,

693
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.250
that was not possible.
On Pellalou.

694
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.580
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

695
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.580
<v 0>added to this was the older of thousands of rotting discarded Japanese and</v>

696
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:42.620
American rations at every breath.

697
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:47.621
One inhaled humid air heavy with countless repulsive odors.

698
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.700
I felt as though my lungs would never be cleansed of these foul vapors.

699
00:48:55.670 --> 00:49:00.080
As I looked on at the stains on the coral,

700
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:05.770
I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how

701
00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:11.801
gallant it was for a man to shed his blood for his country and to give life's

702
00:49:12.831 --> 00:49:15.680
blood for sacrifice and so on.

703
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:19.670
The word seemed so ridiculous.

704
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.460
Only the flies benefited.

705
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.220
So as patriotic
and brave

706
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.970
as Eugene sludge was

707
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.120
the madness,

708
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.540
the madness even made him begin to question what this was all about and think

709
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:47.880
about what these politicians would say

710
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.040
and say that only the flies benefited.

711
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:55.103
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

712
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.510
<v 3>It's crazy how he went so detailed in the,
in the smells,</v>

713
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.930
because you know,
when you watch movies and that's a part that you don't,

714
00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:09.940
don't catch on it every once in a while or the,
you know,

715
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:13.510
the guy he's covering his nose or something like that to indicate this smells

716
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.690
bad,
but that doesn't stick in your mind the whole time.

717
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.940
Maybe if they add like flies or something.
I Dunno.
Um,

718
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.180
but how he,

719
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.710
how he illustrated how this was going on to the point where I had never even

720
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:27.960
thought I'd ever catch

721
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.640
<v 0>a fresh breath.
You know,
basically this is going to stay.</v>

722
00:50:30.641 --> 00:50:35.030
And it really adds that element of,

723
00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.260
of hell,
you know,

724
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:39.950
and they say that smell is one of the most like impactful senses.

725
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.460
You have beckon,
beckon,
like spark memories the strongest,
you know,

726
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.910
no doubt about it.
And there's,
there is a smell.
There was a smell in Iraq.

727
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:51.620
Obviously it wasn't as bad as this,
but it was,
it's,
it's a,
it's a bad smell.

728
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.540
Yeah.
And for sure when something hits me,
if you're an a,

729
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.600
you know,
a strange place or a place where there's that,

730
00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:02.030
where it's not sanitary,

731
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.830
you can get that momentary remembrance of that smell.

732
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.730
And this section called the stench of combat is beyond just the smell,

733
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.860
which we'll get into now.

734
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.200
The grinding stress of prolonged heavy combat,

735
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.070
the loss of sleep because of night,
nightly infiltration rates.

736
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:33.720
The vigorous physical demands forced on us by the rugged terrain and the

737
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:39.540
unrelenting suffocating heat were enough to make us drop in our tracks.

738
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.900
How we kept going and continue fighting.
I'll never know.

739
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:50.250
I was so indescribably weary physically and emotionally that I became fatalistic

740
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:55.240
praying only for my fate to be painless,

741
00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:01.490
thinking he's going to die and his only prayer is that it's painless that's

742
00:52:01.491 --> 00:52:04.130
straight up,
believed in it like you know you're going to die.

743
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.820
In addition to the terror and hardships of combat each day brought some new

744
00:52:10.821 --> 00:52:13.100
dimension of dread for me.

745
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.760
I witnessed some new ghastly McRob facet in the kaleidoscope of the unreal as

746
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:25.460
though designed by some fiendish ghoul to cause even the most hardened and

747
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:30.461
callused observer among us to recoil in horror and disbelief.

748
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.840
Late one afternoon,

749
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.430
a buddy and I returned from the gun pit in the fading light,

750
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:46.570
we passed a shallow deaf laid we hadn't noticed previously in it were three

751
00:52:46.911 --> 00:52:47.744
marine dead.

752
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.900
They were lying on stretchers where they had died before their comrades had been

753
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:55.730
forced to withdraw.
Sometime earlier.
As we move past,

754
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.980
my buddy groaned Jesus.

755
00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:03.830
I took a quick glance into the depression and recoiled and revulsion and pity at

756
00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:04.664
what I saw.

757
00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:11.280
The bodies were so badly decomposed and nearly blackened by exposure.

758
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:15.000
This was to be expected of the dead in the tropics,

759
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:19.290
but these marines had been mutilated hideously by the enemy.

760
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.690
One man had been decapitated his head,
lay on his chest,

761
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.300
his had been severed from his wrists,

762
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:32.220
and also lay on his chest near his chin in disbelief.

763
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:37.500
I stared at the face as I realized that the Japanese had cut off the dead

764
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.440
marines penis and stuffed it into his mouth.

765
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.890
The corpse next to him had been treated similarly.

766
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.250
The third had been butchered,

767
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.600
chopped up like a carcass torn apart by some predatory animal.

768
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:58.150
My emotions solidified into rage and a hatred for the Japanese beyond anything

769
00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:02.180
I'd ever experienced.
From that moment on,

770
00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:06.620
I never felt the least pity or compassion for them.

771
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.290
No matter what the circumstances.

772
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.420
My comrades would field strip their packs and pockets for souvenirs and take

773
00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:15.320
gold teeth,

774
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:20.510
but I never saw a marine commit that kind of barbaric mutilation that the

775
00:54:20.511 --> 00:54:23.870
Japanese committed if they had access to are dead.

776
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.060
Like I said,
it's a glimpse into

777
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:35.370
the darkest
part of humanity.

778
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:39.903
<v 1>And</v>

779
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:45.820
<v 0>I want people to think about that and remember that it's real.</v>

780
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.640
It's real,
that dark part of humanity that

781
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.420
we don't want to exist.

782
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.410
It exists.
Evil exists.

783
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.740
And this is coming from a guy,

784
00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.880
you know when he says that he never had any pity

785
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.130
after this again,
and you,

786
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:20.000
if you go and watch the Pacific and you watch interviews with this guy,

787
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:25.260
you can absolutely feel like I said,
the,

788
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.710
the kindness oozes out of him.

789
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.780
But even he,

790
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.400
when confronting the darkness,

791
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.670
had to

792
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.410
explore his own darkness.

793
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.990
And I'm jumping now

794
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:50.103
<v 1>to the end.</v>

795
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:59.060
<v 0>On August 8th we heard that the first atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan,</v>

796
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.970
reports a bound for a week about a possible surrender.

797
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.830
Then on 15 August,

798
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.480
1945 the war ended.

799
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:18.740
We received news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of

800
00:56:19.831 --> 00:56:24.040
relief.
We thought the Japanese would surrender.

801
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.600
<v 2>Many refuse to believe it.</v>

802
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.700
Sitting in stunned silence we remembered are dead.

803
00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.110
So many dead.
So many maimed,

804
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.720
so many bright futures consigned to the ashes of the past.

805
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.720
So many dreams lost in the madness that had engulfed us.

806
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:50.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

807
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.770
<v 2>Except for a few widely scattered shouts of joy.</v>

808
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:59.110
The survivors of the abyss sat hollow,
wide and silent,

809
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.550
trying to comprehend a world without war.

810
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.670
War is brutish in glorious and a terrible waste.

811
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.710
Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it.

812
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:24.210
The only redeeming factors where my comrades incredible bravery and their

813
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:26.920
devotion to each other.

814
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:28.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

815
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:32.540
<v 2>Marine Corps Training Thomas to kill efficiently and to try to survive,</v>

816
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:38.830
but it also taught us loyalty to each other and love that a spree decor

817
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.500
sustained us

818
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:50.030
until the millennium arrives and country sees trying to enslave others.

819
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:55.290
It will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make

820
00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:59.100
sacrifices for one's countries.
As my comrades did,

821
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:04.380
as the troops used to say,
if the country is good enough to live in,

822
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.360
it's good enough to fight for

823
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.850
with privilege goes responsibility

824
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.820
and that
is another look

825
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:23.220
at war
and

826
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:28.170
it's something that we can't ever forget.

827
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:35.810
That war is awful in that war is the darkness that I talk about.

828
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.330
And
as Eugene Sledge says,

829
00:58:42.331 --> 00:58:44.820
the only redeeming factor

830
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.930
is the incredible bravery and devotion to each other.

831
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:55.100
And I've talked about that before.
What made

832
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:58.670
war to me

833
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:04.430
an incredibly life altering experience.

834
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:07.700
It wasn't the darkness that I saw,

835
00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.390
but the light of the bravery

836
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.640
of those on the battlefield.

837
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:20.920
And I will add another redeeming quality to war.
And it's a,

838
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.530
and that is what is the alternative.

839
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:31.240
So what if we had not stopped the brutal imperial Japanese empire?

840
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.740
What if we had not stopped the Nazis?

841
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:43.610
What if we had not fought a war against ourselves to end slavery?

842
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.320
And today
they're still evil in the world.

843
00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:52.770
They're still darkness.
Isis,

844
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.800
the cult of child rapists and see this and torturers and murderers.

845
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.670
And if we don't confront that evil

846
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.110
and that evil goes unchecked,

847
01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.930
then darkness prevails.

848
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.350
So we have to be a force of light against the darkness.

849
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:20.543
And

850
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:26.870
as Eugene Sledge transformed partially in his brain,

851
01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.820
we have to use the darkness and the evil ourselves to prevail.

852
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:35.190
That's the paradox.

853
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:41.520
And we have to remember that when men get so close to evil,

854
01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.730
it leaves a mark and it leaves a scar

855
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:55.090
and we must forgive them their trespasses and help them to heal if they need it.

856
01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.960
So to the men and women who are fighting or who have fought against forces of

857
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.260
evil in the world.
Thank you.

858
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:10.430
If we were going to

859
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:17.100
dive into that to apply or think about that in context of

860
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:24.640
<v 1>normal people,</v>

861
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.710
<v 2>I would say just remember how horrible things can be</v>

862
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:39.170
and and enjoy that sunrise in the morning.

863
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.353
Again,

864
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600
that book is called with the old breed by Eugene sledge and I hit some

865
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:54.150
highlights but the entire book is incredible.

866
01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.310
The Hbo Mini Series is called the Pacific.
Watch it.

867
01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.720
<v 1>It's incredible</v>

868
01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.250
and remember,
remember,

869
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.140
remember.
All

870
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.160
right,
let's get to

871
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.430
<v 2>some questions,
some questions from the interwebs.
Yes,
Internet questions.
Okay.</v>

872
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.043
And by the way,

873
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:32.610
is a bit late in the game but good evening Echo Charles.

874
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.320
Good evening and thanks for joining.

875
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:37.420
<v 3>Thank a lot of start chiming in.</v>

876
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:42.790
<v 2>Get
with with a book like this.</v>

877
01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.380
I mean,
I'm coming over here to the studio and it is in my mind.
I am,

878
01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.210
I'm fired up and,

879
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.240
and I picture when I want to listen to a podcast,

880
01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.130
I want to sit down,
I want to pray,
I'm going to put the headphones on,

881
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:04.330
I want to press play and I want to get it.

882
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.530
I want to get after it.

883
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.540
I want something to get in my brain and start to make me think.
And uh,

884
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.670
that's where I was tonight.
When I got on on track,
I said,
I said,
hey,
this is the,

885
01:03:15.671 --> 01:03:19.510
this is the podcast and here we go.
And I just went into it.

886
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:24.470
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
it was,
there was no echo Charles in my brain at that note.
No offense.</v>

887
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.530
No,
no,
no,
no.
I don't want to be in your brain bread.

888
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.950
Do you think I like to listen anyway?
I just don't know when the timing,
in fact,

889
01:03:30.951 --> 01:03:35.060
I do know when to chime in when I have a question.
That's it.
That's true.

890
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.860
There's no reason.
So no one wants to hear you say,
hey,
Eco,
hello,

891
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.300
how's it going?
Or nothing like that.
It cut out

892
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:46.200
<v 2>the small talk and let's get down to business.
We can small talk now.</v>

893
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.350
Now that I've released the,

894
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:54.710
the passion that I had and I was at brewing up in my brain can remember I'm

895
01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:58.200
prepping these things.

896
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:03.260
So I'm going through this book for for a week or two and I'm delving into it and

897
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:07.950
I'm doing other,
I'm watching youtube videos of the Pella Lou battle.

898
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.670
It's in my brain and it's wanting to get,
it's wanting to come out.

899
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:17.580
So you just get trumped by that.
No offense,

900
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.880
nope,
none taken.
All right.

901
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.220
Questions Jocko.

902
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.930
<v 3>How do you balance extreme ownership with holding others accountable for their</v>

903
01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:32.180
actions and avoiding them using you?

904
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:39.360
<v 2>So this is actually a question that I ended up responding to on a fairly regular</v>

905
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:44.361
basis and it's really a couple of different angles here that are going on.

906
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:47.040
The one of the,

907
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:52.550
the points here is the balance of extreme ownership versus holding others

908
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:58.020
accountable and what that really means or what another way of looking at that as

909
01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.080
it's really extreme ownership versus decentralized command.

910
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:06.090
So decentralized command is,

911
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:11.870
it's one of the laws of combat that wave and I write about in the book

912
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.990
decentralized command.
And what that means is everybody leads.

913
01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:19.900
That means everybody's a leader and that's what you want.
And that is uh,

914
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.270
that is a,
the complete opposite of extreme ownership.

915
01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:29.320
So if extreme ownership,
I'm going to own everything.
Decentralized Command is,

916
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.920
I'm going to let everyone else lead.
So there's a real,

917
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:36.340
a real contradiction,
a real dichotomy there.

918
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:41.260
So what you have to do is balance it.
You have to balance.

919
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.300
And it's the only way to,

920
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:50.070
to sort of rectify or re or reconcile those two opposing forces.

921
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:55.450
Because you do,
you do have to have extreme ownership of everything that is true.

922
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.800
And at the same time,
you have to have decentralized command to,

923
01:05:57.801 --> 01:06:00.570
because you can't be everywhere at once and you have to let your frontline

924
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:04.450
leaders lead.
So you have to balance them.

925
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.520
So that's one part of it is that you should,

926
01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.980
if you feel yourself,
for instance,

927
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:15.700
if you feel like you can't get everything done and you're,

928
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:17.980
you're losing control or your,

929
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:22.510
you're not able to execute everything cause there's too much on your plate,

930
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.990
it means that you're not delegating enough.
It means that you're not,

931
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:29.380
your frontline troopers aren't stepping up and leading now.

932
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.180
So you've gone too far in one direction.
Now if your leaders,

933
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.260
or if all of a sudden you're having to tell your leaders like,
hey,

934
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.300
you need to get this done.
Hey,
what are you doing?

935
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:41.350
Why aren't you taking initiative?

936
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.750
Then that means you've gone too far in the other direction.

937
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:48.640
So you have to find the good balance.
And that's the,
that's the goal.
And again,

938
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:49.660
and I'll say it over and over again,

939
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.210
that's what makes leadership hard leadership.

940
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:55.510
The hardest thing about leadership is that there's opposing forces that you have

941
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.780
to balance.
And if you could just pick the extreme and go with it,

942
01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:01.150
and that made you a good leader,
anyone could do it.
But it's not.

943
01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:04.990
It's it's the balance that makes you a good leader.

944
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:10.030
It's the balance that's challenging.
So now the other word,

945
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.400
so that's part of the question.
The other word

946
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.960
is accountability and holding people accountable for their actions.

947
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:25.950
Now this is where I'm going to throw something out that people are not going to

948
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:31.321
expect me to say because people always talk about accountability and I hear that

949
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:37.240
all the time in businesses and they say,
yeah,
we really need accountability,

950
01:07:37.241 --> 01:07:40.660
accountability,
accountability and years.

951
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.630
The issue I have with that,

952
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:49.650
you don't want to have to rely on accountability.

953
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:53.950
Accountability is actually a crutch.

954
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:55.030
It's a tool,

955
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:58.810
and I'm not saying you never use it because sometimes you do have to use it.

956
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:01.180
You have to implement it.
If people aren't doing what they're supposed to do,

957
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:06.130
you have to hold them accountable,
but I will tell you this,
what you,

958
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:11.520
what you don't want is people that are doing their job only because you're

959
01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:16.010
holding them accountable.
That's not what you want.

960
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.220
You want people that take initiative and ownership of their job and they do it

961
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.790
not because you want them to or because you're going to inspect them.

962
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.180
They do it because they own it.

963
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:33.440
They take extreme ownership of it.
That's what you want.

964
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.510
So if you were to ask people that work for me,

965
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.880
if I held them accountable and they would be like,
mm,
not really.
I mean,

966
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.290
for instance,
weapons inspections.
So you know,

967
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:53.500
I'm in charge of a platoon or I'm in charge of a task unit and there's a couple

968
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:56.690
of hundred weapons or whatever,
a bunch of weapons.

969
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:01.580
And if you don't take care of those weapons and people don't maintain them and

970
01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:05.450
clean them and
lubricate them properly,

971
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.740
they can rust very easily.

972
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.450
And so we know one of the things that you may have to do is do weapons

973
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:16.451
inspections to make sure that my guys are cleaning their weapons.

974
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:18.650
And I can tell you,

975
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:24.670
I rarely if ever conducted actual weapons inspections.

976
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:31.190
The reason my guys,
my guys did it,

977
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.210
my guys owned it.
My guys wanted to be the best.

978
01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:40.211
They wanted to always have the best possible reputation.

979
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.760
And so I didn't have to go around inspecting their weapons because I knew that

980
01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:50.600
they were going to do it.
I knew that that my guys who were on board,

981
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:54.140
who understood why we were doing what we were doing,

982
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.450
who understood that we wanted to be the best and who were on board with trying

983
01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:03.770
to be the best said,
you know what you,
you know,

984
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.530
we are going to make sure these weapons are the best possible.

985
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.190
And I learned this when I was in my second platoon.

986
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.010
My boss was an awesome guy and this is a guy that I've talked about before.

987
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.230
He was a huge influence on me.
He was a,

988
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.130
a prior enlisted seal who became an officer.

989
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.460
He was a combat veteran from the Warner Granada and he was a very humble guy and

990
01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.600
he's actually the guy that inspired me to become an officer because I said to

991
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:36.470
myself,
wow,
this guy is,
this guy made our lives so good.

992
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:39.890
Maybe I could do that for 16 guys in a platoon someday.

993
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.760
But what I realize about him is he never held us accountable for anything.

994
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:51.550
But at the same time he infused accountability on us because what we wanted more

995
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:58.430
than anything else was to do a good job for him and for the platoon.

996
01:10:59.000 --> 01:10:59.900
That's,

997
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.790
that's how you get troops and teams are aligned,

998
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:09.710
not by holding them accountable with imposed accountability,

999
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.160
but where they are inspired themselves to hold themselves accountable.

1000
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:20.790
I knew I had a coaching call with a team the other day that was,

1001
01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.660
they were saying,
hey,
you know,
we really,
we really,
we would like to have you,

1002
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.020
you know,
coach us because we're,

1003
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:31.470
we're lacking in these areas and we really need,
we know what to do,

1004
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:34.020
but we really need someone to hold us accountable to do it.

1005
01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.380
And I was like,
listen,
I,

1006
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:44.420
I charge a lot of money and you guys would be stupid to give it to me.

1007
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.480
You guys just simply lack the discipline to work for the team and make it

1008
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:53.880
happen.
I,
and I threw this example.
I said,
you know,

1009
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:55.500
if you are competing against another team,

1010
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.570
and what I did was I moved into your house and I woke you up in the morning and

1011
01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:03.150
I held you accountable for what you're supposed to do and I made you do it.

1012
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:08.430
So we put the ultimate and accountability on top of them.
I said,

1013
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:09.630
who would do better?

1014
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.900
You guys with me waking you up in the morning and beating you until you

1015
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.410
accomplish what you were supposed to do.

1016
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:21.411
I'd held you to the up the highest standard of accountability or a team that was

1017
01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:28.161
hungry themselves that was going to go the extra mile that was going to do more

1018
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.900
work.
It was going to stay up later.
That was going to get up earlier.

1019
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.680
Not because somebody was holding them accountable,

1020
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:38.010
but because they had the desire for victory.

1021
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:43.140
Who's going to win that contest?
And the answer is very simple.

1022
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:47.970
Those with the innate and intrinsic desire to win,

1023
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:53.510
we'll win over those that have imposed discipline and accountability put on top

1024
01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:58.230
of them now because there's a dichotomy to everything.

1025
01:12:58.231 --> 01:12:59.580
And because there's a balanced everything,

1026
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.640
there are times where in a leadership position you do need to inspect and make

1027
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:10.110
sure that you hold people accountable.
And an example I have of that is we had,

1028
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.340
when we got to Ramadi,

1029
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:16.341
we had our radios and generally the radio men knew how to program the radios

1030
01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:19.890
and,
and get them sinked up so they could talk to other radios and all that.

1031
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.870
And I told the guys,
I'm like,
listen,

1032
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.880
everybody in the troop needs to know how to program your radio yourself.

1033
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.750
And everyone says,
oh,
okay.
And

1034
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.880
it was so critical that they know how to program these radios.

1035
01:13:35.881 --> 01:13:38.460
Because if you're out in the field and you get separated from your unit and all

1036
01:13:38.461 --> 01:13:41.910
of a sudden your radio gets zero wised or it has a problem and you don't know

1037
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:43.440
how to fix it yourself,
what are you going to do?

1038
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.320
You can't talk to anybody and you're doomed,
you're gonna die.

1039
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:51.390
So because it was that critical.
I actually,
after the first briefing,

1040
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.550
I called a couple of guys up and I said,

1041
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:58.170
give me a radio and I zero wise their radios.
And I said,
okay,
reprogram it now.

1042
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:03.360
And a couple of them didn't know how to do it and I said,
okay,
listen up guys.

1043
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.930
No one is going on operation if you can't reprogram your radio.

1044
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.290
And so the guys had to sit down and go and figure out how to do it.

1045
01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.750
So there's times where you,
you do have to hold people accountable.

1046
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:17.710
And in that situation I knew that even though I was saying,
hey,
it's important,

1047
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.020
they didn't realize how important it was because you know,
it was all,

1048
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:23.200
you got gotta know how to work your gear.
They kind of took it like that.

1049
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:27.160
I knew that guys didn't really understand the nature of how important it was to

1050
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:31.870
be able to operate and reprogram your entire radio and sync it with the army

1051
01:14:31.871 --> 01:14:33.160
radios and all that.

1052
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.480
I knew that they didn't quite understand how important it was and so I had to,

1053
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.100
I had to hold them accountable.

1054
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.480
But generally 98% of the stuff,

1055
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:47.410
I didn't have to hold people accountable.
I didn't inspect things.

1056
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.520
I expected things and they delivered

1057
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:55.030
and,
and that's,
that's,

1058
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.350
people will follow your lead if you take ownership.

1059
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.290
That's how my guys have always been.

1060
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.480
They've always

1061
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:11.200
the scene that Anne and known what the expectations were.
And finally,

1062
01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:15.010
if,
if you're sitting there and you keep saying to yourself,

1063
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.350
I got to hold people accountable,
I got to hold people accountable.

1064
01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:22.330
Most likely you don't need to hold them accountable.

1065
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.740
You need to lead them.

1066
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.390
You need to make them understand why they're doing what they're doing,

1067
01:15:30.391 --> 01:15:35.310
why it's important,
how it impacts the strategic mission,
how it impacts the team,

1068
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.450
how it impacts them.
That's leadership,

1069
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.390
not accountability.
It's leadership.

1070
01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.720
Accountability is just a tool and it is a,
uh,
a,

1071
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.900
it's a crude tool compared to real leadership.

1072
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:53.760
So use it if you have to,

1073
01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:58.920
but try and use leadership instead.

1074
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:07.180
<v 3>Next question.
Jocko.</v>

1075
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.780
I'm entering the police academy in a few short weeks,

1076
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.360
then I'll be a police officer after six months.

1077
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:17.320
I have no military background and have very little experience with true

1078
01:16:17.321 --> 01:16:19.420
confrontation.
And violence.

1079
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.190
What are the best ways a police officer can condition themselves to violence and

1080
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:28.030
confrontation?
I currently train Jujitsu,
but I'm not.
I am,

1081
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.050
but I am curious what else I can do to keep myself and others safe from

1082
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.060
unpredictable violence.

1083
01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:38.170
This is not a self defense question or either mental conditioning question.

1084
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.200
<v 2>Very cool question.
Uh,</v>

1085
01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:47.330
appreciate that question because this individual recognizes that there's a

1086
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:53.800
little bit more to it than just the physical self defense then that's the mental

1087
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.250
and he's 100% right.
So here's some things that you can do

1088
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.740
when you get the opportunity.

1089
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.510
You got to get some realistic training going.

1090
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.100
And I've talked about it a little bit on with a kind

1091
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.470
<v 0>of realistic training that we did in the seal teams.</v>

1092
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.760
There's things that up the intensity greatly simunition or uh,

1093
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.230
like a paint ball scenario.
Another good thing is getting,
uh,

1094
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.810
you know,
really heavy sparring equipment on.
So face gear,

1095
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.480
you know,
and really go to town.

1096
01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:34.710
We are trying to attack someone and take them down and do it,

1097
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:37.970
you know,
three on one,
four on one.
Got To be careful not to get hurt.

1098
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:42.410
You don't want to go that extreme.
But if someone puts on head gear,
you know,

1099
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:44.480
with a face mask and the whole nine yards,

1100
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:50.090
shin guards in padded outfit on and people can attack them and you have to react

1101
01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:56.210
to it.
The other good thing to do is do it in a situation where you know,

1102
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.220
you don't let the guy know what's going to happen.

1103
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.650
You know he's gotta keep his eyes closed until you say go.

1104
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:01.461
When he opens his eyes,

1105
01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:03.410
there's someone there with a knife right in front of a fake knife,

1106
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:06.830
right in front of him is going to stab him and he's got to draw his weapon and

1107
01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:08.780
shoot or defend himself somehow.

1108
01:18:08.781 --> 01:18:12.890
So you want to hit him with these unexpected drills,
with your weapons,

1109
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:16.100
without your weapons shooting and moving.
So those are,

1110
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.060
those are the kinds of things.

1111
01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:20.270
As soon as you get the opportunity to do it and it's even good.
I mean,

1112
01:18:20.271 --> 01:18:23.300
if you've been in a,
in a,
in a,

1113
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.080
you know,
shooting drill with like a barricaded shooter,
which is,
you know,

1114
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:32.510
you put a shooter at the end of a hallway and he's hidden,

1115
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:35.600
but he's shooting at you with paint ball and you get,

1116
01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:39.350
you can get the intensity up very high.
It's getting shot with paint ball hurts.

1117
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.410
And if you're getting nailed and you got to do something and people are like,

1118
01:18:42.411 --> 01:18:44.390
hey,
you gotta make a call,
go do something.
You've got to make it happen.

1119
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.260
How are you gonna stop this guy?

1120
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.320
You can get your intensity up and you can get used to that.

1121
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:53.321
You can inoculate yourself somewhat to that stress and learn to detach yourself

1122
01:18:54.681 --> 01:18:59.030
from it and not let it affect you and not let it grind on you.

1123
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:04.280
So that's the realistic training.
And,
and honestly,
I,

1124
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.760
when I watch some of the police videos of the bad shootings,

1125
01:19:10.941 --> 01:19:15.941
now we know police officers throughout the country every day are under a burden

1126
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.160
of hostility and they do an outstanding job over and over again making great

1127
01:19:26.031 --> 01:19:29.230
arrests and helping people and saving people that are suicidal,

1128
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:31.700
incredible amount of things,
right?
Of course,

1129
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:34.610
no one releases those videos and they don't go viral.

1130
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.360
The videos that go viral and the videos that people watch are the good ones,

1131
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.590
the bad ones,
the bad ones.

1132
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:48.130
And I hope that the police departments across America are doing something to

1133
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:56.141
inoculate their troopers from the stress cause that when I watched these videos,

1134
01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:00.610
that is what I see happening.
The,

1135
01:20:00.611 --> 01:20:03.260
the stress level and the,

1136
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:07.950
the inexperience of the situation.

1137
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.820
And there's one video that I watched which is awful,

1138
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:17.220
and the guy gets a call,
uh,
you see as you see his,

1139
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.010
the first thing you see it,
the whole thing is a body camera.

1140
01:20:20.011 --> 01:20:23.010
And forgive me if someone pulls this video up and I'm not a hundred percent

1141
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:25.020
accurate,
but he gets a call.

1142
01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:29.340
It's at a seven 11 guy with a gun guy pulls a new seven 11 the cop pulls into

1143
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:31.470
the seven 11 as he's getting,

1144
01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:35.430
he gets out of his car and he sees a guy kind of walk in one direction out of

1145
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:39.180
the seven 11 and turn and walk in another direction.
Guys got a Hoodie on.

1146
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:43.830
He's walking away so the cop gets out.
He's yelling at him,
Hey,
stop,
stop,
stop.

1147
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:47.540
That guy doesn't stop.
Finally he's,

1148
01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:49.980
he's now approaching him and he's standing in the open,

1149
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:53.160
and this is something that I see in a lot of these videos.
These cops,

1150
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:55.980
they stand in the open when,

1151
01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:00.030
if you imagine that the other guy has a gun to,
why would you stand in the open,

1152
01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:04.590
take cover,
you take cover.
That's the first thing you do.

1153
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:08.520
If you're,
even if you're trying to stop somebody or trying to yell at someone,

1154
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.680
you take cover.
So if they turn around and to have a gun,

1155
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:14.910
you only have a small portion of your body exposed and you don't get scared

1156
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:19.830
because you're hanging out in the open.
So,
so anyways,
this guy is approaching,

1157
01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:22.440
he's standing out in the open,
he's yelling at the guy.

1158
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.280
Finally the guy turns around and when the guy turns around,

1159
01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:29.430
he reaches in his jacket and boom,
the cop shoots him,

1160
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.500
the guy falls down,
he kind of rolls into a curb,

1161
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.460
the cop comes over.
As soon as the cop comes over,

1162
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:40.950
you very quickly realize what's going on.

1163
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.750
And that is that the guy had headphones on underneath his hoodie and he couldn't

1164
01:21:45.751 --> 01:21:49.410
hear the copy yelling at them.
And then as the cop searches him,

1165
01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:53.970
he pulls out of his pocket,
his iPhone.
And so he was just listening to music,

1166
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.500
reached in his pocket to uh,
turn it off,
turn it off,
and he got shot.

1167
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.530
Horrible situation.
So how do you inoculate yourself to that?

1168
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:07.920
You've got to put yourself into training situations where you do have the

1169
01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:09.060
instinct to take cover,

1170
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:11.430
where you do have the instinct to see what people's hands are.

1171
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:15.900
We do have the instinct to realize that you put yourself in a better situation

1172
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.750
where if the guy does pull out a gun,

1173
01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:23.751
you have time to react to it and you can react to it from a safer distance,

1174
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.653
you know,
as a,

1175
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:29.910
so there's a lot of things I would love to start to,

1176
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:32.370
and I don't know how,
you know,
I don't know how I'm,

1177
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.990
I don't know how to go about this,

1178
01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:39.060
but I would love to start working with police departments in some manner to get

1179
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:42.210
some training set up.
Like the training we had in the seal teams,

1180
01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:46.200
which was the training that I sit up in the seal teams was psychotic.

1181
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:51.330
How stressful we would make it so that these guys were overwhelmed.

1182
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:54.870
They were as explosions,
machine,
gun,
fire,
paint balls,
hitting them,
um,
uh,

1183
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.410
smoke everywhere,
screaming,
civilians,

1184
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.550
screaming wounded,
uh,
actors.

1185
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:06.020
We'd hire actors that were amputees and they have spurting all the

1186
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:10.420
<v 2>places.
It was incredibly realistic.
And that way when guys got into combat,</v>

1187
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.670
like one of the first time I ever got shot on it,
I was like,
okay,

1188
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.940
here's what's going on.
So I hope at some point I can,

1189
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.310
I can help the military with that.

1190
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:21.520
Now in addition to that,

1191
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:26.230
as you're trying to knock yourself your to this violence and get used to this,

1192
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:28.390
watch those youtube videos,

1193
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:33.750
watch those youtube videos of street fights of stupid encounters with,

1194
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:39.820
with bars,
with drunk people and bouncers with uh,

1195
01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.850
the shoot or don't shoot scenarios with cops,

1196
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.290
military situations where they have helmet cams on and you can see things

1197
01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:47.621
happening.

1198
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:50.170
And what you want to do is you want to watch those videos and you want to pay

1199
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:52.000
attention to the people,

1200
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:56.680
to the humans and watch the reactions and watch their movements and watch their

1201
01:23:56.681 --> 01:24:01.681
body language and watch their expressions on their faces and see and judge and

1202
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:06.070
predict and go to another video and hit pause and say,

1203
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:08.800
this is what I see right here.
This is what I think is about to happen.

1204
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:14.160
And educate yourself on human nature because human nature is what you're going

1205
01:24:15.481 --> 01:24:18.670
to be dealing with.
And violence is a part of human nature.

1206
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:22.060
And sometimes things go violent and sometimes they don't.

1207
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:27.100
So how do you predict that?
And if you're unsure,
which you will be,

1208
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:32.290
how do you protect yourself first and give yourself the maximum amount of time

1209
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.650
to make a judgment call so you don't have to rush

1210
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:43.480
on top of that.
It's awesome that you're doing Jujitsu,

1211
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.590
do boxing,
do Moitai do wrestling.

1212
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.420
So you get used to getting hit.

1213
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:53.170
So you start to see what a person's face looks like when they're about to hit

1214
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:58.170
you.
So you start to see what changes in their,
their,

1215
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:01.480
their,
their posture makes when they're about to throw a punch.

1216
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.910
Those are all things that will help.
Few.

1217
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.420
Jujitsu is obviously great for the grinding,

1218
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:12.190
physical grappling situation,
but a lot of times,
hopefully as a cop,

1219
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.050
most of the time you're not in that situation.

1220
01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:18.940
You're standing at a little bit of a distance and,
or you're,
you know,

1221
01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.730
you,
you've got a little bit more time to judge.

1222
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.030
So fight as much as you can.

1223
01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:29.230
Watch those law enforcement and military videos again,

1224
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:33.430
see the reactions,
see the noise,
see the fear,
see the panic,

1225
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:38.050
look at people's eyes,
judged them,
predict what they're gonna do.

1226
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:40.390
Press pause and figure out if you will,
right or wrong,

1227
01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.660
watch horrible violence happen so that you can understand it better so that you

1228
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.160
can handle it when the time arises.
Ya Odom.

1229
01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:54.220
And just kind of to to add on some of the stuff you were saying,

1230
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:59.460
I would even say compete if you can,
cause a lot of times in training you can't,

1231
01:25:59.461 --> 01:26:03.140
especially if you're training every day or pretty often you can get into the

1232
01:26:03.141 --> 01:26:04.100
mindset that

1233
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.670
<v 3>I can just train casual today and if a guy taps me out,</v>

1234
01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.510
which everyone says it doesn't matter that much.
You know,
so when you compete,

1235
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:12.410
that's,

1236
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:16.940
that's one of the significant things that I got bored of that I realized when I

1237
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:18.780
was competing.
It's your,
your re,

1238
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:22.370
your senses are heightened because everything matters.
If you get taken down,

1239
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:27.190
it matters.
If you go for a submission and you don't get it,
it matters in,

1240
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.920
in competition.
So you have that,
that mindset more so.

1241
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:33.080
And you'll get used to that mindset.
And to your point,

1242
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:38.780
I tell this guy's at Jujitsu,
when you're training for a competition,

1243
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.280
no matter what we do,
just about no matter 98% of the time,

1244
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:49.570
I can't get two guys in training to go as hard against each other as they're

1245
01:26:50.031 --> 01:26:51.470
going to end competition.
As someone,

1246
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.170
when someone gets a grip of your GE and competition,

1247
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:59.360
it is 10 times stronger than it is when you're training.

1248
01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:00.081
Cause if you rip,

1249
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:04.490
if I get to grab your g color and you go through some effort to rip it away and

1250
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.950
we're training,
I'm gonna let it go.
Right?

1251
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:10.980
Cause I don't care if it happens in competition and I only have seven minutes to

1252
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.590
work and get you submitted.

1253
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.740
I'm a hang onto that thing and I'm gonna hang on to it hard.
Yeah.

1254
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:18.470
And I'm not going to let go.
And so you end up with a much,
much,

1255
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:19.940
much more intense,

1256
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.720
seven minutes in a competition or three minutes in a boxing sparring match or a

1257
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:30.050
or an a Moitai the intensity,

1258
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.930
you cannot simulate the intensity in con in training that you're going to get an

1259
01:27:34.931 --> 01:27:38.450
a in competition and take that one step further.

1260
01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:40.850
When you get into a life and death struggle,

1261
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:45.770
you're going to have the same level of jump to the intensity that's going to be

1262
01:27:45.771 --> 01:27:47.330
there.
So that's a good point as well.
Yeah,

1263
01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:48.670
and that kind of goes from [inaudible] as well.

1264
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.210
I'm not even a thirdly saying competing Moitai,

1265
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.340
but when we tie is a good one because you get cracked in your body and your legs

1266
01:27:55.341 --> 01:28:00.230
and you get to feel some pain.
Um,
and if you're not used to that.

1267
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:04.430
Okay.
Before I even started,
when we,
today I went in,
um,
you know,
remember Terry,

1268
01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:09.020
so could you,
he was like,
Hey,
you know,
we,
we've trained you do two together.

1269
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:11.990
It was like,
Hey,
I'm training MMA today.
Come,
let's spar with me,

1270
01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.760
my other partner doing.
And I was like,
Hey,
I don't have any striking three.

1271
01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:17.300
He's like,
oh,
I don't care,
you know,
Jujitsu.
So this train was me.

1272
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:23.060
It's not so bright.
He punched me in the face really hard.
And that was,
you know,

1273
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:27.200
and I was like,
man,
just how you were talking about this crash grenades before.

1274
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.990
It was kind of like that.
Just the fact that I got piped in and knocked me out.

1275
01:28:29.991 --> 01:28:33.800
It didn't days meet in that way.
It was just the fact that Dang,

1276
01:28:33.801 --> 01:28:35.090
I wasn't used to this.

1277
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:37.810
I didn't know he was just going to start punching me in my face.
You know,

1278
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.110
I felt we were just going to warm up.

1279
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:44.380
So that's actually the main thing that made me go into [inaudible] specifically.

1280
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.620
So who's to get cracked?
Yeah.
Cause I was like,
Bro,
I'm not even,

1281
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:51.960
I would thought it was pretty good at Jujitsu.
So I figured,
you know,
like I was,

1282
01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.960
I was solid,
you know,
but breath,
so what if I get into some thing,
you know,

1283
01:28:56.961 --> 01:29:01.010
outside of the gym I got cracks me in my face and I'm not used to it.
Yeah.

1284
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.030
You know,
so men,

1285
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.040
so I though the Muy Thai did help is when you get hit in the face,

1286
01:29:07.591 --> 01:29:08.970
it's like Jujitsu,

1287
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:12.180
someone grinding on you and they're breathing all in your nose or they're

1288
01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:15.210
sweating all in your eye or whatever.
That doesn't bother you at all.

1289
01:29:15.211 --> 01:29:18.420
You barely notice it doesn't matter.
Right.
So the same thing with,

1290
01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:22.530
we tell you when you get punched in the nose and it's bleeding and you see your

1291
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:26.080
own blood or whatever,
but if you're not used today,
that'd mess you up.
Yeah.

1292
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:29.340
And if you notice back in the day,
like they're old UFC or whatever,

1293
01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:32.370
guys will get cracked in the face like three,
four times hard.

1294
01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:34.410
And they'll be like,
oh tap.
Oh holy cow.
You know,

1295
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:38.070
cause they're just not used to it.
Nowadays guys are just,
they won't,

1296
01:29:38.071 --> 01:29:40.620
they won't tell him.
Yeah,
the referee got to start on it.
They're used to,

1297
01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:44.640
it rarely does anyone tapped in the UFC from strikes.
Very rare.

1298
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.290
Unless they're like injured.

1299
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:51.810
Even it worry d.
Yeah.
So anyway,

1300
01:29:51.811 --> 01:29:55.200
so,
so the point is,
so when we tie situation and specific,

1301
01:29:55.201 --> 01:29:59.100
because that's where you feel the most pain,
like more than boxing,
like even,

1302
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:01.050
I mean you'll take brain injury for sure,

1303
01:30:01.051 --> 01:30:04.530
but it's not actual paint and we take it kicked in the leg and they teach you to

1304
01:30:04.531 --> 01:30:05.990
hide the pain and to,

1305
01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.960
to not let it affect you and go in the end and the ribs like body needs to the

1306
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:13.500
ribs.
It's super painful when you get used to that.

1307
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:16.360
I think that would help because like if you're in a situation,
the streets,

1308
01:30:16.361 --> 01:30:17.790
I'm cracks you hard in the face.

1309
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:22.850
You know what's interesting about that though is that there are some people that

1310
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.050
can,

1311
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:30.050
can easily or more easily take the pain of Moy Thai or boxing.

1312
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:35.550
Like it's okay with them then.
Then they,

1313
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:40.790
then they can take the grind of Jujitsu and some people can take the grind of

1314
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:45.540
Jujitsu all day long,
but they can never take the striking pain.

1315
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:50.040
So it's,
there's just some genetic or mental situations.

1316
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:51.840
But to your point,

1317
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.860
you need to be comfortable with both those situations.

1318
01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:59.790
And at the very least just familiar with it.
Oh,
I,
like I said,

1319
01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:02.870
that first punch that I took in my face and granted it was,

1320
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:07.350
I wasn't ready for him to just wail on me.
Play football too.
Yeah.
I mean,

1321
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:11.410
so you've been hit,
you've been knocked out before on the field.
Right.
So it's a,

1322
01:31:11.411 --> 01:31:14.250
it's kind of,
if I were to try to remember it,

1323
01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:17.190
it was a combination of sure that physical impact,

1324
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.130
but just the fact that this guy just punched me in my face right now,

1325
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:23.010
it's almost like thanked,
this guy is punching me my base.
Right.

1326
01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:27.120
Not that we're going to,
yeah,
I didn't like that.
But yeah,
after a while,

1327
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:30.720
it doesn't mean the hardest I ever got punched in the face was from Greg right

1328
01:31:30.721 --> 01:31:33.810
in the like right between my eyes.
And it was like happenstance.

1329
01:31:33.811 --> 01:31:38.130
He threw a real solid one.
Um,
as I went to kind of shoot eat,

1330
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:40.470
who's kind of coming up off his knees kind of,

1331
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.200
and I went to shoot like I got,

1332
01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:47.820
I got from off my back and then forward in shot forward and he just went,
boom.

1333
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:51.280
And the,
the,
the,
the force of me shooting forward and went boom.

1334
01:31:51.281 --> 01:31:54.330
And I felt it on my neck.
He was really bad,
but it was in a hard part.

1335
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:58.520
Lucky but yeah,
fully.
That was a KL punch.

1336
01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.160
He just happened to be in that really hard

1337
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.550
<v 0>part.
Um,
but I had been through that before.</v>

1338
01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:06.670
I train Muay Thai before and it didn't,
it didn't even slow it down.

1339
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:09.400
I remember thinking that was probably the hardest punch I ever took.

1340
01:32:09.401 --> 01:32:10.420
And it was with the MMA glove.

1341
01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:13.330
It wasn't with a big boxing gloves back in the old days.

1342
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:18.331
We used to just spark all full on with just MMA gloves on a regular basis.

1343
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:23.980
Yes.
Stupid and don't do that folks.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1344
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:28.380
Don't do that for the whole day.
But what I'm saying is that you were used to it.

1345
01:32:28.381 --> 01:32:30.160
Good.
Again,
I was used to it.
It didn't slow me down.

1346
01:32:30.161 --> 01:32:35.080
If that was like a situation where I took that kind of hard hit in a,
you know,

1347
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:37.450
or a cop would take that kind of hard to hit and they're used to that in

1348
01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:39.130
training or whatever,
that's not going to slow them down.

1349
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.450
That's not going to stun them unless it physically stuns the jars to me.
Yeah.

1350
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.560
And that's,
you know,
even if you're trained,
that's,
that's not,
that's gonna,

1351
01:32:46.930 --> 01:32:47.980
that's gonna Jag.
In fact,

1352
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:52.150
if you train too much and you get yourself hit too often,

1353
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.320
you'll actually decrease your ability to withstand punishment.

1354
01:32:56.321 --> 01:33:00.610
So be careful about that.
You want to train enough that you're used to it.

1355
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.990
You want to know that you can take it,

1356
01:33:01.991 --> 01:33:05.260
but then you don't want to overtrain add all.
Yeah.

1357
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:09.010
You never get better or take,
well,
no,
let me rephrase that.

1358
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:13.030
You get better at taking punches for a short period of time and then it goes,

1359
01:33:13.031 --> 01:33:16.690
starts to go backwards,
you know,
and unfortunately,
that's just the way the,
uh,

1360
01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:17.740
the body's built.

1361
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:22.300
You can see as some of the older UFC fighters get older,

1362
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.360
you know,
there's no doubt they don't have the chin that they once had.

1363
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.300
And that's when they usually decide to hang it up if they,
you know,

1364
01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.240
if they get the right counsel from people.

1365
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:36.540
But nowadays people are sparring a lot less and they're trying to not take all

1366
01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.350
that punishment because everyone realizes that you have a,

1367
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:44.110
you have a limited number of hits you can take to the,

1368
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:48.430
to the head and then it starts to go backwards.
And it's just,
you know,

1369
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:53.350
a lot of this information is coming from the,
the soldiers overseas,

1370
01:33:53.351 --> 01:33:57.640
the marines overseas that have taken concussions and IED strikes and they're

1371
01:33:57.641 --> 01:34:00.670
realizing that that is a permanent,
you know,

1372
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:05.380
downgrade of their systems and they,
they,
you know,
so they,

1373
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:08.730
so they,
that's where a lot of this information came from about football,

1374
01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:12.280
concussion stuff in football.
A lot of that is coming from the,

1375
01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:16.750
the ids that our soldiers and marines have taken overseas and they've realized

1376
01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:20.890
that this traumatic trauma,
traumatic brain injury is problematic.

1377
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.740
And so we need to,
we need to watch out for it.
So yeah,

1378
01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:27.800
especially if you're being a cop and you gotta be alert.
But that's why the,

1379
01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:30.820
and that's why I like the Muy Thai.
That's why I personally,
I did.
Yeah.

1380
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.650
Because it was a lot of like clenching needs and those,
if you were,

1381
01:34:35.690 --> 01:34:37.060
if,
if you've never done it,

1382
01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:40.840
you would think they'd been punched in the nose square in the nose real hard

1383
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.790
would be probably one of the more painful things,

1384
01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.340
but it wasn't compared to the ribs and the legs,
man.

1385
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.680
So if you're kind of used to just taking impacts in pain,
yeah.
You just,

1386
01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:55.000
you just,
and not to mention the physical part,
but just mentally,
they're like,

1387
01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:58.010
when that,
when that comes about,
you can just,
just

1388
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:02.900
<v 2>keep on keeping on now.
Yeah.
Cause you're used to it from a inoculate.</v>

1389
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:07.670
Inoculate yourself and not killing.
Okay.
Next question.

1390
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:13.430
Doco I have three little girls and I'm really intrigued by Brazilian Jujitsu.

1391
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:18.200
What form of martial art would you put your kids in?

1392
01:35:19.450 --> 01:35:24.350
That's an easy one.
Yeah.
Uh,
put your kids into Jujitsu.

1393
01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.230
Do it immediately.
Uh,
we kind of covered this,

1394
01:35:27.231 --> 01:35:29.000
the last podcast and that is the fact that

1395
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.170
if you got a teacher gets up,
don't get in a street fight,

1396
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:36.530
don't get into a fight in the playground.
If someone wants to fight you runaway,

1397
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:39.950
and that's what they should do.
And you know,

1398
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.980
later when they start to become mature enough to make real decisions that should

1399
01:35:45.951 --> 01:35:49.730
guide them.
And occasionally as a man,

1400
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.900
you may have to stand your ground and fight and that's understandable.

1401
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:59.420
But as a little kid who might be getting picked on by bigger kids,
Hey,

1402
01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:03.200
oh,
somebody gets in your face,
runaway.
If you really think you're gonna get hurt,

1403
01:36:03.201 --> 01:36:06.650
runaway.
So you have that self defense mechanism already.

1404
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.920
What you don't have and what you are not born with is when that bully grabs you

1405
01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.330
and pulls you to the ground or grabs you and holds onto you and won't let you

1406
01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:19.760
leave.
That is when you need to know how to grapple.

1407
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:24.920
And Jujitsu is what teaches you how to grapple.
So eventually,

1408
01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.920
like you just said,
you do want your kids to spar a little bit.

1409
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:32.750
You do want your kids to know how to throw some good combinations?

1410
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.800
They,
right.
I mean they should know how to do that.
Uh,
in your,
in the,

1411
01:36:36.801 --> 01:36:38.930
actually the other night I was working with Dean and we were working with a

1412
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:40.030
couple people and just go,

1413
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:44.030
he was going over some basic self defense and there are some legit basic self

1414
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:47.330
defense moves.
Did people should know,
you know,
someone bear hugs,
you,

1415
01:36:47.331 --> 01:36:48.230
someone had box you.

1416
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:53.240
Now we don't think about them at the high level of Jujitsu because we,

1417
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:56.150
we welcome someone had locking us.

1418
01:36:56.151 --> 01:36:58.550
We welcome that stuff because we're so used to it.

1419
01:36:58.551 --> 01:37:00.200
It says we have an advantage when we get there.

1420
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.810
But to a kid you get thrown into a headlock.
Uh,

1421
01:37:02.811 --> 01:37:05.660
first street fight I ever got out of the first guy,
can't call it a street fight.

1422
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:09.260
The first time ever got into a fight wasn't,
you know,
like fourth or fifth grade.

1423
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:14.060
And this kid who was definitely way stronger than me,

1424
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:15.550
grabbed me in a headlock,

1425
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.260
was holding me on the ground and punched me in the head and I did,

1426
01:37:18.261 --> 01:37:19.940
couldn't do anything.
And you know,

1427
01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:24.830
it got broken up after 20 seconds by the principal.
But Oh,
it's okay.

1428
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:28.420
You don't okay that,
that wasn't cool.
So what you want your kid,

1429
01:37:28.421 --> 01:37:31.610
cause if that kid would have tried to attack me when I was standing up,

1430
01:37:31.611 --> 01:37:33.950
I can just run away from him.
But once he grabbed a hold of me,

1431
01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.510
all of a sudden I can't do anything.

1432
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.170
So that's why Jujitsu is the first thing you want to learn.
It's also,

1433
01:37:39.171 --> 01:37:42.650
as I said last time,
it's the most technical thing.
It,
there's the most to learn.

1434
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.330
It's a never ending,
uh,

1435
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:51.260
knowledge quest.
So you want to get on that quest as early as possible.

1436
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.760
Now on top of that,

1437
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.880
and what's really good about Jujitsu,
and again,

1438
01:37:56.881 --> 01:37:58.560
this is something that I've talked about before,

1439
01:37:58.561 --> 01:38:03.561
but when you talk about traditional martial arts and you imagine,

1440
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.750
you know a traditional martial arts dojo where people in plain white ghees are

1441
01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:16.191
standing in a very clean and Spartan facility with Samurai swords Hain on the

1442
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:20.520
wall and they're bowing to the Sensei,

1443
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.660
that implies a certain amount of knowledge will be passed and a certain amount

1444
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:31.170
of etiquette will be passed.

1445
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:36.530
And the etiquette and the knowledge that we passed will be toughness and

1446
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:39.870
confidence and humility.
And as a matter of fact,

1447
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:44.871
if you go to a traditional martial arts school and you bring your kid in there

1448
01:38:45.481 --> 01:38:48.870
and you say,
I want my kid to train,
what will he get out of it?

1449
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:52.620
One of the things that are going to say is he's going to learn to be confident

1450
01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:57.621
or she's going to learn humility and they will teach them that verbally.

1451
01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.380
It will be a lesson,
it will be a

1452
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.810
book,

1453
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:11.810
almost a book lesson on this is humility and this is confidence and hold your

1454
01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:13.440
head high.

1455
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.280
Jujitsu teaches those things.
Not Theoretically,

1456
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.530
but for real.

1457
01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:26.520
Because in Jujitsu you will get humbled.

1458
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.630
You will get humbled by a peer,

1459
01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:31.590
someone that's smaller than you by someone that's weaker than you.

1460
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:33.330
They will submit you,

1461
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.380
they will hold you down and you won't be able to do anything about it.

1462
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:39.960
And that is humility.

1463
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:42.690
And that is where you learn humility and Jujitsu.

1464
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.410
And same thing with confidence.
You know,

1465
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:51.470
you will learn as you get better at Jujitsu that hey,

1466
01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:56.690
I know something and I know I can handle myself in bad situations.

1467
01:39:57.210 --> 01:40:02.210
So it truly teaches humility and confidence.

1468
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.850
Not Theoretically,
but in a very practical sense,
you know.

1469
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:13.170
So get your kids down to the Jujitsu school,
get them enrolled.

1470
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.290
And you know,
we,

1471
01:40:14.291 --> 01:40:18.720
we w we did a podcast where we talked about how to find a good Jujitsu school.

1472
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:23.130
So find a good reputable place and get your kids down there.
And you know what,

1473
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:27.360
when you bring your kids in to start Jujitsu,
get your Dang self on the mat too.

1474
01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:31.800
Cause you got to know it and it's,
everybody should know.
Yeah,
the end,

1475
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:34.080
except for bullies and evil people,

1476
01:40:34.081 --> 01:40:38.340
they should be banned from Jujitsu cause it's too powerful.
Wait two months.

1477
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:44.460
Another element that,
um,
that you might not think of right off the bat,
but,
um,

1478
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:50.570
the fact that you'll meet friends cause [inaudible] for whatever reason.

1479
01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:54.040
I mean it just might be the in general,
but

1480
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.800
<v 3>when you go to like the Jujitsu,
so you go on the mats,</v>

1481
01:40:56.801 --> 01:40:59.290
it's not like how you're saying like a traditional martial arts school where

1482
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:01.900
you're like,
don't talk bow,
be rigid.

1483
01:41:01.901 --> 01:41:05.800
Stand like this while the Sensei's talking say yes sir.
No Sir.
It's,
it's really,

1484
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:08.440
I mean in my experience that I've been to a lot,

1485
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:11.800
especially here in southern California there,
that's where most of them are.

1486
01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:16.570
It's real.
Even though the more rigid ones are casual,
casual before class,

1487
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:17.860
you can talk even during class,

1488
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:21.150
as long as you're not talking while the instructor's,
yeah.
Do you,

1489
01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:24.730
do you do that in a school?
You wouldn't do that anywhere.
Yeah,
exactly.
You know,

1490
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:27.900
but you know what,
you're practicing moves.
It's,
it's,
um,

1491
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:30.390
of course he don't want to deviate too much from the lesson.
But it,

1492
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.750
it's just more social.
And so you talk after class and you'll find that,

1493
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.840
that the atmosphere is really conducive to gravitating towards people that,

1494
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:45.400
that have the same interests.
Have you even outside of Jujitsu and kids,

1495
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:46.121
especially men,

1496
01:41:46.121 --> 01:41:48.760
because usually the teachers are way more lenient with kids when they're running

1497
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:50.860
around and you know,
you're telling them,

1498
01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.220
go do this move and they might be talking a little bit about something or

1499
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:58.410
whatever.
If they're having fun,
which it is very fun.
Um,

1500
01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:00.700
they're just going to want to do it some more.

1501
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:02.860
And then my daughter's two and we found a place that,

1502
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:07.030
that could facilitate a two year old situation and she would always look forward

1503
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:09.670
to it because they,
she just think it's just one big display house,

1504
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:12.850
the rough housing the whole time.
It's the ultimate dream for a kid.

1505
01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:17.910
I'll room with padded floors and padded walls and you can grab the clothes and

1506
01:42:17.911 --> 01:42:20.100
rough house all you want people to the ground.
Yeah.

1507
01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:24.310
You're not going to get punched or kicked or,
you know.
Yeah.
It's,
um,
yeah.

1508
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.450
So there is a,

1509
01:42:26.410 --> 01:42:31.300
a good community aspect to Jujitsu.

1510
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.930
Yes,
very much so.
Which echo likes very much so.

1511
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:39.100
Sometimes I don't even want to roll.
I just want to come and talk.

1512
01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:44.150
So sometimes that's often the situation with that Jocko Willink.

1513
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:49.660
So basically being a new leader,

1514
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:54.040
overcoming friction in the new organization,

1515
01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:58.480
that's this.
That's what this guy is.
He's,
you know,
he's a new leader.

1516
01:42:58.481 --> 01:43:01.710
Overcoming friction in an organization.
Any penetrating insight.

1517
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:02.010
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:05.570
and I think what's important here is this is he's not a new leader like newly

1519
01:43:05.571 --> 01:43:09.410
commissioned leaders stepping up in the ranks.
He's a new in a new organization.

1520
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:12.500
So he's stepping into a new organization leader.
Yes,

1521
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:15.820
the new leader in a new situation.
Gotcha.

1522
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:20.270
We've kind of talked about stepping up from within the organization.

1523
01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:23.150
How do you go in and step into a new organization?

1524
01:43:23.151 --> 01:43:28.151
Now I'm going to look at this from a perspective of of like a normal transition

1525
01:43:28.371 --> 01:43:30.710
into a leadership position and a new job or something like that.

1526
01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.430
Not a hostile takeover situation.

1527
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:38.330
Maybe we can address that on a later time,

1528
01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.400
but not a situation where,
hey,
they fired this guy.
He had a bad reputation.

1529
01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.200
The things are going wrong,

1530
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:48.740
you're going to step in and change it because that that would take a different

1531
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:52.550
leadership approach.
Then the one that I,

1532
01:43:52.551 --> 01:43:56.090
that I would take and that I have taken where you're stepping into a situation

1533
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:59.930
where things are going okay and you put your coming in and you've got some goals

1534
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:02.990
and there's so you're taking over leadership position.
It happens all the time.

1535
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:09.380
Um,
so a couple of things about this.
First of all,

1536
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:12.920
you step into a new leadership role.
You got to talk to people,

1537
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.770
but you mostly got to listen.

1538
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:20.420
You've got to find out why they're doing things the way they are.

1539
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:23.510
Because a lot of times there might be reasons for the way things are happening

1540
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:26.990
that you don't understand or that aren't really particularly evident.

1541
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.080
So you really want to not make the judgements because you're bringing your own

1542
01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:34.880
experience and you've done this a thousand times and that's why you're the new

1543
01:44:34.881 --> 01:44:38.900
leader and that's why they put you in here.
You got to set that aside and say,

1544
01:44:38.901 --> 01:44:41.660
okay,
explain to me why this process is in place,

1545
01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:45.800
or where did this process come from?
Or what does this process trying to prevent?

1546
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.600
So that way you're getting smarter and you're learning and you're not being,

1547
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:53.780
you're not imposing your ideas,

1548
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:57.350
which you don't have any background for.
You don't,
you know,

1549
01:44:57.351 --> 01:45:02.060
you may have been a leadership in a different company or a different unit before

1550
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.470
and you think you know,
but you don't know.
So be humble and check yourself.

1551
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:10.400
Um,
you got to be friendly to people,

1552
01:45:10.401 --> 01:45:14.150
but at the same time you gotta be reserved.
Now this is,

1553
01:45:14.151 --> 01:45:19.151
this is tricky because you are trying to build relationships.

1554
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.480
You absolutely are trying to build relationships.
That's what life is.

1555
01:45:23.481 --> 01:45:26.300
That's what business is.
That's what war is.
That's what everything is about.

1556
01:45:26.301 --> 01:45:28.400
Building relationships with these other humans.

1557
01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.990
So you want to be friendly to people,
but at the same time,

1558
01:45:32.991 --> 01:45:34.430
from a leadership perspective,

1559
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:39.020
you can't just come in and be Mr Nice guy and best friends with everybody.

1560
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:43.760
That's not going to work out for you for a couple reasons.
Number one,

1561
01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:47.780
you don't know the,

1562
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:52.900
the face that people are going to present you out of the gate is not necessarily

1563
01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:59.470
the true face of that person.
So you may check in your first day and this guy,

1564
01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.790
hey,
it's great to meet you.
So good to have you on board,

1565
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:04.640
heard a lot about you and you go,
wow,
this guys,
and he's ticked,

1566
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:07.040
starts giving you some background information about things that are going.

1567
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.290
And by the way,
we got a couple of things that are a little messed up,
you know,

1568
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:12.560
and I can point him out to you,
but that guy might be working his agenda.

1569
01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.660
So you Ganna be cautious as you go in.
Um,

1570
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:22.750
and the other piece of that is it is much easier to reel back in slack or sorry,

1571
01:46:24.081 --> 01:46:29.081
it's much easier to give out that friendship later than it is if you go

1572
01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:32.630
overboard and you become everyone's best friend and now you got to cut it off

1573
01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.680
and all of a sudden you become a jerk.
So it's much easier to,

1574
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:42.550
to give out the slack when you want to later than it is to give out a bunch of

1575
01:46:42.741 --> 01:46:45.470
slack and then try and reel it back in and be a jerk.

1576
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.890
And that makes it hard for both parties.
That's why in that case,
yeah,
like what?

1577
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:51.060
It's going to be really hard.

1578
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:54.120
The only reason you're pulling back the friendship thing is because it started

1579
01:46:54.121 --> 01:46:58.530
going sideways and that makes it even harder.
It's a nightmare.

1580
01:46:59.040 --> 01:46:59.873
Uh,

1581
01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.710
got to watch out for the gossip because everyone's going to want to whisper in

1582
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:07.770
your ear the things about the things about the people and this and that.

1583
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:11.460
So you gotta be careful,
nod your head,
take it,
be onboard,

1584
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:16.690
but take it with a grain of salt.
Definitely don't encourage it yet.

1585
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:21.240
And that can be a hard part for certain types of people will say,

1586
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:24.030
because let's face it,
man,
that can be some interesting stuff.

1587
01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:27.570
There can be some knowledge to be gained there,
but you just have to be careful.

1588
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.260
You want to hear some insights.
Right.

1589
01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:35.500
But be careful when the insights crossover into gossip.
Yeah.

1590
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:39.390
And be careful that the insights are coming from people that might have agendas.

1591
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:40.590
In fact,

1592
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:44.610
they are coming from people that have agendas because everybody has agendas and

1593
01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:46.470
maybe the person has a positive agenda,

1594
01:47:46.471 --> 01:47:50.130
which is to improve the company or improve the unit or improve the team,

1595
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:55.310
but they also might have a agenda of improving their own station in life.

1596
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:58.140
So you have to be careful of that.

1597
01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:03.450
They are watching you,
they are watching you.

1598
01:48:03.451 --> 01:48:05.910
When you come in to take over,
they are watching you.

1599
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.640
So act accordingly.

1600
01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:13.620
Think about the fact that they are watching you.
Like I said,

1601
01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:17.130
use caution and forming these new relationships.

1602
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:22.980
You got to find out who's who.
You want to establish things.
But again,

1603
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:27.981
you got to watch out because people might not necessarily be who they make

1604
01:48:30.361 --> 01:48:32.820
themselves out to be in the beginning.

1605
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:37.110
So this is kind of becoming a little bit of a chorus.

1606
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:41.790
When I talk about leading,
be humble,
listen,
learn,

1607
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.230
move methodically.

1608
01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:47.070
When it does come time to make change in a new situation,

1609
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:52.290
most of the time I would say do it incrementally.

1610
01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:57.620
Do smaller changes after you've assessed fully and you've got people,

1611
01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.780
a p got people's opinions and you've expressed and socialized your ideas so

1612
01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:07.250
you're not trying to roll in there and change the world again.

1613
01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:10.770
Now if we go into a hostel turnover situation or there's someone's been fired

1614
01:49:10.771 --> 01:49:13.020
for cause or that's a different situation,

1615
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.640
but for a normal transition into a new job,
be humble,
listen,

1616
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.180
learn and lead that part where you're,
you're talking about,

1617
01:49:21.181 --> 01:49:25.230
find out why they're doing the things that the way they are and stuff like that.

1618
01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.113
Um,

1619
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.910
that part can be depending on certain people's personality.

1620
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.020
Like if you're coming in as the new guy and you and you ask,
start asking,
hey,

1621
01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:39.720
why do you guys do it like this?
If you come off with the wrong tone,

1622
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.480
sometimes it'll sound like that.
You're questioning.
Oh,
for sure.

1623
01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.920
I remember when I worked at the nightclub,
we had a new manager,
um,
and

1624
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.420
<v 3>his name was Joel.
He,
uh,
he,</v>

1625
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:53.440
he came in and he was strangely,

1626
01:49:53.441 --> 01:49:56.650
he was this whole list personified.
He came in,

1627
01:49:56.651 --> 01:49:58.780
he was really friendly but really reserved.

1628
01:49:59.170 --> 01:50:02.620
But the one thing he did cut it to address what,
what else?
We did a good chair.

1629
01:50:02.650 --> 01:50:05.330
Really good job.
Yeah.
Except as,
no,
no,
no,
no,

1630
01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:08.350
nothing I'm saying is an example of how he

1631
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:13.300
clarified that.
He's not questioning the way we're doing stuff.
He's not saying,

1632
01:50:13.301 --> 01:50:16.360
hey,
where are you doing it like that because this way sucks.

1633
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.680
It didn't have that tone.

1634
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:21.640
But he came to me and I saw him do it to the other guy where he,

1635
01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:23.010
he came in and said,
hey,
I'm,

1636
01:50:23.011 --> 01:50:26.800
I'm going to be asking a lot of questions cause obviously I'm new here,
you know,

1637
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.400
just so I can understand and,
and,

1638
01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:33.340
and get on board with what you're doing so it can be ultimately what we're
doing.

1639
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:37.570
That's what he said.
He said it in a little bit different way obviously.
But um,

1640
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.230
that's what he said and that right away.
So no matter what the question he asked,

1641
01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:44.110
it was almost like,
shoot,
I want to tell this guy how it's working.
You know,

1642
01:50:44.111 --> 01:50:46.660
cause he's,
he's,
he's,
he's on my team automatically.

1643
01:50:46.661 --> 01:50:48.400
He told me that and he was on my team.

1644
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:52.990
So I think if that can be clarified that you're not like questioning me because

1645
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:56.770
it seems like,
you know,
I want to make it seem like,
um,
you know,

1646
01:50:56.771 --> 01:51:00.040
I know a better way right off the bat.
You don't want that tone,
you know,

1647
01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:02.830
I know just from a on the receiving end,
I don't want that.
Tell him nope.

1648
01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:06.130
Cause I'm going to be all,
yeah.
So anyway,
yes,
yes,
yes.

1649
01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:09.580
<v 0>In the last thing I kind of had written down here was,
um,</v>

1650
01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:13.690
enjoy it.
It's,
it's,

1651
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.520
it's awesome stepping into a new leadership position and it's challenging to do

1652
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:19.600
what you just talked about,

1653
01:51:19.601 --> 01:51:24.601
to transition people in to your leadership realm and to do it in a subtle way

1654
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:29.230
that brings them on board with a positive attitude.

1655
01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:33.070
So enjoy that challenge.
Yeah.
Cause it's,
it's pretty fun.

1656
01:51:33.071 --> 01:51:36.220
It's challenging and most importantly it's rewarding.
Yeah.

1657
01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.800
<v 3>Next question,
Jah.
Cool.</v>

1658
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.890
How do you learn slash practice detachment in realtime

1659
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:50.090
<v 0>detachment?
So this is something</v>

1660
01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:56.860
that I have talked about a lot and it is definitely a very important part of

1661
01:52:00.441 --> 01:52:02.810
leadership and it's a very important part

1662
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:03.743
<v 1>of</v>

1663
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:09.420
of finding it,

1664
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.940
<v 0>finding your way successfully through life.</v>

1665
01:52:11.941 --> 01:52:14.850
It's an important part of navigation of,

1666
01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:19.640
of the world.
So,
and if,

1667
01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:21.060
if you haven't heard me talk about this,

1668
01:52:21.061 --> 01:52:26.061
this is the idea that you are not caught up in the emotions and the chaos and

1669
01:52:27.331 --> 01:52:30.680
the,
and the tactical firefight that's happening.

1670
01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:34.290
You detach so you can make good judgments about things.

1671
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:37.980
So how do you do it?
How do you learn it and how do you practice it?

1672
01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:40.320
Step number one

1673
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.860
is awareness.
Awareness

1674
01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.410
<v 2>of yourself.
So you start asking yourself,
wait,</v>

1675
01:52:51.411 --> 01:52:53.180
how am I being perceived right now?

1676
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:57.350
If you can just occasionally start asking yourself,

1677
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:58.850
how am I being perceived right now?

1678
01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:04.700
How is echo seeing me right now?
So all of a sudden you've,

1679
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:09.050
you started to take other people's perspective,
which is,

1680
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:13.820
it's a good start because it's not your own.
And the goal is to,

1681
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:17.750
is to get outside of your own perspective and see yourself from some kind of a

1682
01:53:17.751 --> 01:53:22.430
distance.
So you start asking yourself,
how am I being perceived?

1683
01:53:22.431 --> 01:53:26.780
And then start trying to watch yourself like what do I look like right now?

1684
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:32.750
Am I caught inside that madness?

1685
01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:35.870
And once you start to do that,
that's going to be like your,

1686
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:39.910
that's going to be your little tool that you're gonna use is getting outside and

1687
01:53:39.911 --> 01:53:43.940
just watching yourself and saying,
okay,
I am aware of what I'm doing right now.

1688
01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:48.050
I am aware of what I am doing right now.

1689
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:53.380
And then what you want to do is you want to set some kind of alerts because you

1690
01:53:55.681 --> 01:53:58.720
don't walk around.
I don't walk around detached from myself all the time.
I'm not,

1691
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.240
I mean,
otherwise you would have no joy and you would have no,

1692
01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.020
you'd have no pain,
you'd have no emotions because you'd be detached from it.

1693
01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:09.470
So you don't walk.
I don't walk around just detached all the time,

1694
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.840
but I do have some alerts,
some little red flags,

1695
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:19.280
and we'll triggers.
That happened in my mind that when I feel them,

1696
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.470
I know,
okay,

1697
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:27.310
you're starting to go too far and you're losing

1698
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.320
the perception of yourself.
What's your,
your trigger there?

1699
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.213
A couple of them.

1700
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.690
Number one is like some strong emotion like anger,

1701
01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:40.910
you know,
anger.
You start,

1702
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:44.420
if you start clenching your fist or you start raising your voice,

1703
01:54:44.421 --> 01:54:48.500
that should be a warning.
Okay?
You are not thinking clearly right now.

1704
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:52.910
Detached from this.
Get away from these emotions.
Um,

1705
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:54.800
some kind of chaos.

1706
01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:58.280
I like chaos happening and you're in it.

1707
01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:02.240
Whether it's in a supermarket,
whether it's,
you know,
something bad,

1708
01:55:02.241 --> 01:55:05.810
something violent,
something mob.
If you're getting in that situation,

1709
01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:07.100
you start feeling that.

1710
01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:11.630
Detach yourself from it cause you can get caught up in it's any overwhelming

1711
01:55:11.631 --> 01:55:16.040
excitement will be it.
Now here's a good red flag.

1712
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:18.830
Here's a good red flag.

1713
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:24.160
Good alert is the 27th time you bang your head against the wall attacking a

1714
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:28.820
problem,
whatever that problem is.
You know,

1715
01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.770
and I actually made this joke the other day,

1716
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:34.850
a Jujitsu because we're talking about passing someone's guard and people will

1717
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:38.990
try and try and try one way,
one way,
one way,
one way,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.

1718
01:55:38.991 --> 01:55:43.800
And I'm like,
listen,
after your 27th attempt to pass someone's guard,
same way,

1719
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.900
go ahead and try another way.

1720
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:50.700
So this happens a lot where if you find yourself beating your head against the

1721
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:53.580
wall after the 27th time,

1722
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:58.800
go ahead and let that be a little alert that you need to detach.
You need to get,

1723
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:00.730
cause there's some reason that you're doing this.
Yeah,

1724
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:04.650
maybe it's an emotional reason.
Maybe it's just you're too close to the problem.

1725
01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:09.780
Maybe it's that the problem has a hold of you and you don't recognize it.

1726
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:14.430
But let that be in the alert trigger that tells you,

1727
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.770
hey buddy,
detach.

1728
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.950
Take a look around and see if there's another way.

1729
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:25.610
Now another huge thing that requires detachment.

1730
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:31.630
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1731
01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:35.860
<v 2>is your ego,
your big,
nasty,</v>

1732
01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:37.780
powerful ego.

1733
01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.310
It's one of the biggest things that you have to utilize the attachment to

1734
01:56:42.311 --> 01:56:43.144
overcome.

1735
01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:48.300
And let me tell you some of the things that will warn you that your ego is now

1736
01:56:50.261 --> 01:56:54.780
in the game.
And when your ego's in the game,
when your ego is in the game and it,

1737
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:58.240
it will very easily when it will beat you.

1738
01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:02.740
So when you're feeling
jealousy,

1739
01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.320
likely that's going to be your ego and actually hurts somebody or somebody on

1740
01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:08.960
Twitter.

1741
01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.180
He hit me with this the other day and it was something along the lines of,
uh,

1742
01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.030
if you're feeling jealous,

1743
01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:20.440
instead of saying,
I'm jealous of this person,

1744
01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:25.450
say what can I learn from this person?
Wow.
Great statement.

1745
01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.610
Right?
Because that's when you set your ego.

1746
01:57:27.611 --> 01:57:31.120
That's when you detach from your ego and you say,
okay,

1747
01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:34.720
I'm not going to be jealous of this person.
They can teach me something.
Uh,

1748
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:39.610
when you start feeling frustrated,
when you first start feeling disgust or anger,

1749
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:43.630
where is that emotion coming from?
Very high likelihood.

1750
01:57:43.631 --> 01:57:45.220
It's coming from your ego.

1751
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:51.510
So you need to put that ego in to check.

1752
01:57:53.290 --> 01:57:57.700
Do you think that's the hardest one,
do you think?
Oh yeah.
Although,

1753
01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.300
yeah,
they can all be pretty hard.
I mean,
because you know,

1754
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:09.380
w w when you get emotional about the relationship,
yeah.

1755
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:11.870
I mean that's not always your ego.
That can be your ego,

1756
01:58:12.170 --> 01:58:14.370
especially if there's another person involved.
Right.

1757
01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:17.000
But a lot of times that's not your ego.
That's,

1758
01:58:17.001 --> 01:58:20.720
that's your emotion that's hurting and causing problems.

1759
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.540
Um,
but yeah,
the ego,

1760
01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:27.200
I actually find the ego because it's so clear.

1761
01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:32.360
It's so clear that you're just being an idiot with your ego.
I always go,
God,

1762
01:58:32.361 --> 01:58:36.170
I'm stupid.
Why am I doing this?
Yeah.
Uh,

1763
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:38.750
and I think it,
he's usually pretty good.

1764
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:42.130
I think the ones that are harder or a little bit a bit more subtle,

1765
01:58:42.330 --> 01:58:46.930
<v 3>you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's Kinda what it mean because the ego is like,</v>

1766
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.000
that's how powerful it is because it,

1767
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:54.220
any extreme situation or Eric extreme example,
any one of these,

1768
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:56.560
like if you get really angry,
it's easy to see.

1769
01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.940
I lost pay temporary right there and you shouldn't have done that,

1770
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.820
shouldn't have yelled at,
you know,
whatever.

1771
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:06.500
Or if your ego's prevalent in this really,
um,
just to,

1772
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:10.650
in a real strong way.
It's obvious.
Of course it's not,
but the Eagle,

1773
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:15.520
I feel like it's like that subtlety of it makes it hard.
Yeah.
Because you know,

1774
01:59:15.521 --> 01:59:18.730
that last part of the,
it's like if you want to remove your ego,
it's,

1775
01:59:18.731 --> 01:59:22.660
it's almost like a bucket of sand where you got to get the last corner of your

1776
01:59:22.661 --> 01:59:25.720
ego out for it to work.
Otherwise,
we eagle still in the game.

1777
01:59:26.290 --> 01:59:29.320
It was always in the game.
And,
and I don't encourage people to,

1778
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:33.130
I'm not like the boot of it says completely eliminate your ego because your ego

1779
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:36.640
is what's driving you in many cases to perform well,
to win.

1780
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:40.600
There's nothing wrong with that,
you know,
and if you,
uh,

1781
01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:46.570
but the part of the Ayn rand in the end of what's that book anyways,
she's like,

1782
01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:51.200
ego is this,
God blessed the ego.
You know,
this yeah.

1783
01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:55.180
Uh,
in,
it's pretty powerful because that's what drives you.

1784
01:59:55.181 --> 01:59:57.310
That's the individual effort.

1785
01:59:57.850 --> 02:00:02.850
The problem is there's a dichotomy of everything and sometimes your ego will get

1786
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:05.650
the best of you and that's what you need to watch out for.

1787
02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:08.380
And that's when you got to learn to detach from it.
Yeah.

1788
02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:13.510
So it's like each situation you have a certain sized cup that can only hold so

1789
02:00:13.511 --> 02:00:17.260
much ego to get it done and then any even one drop,

1790
02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:21.310
it's going to jam you up when you're,
if you're one drop overflowing,
you know?

1791
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.880
And you could make bad decisions with your ego if you let it get in the way.

1792
02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:25.420
Yeah man.

1793
02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:28.630
And that's the hard thing because B and I think that's probably the reason

1794
02:00:28.631 --> 02:00:31.900
because you need your ego to,
to kind of function,

1795
02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.420
to get tasks done and excel and all this stuff.

1796
02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:39.660
So you have to basically find that fine line that you have to get rid of,

1797
02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:40.510
you know,
the,

1798
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:45.510
at what point do you get rid of enough ego to still having enough you go to get

1799
02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:50.590
the task done,
you know,
so the dichotomy.
Yeah.
Sometimes you don't realize it.

1800
02:00:50.650 --> 02:00:54.490
Yeah.
Um,
not that I ever have that problem.
Nothing like that.

1801
02:00:54.491 --> 02:00:58.180
I'm just saying it seems like we are that problem,
unfortunately.

1802
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:02.920
<v 1>Okay.
Jocko,</v>

1803
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:06.890
<v 3>what do you think of people in leadership roles who,</v>

1804
02:01:06.891 --> 02:01:11.891
cause I see it in coaching guys either totally use it or are totally against it.

1805
02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:20.060
So swearing,
cussing,

1806
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:24.410
using foul language.
Uh,

1807
02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:26.750
I think this is pretty straight forward question.

1808
02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.950
I can tell you that by no means

1809
02:01:32.630 --> 02:01:35.180
am I a saint and,
and you know,

1810
02:01:35.181 --> 02:01:40.100
I was in the seal teams for 20 years.
And

1811
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.380
<v 0>when you've heard the term swear like a sailor,</v>

1812
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.880
there's actually a level beyond that and that's swearing like a seal.

1813
02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.800
And so I,
I've,
you know,
there's times in the seal teams where literally,

1814
02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:52.793
you know,

1815
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.400
every single word in a sentence would be,
you know,
a swear word.

1816
02:01:58.910 --> 02:02:00.970
Uh,
and,

1817
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:04.640
and that's something that when I go back and brief the brief,

1818
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:08.660
the seal teams right now on something,
I go almost right back into that mode.

1819
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:10.730
You know,
not,

1820
02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:15.820
not quite as bad as I would probably was at the high point of my career where I

1821
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:22.910
was well rehearsed and well trained at foul language.
But,
uh,

1822
02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:26.390
but hey,
here's the deal on a forum like this where we're on a podcast where,

1823
02:02:26.690 --> 02:02:29.900
you know,
many,
many people listen to this,

1824
02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:34.970
including kids and my kids.
And,

1825
02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:36.553
um,

1826
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:41.240
I try and utilize better language now.

1827
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:46.070
And I'll tell you what,
I actually had a point where I sort of said to myself,
me,

1828
02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:49.370
I'm not going to do that.
And I heard a podcast,
what,
you're not going to do?
What?

1829
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:52.190
I'm not going to square.
I'll blocks.
I'm not,
I'm not going to be an,

1830
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:54.500
I'm not just going to square the whole time and a podcast.

1831
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:56.690
And this actually happened because I heard a podcast,

1832
02:02:56.691 --> 02:02:59.840
I listened to a podcast where it was actually,

1833
02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:02.850
it was a conversation,
you know,
normal podcast.

1834
02:03:02.851 --> 02:03:04.700
There's a conversation going on between two people.

1835
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:10.270
And they were swearing so much that I just said to myself,

1836
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:16.580
man,
this sounds ridiculous.
It just sounded,
it sounded completely ridiculous.

1837
02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:21.830
And I just decided after,
and this was before we started our prior,
this was,

1838
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.440
you know,
maybe like two years ago.
I mean,
it was a long time ago.

1839
02:03:24.441 --> 02:03:25.940
I heard this podcast and I just said to myself,

1840
02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:30.620
these people sound stupid with so much swearing and um,

1841
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:33.350
and it wasn't it.
The thing is like,

1842
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:37.760
you listen to Joe Rogan or like a comedic podcast and they're swearing and,

1843
02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:40.730
and some people,
like for instance,
Joe Rogan,

1844
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.740
he swears he does it at the right time and it has comedic impact.

1845
02:03:45.741 --> 02:03:49.790
Word has value when he does it.
So,
so that's understandable.

1846
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:54.200
But I've heard people that they just,
it's,
it's just,
it doesn't,

1847
02:03:54.710 --> 02:03:57.770
it ends up having no impact other than just to make you say,

1848
02:03:57.771 --> 02:04:02.200
this person is not very smart.
Right.
So with that,
you know,

1849
02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.310
I just tried to keep it clean.
Um,

1850
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:07.820
but actually it's not even almost like I don't consciously sit there and try and

1851
02:04:07.821 --> 02:04:11.630
keep it clean,
but,
uh,
you know,
I try and keep it clean.

1852
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:14.400
Is that kind of like,
you know,
people,
uh,

1853
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:19.700
most of us have this little,
the problem,
but what would they like,

1854
02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.550
like,
you know,
very similar,
like,
oh,
it just did.

1855
02:04:24.150 --> 02:04:26.480
It's still kinda like that.
Yeah,
it is.

1856
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:31.370
It's the same thing where when you hear someone saying like,
like,

1857
02:04:31.371 --> 02:04:33.980
like it,
as soon as you,

1858
02:04:33.981 --> 02:04:38.360
you might not even recognize it at first because we're used to hearing it.
Yeah.

1859
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.450
But if you pick up on it and you're listening to a podcast and you start to hear

1860
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:45.690
someone do that,
it's the same thing.
You just say,
wow,

1861
02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:49.950
this person really sounds stupid and they might be smart,

1862
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:56.090
but this person sounds really stupid and I'm not going to sound like that.

1863
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:01.290
So that's pretty much where,
uh,

1864
02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:05.610
where my opinion comes from and why.
And you know what,

1865
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:08.490
I have had a couple people hit me up and say,
you know,
hey,

1866
02:05:08.491 --> 02:05:11.460
this is the only podcast that I listened to that my kids can listen to.

1867
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:16.620
And that's,
that's kind of cool.
You know,
I,
I appreciate that.
It's,
it's pretty,
um,

1868
02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:22.010
it's pretty humbling to hear that people are sitting there listening to podcasts

1869
02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:24.690
where their kids,
yeah.
And I guess humbling is the wrong word,

1870
02:05:24.691 --> 02:05:28.650
which somebody hit me up on Twitter.
It's an honor.

1871
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:33.120
It's an honor that doesn't feel like I deserve,

1872
02:05:33.121 --> 02:05:36.600
but it's an honor to hear somebody sitting around and say,
Oh,
you know,

1873
02:05:36.601 --> 02:05:38.220
I listened to his podcast with my daughter,

1874
02:05:38.221 --> 02:05:39.840
or I listened to your podcast with my son,

1875
02:05:39.841 --> 02:05:42.770
and it's so many good lessons to learn.
And that that feels pretty good.
Yeah.

1876
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:44.100
Yeah.

1877
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:49.100
And so if I was to throw that out the window so that I could drop some f bombs,

1878
02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:52.710
yeah.
It doesn't really seem worth it because what kind of,
uh,

1879
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:56.220
what kind of a linguistic command do I have?

1880
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:58.890
If the only way I can get my point across is by,

1881
02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:04.320
is by using foul language.
You know,
and the funny thing is too,
is,

1882
02:06:05.010 --> 02:06:09.030
well,
I used to go,
you know,
when I was in the seal teams,

1883
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.940
I would go and literally,
like I said,
my,

1884
02:06:11.941 --> 02:06:16.941
I would have whole sentence constructions that would be nothing but f bombs.

1885
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:21.180
Right.
And I would come home and in front of my six,

1886
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:24.420
six year old kid or whatever,
I never swore in front of my kids.

1887
02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:26.970
And people would be kind of surprised.

1888
02:06:26.971 --> 02:06:31.971
Like if I had a seal buddy over and they'd hear me talk in my house and they'd

1889
02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:35.160
say,
how do you even do that?
How do you,
and I don't know why,

1890
02:06:35.161 --> 02:06:39.510
I've just been able to do it.
So that was another thing.
You know,
these podcasts,

1891
02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:42.300
when you go on the interwebs,
they're there for,

1892
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:48.240
I hate to say it,
but they're there for ever.
And you can take them down.

1893
02:06:48.241 --> 02:06:50.730
But these are going to be,
these are out there.
So if you,

1894
02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:56.120
if you want to be represented that way for the rest of your life,

1895
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:02.610
then you gotta be a little bit careful about what you're saying.

1896
02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:07.570
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
um,
cause I,</v>

1897
02:07:07.630 --> 02:07:10.110
I kinda like sweat.
No,
I don't like to swear,

1898
02:07:10.111 --> 02:07:13.050
but I like when people swear and stuff,
I think it's,

1899
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:15.630
but just like how you were saying,
like for example,
Joe Rogan,

1900
02:07:15.631 --> 02:07:18.030
like he'll swear and sometimes they'll swear a lot,
but it's perfect.

1901
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:22.090
It's funny when it needs to be funny.
It emphasizes,
you know,

1902
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:24.780
a certain emotion when it needs to.
It's,
it's perfect.

1903
02:07:24.781 --> 02:07:27.360
And that's kind of the reason why I like it because sometimes it can be really

1904
02:07:27.361 --> 02:07:30.010
funny.
It can be fun to do.
Um,

1905
02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:33.150
but overall there's a certain kind of,

1906
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:36.370
you can't help but kind of respect someone who doesn't like,

1907
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.730
<v 0>okay,</v>

1908
02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:41.690
<v 3>use the word like all the time where that doesn't say I'm all the time or who</v>

1909
02:07:41.691 --> 02:07:45.560
doesn't say you know,
all the time or no I'm saying or whatever.
Um,
and,

1910
02:07:45.710 --> 02:07:47.300
and can can control that.

1911
02:07:47.301 --> 02:07:50.690
And I think swearing is yet another one of those things that some people,

1912
02:07:50.691 --> 02:07:54.140
it's more of a weakness where they kind of,
they didn't know how to use it.

1913
02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:56.990
They just swear it cause they swore,
they knew my parents were.

1914
02:07:56.991 --> 02:08:01.580
So I swear who cares kind of thing.
And on top of that,

1915
02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.560
you do have to consider who you're talking to.

1916
02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:06.380
And in a podcast situation you're essentially talking to everybody regardless of

1917
02:08:06.381 --> 02:08:06.880
the role you,

1918
02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:10.220
you were trying to talk to who you think or want your audience to be.

1919
02:08:10.221 --> 02:08:12.950
It's everyone and anyone who presses the button,
it's going to be listening.

1920
02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:17.210
So if you don't care how you come off and then good,
then that's,
that's great.

1921
02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:21.320
But I think you do have more of a control on how you come off,

1922
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.730
when you can control.
How much you swear,
don't swear.

1923
02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:27.600
<v 0>Well,
I haven't had anybody,
you know,
hit me up on Twitter and say,
hey,</v>

1924
02:08:27.630 --> 02:08:31.500
you really need to swear him in the water.
Right.
It doesn't happen.
No one said,

1925
02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:31.831
hey,

1926
02:08:31.831 --> 02:08:36.690
you need to say Amore or they need to say like more people don't need to hear

1927
02:08:36.691 --> 02:08:40.770
that.
They accept it because it's there.
And I'll tell you a funny,

1928
02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.050
the first time I took my,

1929
02:08:43.051 --> 02:08:47.790
used to take my son out occasionally to various seal training sites,

1930
02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:48.961
you know,

1931
02:08:48.961 --> 02:08:53.961
in order to inoculate him to violence and firearms and machine guns and war

1932
02:08:56.230 --> 02:09:00.840
and uh,
and uh,
yes,
you've all people can all call child services on me.

1933
02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:05.190
Uh,
but it was funny the first time,
you know,

1934
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:10.430
he watched a SQL platoon do some event and I think it was at,

1935
02:09:10.441 --> 02:09:11.274
uh,
at,
uh,

1936
02:09:11.490 --> 02:09:16.490
urban training facility and they got done and I was debriefing them and you

1937
02:09:17.341 --> 02:09:22.260
know,
this is my son who had never heard me swear and who kind of use at that age

1938
02:09:22.261 --> 02:09:26.220
where,
you know,
less swearing ward was like,
worst thing ever.

1939
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:30.510
And He,
you know,
he was standing there and I debrief these guys and I,

1940
02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:36.230
I debrief them in the proper seal technique and I got done.

1941
02:09:36.361 --> 02:09:40.440
He had a look on his face that said,
wow,

1942
02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:44.760
this guy is a little different than what I knew.

1943
02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:49.170
He was pretty shocked and it was a,
he was a pretty funny scenario.

1944
02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:51.780
So you know how you say you don't swear in front of your kids?
Um,

1945
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.670
why is that?

1946
02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:58.720
<v 3>Because you don't want them to swear or were,
and</v>

1947
02:09:58.770 --> 02:10:01.780
<v 0>there is,
you know,
if you ever see a in an,</v>

1948
02:10:01.781 --> 02:10:04.660
I do now that my daughters are a little older,

1949
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:09.780
I'll drop some swear words in them in occasionally for impact or for humor,

1950
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:13.960
you know,
or for whatever.
So,
so I will do it.

1951
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:16.720
But if you ever see a,

1952
02:10:17.190 --> 02:10:20.480
a young girl swearing it,

1953
02:10:20.650 --> 02:10:23.590
you see a young boy,
you know,

1954
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:28.740
it very much seems disrespectful in my opinion.

1955
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:34.350
So I don't want my kids to be running around with a foul mouth.

1956
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:37.873
Now,

1957
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:40.880
I took my son and a couple of his buddies went a little surf trip and they were

1958
02:10:40.881 --> 02:10:43.610
sleeping in a tent outside of,
and I was in the,

1959
02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.640
I was in the camper and I woke up at when I normally wake up and they were what?

1960
02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:52.400
They were up early to go surfing as well,

1961
02:10:52.401 --> 02:10:57.030
but I was standing outside their tent and I was pretty impressed with the wide

1962
02:10:57.090 --> 02:11:01.670
array of foul language that they produced.
And that's kind of the thing too,

1963
02:11:01.671 --> 02:11:05.570
right?
So it doesn't,
if you'd never swear to your kids,

1964
02:11:05.571 --> 02:11:09.040
it's not like you have protected them for swearing.
So that's,

1965
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:13.310
that's my point is that after I stood out there for awhile and I listened to

1966
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:16.580
them and then I said something along the lines of,
Hey,
are you guys done?

1967
02:11:16.581 --> 02:11:19.790
I know you ready to go surfing.
And my son says,

1968
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:24.770
how long have you been out there?
That in?
And I swore back at him,

1969
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:28.490
I swore back at him and said,
I've been out here long.

1970
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.260
And then they kind of remained quiet for a second and then they started
laughing.

1971
02:11:33.261 --> 02:11:37.940
I said,
all right boys,
let's go.
So I'm not a goody two shoes.

1972
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.170
I understand.
And you know,

1973
02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:44.171
we talked about pat and patents SRE incessantly amongst the troops and then when

1974
02:11:44.451 --> 02:11:46.850
he'd get in front of the politicians he would not,

1975
02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:51.680
and I guess I would hope to behave that way.

1976
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:54.690
And I used to do that too.
I used to go there was when we got back from Ramadi,

1977
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.950
I had to go and brief the secretary of the navy.

1978
02:11:57.951 --> 02:12:00.890
I had to go brief the congressional joint caucus.

1979
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:04.640
I mean I had to go and brief some high level governmental officials and whatnot

1980
02:12:04.641 --> 02:12:05.770
and I would just walk in there and not,

1981
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:08.330
well obviously you're not going to swear in front of them.

1982
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:09.680
So I think that's another,

1983
02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:15.610
another situation where you've got to know and understand when to swear in one

1984
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:21.190
when not to swear.
And I just,
hopefully I'm making the right decisions.

1985
02:12:21.191 --> 02:12:23.220
And like I said,
no one has,
uh,

1986
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:28.700
no one has hit me up and said,
you really need to use more foul language.

1987
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:31.520
And you know,
there's times where we've,
you know,

1988
02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:36.260
we've used foul language on the PR on the podcast because hey,

1989
02:12:36.261 --> 02:12:39.890
it's a reality.
It's a reality of Vietnam.

1990
02:12:39.891 --> 02:12:41.510
It's a reality of all wars.

1991
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:47.450
So to exclude it,
like it doesn't exist is not what I'm trying to do here.

1992
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:51.560
And that's kind of a big,
in my opinion,
a big deal.

1993
02:12:51.561 --> 02:12:55.340
When someone you can tell they're,
they're actively pursuing,

1994
02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:58.370
not swearing where in any kind of,

1995
02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.330
especially in casual conversation where they were about to say something.

1996
02:13:02.331 --> 02:13:07.010
And then the um,
then the youth like,
I dunno sugar,
I don't Dunno,

1997
02:13:07.110 --> 02:13:09.780
you know,
those re obvious replacement where it's,

1998
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:13.040
and there's nothing wrong with it,
but it does kind of kind of make you think,

1999
02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:16.490
oh wait,
like we,
so we can't just be ourselves right now.
Like we,
I don't know.

2000
02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:19.070
It feels like you may not feel fake or relate to it.
Yeah.

2001
02:13:19.071 --> 02:13:24.071
You know what's interesting is you've seen full metal jacket and just an amazing

2002
02:13:24.441 --> 02:13:27.830
movie about the Marine Corps and the whole,
the whole,

2003
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:32.190
the whole first 45 minutes is bootcamp and it's played

2004
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.420
<v 2>by Lee.
Ramy ethic is his name and he does.
He was a real jewel instructor.</v>

2005
02:13:36.421 --> 02:13:41.000
And so he just nails it.
And I remember when my son was six or seven years old,

2006
02:13:41.001 --> 02:13:43.970
I go and I thought to myself,
I'll,
I'll play him some of this movie.
We,

2007
02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:47.600
I'll just find some parts that don't have any foul language.
There are no parts.

2008
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:52.440
The whole thing is just completely over the top and it's awesome.

2009
02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:55.200
Um,
so,

2010
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:59.760
so there's definitely a time and a place for it.
And the other thing is,
for me,

2011
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:04.710
honestly,
it's,
it's,
you know,
how was,
I'm always trying to do better at stuff.

2012
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:10.430
There's a challenge be in trying to find words that are going to have impact

2013
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:17.730
without just going right to the easy button on them on the big F bomb cause

2014
02:14:17.731 --> 02:14:20.400
that's going to have impact.
But if that's what you need to use,

2015
02:14:20.401 --> 02:14:24.510
then it's just a little easy out that I don't want to take it every single time

2016
02:14:24.511 --> 02:14:27.240
it presents itself and it'll tell you when I get,

2017
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:32.100
there's been a couple times with my kids where they've stepped over the line or

2018
02:14:32.101 --> 02:14:36.840
there's something out of line and when I,
I went to have sworn at them,

2019
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.980
it was like I slapped him in the face because it was having that much impact.

2020
02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:42.330
Whereas if I was just throwing around all the time,

2021
02:14:42.331 --> 02:14:44.280
it's taken away the impact of,
right,
right.
Yeah.

2022
02:14:44.281 --> 02:14:48.860
So strategically it's strategic swearing patent apparently with,
um,

2023
02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:53.540
from what I read,
he,
when he'd get people fired up,
he'd do that on purpose.
Oh.

2024
02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:56.510
And then like even just in normal conversation,
he didn't really swear that much.

2025
02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.820
That's one of the things.
So he used it as a,
as a specific tool,
you know,

2026
02:14:59.821 --> 02:15:02.500
to get certain things done.
As far as influence goes.
Yeah.

2027
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:05.790
I can't believe we've talked for 10 minutes about swearing.

2028
02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.090
That's what it needed to be talking about.
Hey,
we got to ask the question.

2029
02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:15.330
I think we've got time for one more.
Okay,
last question,

2030
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:16.703
Jocko.

2031
02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:21.770
What techniques do you use to deal with situational stress from battlefield to

2032
02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:26.130
boardroom?
Well,
first of all,

2033
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:30.390
and I don't mean to minimize the stress that people face,

2034
02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:34.730
but imagine a pageant.

2035
02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:37.020
What Eugene Sledge that we talked about tonight.

2036
02:15:37.021 --> 02:15:41.940
Imagine what he went through on Pellalou in the tens of thousands of marines

2037
02:15:44.130 --> 02:15:48.550
that's suffered debt,
unimaginable horror.

2038
02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:54.550
Any imagine Hackworth who we talked about here,

2039
02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.600
who wrote about face assaulting enemy positions in Korea and he was wounded over

2040
02:15:58.601 --> 02:16:03.330
and over again.
All in the line.
It's still went back for more.

2041
02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:09.310
And then you've got Alan Seeger,
the poet

2042
02:16:11.650 --> 02:16:15.700
who in World War One when over the top,

2043
02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:20.990
over and over again to make his rendezvous with death.

2044
02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:26.620
And there's been thousands and hundreds of thousands,

2045
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.560
millions of that have been in very stressful situations and faith,

2046
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:41.100
evil and phase death much worse than the situation

2047
02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:47.260
I'm in.
Or a urine that we might consider stressful.

2048
02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:50.710
And I even did this when I was overseas,
when I was on deployment,

2049
02:16:50.711 --> 02:16:55.300
when I was a combat leader,
I was feeling stress.

2050
02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:59.930
And you know what?
We took casualties and it was awful and it was heartbreaking,

2051
02:17:05.090 --> 02:17:10.090
but there were other soldiers and warriors throughout time that had been in much

2052
02:17:12.411 --> 02:17:13.790
worse situations,

2053
02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:18.050
Gettysburg or Vicksburg or the battle,
the bowl

2054
02:17:20.610 --> 02:17:25.500
and and all those horrible situations.

2055
02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:30.700
They prove really that humans can withstand almost,

2056
02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:34.260
almost unimaginable stress,

2057
02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:39.000
which meant to me that I could too.

2058
02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:43.950
And you can and,

2059
02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:46.410
and the first step for me is doing that,

2060
02:17:46.411 --> 02:17:50.610
taking that look to gain some perspective.

2061
02:17:52.890 --> 02:17:55.650
And then in order to gain perspective,

2062
02:17:55.651 --> 02:17:58.950
you've got to do something that we already talked about.
You've got to detach.

2063
02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:03.000
You've got to detach from the problems or the stress that you're experiencing

2064
02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:07.740
so that you can get that perspective of them.

2065
02:18:09.930 --> 02:18:10.763
Now

2066
02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.890
there's a couple different types of stress.
Now,

2067
02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.700
if it's something that you can control that's causing you stress,

2068
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:23.810
well why aren't you getting control of it?

2069
02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:26.240
Generally it's a lack of discipline.

2070
02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:31.780
So you got to have the discipline to grab control and make it happen.

2071
02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:34.100
And when I say you need discipline for that,

2072
02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:39.050
what that means is these stresses that you're avoiding,

2073
02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:42.080
they're not going to go away.
If you avoid them.

2074
02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:48.050
So take the discipline and to face the stressful situation,
get ahead of it.

2075
02:18:48.051 --> 02:18:49.070
Don't be afraid of it.

2076
02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:55.920
Now there's also stress that's caused by things that you cannot control.

2077
02:18:56.850 --> 02:19:01.850
And if you remember talking earlier about artillery and how horrible that was,

2078
02:19:03.901 --> 02:19:07.070
and what made it so horrible was that there's no control over.

2079
02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.620
So if you can't control something and you can't get control of it,

2080
02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:20.540
you have to at least embrace what you can.

2081
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:23.520
And I'm not saying you're going to embrace artillery shelling,

2082
02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:24.450
but I'll tell you what,

2083
02:19:25.470 --> 02:19:30.470
when it comes to things artillery or for us in Ramadi was iads and we could do

2084
02:19:32.391 --> 02:19:34.940
everything we could do to mitigate that risk.

2085
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:40.070
But eventually there's only so much you can do and you cannot completely

2086
02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:44.750
eliminate it,
but you can't control it.
So why you going to worry about it?

2087
02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:46.730
Why you gonna stress about it?

2088
02:19:48.310 --> 02:19:53.110
If there's something that is completely beyond your control,
you cannot.

2089
02:19:53.111 --> 02:19:56.800
You've got to detach from it and not let yourself get stressed about it.

2090
02:19:58.630 --> 02:20:00.520
And on top of that,

2091
02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:03.900
if it's something that you can't control,

2092
02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:06.030
how can you look at it in a different light?

2093
02:20:06.031 --> 02:20:09.900
How can you see it in a way that you could actually take advantage of it?

2094
02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:13.950
How can you take

2095
02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:20.400
that stress and make it into some kind of ally?
You know,
the,

2096
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:25.170
the chaos of combat is something that I couldn't control,

2097
02:20:25.171 --> 02:20:28.620
but I had to embrace it so I could try and figure out how to take advantage of

2098
02:20:28.621 --> 02:20:32.290
it.
So when it comes to stress,

2099
02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:35.680
don't fight it,

2100
02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:41.790
turn it on itself and use it.
Use it.

2101
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:46.910
Use it to make yourself sharper and more alert and use it to make yourself think

2102
02:20:47.791 --> 02:20:52.791
more and learn more and get better and use that stress

2103
02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:58.710
as a catalyst to make yourself better.

2104
02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:07.000
And I think that's all we've got for tonight.

2105
02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:11.680
So thanks to everybody for tuning in and listening to us.

2106
02:21:13.210 --> 02:21:18.210
Thanks for the feedback through the interwebs to me,

2107
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:23.540
um,
at Jocko Willink and to echo who is at echo,

2108
02:21:23.610 --> 02:21:24.443
Charles,

2109
02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:30.150
thanks for leaving reviews of the podcast and the book on iTunes and on Amazon

2110
02:21:31.391 --> 02:21:35.350
because those are very helpful.
And most of all,

2111
02:21:36.250 --> 02:21:40.300
thanks to everybody for getting out there and getting after it.

2112
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.390
So until next time,
this is Jocko and echo

2113
