This is Jocko podcast number 64 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.880
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.360
Good evening in a country that most people would struggle to find on a map in a

4
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.970
compound that few possess the courage to enter.

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.230
<v 0>Men from my previous life took the fight to our enemy</v>

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.050
in that compound,

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.740
they found men that pray five times a day for your destruction.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.570
<v 0>Those praying men don't know me.</v>

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.870
They don't know you and they don't know America.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.820
<v 1>Okay?</v>

13
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 0>They don't understand our compassion,
our freedoms,</v>

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.850
and our tolerance.

15
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.380
I know it may seem as if some of those things are currently missing,

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
but they remain at our core and always will.

17
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.940
Our capacity for them is boundless and is only dwarfed by the hatred in those

18
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.420
men hiding in that compound,

19
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.180
the hatred they have for you.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.030
Those men don't care about your religious beliefs.

21
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.850
They don't care about your political opinions.

22
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.680
They don't care if you sit on the left or the right liberal or Conservative,

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.080
pacifist or warrior.

24
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.890
They don't care how much you believe in diversity,
equality,

25
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.090
or freedom of speech.
They don't care.

26
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.713
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
You have never smelled the breath of a man who wants to kill you.

28
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.880
I'm sorry.
You've never felt the alarm bells ringing in your body.

29
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The combination of fear and adrenaline as you move towards the fight instead of

30
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:14.100
running from it.
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.720
You've never heard someone cry out for help or cried out for help yourself.

32
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.370
Relying on the courage of others to bring you home.

33
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm sorry.
You've never tasted the salt from your own tears.

34
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.870
As you stand at flag draped coffins bearing men,

35
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.000
you were humbled to call your friends.

36
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
I don't wish those experiences on you,

37
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.453
<v 1>but</v>

38
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.170
<v 0>I do wish you had them.</v>

39
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If you had them,
it would change the way you act.

40
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.340
It would change the way you value it would change the way you appreciate it.

41
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.903
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.020
<v 0>you would become quick to open your eyes and slowed open your mouth.</v>

43
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.760
Most will never understand the sacrifice required to keep evil men like those

44
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:20.060
from that distant compound away from our doorstep.

45
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.410
<v 1>Okay,</v>

46
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.050
<v 0>but it would not hurt you to try and understand.</v>

47
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.240
It would not hurt you to take a moment to respect the sacrifices that others

48
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:34.710
make on your behalf.
Whether they share your opinions or not.

49
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.240
You're would not hurt you.

50
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:43.740
To take a moment to think of the relentless drain on family,

51
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.540
friends,
and loved ones that are left behind sometimes for weeks,

52
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.440
sometimes for months,
sometimes for years.

53
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.100
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.350
<v 0>sometimes forever.</v>

55
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.510
<v 0>Ideas are not protected by words.</v>

57
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Paper and ink may outline the foundation and principles of this nation,

58
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.040
but it is blood only blood

59
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.990
that protects it.

60
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.500
Dusty compound a man you have never met,

61
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.220
gave everything he had so that you have the freedom to think,

62
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.160
speak,
and act however you choose.

63
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.553
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.700
<v 0>he went there for all of us.</v>

65
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.540
Whether you loved or hated what he stood for.

66
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.460
<v 0>He went there to preserve the opportunity and privilege to believe,</v>

68
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.550
to be and to become what we want.

69
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.133
This country,

70
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.430
every single person living inside of its borders and under the banner of its

71
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.130
flag.
Oh that man,

72
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.190
we owe that man everything we owe him,

73
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:17.160
the respect that his sacrifice deserves

74
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.170
same.
Thank you is not enough.

75
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.640
We send our best and lose them in the fight against the worst evil this world

76
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:32.950
has to offer.

77
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.110
If you want to respect and honor their sacrifice,

78
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.440
it needs to be more than words.
You have to live it.

79
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.630
Take a minute and look around,
soak it in,

80
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.030
all of it.
The good,
the bad,
and the ugly.

81
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.790
You have the choice every day as to which category you want to be in,

82
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.130
in which direction you want to move.

83
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.580
You have that choice because the best among us,

84
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.910
the best we ever had to offer,

85
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.350
fought and bled and died for it.

86
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.880
Don't ever forget that.

87
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

88
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.133
<v 0>Now</v>

89
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.850
those words were any piece that was called a debt that cannot be repaid.

90
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.693
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

91
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.860
<v 0>which was written by a fellow CEO</v>

92
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.310
and a friend of mine named Andy Stumpf.

93
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.090
When he heard that we had lost another frog bear

94
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
chief Ryan Owens during a daring raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen.

95
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.890
<v 0>Man,
it was a very fitting tribute,</v>

97
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.450
another fitting tribute,

98
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.810
yet another fitting tribute to yet another great warrior who sacrificed

99
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.870
everything
for us.

100
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.250
One of the hardest truth is,
is that I know,

101
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.620
we know

102
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.610
that this will not be the last great warrior to fall.

103
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.560
And those warriors still on the wine close ranks to fill the void left by the

104
00:08:09.601 --> 00:08:10.434
fallen

105
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.910
and they continue to march forward

106
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.190
into the dark and into the dust looking for and hunting for evil.

107
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.490
And those warriors,

108
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.290
regardless of what they come up against,

109
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.510
they will not stop.

110
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.903
And this evening,

111
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.230
while that punked continues,
while evil lurks out there in the world,

112
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.830
I am lucky enough to have one of the good guys here with me,

113
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.070
the man that wrote those powerful words and that powerful tribute as I said,

114
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.770
a friend and a former seal teammate of mine and he stomps Andy Stumpf.

115
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.670
Welcome to the show brother.
Thanks for having me man.
There was,
um,

116
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.000
that was a gradable piece,
man really was and a fateful rightness.

117
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.210
I think a,
they got around and I hope more people get to hear it now and,

118
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.410
and spread it and share it about that.
You know,
another,

119
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.740
another brave warrior down.

120
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.050
<v 2>Yeah.
It,
uh,
like we were going back and forth over text.</v>

121
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.270
I think took off like wildfire.

122
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.300
I was eating breakfast with my sons and had received the news from buddy before

123
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:58.800
it had broken on a mainstream media in.

124
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.090
It was just one of those moments where I couldn't get the thoughts out of my

125
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:04.980
head.
So I cracked open my laptop,

126
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.060
literally took one stab at that one pass and just hit the post button and walked

127
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:13.860
away.
Came back four or five hours later and my phone was just exploding.

128
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.560
And uh,
yeah,
I mean it,

129
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.090
it was Cathartic for me to write it and I do hope that more people can

130
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:25.230
understand the message and take just two seconds out of their day to realize

131
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:28.620
what's happening all around them,
all around the world at any given time.

132
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.000
<v 0>And He'd given time.
It's happening.
Yup.
The sacrifices are there and it's,</v>

133
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.960
you know,
speaking of social media,
it's been a lot of people been requesting.

134
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.220
<v 3>We've been asking,
do you know Andy Stone at Andy Stumpf?
Do you know Jocko?</v>

135
00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:44.110
So yes,
we do know each other.

136
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.990
That is confirmed and they've been asking you to come on the podcast.

137
00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:49.180
So thanks for coming on.
Man.
I know,
I know.

138
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:52.450
We haven't really seen a bunch of each other in the last few years.

139
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.390
It's been like five years.
That's ridiculous.

140
00:10:55.391 --> 00:10:59.020
And for all those people have been asking,
you can stop now.
The answer is yes.

141
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.380
I know Jocko.
We've known each other for a while and here we are.
Stop.

142
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.060
We're good to go.
Yeah.
But I really appreciate you coming on.
So,
um,

143
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.790
let's get into it,
man.
Let's talk about,
let's talk about you.

144
00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:12.070
You don't give us your basic background,
you know,

145
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.570
tell us about growing up in Santa Cruz wants up Santa Cruz.
Man,

146
00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:18.190
what a great place to grow up.
I mean,

147
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:23.191
Santa Cruz is amazing with an asterix and that asterix is whether or not at some

148
00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:27.190
point in time in your life you leave Santa Cruz because it's a bubble.

149
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.020
But for me it was awesome.
I have family roots there from not only my father,

150
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.630
but my grandfather.
They had one of the first construction companies.

151
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:38.110
They're built,
the high school that my father attended,

152
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.160
a built a lot of the infrastructure,
uh,

153
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.320
and also had a lot of ties to like law enforcement and firefighters,

154
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:47.050
which would help me out when I would get rides home,
when I would get in trouble,

155
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.000
you know,
advantages that other people didn't have.
But I mean,
I consider my,

156
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.070
I mean background is

157
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.860
<v 2>very generic.
I mean,
I played water polo and baseball in high school.</v>

158
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.440
I'd give myself a C as far as being an athlete,

159
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:06.970
like very average junior lifeguards,
so comfortable,
uh,
in and around the ocean,

160
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:10.030
which was a skill that obviously paid off in training.
You can surf.

161
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.170
Did you surf in Santa Cruz?

162
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.320
I did serve quite a bit and I'm sure you've served up there as you know,

163
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:18.220
is extremely territorial.
Uh,
good waves.
It's good ways,

164
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.040
but like when you're 150 pounds,
you know,
and you're 17,

165
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:25.240
18 years old and just really wasn't into,
uh,
you know,
fighting for waves.

166
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.090
So at surf a little bit,
a little longboard stuff down by cows,

167
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.530
maybe steamers if it wasn't huge and it just played sports.
Yeah,

168
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.530
I mean it was super casual work for my dad's construction company.

169
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.290
Santa Cruz has a dichotomy to in it,
in the fact that,

170
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.190
especially when you were growing up,
there was mad like,
okay,

171
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:43.210
there's that basically,

172
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.860
I don't know if you want to call it the haves and have nots,

173
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:47.410
but we're not talking about money.
We're talking about like massive drug use,

174
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:50.440
right.
Still exists to this day.
Uh,
and it's,

175
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.380
it's like an undercurrent that not a lot of people know about Santa Cruz.

176
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.540
Most of the people who live in Santa Cruz don't work there.

177
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.320
The money all comes from the Silicon Valley.
They go over the highway 17.
I mean,

178
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:03.310
the,
the median cost of homes in Santa Cruz I think is near $800,000,

179
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:07.090
which is crazy because the city was kind of built around Uc Santa Cruz.
I mean,

180
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:08.920
it's a college,
I mean,
he was going to afford that stuff.

181
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.070
But in the surfing scene,
I mean,
that's where a lot of the drug,

182
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.911
from my understanding,

183
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:16.360
that's where a lot of the drug stuff started and then it just pushed itself out.

184
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:20.370
It still exists.
It's really bad.
It can be,
it can be a rides.
You,

185
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:23.860
you'd think Santa Cruz is nice beach town,
but it can be a rough town.
I mean,

186
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.050
you make a wrong turn and you're going to be in trouble.

187
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.900
But at the same can be true here of San Diego or anywhere you may want to go.

188
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.880
So when did you hear about when you hear about the teams decide you're going to

189
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:38.650
get it off?
Yeah.
You know,
uh,
so I come from a military family.

190
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.830
My grandfather was in the navy,
my father was in the navy.

191
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:45.730
He was a twin 50 cal gunner on the mark ones in Vietnam.

192
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.760
The first squadron,
a patrol boats with the Jacuzzi jets.

193
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.850
What she said had a failure rate of about 90%.
That had to be fun.

194
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.660
And of course they didn't fail at the time that you would want them to pulling

195
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:58.630
away from the dock while yeah,
no,
just as the middle of a firefight,
you know,

196
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.430
a complex ambush that you're trying to get out of.
Uh,
so you can,
I mean,

197
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.010
I don't think I actually,
I know for a fact my father proud work with seals.

198
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.840
That's,
yeah,
that sounds good too.
That's how I heard about it.
Um,

199
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.430
my father probably didn't want me to join the military.
I mean,
I,

200
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.310
I don't want my son's necessarily to,
however,
I would never stand in their way,

201
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:21.340
just like my father allowed me to pursue what I wanted to do.

202
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.740
But I started working for him when I was 11 and learn some of the best lessons

203
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:30.741
in my life with bricks in my hands because he was a mason and I basically moved

204
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.730
to bricks for a long time.
Uh,

205
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.730
but it was hard work and it paid off later in life.

206
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.760
And I remember we were driving back from a job when I was 11 and he mentioned

207
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.300
seals and with no understanding of what they are,

208
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.510
just his description of what they did,
how they he was,
it was like,
you know,

209
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.490
they were in the water,
they would get them the boats,
they drop them off.

210
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.780
It was intriguing to me.

211
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.550
So it led me to trying to search for as much information as I could find out

212
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.260
about them.
And in the early nineties,
the Internet was not what it was today.

213
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:07.040
So of course I found the book that almost every team guys read the men with

214
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:11.690
green faces all about Vietnam.
But it's an awesome book.

215
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.250
So I read that and then unfortunately stumbled across the rogue warrior series,

216
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.170
which as I was saying before we started,

217
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:20.330
I made the mistake of thinking that it was a nonfiction

218
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.633
<v 3>work.</v>

219
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.340
<v 2>Didn't find out until a little bit later that that was incorrect.</v>

220
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.620
But I was hooked from that moment on.

221
00:15:28.621 --> 00:15:32.550
It was every piece of information that I could find.
It's all I wanted to do.

222
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.560
It was like a magnetizing force.
Uh,
I don't have the vocabulary to describe it.

223
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.580
People who don't come from our worlds,
it's very uncommon for them to hear that.

224
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:42.660
But you know,
as well as I do,

225
00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:46.800
the seal teams is full of people with the same narrative.
Oh yeah.

226
00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:50.010
I've just always wanted to do this.
It was a calling.
Uh,
but yeah,

227
00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:55.011
I mean the idea was sparked from my dad and I was 17 still in high school at

228
00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:56.761
junior in high school.

229
00:15:56.761 --> 00:15:59.490
And I went to the navy recruiter and brought the navy recruiter home cause it's

230
00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:04.110
my parents had to sign for me and I had my mom who was an Army Brat and my dad,

231
00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:05.100
who was like I said,

232
00:16:05.101 --> 00:16:09.900
served in Vietnam and I'm sure that they were not extremely excited,

233
00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:10.890
but they both signed for me.

234
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.160
So I enlisted actually when I was a junior in high school and the left just a

235
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.880
few days after high school graduation.
That's so legit.
Yeah,
it was awesome.

236
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.490
And that it's not,
I look back now,
I'm like,
why did I do that?

237
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.280
Why did I enlisted your early,
all I did was give a recruiter,

238
00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:26.970
I filled their quota for the month.
I couldn't lead us.
Like,
yeah,

239
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:29.130
you've got to still got to wait till I turned 18 and graduate.

240
00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:32.640
But I mean the recruiter was happy.
But I mean I,
I never took the sats.

241
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.630
I had no plan B.
It's what I knew I wanted to do.
And I,

242
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.170
I never even considered,

243
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.880
I enlisted August 1st of [inaudible] 96.
Okay,

244
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.870
<v 3>awesome.
Yep.
And so then you show up with buds,</v>

245
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.850
showed up for Buds January of [inaudible] 97 and get some winter.

246
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.750
Where still were you still 17?
I was 18.
Yeah.

247
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.630
I got some custom winter class action on

248
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.570
and from Santa Cruz there was not that straight.
Yeah.

249
00:17:00.571 --> 00:17:04.040
I never really laid in the ocean for extended periods of time without a wetsuit.

250
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.520
Uh,
but you know what,

251
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.950
even the training was everything that I thought it was going to be.
I mean,

252
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:10.940
I was happy to be there

253
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.640
<v 2>and it hurt every single day and it was extremely hard.
Um,</v>

254
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.330
but God,
I'd pay money.
I'd give you every penny I have right now to go back.

255
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.950
If I could turn back the clock right now,

256
00:17:20.951 --> 00:17:24.130
I would make exactly the same choices up until that point in my life.

257
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.110
Maybe they would change it a little bit later on,

258
00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:27.740
but until that point we're still going down the same.

259
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.390
<v 3>Yeah.
I had,
somebody asked me that the other day,
some kid,</v>

260
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.970
I was talking to some school kids and one of them said,
you know,

261
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.910
what can I do to get ready for seal training?
I was like,
man,

262
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:41.430
seal training is awesome.
You get paid,
you work out,

263
00:17:41.431 --> 00:17:43.350
you literally work out all day long.

264
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.860
They feed you three if not four meals a day of all you can eat,

265
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.450
just get after it.
It's,
it's awesome man.
It's so fun with aggressive,

266
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.920
a type motivated,

267
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:57.540
largely personalities surrounding gill gets better as the obviously the days and

268
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:00.300
weeks go on and training some of the people who shouldn't be there weeded out.

269
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.370
But yeah,
he,
and then even the teams,
it's like,
it's,
it,

270
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.380
it can be everything that you want it to be.
Yeah.
So you show up,
you,

271
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.390
so you get done,
you show up at the teams,
your new guy.

272
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.740
How's that new guy experience?
Man?
Uh,

273
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.440
I don't know the statute of limitations on some of the things that were done to

274
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:20.160
me,
but uh,
I mean again,
but it was,
it was awesome.

275
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.660
I was surrounded by my heroes.
I didn't know anything about anything.
Uh,

276
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.920
I didn't realize that at the time.
Uh,
but I mean your head cause what?

277
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.220
Cause in our heads we know everything about everything.

278
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.540
I in to buzz and airborne school at Fort Benning,

279
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.770
I am the most highly polished soldier in the world.

280
00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.900
You just Fyi for those people that don't understand when you get done with buds

281
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.880
and airborne school,
you know nothing,
you know nothing,
you know,

282
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:51.820
nothing tactical,
you know nothing.
And it's pretty ridiculous that,

283
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.980
that it's got the call people call buds at school and I it's,

284
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.410
and again you got to air quote that cause you don't,
you don't know how to be a,

285
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.170
that's another one I get all the time.
You don't,

286
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.730
you're not a seal at the end of buds.

287
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.570
I always tell people it stands for basic underwater demolition seal with the

288
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:07.530
emphasis on the beat.

289
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.730
It's basic and you can run and do pull ups and you looked great with shorts on

290
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:15.930
at the beach.
I mean,
but you don't know anything.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,

291
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.860
I mean I checked in,
uh,
you know,
pre nine 11 although they are better now.
I just,

292
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:22.080
I have to say that forced they're way better now.

293
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:26.010
I was talking to some guys that recent graduates that are now in the pipeline,

294
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.320
they're getting trained and I told him,
I said,

295
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.700
you guys are getting trained infinitely better than what we got.

296
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.080
Infinitely better now.

297
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.190
It has to do with the timeframe that you and I came in the 90s there was no,

298
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.950
there was few,
very few Vietnam veterans left.

299
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.370
You milk what you could out of them but you weren't going to get like now every

300
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.380
single guy that's teaching every single bloods instructor,

301
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:49.530
all combat veterans that have experienced.
So it's,
it's a different game now.

302
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:50.000
They've,

303
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.370
and I figured we were taught infinitely better than the people before us.

304
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:56.430
I'm glad to see that that cycle repeats itself and then it's just a matter of

305
00:19:56.431 --> 00:19:58.680
technology and understanding and a,

306
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:00.360
I mean they've changed the pipeline a little bit.

307
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.770
Especially what happens after Bud's.
Yeah.

308
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.830
Cause I went to team five then we did our own tried and board and we did our own

309
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.114
trading.

310
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.700
And then you could talk to the guys like down at team three they're like,

311
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:15.870
oh yeah,
we didn't do any of that
philosophy.
It just means I'm better than,

312
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.610
you know.
But yeah,
there's no competitive nature of the teams at all.

313
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.590
But I mean it was,

314
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.820
I mean I looked at these guys who had been in seals for like five,
six,
seven,

315
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:29.880
eight years or there was like a Vietnam vet walking around.
Like you're just,

316
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:33.680
I just wanted to breathe the same air as those people.
And I mean,
it's a,

317
00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.820
you realize incredibly fast that you don't know anything and you realize that

318
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:43.250
because you get taped up for your mistakes
because you're,

319
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:46.340
you're reinforced every time that you make a mistake.
And he's just like,

320
00:20:46.341 --> 00:20:48.100
I couldn't do anything right for

321
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.680
<v 2>like years,
because I didn't know anything the biggest,</v>

322
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.810
if we had been fighting an enemy,

323
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:55.240
I would have been more of a danger to the people that I was with.

324
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.370
And then the enemy that we were fighting.
It just,

325
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.090
I mean I tell people it takes five to seven years to even understand what it

326
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:04.930
really means to be a seal.
And then probably at the 10 year mark,

327
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.630
you're at the top of the bell curve as far as what you're going to be able to do

328
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:12.490
operationally.
But still,
I mean I was in heaven,
I was in my,
I was,

329
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.960
I wasn't even 21 yet.
Living in an apartment in core natto riding a bike

330
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.030
well until I got paid.
Yeah.
That would be the poorest guy.
Two days after that.

331
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.000
<v 4>It is like for most guys that coming out of high school,</v>

332
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.090
because when you're in high school,
you know,

333
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.220
even if you're working at Wendy's like I did,
you know,

334
00:21:32.221 --> 00:21:36.360
you're only making whatever for 25 an hour and that amount.
So you know,
whatever,

335
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.310
you know you're going to get like 80 bucks every two weeks and you,

336
00:21:40.311 --> 00:21:44.580
you show up in the teams and all of a sudden they're giving you real legit
money.

337
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.560
You're filling your pocket of every two weeks.

338
00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:50.160
You are the richest kid in the world,

339
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.890
not a fear new guy.
Cause you're paying for everything.

340
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.860
You buy some beers,

341
00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.040
<v 2>beer.
So learn a lot of stuff in bars,
over beers and learned a lot of,</v>

342
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.210
I mean you listen to a lot of history.
Uh,
you learn a lot about yourself.

343
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.050
You learn when you should keep your mouth shut cause it gets shut for you.

344
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.950
I've been taped up in a bar,
maybe

345
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.170
<v 4>the uh,
the uh,
the hazing was pretty good.</v>

346
00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:19.700
And the teams back then reinforcement less than before so you can get a couple

347
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:21.410
of deployments,
a couple deployments,

348
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:26.500
<v 2>nine,
11 deployments.
Uh,
and you know,
again,
the life is a new guys.
Amazing.</v>

349
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:30.070
Like here's a rifle,
it's yours.
And then my first,
uh,
department,

350
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:32.200
I worked in with us as secondary calm guy.

351
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.170
So I think I had like a PRC 77

352
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.470
with like rotary,
you know,
rotary dials and whip antenna.

353
00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:43.840
I hadn't even been to comm school,
but it's like this is my stuff.
And I got,

354
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:44.441
remember going,

355
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:48.640
getting issued my first set of gear that I look back at it now and it's like I

356
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:51.100
couldn't sell it if I want it to.
So antiquated.

357
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:55.570
But I was so happy to be where I was and we,
you know,

358
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:58.030
he'd trained for 18 months and we'd deploy first six,

359
00:22:58.031 --> 00:22:59.980
but my first deployment was to Japan,

360
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.250
to the Kadena Air Force base and we experimented with how much we could drink

361
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:09.940
and how much we could work out.
Like which ratio is best 80,
20,
70,
30,

362
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.190
and we'd go train our partner forces.
But I mean we just,
I mean we lived life,

363
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:19.300
heart,
it was exactly the Brotherhood that I thought it was.
B,

364
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:22.570
I was surrounded by my best friends.
We all had the same drive.

365
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.810
You could have told us to go build sand castles.

366
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:28.720
We would have had the best sand castles in the world because we just go and go

367
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:32.890
and go and go until we get it right surrounded by likeminded,
motivated people.

368
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.383
Come back.

369
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.560
There's another 18 month workup is like a kind of new guy.

370
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.270
One platoon wonder if you will,
if you will.
Again,
you know,

371
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:48.220
about 20%,
but you think you know about 80,
the ratio is just a skew.
Uh,

372
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.430
went through the whole workup again and then deployed to Guam for six months.

373
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.890
And then at the same time we'd go to Australia for a bit.

374
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:57.990
We train with the partner forces there.
We'd go to the Thailand's,

375
00:23:57.991 --> 00:24:01.310
we'd go to Philippines and then we'd go back and we'd just train and talk about

376
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:05.060
how awesome we were going to be when the big mish,
remember the Golden Conex box,

377
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.840
big mission,
the gold car.

378
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.540
<v 4>Leif and I have talked about that.
You know,
back in the day,
pre,</v>

379
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.820
especially pre nine,
11,

380
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.290
we were all preparing for the one big mission that was going to go down the big

381
00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:19.900
mish.
And you know how,

382
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.730
and what was interesting is because we didn't have any combat experience,

383
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.170
at least from my perspective,

384
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.820
we trained freaking hard because we thought like it was going to be even a

385
00:24:30.821 --> 00:24:33.350
harder than anything we could imagine.
We don't know how hard it's gonna be.

386
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:34.390
So we're just going to be like,

387
00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:36.910
it's not sandcastles cause we would have prepared for that hard too.

388
00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:38.530
But it's real.
This is what we're prepared for.

389
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:43.531
So we trained as hard as we possibly could in every area in every arena to be

390
00:24:44.411 --> 00:24:47.170
ready for whatever was going to come,
which we had no idea.

391
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.420
I don't know if I've talked about this before,

392
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:53.380
but we finally got my first deployment,
my first deployment deployed to Guam.

393
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.070
When I'm ready for the big Mesh Bro.
Totally.
Um,
I'm ready.
It's going down from,

394
00:24:57.071 --> 00:25:01.900
we get there,
we get there and we have,
you know,

395
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:05.950
we get issued beepers so you know it's real now cause you're getting issued

396
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:07.480
beepers cause this back in the day.

397
00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:09.820
Then we'll go what had beepers back then unless you,

398
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.890
unless some shit was going to go down.

399
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.180
So they give us the beepers and we're like ready to rock and roll.
And finally,

400
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:20.080
actually I was surfing and I come in and someone's waving one of my buddies

401
00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:23.950
waving him on the beach and like,
hey I run up.
What's going on?
Hey we got a page.

402
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.270
Should we get the that we have an agent,

403
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.180
we know we get the nine one one page on get to,

404
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.730
but we'd get a call asked to base,
we get there.
We get in,

405
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.830
the LPO is sitting there.
I look at his face and I go,
this doesn't look,

406
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.720
this doesn't look like the kind of face I anticipated seeing right now.

407
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.930
And I've been in Guam,
this is my first appointment.
I'm two days into Guam.

408
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.030
So I think,
man,
this is exactly like where you're,

409
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:50.980
you're saying that's going to be like,
of course man,
I just got on the boy man,

410
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.880
it's going down.
So Nokia President knows that I'm on deployment.
He's already,

411
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.310
yeah,
we're going to action that target.

412
00:25:57.311 --> 00:26:00.340
So what I failed to mention was that we were like our second or third day and

413
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:02.200
Guam the first day in Guam that we were there.

414
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:03.550
We went and cited it in our weapons.

415
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:08.920
So we got to recall emergency recall nine one one go back into base.

416
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.940
Guess what we didn't do,
we didn't clean up our brass,
so I'm not kidding.

417
00:26:12.941 --> 00:26:16.540
We went and cleaned up our brass they made and they recalled us emergency recall

418
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:20.440
the go cleaning up our brass on the rage.
After that big,

419
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.450
the beers got cracked open and it went sideways real quick for the rest of that

420
00:26:25.451 --> 00:26:26.284
deployment.
But

421
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.450
<v 2>isn't it amazing what used to constitute</v>

422
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.960
<v 4>in an emergency?
That was a,</v>

423
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:36.470
that was a rough one,
man.
So you end up,

424
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.390
so those are a couple of pre nine,
11 different.

425
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:41.810
Where were you when September 11th happened?

426
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.240
<v 2>Uh,
it was a station,
it's a team five still.</v>

427
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:49.410
And I was living in the Archstone apartments right by Ikea in mission valley.

428
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.520
Watch the second one go in live the,
I remember it,
uh,

429
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.660
it was living with a buddy and uh,
my wife,
we'd been married for

430
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.820
six months and watched the second one go in line.

431
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.070
<v 4>Wasn't you knew immediately?
Did you know it does,</v>

432
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:07.640
you think rethinking on the first one,
because I wasn't the first one.

433
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.960
<v 2>I'm going live,
I turn it on just in time to see the second one.
I,</v>

434
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.610
but I think I caught most people like the first one,
they're like,
oh wow,

435
00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:17.180
that pilots probably in trouble.
We're going to be a lawsuit on that one.

436
00:27:17.181 --> 00:27:20.750
And then the second one,
there was no doubt whatsoever.
And I didn't know,

437
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.130
I mean looking back,

438
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.390
I didn't have the mental capacity to understand the difference that it would

439
00:27:26.391 --> 00:27:29.480
have in my life,
but I knew that something was going to be different.
I mean,

440
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.200
I think I realized that we were passing from the conceptual phase to the

441
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:37.220
practical phase of what we had trained to do for a really long period of time.

442
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.080
<v 4>You know,
who didn't know that.
So the deed,</v>

443
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:42.010
the officer to exotic going to college at the time.

444
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.120
And I called the officer detail or who was a friend of mine who I knew who I'd

445
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:49.570
worked for,
who is an outstanding guy.
And I called him up and I was like,
Hey sir,

446
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.040
I'm in college.
Get me out of college,
I'll finish online.
I'll do something.

447
00:27:54.041 --> 00:27:58.810
Just get me out of here.
Send me to a team immediately,
please,
please.
And He,

448
00:27:58.811 --> 00:28:02.020
and he says to me,
Jocko,
don't worry,

449
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:06.190
this war is going to last a long,
long time.
And of course I didn't believe him,

450
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.420
but damn,
was he right?

451
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.980
<v 2>He was.
But I mean,
I can only imagine being in your shoes.
I would have been like,</v>

452
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:15.030
I don't really care.
This is what my calling in life is to be.
I don't,

453
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:17.850
I don't care if I'm in line to get the Nobel prize for something.

454
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:20.770
Like we'll just put that on the shelf and I'll come back and get it Nobel,

455
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.090
what is a war going on?
And

456
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.880
<v 4>so you get done with that and then shortly thereafter you ship out to the east</v>

457
00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:29.530
coast,
right?

458
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.960
<v 2>Yup.
Go out to the east coast and uh,</v>

459
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.640
did the vast majority of my combat deployments out there.
Uh,

460
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:42.550
and while,
I mean,
what an eye opening experience,
you know it from,
like I said,

461
00:28:42.551 --> 00:28:47.551
going from conceptual shooting paper targets and training heart and realistic

462
00:28:48.191 --> 00:28:52.750
to,
to being on a two way range for the first time.
I mean,

463
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:58.320
uh,
the,
the first target I ever was on a,

464
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.660
I think my helicopter had 27 rounds in it and the door gunner got shot in the

465
00:29:01.661 --> 00:29:05.230
face right in front of me and I'm in mob level four.

466
00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.790
<v 4>Yeah.
For those of that don't know it back.
And what that is.
That's,</v>

467
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.980
that's the chemical,
biological and radiate,

468
00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:14.560
radiological suit protection that you wear.

469
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.420
And highest level four is you're wearing your mask,
you're wearing everything.

470
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.110
So it's,
it's a horrible,
uncomfortable,

471
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.780
miserable thing to do.
And

472
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.940
<v 2>we had a four hour 47 flight on the way to the objective and 30 minutes out we</v>

473
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.680
got all of our stuff on to include our gas masks

474
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.730
<v 4>or the,
I was going to say if you had the blowers,
that does make it a lot nicer.</v>

475
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.300
She puts your weapons strap over the hose.

476
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.960
<v 2>No,
I could go on for days about mistakes I've made in my life.
Uh,
so yeah,</v>

477
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:50.080
it was skip breathing and occasionally the glass would touch my eyeball,

478
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.880
couldn't breathe.
But I mean this,

479
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.490
this is my first real target ever and it's,
uh,

480
00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.400
we're hitting the number one chem bio target in Iraq.
Uh,

481
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:04.510
right after the war kicked off and I was on the third 47,

482
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:07.450
they came in and they blew the power grid.
Uh,

483
00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:11.140
but a tend to strike before we landed.
And then they landed,

484
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.500
the helicopter is in between the fireball and the city.
So we were back lit.

485
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.510
So each subsequent helicopter that came in a took more rounds and by the time

486
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:21.880
ours came in he started taking rounds.
Is it about a minute out?

487
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.390
I didn't even know what they were.
I'm just sitting there looking through straws,

488
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.450
you know,
through my gas mass,
through my night vision goggles,

489
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.410
suffocating myself cause my weapons strap is over the hose.

490
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.630
It's supposed to be giving me the air.
Uh,
and you know,

491
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.040
there was some sparks,
nobody,
nobody heard on the bird,

492
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.540
not a single one of our guys shot.

493
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.610
And then right before we touched down the door,
gunner just falls over.
And then,

494
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:44.741
you know,

495
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:49.741
the top of his head kind of came off and tie my tie my jacket around his head

496
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:54.280
and it just took off and away we went on our first combat operation.

497
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:57.820
But the whole thing was just surreal.
And that,
that leap,

498
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.870
I didn't realize how surreal was until the next morning when I woke up and I was

499
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:05.230
like,
man I hope this is survivable.

500
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.150
Cause that was just one of many in the target deck and it continued for months

501
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.720
and then a years and you know,
two decades now.
Yeah.
And it was,

502
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.410
and it took me a little bit of time to get up and running to be,

503
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.380
to be comfortable in that environment.
But I,

504
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.740
I developed a level of comfort in that environment.

505
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:30.130
And if I'm being totally honest,
I mean I loved it.

506
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.330
I loved it.
It was,

507
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.960
I mean I understand that it's high consequence and that it's high risk and that

508
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:41.260
there's,
there's matters of life and death and decisions that are being made,

509
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:45.250
but that's where I want to be.
I mean that,
I was like,
yes,

510
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.410
this is what I came to do to fight for the values that I believe in and to fight

511
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:54.970
for people who can't fight for themselves.
And uh,
yeah,
it was awesome.
Loved it.

512
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.210
<v 4>It's interesting how you talk about that,
um,</v>

513
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.950
transition from like form training,
which is what we all lived.

514
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.120
There's very few people that,

515
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.910
this is another thing that it's hard for people to understand about,

516
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.070
especially about the early days of the seawall.

517
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.550
For us in the early days of the seal teams is there was so few people that

518
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:16.510
actually had combat experience and that going all the way up to the leadership.

519
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:19.830
A lot of leadership had no combat experience and so for us,

520
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.650
all of a sudden in a very quick learning curve,
you,
you know,

521
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:25.210
you spend two weeks on deployment,

522
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.430
you had more combat experience then and you know,

523
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:29.950
than anybody else in the seal teams at that time.
You know,

524
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:32.230
other than the guys that were deployed right before you,
but you had to,

525
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.190
that's how quick the learning curve was and things were changing.
I mean,

526
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:37.090
look at what we trained.

527
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.660
We were doing Otb and exhaustion Draeger dives and I'm doing river and stream

528
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:45.980
crossing at Niland Bro,
I'm not kidding.
Before my first deployment to Iraq,

529
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.230
I took my seal platoon,

530
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.210
we went on board of an amphibious landing ship in San Diego and when,

531
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:53.991
and no kidding,

532
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:58.970
did lead line and slate beach reconnaissance at Camp Pendleton.

533
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.270
That was,
that was less than movies.

534
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.340
It might have been a month and a half before deploying to Iraq to do operations.

535
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.403
That's how,
that's,
that's,

536
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.580
that's the lag time in the big bureaucratic machine in the military.
Hey,

537
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.620
you know,
we've got this big a fleet exercise.

538
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:15.440
You guys are gonna go participate in one of,
one of our,

539
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.970
one of my guys in that platoon,
I come down and go,
hey,

540
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.990
breakout your lead line and states.
So again,
for those of you that don't know,

541
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.810
there's the,

542
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:29.250
a very prehistoric type operation that was excellent descriptor.

543
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.190
It's war.
They came from World War II.
It came after the battle of,
Whoa,

544
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.180
at the battle of Tarawa,

545
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.440
the marines went in and as they went into the beaches and they're landing craft,

546
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:44.390
they hit reef and the,
they open the gates of the,
of the,
uh,

547
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.870
landing craft.
The Marines got out and unfortunately the reef ended.

548
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.260
And so he's got these marines went out and they went into,
you know,
10,
12,

549
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:55.730
15 feet of water instead of two feet of water.
And many,
many marines were draft.

550
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:59.690
The gear there was not buoyant.
So it was not designed for swimming.
It was,

551
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.190
it was meant for beach landing,
not for a swim.
And anyways,

552
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.010
that was kind of the one of the precursors to the UDTs.
And,
and what,

553
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:11.570
so what are our predecessors used to do is go in with a lead line,

554
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:14.180
which is a piece of string with a lead on the bottom of it.

555
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.800
And it's got little marks on it called buntings little marks on it that tell you

556
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:19.940
how deep it is.

557
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.450
And you go in as a big team and you drop these lead lines and you figured out

558
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:27.110
how deeply you and your slate is a piece of plexiglass that's been sanded down

559
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:30.530
and you write with a pencil on it,
how deep it was in this particular location.

560
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.430
So I tried to do calculus with an abacus.
So,

561
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.330
so we are,
you know,

562
00:34:37.331 --> 00:34:40.340
like less than two months from deploying to Iraq for the first time,

563
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:43.880
none of us had ever been in combat for not one single person,
zero,

564
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:47.240
not one single person in my soup tune had ever been in combat before,

565
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.590
including our task unit commander,
no one.
And so we say,
Oh,

566
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.370
you know what we need to do right now is we're going to do a hydrographic

567
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:57.080
reconnaissance.
That's what it's called would lead line.
It's late,
but one,

568
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.020
one of the guys might have to you,
what are you doing?
What are you talking about?

569
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.060
And I go,
Bro,
we're just going to do it.
And it was like,
you gotta be kidding me.

570
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:09.040
What is wrong with us?
But so that learning curve was fast,
but then it,

571
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.070
but I also too,

572
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:14.540
to kind of emphasize what you're saying and I look at it when you,
when you said,

573
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.190
do you know your first platoon,
you know,
like 20% and then your second platoon,

574
00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:21.080
you know,
for me,
cause I have four kids,

575
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.620
it's very similar to what you learn with kids.
Your first kid,
you're like,

576
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.830
oh wait,
what?
You don't know how to do anything.
Everything is hard.

577
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:30.130
You know what you're worried about everything.
Your second kid,
you're like,

578
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.180
Oh yeah,
I'm pretty,
we're pretty much going to go your third kid.
You're like,

579
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.090
okay,
you know,
I think we're comfortable.
Your fourth could be like,

580
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:38.670
I got this whatever the fourth degree,
first kid,
go take care of your siblings.

581
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.970
Exactly.
Which is,
which is really,
which is really exactly what you do.

582
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:44.850
And the teams are like,
Hey,
you know,
get,
you know one cruise wonder,

583
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:45.511
go show that new guy.

584
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:48.300
What's up cause you don't have to do it anymore and you want them to learn the

585
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:49.134
experience.

586
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.850
But that's the same thing with the combat operations that you do in and over a

587
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:56.870
period of a couple of weeks,
all of a sudden you go from being,
you know,
out to,

588
00:35:56.871 --> 00:35:59.760
I'll give you another good example from my perspective,

589
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.630
my first deployment to Iraq when every operation we would go on like the first,

590
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.090
like let's call it five or seven operations that I did,

591
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.020
every piece of gear that I had to change the batteries changed the battery,

592
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.630
my not change the battery,
my laser change battery,

593
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.080
my flashlight changed every single bit.

594
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.610
I need a brand new battery in every one of these pieces of gear.

595
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.690
Well I was doing it cause that's,
that's when we talked about the big mission.

596
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.820
That's what we were thinking.
Oh,
what I've,

597
00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:26.370
I got to have this a hundred percent we realized after a week,

598
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.840
if everyone does that,

599
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:30.480
we're not going to have any batteries left and another two weeks.

600
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.890
And so we all realize,
you know what,

601
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.210
you're going to have to use that battery and keep track of how long you've used

602
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.560
it for.
Cause you don't want it to fail,
but you're going to get,
you know,

603
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.320
12 or 15 or 25 uses out of this thing.

604
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.180
But that's the kind of lessons that we learned.

605
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:44.850
And that's the kind of comfort level you've got.
Like,
okay,
if my nods fail,

606
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.090
I'll stop.
I'll put a new battery in,
my nods and we'll move on.

607
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.590
So those are the kinds of things that you learn in that steep learning curve

608
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:55.170
that all of us,
our whole generation went through that real quick.

609
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.780
<v 2>And you only learn that with time in the saddle.</v>

610
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.380
Like it takes experience to understand like,
okay,

611
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.530
I can use this lithium battery that probably costs $9 and I didn't turn it on

612
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:11.430
the whole time and I'm going to Huc it.
You know,
I think I can use it again.

613
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:13.920
I mean,
but I mean everything changed.
The tactics change,

614
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.770
gear changed the way we trained change.

615
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:20.100
It was amazing what happened post nine 11 all this stuff we thought was going to

616
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:22.230
be crazy effective cause I've worked in Vietnam.

617
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.270
Guess what doesn't work in the desert.

618
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.620
<v 4>Let me ask you this,
when you say that you only learn it in the saddle,</v>

619
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.490
when you were,
when you went through training,
when I was,

620
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:33.510
when I was running training,

621
00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.040
did you are able to convey a lot of that information of those guys though?

622
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.500
I tried.
I thought,
I think you were,

623
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.750
and maybe you couldn't give them every single little tiny thing,

624
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.270
but what I'm saying is there was no one to teach us that stuff.
Yes.

625
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.660
In the,
for me it was in 2003 months there was no one to say,
hey,

626
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.760
you don't need to change your battery on every operation.

627
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.890
You're going to need those batteries.
Do you need to make them last?

628
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.940
So we did get,

629
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.480
we did get some fundamental knowledge back from for sure from those early times.

630
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.520
<v 2>And then you still got to add that experience though,
that people,</v>

631
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.280
I mean like you can't,

632
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.900
you could read a book and then go do it for real and you need the combination of

633
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:14.080
the two to have that confidence and then you can impart it on somebody else.

634
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.590
And you know,
history just like,
like you said,
the Vietnam guys,

635
00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:21.370
like they were just timed out.
We didn't have access to that.
And I'm not,

636
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.410
I look at the pre nine 11 training that we did,

637
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.290
it was awesome,
but it don't get me wrong,
I loved it,
but man,

638
00:38:29.291 --> 00:38:30.400
it doesn't work in Baghdad.

639
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:35.990
And then we had a tactical shift again in probably 2006 2007 you know,
it's,

640
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.370
<v 3>it's just,</v>

641
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:41.080
it's that I think is what separates our community from a lot of other ones.

642
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:43.420
Like we're malleable,
but we have,
leadership is like,
listen,

643
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.690
this isn't working in real time.
We need to create a solution for it right now.

644
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.400
And we're willing to do that.

645
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.060
We have just a little bit more control of the wheel.

646
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.670
And I know part of the reason is because we had no doctrine.
Yeah.

647
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.900
Whereas the other service branches,
many of them have this beautiful,

648
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.850
really well written doctrine on this is how you do this type of operation.

649
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.910
And we didn't have that.
So guess what?
For us to say,
you know what,

650
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.830
that didn't work yesterday.
We're going to change it today.

651
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.920
They didn't have that capability.
They were like,
Hey,
this is the way we do it.

652
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.650
And we never really had,
this is the way we do it.
I mean,

653
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:17.380
thinking about before trade,
I was a team five,
right?

654
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:20.410
So we would go to Alaska and do cold weather training and the team three guys

655
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:24.390
were off driving DPV I mean there wasn't even talking in between the teams.

656
00:39:24.391 --> 00:39:27.880
So there was so much skillset and of course,

657
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:29.770
I mean if you're a team three I wasn't telling you shit,

658
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.510
I can give you the wrong information because we're competing with ourselves.

659
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.230
But yeah,
that,
like you said,
no doctrine.
And then finally we had,

660
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:42.410
you know the trade at East Coast and west coast and you know sharing information

661
00:39:42.411 --> 00:39:46.210
and coming together and lessons learned and all that stuff that I think largely

662
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:49.870
professionalize the force from a paperwork perspective but has impact on the

663
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.010
battlefield as well too.

664
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.040
It's not sexy and it's not fun but it keeps people alive.

665
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.420
There's no doubt about that.

666
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:59.410
The amount of interoperability we would do as the different training departments

667
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:00.760
was was awesome.

668
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.240
It was awesome and balancing lessons learned and the feedback loop with that we

669
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:08.260
got going.
One was definitely far superior to anything.
Then like you said,

670
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:11.830
when we had the teams go in all different areas and not talking to each other,

671
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.470
I mean I got issued over whites at team five would,

672
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:19.471
they wouldn't issue us Tan BTUs cause we were a southwest Asia platoon and I'd

673
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:21.220
look at the guys wearing the chocolate shifts.
I'm like,

674
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.990
oh I get a pair of though.
I'll trade you for it is woodland and camp.

675
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.600
It's just a different world.

676
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.660
But I'm actually extremely grateful that I got to see both sides of the coin

677
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:36.610
because if you never got to see that evolution,
uh,

678
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.460
you're missing a huge piece of who we are as a community.

679
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.330
And also I believe it would be easier that you would,

680
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.070
that we could let it slip back in that direction if we don't,

681
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.330
like we said,
capture those lessons and be able to pass them on.
So how many,

682
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.410
then you got out to the east coast,
how many deployments did you do out there?
Uh,

683
00:40:56.411 --> 00:41:00.010
I bounced back and forth from Iraq to Afghanistan,
uh,

684
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:04.000
for basically four years straight.
It'd be anything between three to

685
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:10.120
four months.
They were shorter in duration.
Uh,
so I ended up in my career,

686
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:13.150
I've been to Iraq three times and Afghanistan five.

687
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.970
And at one point there you kind of got a little setback.
Yeah.

688
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.863
Uh,

689
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.980
I equate it to going to Vegas and you can play craps for a really long time and

690
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.000
you can be on a great heater.
Uh,

691
00:41:26.001 --> 00:41:28.510
and then a seven is going to come up and bite you and hopefully you don't have a

692
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:33.380
lot of chips on the table.
Um,
yeah,
I got,

693
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.070
uh,
I

694
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v 2>got shot from about 15 feet away by a guy in a window that I didn't see and I</v>

695
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:41.840
was staring at that window for 10 minutes before I,

696
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.110
I was sitting on a ladder looking into a courtyard where they were trying to

697
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:47.270
determine,
uh,

698
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.680
which building was the one that we were actually going to make entry on.

699
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.430
And they determined that the building that I was looking at was the one we were

700
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:57.950
going to make entry into actually going to back it up a little bit.

701
00:41:57.951 --> 00:41:59.060
So we walked by this building.

702
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:01.970
Originally the lights were off cause I was walking point at the time.

703
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:06.200
So we went down an alley.
Uh,
you know,
we're not always the best and then just,

704
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:09.140
we made a little bit of noise.
So a guy comes out of a house,

705
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:14.150
we pursued him into the house and made additional noise while we were doing
that,

706
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.000
uh,
securing that to make sure that,
uh,
maybe it wasn't the guy,

707
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.780
we weren't exactly positive of the location,

708
00:42:18.781 --> 00:42:21.230
so maybe that could have been the guy.
So it wasn't,

709
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:24.530
and we backtracked and went back down that alley.
And uh,

710
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.700
the guys who were doing the,
they were fixing the target,
uh,

711
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.160
trying to determine which building it was going to be.
They needed some time.

712
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:34.400
So I a ladder up on a wall cause I'm not a huge fan of not being able to see

713
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.234
over things,

714
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.840
climbed up on the ladder and was just looking at the outside of a building and

715
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:40.040
the lights were on this time,

716
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.610
which defeats a lot of the technological advantage that I have.

717
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.110
So I was kind of just looking underneath my nods and I could see plainly into

718
00:42:48.111 --> 00:42:51.650
the window.
I'd never saw a shadow.
I'd never saw a curtain move.

719
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:55.190
I'd never saw anything.
And they finally gave me the,
go ahead,

720
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.300
hopped off the ladder.

721
00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:00.050
And I remember being in the corner of the court yard by myself for a little bit

722
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.750
before,
uh,

723
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.320
two other guys came over with me and I almost approached the door on my own,

724
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.840
uh,
because I had before and it was dark and I had the shadows and it was kind of

725
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:13.640
like an American house where there's uh,
uh,

726
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.180
it was like an l the long end of the lb and the garage and then there's that

727
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:20.030
path that goes to the front door and then it breaks off and then there's that

728
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:21.860
window right there.
That was the window I was looking at.

729
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.160
I was just going to go to the corner to sit security for the breach and I almost

730
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:28.430
left the shadows.
I was like,
you know what,
not today.

731
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.100
So waiting for two more guys to come up.

732
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.210
And right at that corner that I was going to post myself up on there was a

733
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:38.060
window and I wasn't going to turn my back on the window without taking at least

734
00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:42.950
a quick peek in it.
And as soon as I turned my head to look in that window,

735
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.960
I heard a crack and uh,
around,
hit me high up on the hip and spun me.

736
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.960
And then this,
the only time I've ever felt in my life,
the truth,

737
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:55.460
sensation of time slowing down.
It really it was,
it was almost like the movies.

738
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.650
It's probably the only thing I can say.
It was ever like the movies,

739
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:01.550
but it's slowed down and spun me towards him.
And when it hit,

740
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:05.080
I pushed off a little bit with my right foot,
I think just instinctually can,

741
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:09.020
I kind of pushed me down and there was a vehicle in the driveway and I ended up

742
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.910
stuck underneath the vehicle.

743
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.140
I had a shotgun on my right hand side and the Bungee cord got stuck on the under

744
00:44:14.141 --> 00:44:16.760
carriage.
I'm laying on top of my gun,

745
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.000
can't get at staring at full auto fire from like 15 feet away out of a window.

746
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.910
Guys just up on his knees,
just hosing.
And uh,

747
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:31.530
probably three seconds occurred or expired.
And I mean,

748
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:35.670
obviously all hell broke loose from people on our side.
Uh,
engaging the window.

749
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.370
They made entry from the other side,
ended up having,

750
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:42.690
I think it was eight American servicemen get wounded on that target alone.
Uh,

751
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.670
some of it was,
uh,
our guys were too close to a breach.
I mean,
a lot of it was,

752
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.860
it was some fog of war stuff from a unit that you wouldn't associate necessarily

753
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:55.470
with the fog of war.
But it,
you know,
it happens.

754
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.100
I associate the fog of war with all the units,
unfortunately.
Yeah.
But you know,

755
00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.250
some of them would say it surprises you had some levels more than others.

756
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.160
And it was,
you know,
they were trying,
they wanted to get internal,

757
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.420
they get the breach on the door,
get the breach on the door.

758
00:45:10.421 --> 00:45:12.330
So we put a c six strip charge up,

759
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.480
which is a very large explosive charge that runs the length of the door,

760
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:17.820
put it on the hinge side.
And when they set it off,

761
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:20.310
there was a unit that had entered on the other side of the building without

762
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.370
telling anybody standing about three feet from him.

763
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.290
So there were some people who were shot on the inside.

764
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:26.700
There were some people who were shot on the outside,

765
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:28.710
and then there were some people who were hurt from the explosion.

766
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.400
So they had little birds coming in and grabbing people.
Uh,

767
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:37.401
I ended up getting thrown in the back of a Bradley with a Guy Who jab knee with

768
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:40.170
a 14 gauge needle and hadn't prepped the bag.

769
00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:42.240
So he pulled it back out and I told him at that point,

770
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:44.460
you're done with any medical treatment at this point.

771
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:48.780
I will handle my own stuff from here on out.
We're like an army medic.

772
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:51.690
He was just shaking.
I'm like,
you're good.
I'm going to live.

773
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:55.710
I think so just take it easy,
take it easy.
But,
uh,

774
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.360
I mean,

775
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.940
I didn't do anything differently that night that I hadn't done before hundreds

776
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:04.890
of times.
Uh,
you know,
I just,
I was on the wrong side of the bullet and it,
it,

777
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:09.450
uh,
it actually really rocked my confidence.
It was,
I was young,

778
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:12.780
I was in my mid twenties where I wanted to be operating at the level that I

779
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:17.190
wanted to be operating at.
And I mean,
I couldn't walk for almost a year.

780
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.490
I had a Hemiplegia like paralysis of one side of my leg.

781
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:24.340
I had dropped foot for a year,
obviously hit nerves then they don't know.

782
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:25.830
They didn't,
I mean they don't know.

783
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.420
It either hit the sciatic nerve as it went through or the shockwave short

784
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.560
short-circuited either way,

785
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:35.790
the result was the same at Friday at all the way down to,
uh,
my ankle.

786
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.880
So when I was in the back,
when I got to the hospital in the Green Zone,

787
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:43.030
my biggest complaint was that my ankle felt like it was snapped in half.
Uh,

788
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.860
and like I still have never had a surgery,
never broken a bone.

789
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.960
Everything is still inside of my pelvis.

790
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:53.700
They just wrapped the wound with ace wrap and drug me out of the compound.

791
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.920
I mean,
that's literally it.
And then they went back to business.

792
00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:00.210
But I thought that I was like,
I had,

793
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.160
my ankle has gotta be destroyed somehow.

794
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:05.150
So they cut my boot off like very gingerly and they're looking at it.

795
00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:06.270
They're like,
your ankle is totally fine.

796
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:08.610
But that was by far the worst part of it was the,

797
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.480
the neuropathic issues for like a year and a half,
almost two years.

798
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:16.530
It felt like my dip,
my leg and gasoline and just lit it on fire 24,
seven.

799
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.530
And so the navy,
I mean I had like 14,
15 pill bottles.
Uh,

800
00:47:21.531 --> 00:47:26.070
I mean I was taken two,
three,
four ambien staying awake.
Of course,

801
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:28.680
the only way to up that game is to combine with Captain Morgan,

802
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:32.890
which I in a variety of de dosages.
Uh,

803
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.830
so I would sleep but wake up exhausted.
I mean it was,
it was rough.

804
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:40.150
It rocked me as a person and as a,

805
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.600
as a seal.
I didn't know if I was ever come back from it.

806
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.880
Where were you stationed at that time?

807
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.590
We still a out on the east coast or did you go to the east coast?
I went to buds,

808
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.940
uh,
as a,
basically a break to rehab myself.

809
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.340
Uh,
I mean like,
so it's even still today,

810
00:47:57.341 --> 00:48:00.670
I can't fell my left leg from the knee cap down.
I roll my ankle all the time.

811
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:05.290
I'm just used to,
I'm used to it.
I know somehow compensate for it the best again.

812
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.040
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm very,

813
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.970
I don't do any like lateral stuff because if I catch my left foot to the
outside,

814
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.660
that that's the role that I can't stop.
It's the one at the outside.
So I mean,

815
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:15.640
I still train as hard,
if not harder than I used to.

816
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:19.300
I'm just super cautious with what it is that I do and I tailor it all towards

817
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:22.900
the stuff that I do now.
But yeah,
you want to talk about,
you know,

818
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:26.470
you watch all these movies where you guys are just getting drilled and they're

819
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:29.020
running at it.
And like,
I'm going to be the biggest warrior ever.

820
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:31.720
And like I was flat on my back.
I mean,
that was fricking done training.

821
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:34.260
There's nothing I could do pinned under a car.
Uh,

822
00:48:34.261 --> 00:48:36.790
it needed a buddy of mine to come over and pull me around in the middle of a

823
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:41.770
firefight to get me out of harms way.
I mean I got super lucky.
The,
uh,

824
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:45.520
the belt I was wearing that night has the second round that the guy shot at me.

825
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.710
It burned the belt for like two inches.

826
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.830
And then the copper jacket is still in the,
uh,
the belt itself.

827
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:54.550
That's how close I got to getting hit.
Even higher up in the hip,
like the pelvis.

828
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.250
I don't think I would've survived that one if that would hit me.

829
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.030
Cause there's an AK from like three times the distance from me to you right now.

830
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.930
It was spicy.
So,
so when you,

831
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.640
they're just,

832
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.350
I mean I'm not trying to say anything super negative about the care that you
got,

833
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:13.690
but they're like,
okay,
take this pill,
take this pill,
take this pill,

834
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:17.110
take that year.
It was early.
So I was um,

835
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:22.990
I got home about two days after it happened.
They flew me,

836
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:26.980
they medivaced me to launch tool.
I decided I didn't want to stay there.

837
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:31.430
So I checked myself out and got a Delta ticket and flew into New York.
Uh,

838
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.920
it got picked up by another plane and my wife met me at the stairs of the

839
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:36.480
aircraft,

840
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.480
it in Oceana naval air station there with my son in a stroller and she was

841
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:45.820
pregnant with our second child.
And about a week after that,

842
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.910
my resting heart rate was sitting at like 150.

843
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.970
I was sweating profusely in a ton of pain and they take me to the hospital and I

844
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:59.890
remember talking to like this,
I think as an e five at the time.

845
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.930
So I was talking to this little punk,

846
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:06.010
he to Corman who was checking me in and he was like,
you know,

847
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:08.000
what's the nature of injury?
And I'm like,
you know,

848
00:50:08.001 --> 00:50:10.870
a gunshot wound to the hip and I kid you not.
He's,

849
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.010
he's like writing this stuff down.
He stops and he looks at me and he goes,

850
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.180
self inflicted.

851
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.030
And my wife's sitting there looking at this.
She's just like,
what's,

852
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.830
what's going on?
Like she has very little understanding of the military medical.

853
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.150
I sat in the waiting room while they took people in with the sniffles and the

854
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:35.330
flu for four hours before they took me in.

855
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.980
And my wife finally just started losing her mind on them and like,
you know,
they,

856
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.440
it was a training hospital as most military hospitals are.

857
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:47.330
They had never seen a gunshot wound because it was relatively early in the war,

858
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:47.601
you know,

859
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:51.230
given where we were at that time and they wanted to come have all the doctors,

860
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:52.460
all the residents come in,
they're like,
hey,

861
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:56.060
can they come in and check out the wound?
Like we'd never seen a gunshot wound.

862
00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.090
I'm like,
sure,
if you bring it a pint of morphine with you and juice me up first,

863
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.720
I don't care what you do.
Like,
I just couldn't sleep.
I was in so much pain.
Uh,

864
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:10.760
the treatment that I got from the military was not awesome.
Um,

865
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.160
it,
it was frustrating at the time,

866
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:17.660
but this is just to make sure this is oh five oh five early oh five.

867
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.170
It wasn't awesome.
They weren't used to seeing a lot of that stuff.
Uh,
yeah,

868
00:51:21.171 --> 00:51:25.310
I got pills and I got sent home and kind of largely left to my own devices,

869
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:29.420
which was not a smart call at the time.
Um,
I mean I,

870
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.330
in my career I felt like I was a race car in fifth year,

871
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:35.210
going around turn four and then somebody dumped the trainee into reverse and

872
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:38.510
there was just pieces everywhere and I had to kind of put it back together

873
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:43.090
myself and it sucked at the time.
Um,
my wife's still,
I mean,

874
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:47.140
she's pissed about it,
the,
the treatment that I got,
but I mean,
I,

875
00:51:47.141 --> 00:51:49.940
the military did what they were doing at that time.
You know,

876
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:53.670
I don't hold them against it or hold it against them at all.
Uh,

877
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:58.180
but it sucked for sure.
And I do know we've made vast improved.

878
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:00.610
You were one of the guys that,
yeah,

879
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.080
the reason why there's been so many improvements,
because you know,

880
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:06.200
guys were coming back and getting the kind to treatment that they would

881
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:08.150
definitely deserve better.
You know,
we,

882
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:12.710
one of the worst things about the whole thing was actually the flight out of

883
00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:17.711
ballade and as c one 41 full of stretchers of people that were wounded far worse

884
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:19.724
than I was.

885
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Just the noises that were being made on that flight from ballade to Landstuhl.

886
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.900
Uh,
I was very fortunate.
I had a doc who was assigned to me as just like,
hey,

887
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.530
knock me out.
Right?
Like I don't want to hear this anymore.

888
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.440
And I had the guy just basically just juice me up until I fell asleep for the

889
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:41.420
whole flight.
But what an experience that you'll never forget,

890
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:46.450
just a tube full of bleeding Americans,

891
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:47.720
you know,

892
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.870
on their way back to try to put their lives back together and people missing p.

893
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.220
I mean,
I was right next to a guy who was standing in a turret of a Humvee when a

894
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:56.900
suicide bomber clocked himself off.

895
00:52:56.901 --> 00:53:00.020
And every inch of his body from bell line up was just completely tattered.

896
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.580
I mean,
uh,
another guy who had his legs blown off.
I mean,
like it,

897
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.970
I'm sitting there,
I'm like,
I don't,
I'm like,
okay.
I thought I was injured.
Uh,

898
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.530
you guys,
you guys are way worse off than I am.
It was a very sobering experience.

899
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.220
How did you,
so you go,

900
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:20.470
you go kind of pretty far down the road of a reason.
Pills.

901
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.440
Okay.
So do you some good recipes if you're interested in three blues of red,

902
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.210
<v 4>two bottles of Captain Morgan.
How did you,
okay,</v>

903
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.600
well we'll take it for granted that you went pretty far down that road.

904
00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:36.210
Being that you know,
you've got the team guy personality of okay,

905
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:39.330
I can't do this so I'm going to,
I can't do this to the extreme.

906
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:44.130
Someone to do something else.
I have to go and stop.
How did you figure out,
okay,

907
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:46.870
you know what,
what,
what was the slap in the face that made you say,

908
00:53:46.871 --> 00:53:48.780
you know what,
this,
this is not where I want to be.

909
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.940
<v 2>I was in the car with my wife,
so one of the pills they gave me was Neurontin,</v>

910
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.490
which is a antiseizure medicine for children,

911
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.890
but it has a secondary or tertiary side effects,

912
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.710
side effects of a neuropathic pain control.

913
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.420
It was an attempt to try to get that burning feeling to stop in my leg.
And,

914
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.020
uh,
I kept signing waivers for the dosages cause they were,

915
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.220
we were off the charts,

916
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:15.690
like we were making medical history with the dosages that I was on.
Uh,

917
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.080
and another side effect of it is central nervous system suppression.

918
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.910
And I remembered going by the gasoline or calm by the gasoline going by the gas

919
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:27.540
station and looking at the sign for the prices of the gasoline.

920
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:31.680
And my wife asked me it,
very rudimentary mathematical problem and I couldn't,

921
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:35.430
I couldn't figure it out.
Uh,
and I'm certainly not the smartest guy in the world,

922
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:38.130
but like I should be able to add two plus two and,
you know,

923
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.650
maybe multiply that out a little bit.
And I,
I couldn't do it.

924
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:43.980
And I recognize that in and of myself.
Uh,

925
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:48.981
so that night I stopped drinking and basically started weaning myself off of the

926
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:55.470
neurotin cause you can't stop it cold Turkey because if you do,
uh,

927
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:57.570
your propensity for seizures goes through the roof.

928
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.330
So you ha you got to graduate yourself out of it.

929
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:02.880
So it took me like six to eight months to get myself off of them.

930
00:55:02.881 --> 00:55:05.930
They're rotten off all the pills.
Uh,

931
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.270
and I just started working out like a maniac and that's how I got myself.

932
00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:13.200
I did it.
I did it all on my own.
I didn't get on any protocol from the navy,

933
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.050
but I remember that moment where I just couldn't answer that question.

934
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:18.750
I was like,
okay,
Tom did Tom to shift course

935
00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.690
<v 4>and you know,
a lot of people always,
a lot of people ask about,
um,
you know,</v>

936
00:55:22.691 --> 00:55:25.810
when you're injured.
They asked me,
what are you doing?
I always say,
Hey,

937
00:55:25.811 --> 00:55:28.330
I do what I can do.
If I got a blown out knee you normally do,

938
00:55:28.331 --> 00:55:31.360
I'm going to do a one legged squats together ligament do.
Pullups was that your,

939
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.250
your attitude?
And was like,
okay,
what can I do?

940
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:33.991
<v 2>You know?
That's,</v>

941
00:55:33.991 --> 00:55:38.991
that's how I found a crossfit was through getting shot.

942
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.720
That's what I use to,
and again,
I could care less than me,

943
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:45.720
but people get very excited about the term crossfit,
functional training,

944
00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:48.510
whatever you want to call it.
To me,
it was really new at that time.

945
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.590
Like I was on the bodybuilder routine if you know,

946
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.010
chest and Tris and back and buys

947
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.720
<v 4>nineties team guy,
totally or otherwise known as the echo right.</v>

948
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.230
<v 2>Wednesdays.
Uh,
but yeah,
so like,
and I had never done the squats before,</v>

949
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.720
so I literally held onto a pole in,

950
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:06.630
lowered myself down into a squat and I picked myself up and I just,

951
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:10.500
I just changed stuff so I could do it.

952
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.910
And uh,

953
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.860
I remember the first night of sleep that I had that was really good and my wife

954
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:19.440
could probably point to it on a calendar because I came back from the gym,

955
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:23.160
like I had no responsibilities at work because my squadron was still deployed.

956
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.300
So I mean,
I literally was like,
Hey,

957
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:28.520
come in on Thursdays and we'll give you some east stub on your leg.
Right.

958
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.710
That was,
that was the therapy.

959
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.300
So I went into the gym and I just crushed myself.
Came home,

960
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:36.550
like covered in sweat and just passed out,

961
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.230
slept good and just continued that routine on.
And,
you know,

962
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.830
they were saying it would take me a couple of years if ever,

963
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:48.220
to get back on a full active duty because they didn't know.
I mean,

964
00:56:48.221 --> 00:56:49.630
cause with nervous,
they're like,
yeah,

965
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:53.230
you reached the end of the medical practice when you start talking about nerves.

966
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.060
I've never had,

967
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.910
I mean the doctors with probably a decade of medical experiences saying to me,

968
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.330
Oh,
I don't know.
I'm like,
Hey doc,
I don't have an MD.
And I could tell you that.

969
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:04.240
I don't know.
Could I get a better answer out of you then that like,
come on man.

970
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.640
Uh,
but yeah,
I mean,
I worked myself back.
I wasn't done.
I didn't want to be done.

971
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.760
And I worked myself back to a point where I felt confident again that I could

972
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:17.320
deploy and I was still continuing what?

973
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:20.260
So I left and went to buds in 2006 as an instructor.

974
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:25.810
Use that time to rehab myself.
And then,
um,
by the time I got to team three,

975
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:27.610
it was about four,

976
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.210
four or five years after that injury where I was going through training.

977
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.820
When you were the OIC to trade it and,

978
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.310
and also you became an officer at that point when you're going to books.
I did,

979
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:40.120
I did.
I,
um,
I didn't have,
it's not that I didn't have a choice.

980
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:44.350
It was the best choice that I had at that time.
So when I got shot,

981
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:48.880
I was on my Lpo tour.
Uh,
and for people who don't understand the military,

982
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:52.930
it is a mandatory go no go wicked for advancement.

983
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:57.010
And they counted it as me not successfully completing it,

984
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.860
so to advance.

985
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:02.890
So I was in east six at the time and I was trying to walk the less,

986
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:06.820
sorry for laughing.
I'm an evil bastard cause I'm laughing,
I'm not laughing,

987
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.860
laughing at the old system.

988
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:13.090
So if you want to March your way from [inaudible] to [inaudible] nine,

989
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:15.190
you have to hit these mandatory career wickets.

990
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.330
And the jump between East 67 for the enlisted guys is the large jump from middle

991
00:58:19.331 --> 00:58:24.130
management to the c suite of the enlisted realm.
They judge,

992
00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:27.950
you only buy your service record unless you have these mandatory wicked's you're

993
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.320
getting swept off the table.

994
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:33.520
And so I submitted my chief packages twice with a good,

995
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.300
uh,
awesome evaluations.
I mean,

996
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:42.010
I was doing some awesome stuff in my career.
I had good words,
uh,

997
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.380
give recommendations,
good evils from everybody.

998
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.720
And two years in a row they were like,
nope.

999
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.780
And so finally I started calling people who probably shouldn't have told me the

1000
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:52.560
answer.
I'm like,
Hey,
what's going on there?
They're like,
oh,
you know,

1001
00:58:52.561 --> 00:58:57.210
your Lpo tours getting counted against you.
And I did.
And Yeah,
and I,

1002
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.740
and I didn't want to be done with being in the military.

1003
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.290
And I'm sitting there and I'm like,
okay,
how,

1004
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:08.070
what can I do here if I want to continue on and I want to have impact?

1005
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.110
So I decided I needed to maneuver.

1006
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:16.950
So I researched a officer programs and stumbled across the limited duty officer

1007
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:22.850
program,
which is traditionally for east 78.
And uh,

1008
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:25.250
and there had never been an [inaudible] candidate picked up.

1009
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:30.260
And so I threw my package in the next year that it came up and was actually

1010
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:33.410
selected first out of the whole stable of people that were selected that you're

1011
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.710
ahead of like five or six other chiefs,
uh,

1012
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:38.630
who ended up getting picked up for LDL.
But for me it was,

1013
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:42.350
I'm looking at him like,
I want to stay in and I want to have an impact.

1014
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.260
This is the only way that I can do it.
So that's why I submitted my,

1015
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.230
my officer package.

1016
00:59:46.231 --> 00:59:49.430
She was never any burning desire of mine from like years before that.

1017
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:53.780
It was just that I need to do something to keep moving.
And that was my,

1018
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:54.800
that was my route to do it.

1019
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:59.250
<v 4>Did you,
when you were,
so you get wounded,
right.</v>

1020
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.860
And obviously you could have said at that point,
hey,
you know what,
I'm done.

1021
01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.670
You know,

1022
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:09.320
when you look at the various reasons that a person could choose from,

1023
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:13.160
why you said like,
you know what,
I'm not done.
Because the friends that,
you know,

1024
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:16.160
other guys that we both know that I've talked to,
they have,
you know,

1025
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:20.060
various reasons.
Some of them are straight up vengeance like,
oh,

1026
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:23.060
I'm going to go back and I'm going to get after it.

1027
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:28.130
These people are going to pay some of it.
Hey,
I for myself,
you know,

1028
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.410
kind of like what you were saying,
like I,
I feel like I,
I,

1029
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:32.960
I can't do what I am supposed to do,

1030
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:35.040
so I want to prove that I can go back and do it.
What,
what,

1031
01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:38.420
what was like the driving reason for you if you have,
if you had to pick one,

1032
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:40.990
maybe there's just all those things,
which is a perfectly acceptable answer too.

1033
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.810
I mean,
vengeance is certainly a part of it,
right?
Like,
how dare you,

1034
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.600
I'm the only one who gets to do that to people.

1035
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:52.150
<v 2>Uh,
you know?
Yeah.
What a crazy,
a crazy thing to think like that.</v>

1036
01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:54.210
But you kind of do like you think you're invincible.
Right.

1037
01:00:54.211 --> 01:00:58.990
And so I needed to prove to myself that I could still do the job that I wanted

1038
01:00:58.991 --> 01:00:59.824
to do.

1039
01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:04.890
I was pissed about it and I was at a point in my life where I was still very

1040
01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:10.060
tied to what the job meant.

1041
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.360
I derived so much of my personality and who I was from that job because it was

1042
01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:20.881
all that I had focused on for the vast majority of my life at that point that I

1043
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.040
didn't,
I didn't know who I would be without that.

1044
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:29.020
So it was a combination of all of those things that just kind of kept driving me

1045
01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:34.030
towards going back.
And there was,
I mean there was never a second's hesitation.

1046
01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:38.050
I like,
I knew I was going to not stop.
I just didn't know that the road,

1047
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.690
the road with which I was going to take to not stop.

1048
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:42.860
<v 4>You know what's weird too is that,
you know,</v>

1049
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:47.420
for guys that like you and I that are full on institutionalized in the military,

1050
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:51.950
it's almost like the,
when I was in,

1051
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.900
I didn't understand other options.
Like it wasn't like,

1052
01:01:56.901 --> 01:01:59.630
well I could do this.
Like right now we can sit back.
You know,
Andy,

1053
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:01.490
you could have gotten out back then and you could have gone into it.

1054
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.080
It's so clear to see that.
No,
but when you're in you're just,
no,
no,

1055
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.020
well if you can't do this well then there's nothing else that you actually can

1056
01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:10.940
do.
This is the only option in the world.

1057
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.610
<v 2>And if we're being totally honest,
a lot of that is by design.</v>

1058
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:16.503
<v 4>I'm sure it is</v>

1059
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.220
<v 2>military and especially the seal teams.
What did we do to our buddies</v>

1060
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.160
<v 4>who want to get out?
You know,
like I am thinking about getting out,
hey,</v>

1061
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:27.900
fuck you quitter,
quitter.
But I mean like we,
I mean we're the most,

1062
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:30.640
I did 20 years of,
one of my buddies was like,
I said,
hey man.
Yeah.

1063
01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.130
Like at the 18 year mark,
I told one of my close friends,
I'm like,
yeah,
I'm Adam.

1064
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.370
I'm going to retire at 20 they're like quick quitter.

1065
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:42.420
I'm thinking about in the training from day one it's about the guy to your left

1066
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.670
and right,
right,
and then you get back from a mission,

1067
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:46.110
you take care of the team gear first.

1068
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.210
You know the last thing you do is you take care of yourself.

1069
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:53.211
So were you are the bottom of the priority list priority list life is the bottom

1070
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:58.140
of the priority list and the CEO came and that has secondary and tertiary

1071
01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:01.950
effects when it comes to understanding what you can do or options that you would

1072
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:04.710
have outside of the military.
I'm not saying they do it by design,

1073
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:09.630
but the system that we come from naturally puts on a set of blinders,

1074
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:13.270
which I think is essential to make us as effective as we are.
You're right,

1075
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.930
I think,
I think it is a complete secondary effect.

1076
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:20.250
It's not like there's some evil training person in the sky that's going,
okay,

1077
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:22.680
the way we can get these guys to stay in.
It's do this.
No.

1078
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.210
The way that the seal teams has evolved to be the best we can be in combat is to

1079
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:29.910
make this thing your number one priority.
Which I say that all the time.

1080
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.200
I got asked this the other day,
I was out doing uh,
uh,

1081
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.370
working with a company and you know,
some guy who was asking me,

1082
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.010
how did you do your work life balance when you're in the seal teams?

1083
01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:42.030
And I'm like,
no,
this isn't the answer I shouldn't be giving.
I'm not authorized.

1084
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:44.660
The only,
you know what you do,
you marry an awesome girl.
Yep.

1085
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:46.860
And then you focus on your job.
That's what I did.

1086
01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:51.840
I married an awesome girl and I focused on my job and my wife knew.
She knew.

1087
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:55.140
It wasn't like I covered up and said,
no,
no babe,
you're my number one priority.

1088
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.940
It was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
The,

1089
01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.980
the teams and then the teams and then the teams and then everything.

1090
01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:05.220
Then like Jujitsu and then everything else.
And then you're down here.

1091
01:04:05.221 --> 01:04:07.940
That's the way it is.
And I'm not trying to be an asshole.
That's the,

1092
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.810
that's the reality of the situation.
And that's why,
yeah,
it's uh,

1093
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.040
that's,
that's why another reason why when,
when guys get wounded and they go,

1094
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.210
yeah,
well what else are you going to do?
Yeah,

1095
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.260
so you get to team three w what was your position when you,

1096
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.900
by the way,
so just so people understand that this LDO thing,
which by the way,

1097
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.690
I don't know if you've known this,
but it's completely gone.
It's shut it down.

1098
01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:36.030
They shut it down.
It's one of the,

1099
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:38.790
if not the only way to get commission without a college degree.

1100
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.440
I'm working on a high school diploma here.
People public school education,

1101
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.270
barely in Santa Cruz.

1102
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.390
But you showed up and like to this day,
right at this moment in time I had,

1103
01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.410
and I was quote unquote running the training.

1104
01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:56.490
I have no idea what your job actually was.
How awesome is that?

1105
01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.830
That is pretty awesome.
Well done.
But you know,

1106
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:03.030
I know I could tell you exactly what role you fulfilled,
you know,
as a leader,

1107
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:05.420
but I don't know where you would have broken out on an org chart.

1108
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.320
What was your actual officer for a task unit for the seal team?
Three in general.

1109
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:15.670
You were running around with a machine gun during workup because they would've

1110
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:17.480
failed their,
oh,
Ari.

1111
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.620
<v 2>I mean the platoons would count or like,
you know,
uh,</v>

1112
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:24.380
the sea would be like,
Hey,
uh,

1113
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:28.540
we failed land warfare where you come out to not live with us for the or.

1114
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.220
I'm like,
absolutely,
I'll come out and swing blanks.
And like,
I mean,

1115
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.530
for one,
like I,
I have,
I never wanted a desk job.

1116
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:42.640
I loved best job in the seal teams.
And you know,
this is an e five shooter.

1117
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.990
Absolutely.
My first combat deployment,
my responsibility was a sledgehammer.

1118
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:50.770
Then I moved up to the Hooli and then I moved to a shotgun and then I could do

1119
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:53.780
whatever I wanted to do and it was the best job in the world.
And like I,

1120
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.200
that's all I wanted to do.
So although I was an officer to be,

1121
01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.020
by the way,

1122
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:04.020
you get to be a master with a slight or a master with a hooligan tool.

1123
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:09.160
Yeah.
You just become,
it's your life precise,
efficient.

1124
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.520
Uh,
and so the,
you know,
like I put my officer package in,

1125
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.550
but let's say like 20% of me,
it was like,
you know what?

1126
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:17.260
This is just a means to an end.

1127
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:21.220
I'm going to figure out a way to get back on the battlefield because LDLs are

1128
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:24.340
not supposed to be tactical leaders at all.
You're a line officer,

1129
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.580
but I should have never been.
Well,

1130
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:32.500
I should have never been by the letter of the law of the Ldo manual in a

1131
01:06:32.501 --> 01:06:33.550
tactical leadership position,

1132
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:37.060
which I eventually worked my way to not buy any kind of design.

1133
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.600
But I went to team three training hill and you know,

1134
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:46.900
they're getting ready to send people to Afghanistan and no one's ever set foot

1135
01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:48.850
there.
And you know this,

1136
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.770
the skipper wanted to send me there and then the troop commander had a great

1137
01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:58.330
relationship with and they were short and officer here and there.
So I'd like,
oh,

1138
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.210
maybe I'll just go out to San Clemente island for a little bit,
you know,

1139
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.250
maybe I'll get on the roof and throw some grenades in the window.

1140
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:04.480
It's hard to say what I'm going to do.

1141
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.740
And so I just like just kind of started going out there again and then like went

1142
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.010
out to an island when they,
when the,
the troop failed their land warfare.

1143
01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:15.010
I went out with them and try just to try to go and do smart stuff to help them

1144
01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:17.910
out to relieve some,
give the leadership some distance in space.
Yeah.

1145
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:18.631
<v 4>And it was awesome.</v>

1146
01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:22.110
I mean it's awesome when guys that were experienced were come through like

1147
01:07:22.111 --> 01:07:24.870
yourself,
which is so good to have guys like you come through,

1148
01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.780
especially because you were,
you were super experienced,

1149
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.230
really good tactically and super humble.
It wasn't like you were out there like,

1150
01:07:31.231 --> 01:07:34.500
no,
you were like,
oh,
this is awesome.
Training.
Looks like,
Oh yeah,
this,
hey,

1151
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.930
we need to do this.
It was just,

1152
01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.420
just so good for the troop to see that type of leadership out there.

1153
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:44.000
<v 2>Plus I like offensive maneuvers and what I'm telling guys to move forward.</v>

1154
01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:48.050
They're like,
oh,
we can do that.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
Oh yes,
Oh yes,
we can do that.

1155
01:07:48.051 --> 01:07:52.700
And you should.
And they,
and they just,
they weren't because that,
you know,

1156
01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:57.080
you get a junior officer in a community full of a types and most of the people

1157
01:07:57.081 --> 01:08:01.160
that work for them have more experience than them.

1158
01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:04.820
They're hesitant to make a call because we eat our own cause when did the most

1159
01:08:04.821 --> 01:08:06.590
voracious community ever,

1160
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.340
so they're afraid to make an offensive call when they should make an offensive

1161
01:08:10.341 --> 01:08:13.130
call.
Like ever.
I've heard you say before,
and I know we have the same position,

1162
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:16.340
like the default move should be aggressive,
drive forward,

1163
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.610
not away like putting your enemy on their heels.

1164
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:20.930
You don't need to be on your heels at all.

1165
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:23.330
Like take their space and time away to make a decision.

1166
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:26.870
Shorten their short and your Ooda loop and get in the middle of theirs and just

1167
01:08:26.871 --> 01:08:29.750
start wreaking havoc.
But you got to have,
again,

1168
01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.690
time in the saddle to be comfortable making those calls.

1169
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.270
And a lot of it I noticed was pattern recognition.
Like,
Oh,

1170
01:08:35.271 --> 01:08:38.870
I've seen this a high grounds over there.
Sure,
let's get some guys over there.

1171
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:41.450
Hey,
they're going to come around this building.
Don't ask,
just don't,

1172
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.120
don't ask me now.
Just get over there.
Go over there please.

1173
01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:47.660
Like you can see it's pattern recognition from time in the saddle.

1174
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:51.560
And because I was exposed awesome people throughout my career and I watched him

1175
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:55.010
and I wrote down what they did and I just have always tried to be a sponge.

1176
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.260
You have to be a sponge and suck up knowledge.

1177
01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.490
<v 4>And so then you,</v>

1178
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.190
you do another deployment and you do end up in a leadership position.
Yeah.

1179
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.490
Which again,
good job.
You said it was,
what'd you just say?

1180
01:09:06.491 --> 01:09:09.940
It was unintended or something like that was relatively unintended.

1181
01:09:09.941 --> 01:09:12.730
Relatively quantified it now thank you.

1182
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.270
Because I was going to have to call bullshit,

1183
01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.760
<v 2>you know?
Uh,
so I went through the last,
you know,</v>

1184
01:09:18.761 --> 01:09:22.020
the troop commander from that troop was like,
hey,
we're,

1185
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:24.020
you're going to come over.
I was supposed to be the OP.

1186
01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:28.690
So on that deployment at a fire base that was in between the two platoons,

1187
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.730
one of the officers was having a kid,

1188
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.210
he wanted to stay back for about the first month,
month and a half.

1189
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:38.860
And so they had no AOAC minted oh one at this point.

1190
01:09:38.861 --> 01:09:42.550
Freshy butter bar.
But one of my favorite things to do,
a totally an aside,

1191
01:09:42.551 --> 01:09:45.610
was to put my cammies on with my butter bars and I'd go to the ops meetings over

1192
01:09:45.611 --> 01:09:50.160
at group and I'd let like a e six is an e seven it's like talk to me like this

1193
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.130
brand new.
Yeah.
Cause I always,

1194
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.830
I mean I've looked relatively young and they're like,
you know,

1195
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.220
later on once you got something,
you know

1196
01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:00.650
<v 4>time mean these guys are actually guys that you would probably or in many cases</v>

1197
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:04.730
had been in the team longer than oh for sure.
Yeah,
100% and I'd be like,
Huh,

1198
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:06.830
tell me more.
And you're like,

1199
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.010
and then I'd catch him later on in my Khakis and they're like,
ah,

1200
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:13.890
I got to admit I had some phones as butter bar as well.
I got her admit.

1201
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.110
Oh that's awesome.
Thank you so much for the guidance.

1202
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.930
I hope one day I know as much as you do.
And they're just like,
yet I told them,

1203
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:24.110
I told the,
I told the chief or senior chief,

1204
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.520
actually that was kind of calling me out like butter bar at when I was at team

1205
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:32.580
too.
And I was telling him in front of my platoons there and they all,

1206
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:35.780
they all knew me and I go,
well,
you know,
you know,
senior you got to,

1207
01:10:35.781 --> 01:10:40.720
you got to understand ensigns run the navy.
And he,
he used the width.

1208
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:45.300
You can see I'm turning red instantaneously into orbit the orbit.

1209
01:10:45.301 --> 01:10:47.960
And he actually said,
you know,
you guys need to straighten this inside and out.

1210
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.420
And I said,
hey,
why don't you do it?
I'll meet you out the mill.
Vance,

1211
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.670
let's call it new and I'll be out there to warm enough.

1212
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.290
You'll be out by yourself.
Oh,
that was so good.
Yeah.

1213
01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.040
So

1214
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.960
<v 2>you know,
the,
the true commander was like,
Hey,</v>

1215
01:11:00.961 --> 01:11:04.280
do the last month to training with us,
which was the San Clemente Block.
Uh,

1216
01:11:04.281 --> 01:11:08.340
so went out there with the snake many block.
Uh,
the skipper was like,
hey,

1217
01:11:08.341 --> 01:11:11.160
go over there as the op,
so,
but we're going to slide you out with this platoon.

1218
01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:16.161
Were having some potential leadership issues with the OIC,

1219
01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.990
a man that I know you're familiar with because we experienced them largely

1220
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:25.230
together.
Uh,
and I think,
I think,

1221
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.530
and this is me speaking for why I think he did that.
I think he did me,

1222
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.120
he put me out there as a,
as a safety mechanism.
I don't know.

1223
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.110
I don't think he had anything else to do.
Uh,

1224
01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:41.070
so I went out there and uh,
he ended up being relieved and then,

1225
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.180
uh,
the skipper,

1226
01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:46.890
because mean I was an o one wearing oh three a and o four one Scott wasn't

1227
01:11:46.891 --> 01:11:49.590
paying attention because I would just take his collar devices often cause or

1228
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:51.720
whatever.
It's not like I'm an o three either.

1229
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:54.150
So I would just put on whatever color device I could get my hands on.

1230
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:57.540
And there was no colonel bars available.
Oh,

1231
01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:00.720
I didn't wear it if I couldn't find some general stores that had been rock in

1232
01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:03.570
those things.
And,
uh,

1233
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.220
I mean it was one of the best deployments of all the stuff that I did a while I

1234
01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:09.054
was in.

1235
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.930
I think what I was the proudest of is a lot of the guys I deployed with for

1236
01:12:12.931 --> 01:12:17.931
people that I had put through buds and to see them overseas on their first

1237
01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:21.180
deployment.
Uh,
and the only word for it is,

1238
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:25.620
is afraid to do something because of the consequences.
You know,
there's,
there's,

1239
01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:28.800
as you know,
there's a lot of oversight.
If you pull the trigger on somebody,

1240
01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:33.300
you had better be able to articulate why you did that.
Uh,

1241
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:35.430
you need to be able to conduct yourself over the radio.

1242
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:38.340
You have to be able to paint the picture.
There's a correct way to brief.

1243
01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:40.670
There's the ways that,
you know,
you got to play,
you know,

1244
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:44.640
mental judo and interacting with people.

1245
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.060
And to see these young guys who had no experience and afraid too afraid is not

1246
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:56.280
probably the best word,
but hesitant to make decisions.

1247
01:12:56.281 --> 01:12:58.290
And then at the end of the deployment,

1248
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:03.291
just sharp teeth out knowing what they need to do.

1249
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:05.880
And I can just sit back and it's not,
and again,

1250
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.160
that that's a lot of that is them getting that experience.

1251
01:13:08.161 --> 01:13:13.161
But I was just glad that I was able to be there to provide that buffer because I

1252
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:15.210
wasn't gonna let anything happen while I was out there.

1253
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:19.770
To the best of my ability.
Like I always picked the most dangerous place to be.

1254
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.950
I always wanted to be in a position where there's going to be a decision to be

1255
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:25.350
made like that.
That's just the way that I want to be.

1256
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:27.510
Like where's the most dangerous place to be?

1257
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:30.930
Where's the most optimal place to be put me in coach,
I'm going to be right here.

1258
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:35.740
And then to try to teach other people to do that exact same thing and then to

1259
01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:36.241
step back.

1260
01:13:36.241 --> 01:13:40.290
That to me is probably what I'm the most proud of is the growth of the people

1261
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.124
that I was.

1262
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.210
<v 4>You know,
you talk about that mental judo thing,
which again,</v>

1263
01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:48.600
this is the one that's going to be hard for civilians to understand how much,

1264
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:50.161
you know,

1265
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:55.161
it's like a bureaucratic force that exists in the military and really you have

1266
01:13:57.661 --> 01:14:00.840
to be,
you have to be able to,

1267
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:04.020
to navigate through that.
And that was,

1268
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:08.580
that was the thing for me that I always look back and I go,

1269
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.980
I wish I would've done a better job of teaching that

1270
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.040
<v 3>to guys because I had no problem teaching them the tactical side of things.</v>

1271
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.310
And then if I really was close with someone or really spent some time with them,

1272
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.130
I'd be able to get through the rest of it and say like,
okay,
by the way,

1273
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:22.500
this is how you have to do this,
this is a,

1274
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.770
this is how you have to walk this line,

1275
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:26.470
this is what you have to say in these situations.
And they'd be great.

1276
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:31.090
But some guys would catch,
like some guys would catch the,
uh,
the,

1277
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:35.320
the surface Jocko,
right.
Just like the surface Jocko,

1278
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:38.410
which is like you're old,
right?
Which is,
which is awesome.
Right.

1279
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:41.650
That's absolutely part of,
uh,
part of it.
Right?

1280
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.320
But guys that only caught the surface,
Jocko,

1281
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:48.520
sometimes they get caught up later because they'd say,
you know,
Oh,
this guy was,

1282
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:51.730
uh,
this guy was Pino risk averse.
I'm like,
oh well,
you know,

1283
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.650
here's what you got to do when you got a guy that's where his commercial or this

1284
01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.780
guy's Nico Model,
here's what you got to do.
And he's got a handle them.

1285
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:59.920
So that's something that when I had the opportunity and the time,

1286
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:03.400
but that thing,
the other thing about it is there's no,

1287
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.360
there's no training for that.
That's just,
I was just going to,

1288
01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:10.600
being in the saddle like that is,
there is no one that says,

1289
01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:13.210
and it's hard to even simulate because that means you've got to stimulate some

1290
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:17.650
other human beings rank and characteristics and personality through your

1291
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:20.440
deployment.
I might change halfway through your briefing.
You know,

1292
01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:23.590
you can brief a guy that's all in a good mood and all of a sudden he turns,

1293
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:26.290
cause he saw that you said something that you got to learn how to deal with
that.

1294
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.970
And that political side of,
that's what it is.

1295
01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:30.250
Basically it's political and it's relationships.

1296
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:34.600
Building those things up that is so key.

1297
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:38.800
And once you get into the leadership position,
I hate to say this,

1298
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.010
I hate to say it,
once you're in the leadership position,

1299
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:47.410
that is at least as important as what you're going to do tactically.

1300
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.280
I mean the seal teams have made their mark kinetically,

1301
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.170
but we get our go.
No,
go off of PowerPoint.
Absolutely.

1302
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.990
I mean that's the,

1303
01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:02.350
I've had briefs come back because the helicopter was facing the wrong way on the

1304
01:16:02.351 --> 01:16:05.920
insertion slide.
I've almost gotten into fist fights.
I'm like,
listen,

1305
01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:11.700
it's Helvetica 12 not 11 we're not two in times.

1306
01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:13.370
New Roman shit now.
All right.

1307
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.630
[inaudible] get out of my face with that times new Roman son,

1308
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:21.640
the battlespace commander said it's Helvetica bold sometimes only on the exfil

1309
01:16:21.641 --> 01:16:24.970
slide.
But like,
I mean,
it's insane.
Like we,
we have,

1310
01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:27.520
we can bring some of the most amazing combat power to bear,

1311
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:33.270
but only if the leadership can articulate and navigate what the battle space

1312
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.011
owner wants.

1313
01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:39.010
Cause we don't make sense to a lot of people who don't come from our background.

1314
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:39.790
And you gotta learn,

1315
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:43.270
you gotta learn to read what they're saying and speak their language and then

1316
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.830
you just,
you gotta maneuver.

1317
01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.370
I mean that's the biggest thing is you gotta maneuver and then then you can be

1318
01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:51.070
so wildly effective.
It doesn't matter how good you are tactically.

1319
01:16:51.071 --> 01:16:54.620
If you can't get outside of the wire.
I mean,
and it's truly,

1320
01:16:54.621 --> 01:16:57.550
if I tell people this all the time,
you want to shut down the seal teams,

1321
01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.490
kill Microsoft Office.
We're done.

1322
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.730
We're done.
Yeah.
The whole military is actually very,
you know,

1323
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:10.070
it is a bureaucracy.
You said it's kind of a bureaucracy.
It is the biggest,

1324
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.910
I mean it's 100% bureaucratic.
I mean it's amazing.

1325
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.400
And as an e five you're like,
I just,

1326
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:20.150
I just want to go jam my mags up and then make them empty.
And you're like,
yeah,

1327
01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:20.871
that's awesome.

1328
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:25.010
I'm going to be up for 12 hours looking for the appropriate helicopter icon and

1329
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:29.450
I may get Sassy and have it move in with helicopter noise is,

1330
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:32.020
it depends.
And then you got to be able to brief it,
right?

1331
01:17:32.021 --> 01:17:34.080
Cause then there's a whole other skill,
like I'm,

1332
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:36.800
I don't know how many times you have to go and not only present the brief but

1333
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:40.250
like talk to the guy who's going to say yes or no and develop that relationship

1334
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.380
and you're selling your operation

1335
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:48.300
until you get that relationship where they're coming to you and saying,
Hey,
this,

1336
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.940
which is the best possible case.

1337
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:54.941
And I was blessed to band up in that situation where it was just a total mind

1338
01:17:55.641 --> 01:17:59.020
meld of a,
whatever you guys want to do,
what can you do here?
Can you,

1339
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.383
that's when you,

1340
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:03.170
that's when you just are loving life and it doesn't get any better than that.

1341
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.580
Good Times with PowerPoint.
Oh my God,
you've got,

1342
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.210
you can hit the control key and the Arrow,
it only moves a little bit.

1343
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.940
Need to move that just to get it centered.

1344
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:20.540
I know so much about PowerPoint that I could never forget if I wanted to.

1345
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.920
It's so horrible.
You,
so that was a,
that was an awesome to prelim it though.

1346
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.800
<v 2>It was awesome for different reasons.
I mean,
don't get me wrong,</v>

1347
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:32.830
I w w as an o one was caring generally my 301 bag and to javelin missiles to

1348
01:18:33.441 --> 01:18:37.550
high ground positions and coming back with them all empty the majority of the

1349
01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:37.770
time.

1350
01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.850
<v 3>So I got to have,
yes,
that does go in the boxes.
I got to have a,</v>

1351
01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.250
<v 2>a bit of what we'll call a hoot and then,
but again,</v>

1352
01:18:45.251 --> 01:18:47.110
professionally developing for me too,

1353
01:18:47.111 --> 01:18:49.740
because I didn't have any experience being an op.

1354
01:18:49.741 --> 01:18:54.370
So for a task unit and you wanna talk about relationship stuff,
the sometimes,

1355
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.600
you know,
the base that we were on,

1356
01:18:55.601 --> 01:19:00.280
I just developed a relationship with there and three or s three and ended up,

1357
01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:02.500
I was selling myself.
We had a great relationship.

1358
01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:04.690
I could come to him the day before be like,
hey,
we're looking to do.
And they see,

1359
01:19:04.691 --> 01:19:07.600
he's like,
Yep,
no problem.
Let me know what's lineup a QRF.
And it just,

1360
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.260
it's so much
pulling.
The trigger is easy.

1361
01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:16.600
All the stuff you gotta do to get to that point is so hard and it just doesn't

1362
01:19:16.601 --> 01:19:17.650
make the movies cause it's boring.

1363
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.280
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
there's,
there will,</v>

1364
01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.880
there will literally never be a movie or a book about that crap.

1365
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:25.460
Why can't we have a movie about a 72 hour planning cycle?

1366
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.360
I don't understand where's the three meter imagery?
God dammit,
this is five.

1367
01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:32.310
I heard one of my platoon commanders,
not life,

1368
01:19:32.311 --> 01:19:35.510
the other big Delta platoon commander was telling someone and he goes,
he goes,

1369
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:38.450
you know,
someone was like,
Oh yeah,
you guys got to me.
And he said,
Joe,

1370
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:43.070
I watched Jocko literally beat his head up against a wall for every single

1371
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.900
operation that we did.
I was like,
Oh damn.

1372
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.560
And that wasn't the conventional side.
Yeah.
That was beaten up against.
There was,

1373
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:54.830
you know,
it was our chain of command,
which is very,
um,

1374
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:59.420
which can be very micro focused on little things from time to time.

1375
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.920
Occasionally you get the broad spectrum of leadership inside of the teams.

1376
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:08.040
Not all of it is good,
but you,
whichever,
whichever game

1377
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.470
<v 4>you gotta play,
that's what you got to play.
And that's exactly what I did.</v>

1378
01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:11.490
And that's,
you know,

1379
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:14.610
that's why I always say that had the same relationship with every boss I've ever

1380
01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:16.530
have,
no matter who they were and what,

1381
01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.360
how crazy they were or how awesome they were.

1382
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.660
They trusted me and they were going to give me what I needed to do my job.

1383
01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.870
So that was your last appointment then?
It was,

1384
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:28.470
and then you went to trade at trade at and I was gone

1385
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:34.100
<v 2>check.
I got there in August of 2010.
Yep.
I was while I,</v>

1386
01:20:34.210 --> 01:20:37.490
I think the last time I literally saw you before today was in the hallway right

1387
01:20:37.491 --> 01:20:38.301
by your old office.

1388
01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:42.950
You were walking out and I was coming back from deployment and we're like,
yeah.

1389
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:46.490
So like five years ago,
it's no big deal.
Actually seven years ago.

1390
01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.030
Did you do there?
Uh,
it was the opposite I think.
I mean,

1391
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:54.670
did you get to go out at all?
I didn't do anything.
I augmented the leap frogs.
Um,

1392
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:59.870
I'm not,
I would die.
I don't do good when it comes.
I mean,
I did my job,

1393
01:20:59.871 --> 01:21:04.670
but like I'm not a paperwork,
you know,
Ninja that hall in,
nor is there really,

1394
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:08.780
it's not really an op so much like the trade,
that guy is not the CEO.

1395
01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:12.200
He's the OIC.
So a lot of those positions,
there's redundancy.

1396
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:13.940
There was a training warrant.

1397
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.710
<v 4>Oh.
So it's fairly repetitive.
So there's not like an ad,</v>

1398
01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:20.600
a team with the first time you're going to go through this and now it's

1399
01:21:20.601 --> 01:21:21.290
everything.

1400
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:23.600
<v 2>Did you get through two or three cycles and it's like,
okay,</v>

1401
01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:26.090
you could put this thing on autopilot.
It's the same thing every three,

1402
01:21:26.091 --> 01:21:30.260
six months,
whatever it is.
So I got medically retired,
uh,

1403
01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.950
I was going to just get out of the military.
Uh,

1404
01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.570
I came back from that deployment and that was talking to,
uh,

1405
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:40.430
the officer detailer about what I would need to do to continue my career.

1406
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:43.670
And she said,
well,
you know,

1407
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:46.310
since you haven't done your AOC or your OIC to,

1408
01:21:46.311 --> 01:21:50.130
or what we're going to need you to do is to back to back AOSC.
Oh,
I see.

1409
01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:53.660
Then you're going to do your,
you know,
your disassociated tour.
I'm just like,
we,

1410
01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.810
we can stop right now.
Like,
my wife's not going to tolerate that.

1411
01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:01.190
Like I think she's at the vast limit.
I was at the limit my body,

1412
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.010
like my ankle,
I almost had to medivac myself out a couple of times,

1413
01:22:04.011 --> 01:22:06.740
like roll my ankle extremely bad on a,

1414
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:11.690
on an offset patrol in like laying on target with my foot up in the year.

1415
01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:16.040
It was just,
I was,
I recognize it like my time was over.
Uh,

1416
01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:19.430
so I researched what it would take for me to stay in and continue and it was not

1417
01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.293
tenable.

1418
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:24.110
So I was just going to get out of the military and I was five days from my

1419
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:27.860
separation date and went to go get my physical and the doc's like,
no,

1420
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:32.960
I'm not signing this right on.
Good for him.
Uh,
they extended me a year.

1421
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:37.850
I mean,
I had to go,
I went out to Nico and uh,
but as the did that,

1422
01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.990
as far as the kind of the horsepower for the writeup,

1423
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:43.730
I've got the whole full assessment done and ended up getting medically retired,

1424
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.300
which was a huge benefit to myself all thanks to that doc who was like,
no,

1425
01:22:47.301 --> 01:22:48.770
I'm not,
I'm not going to sign this.

1426
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:52.740
<v 4>Yeah,
that is awesome.
And there's plenty of team guys that,
you know,</v>

1427
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:56.240
spend their entire career.
I'm not going to the doctor.
I'm not going to do.

1428
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.100
And that's another thing that gets conditioned into you going through basic seal

1429
01:22:59.101 --> 01:23:01.020
training,
which is don't go to medical no matter what.

1430
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:02.940
<v 2>Why wasn't the same way?
Even after getting shot,</v>

1431
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:04.930
my medical record was thin and you know,

1432
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:09.160
I was going through the questionnaire and the interview at the actual discharge

1433
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.460
to physical and he's like,
what?
Like you couldn't find any of the documentation.

1434
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:16.510
And then I left Nike with like 300 pages.
Uh,
maybe if you read that thing,

1435
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:17.740
it's like this guy will never,

1436
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.660
I should be in a wheelchair right now with a straw.

1437
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:23.520
Like you read that thing and I'm like,
oh my gosh.
Uh,

1438
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.030
and then you get away to do bureaucracy,
submit a package to the MED board,

1439
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:31.840
and six months later they're like,
okay,
you're out.
And that was it.
That was it.

1440
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:37.220
No retirement ceremony.
I just was like,
Hey,
uh,
went in,
talked to the OIC.

1441
01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.240
I was like,
Hey,
um,
it's almost lunch time.
I'm going to leave now and I'm,

1442
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.153
I'm never going to come.

1443
01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.280
<v 4>How many years was that for you?</v>

1444
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:49.920
<v 2>One month shy of 17.
Yeah.
And so I literally went in,
I was like,
hey,</v>

1445
01:23:49.921 --> 01:23:52.500
it's almost lunch.
I'm leaving.
I'm not going to come back.
And he's like,

1446
01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:53.370
all right,
cool.
See you later.

1447
01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:57.780
I had some terminal leave saved up at like 90 days worth and I just gone,

1448
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.673
never went back in.

1449
01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:03.510
I think I went and got my dd two 14 or like my retirement id card like a year

1450
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.690
later.

1451
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:06.160
<v 4>Yeah.
It just never went back.
It's crazy.</v>

1452
01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.660
It's crazy how you do that time and then it's over like that.

1453
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.290
And in a blink of an eye,
I remember that I was all big.

1454
01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:19.420
Did the retirement ceremony did that,
came back all my,
the rest of my gear,

1455
01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:22.420
which was all packed up in my drawing cage,
went up,
grabbed it,

1456
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.730
pulled in the back,
throw it in the back of my van,
drived out the gate.

1457
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:27.880
That was it.
Yup.
No more.
Yeah.
I just gone,
that's it.
Don't,

1458
01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.950
never do never to be back.
20 years done.
Yup.
It's bizarre.

1459
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:37.600
So then you get into the afterlife.
Indeed.

1460
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.840
What's that been like?
So what,
what year did you,

1461
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.430
what year was that that you retired?

1462
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:46.310
<v 2>I got retired the last day of June,
2013.
Okay.</v>

1463
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:50.190
So I'm coming up on a this year,
it'll be four years.
Uh,
I had,

1464
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:53.370
fortunately I was kind of double dipping on weekends.

1465
01:24:53.371 --> 01:24:55.440
I had a job that I was doing on the weekends,

1466
01:24:55.441 --> 01:24:59.880
so I transitioned to doing that full time.
Uh,
and I dabbled in a lot of stuff.

1467
01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:03.660
I mean I got 3,500 hours of flight time.
I typed,

1468
01:25:03.661 --> 01:25:06.900
rated in a Gulf stream jet,
the citation five 25 jet,

1469
01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:10.170
which gets me like five other jets.
I could fly.
I did.
Uh,

1470
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.030
when did you rack up all those hours?

1471
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:16.890
What I do on my weekends is not know the business of the navy.

1472
01:25:18.450 --> 01:25:21.360
I flew hard.
I mean,
I was just flying a ton.
Uh,

1473
01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:24.000
I got my pilot's license on my own when I was in,

1474
01:25:24.001 --> 01:25:27.060
and then all the rest of the licenses came in the two to three years after,

1475
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.640
after I was in.
But I was just,
was cranking out hours.

1476
01:25:29.641 --> 01:25:33.060
I had a company that I was working for that was paying for all the training so I

1477
01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:37.290
could fly as much as I wanted to.
So I dove in to the bucket both feet.

1478
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:41.370
Uh,
I did charter flying for a bit.
Uh,

1479
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:45.900
I mean I was managing licensing and sponsorship deals for an organization and it

1480
01:25:45.901 --> 01:25:49.620
just,
everything kind of just morphed.
I left that organization,

1481
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:52.200
got back into teaching,
uh,

1482
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.570
military guys a little bit on the jump side of the house.

1483
01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:57.450
I've been passionate about jumping ever since the first of that.
I did come,

1484
01:25:57.451 --> 01:25:59.580
he jumps you over.
I know,
uh,
just over 6,000,

1485
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.920
which seems like a lot until he guys that have 29,000,

1486
01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.620
I jumped at Scott at San Diego all the time.

1487
01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:10.530
And if you work in the sport for any period of time,
you'll be at 10,
15,
20,000.

1488
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:13.520
It's not,
it's not uncommon,
but in the military it's just,

1489
01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:16.760
that's the school bus to get to work.
So it's an ancillary skill set at best.

1490
01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:21.740
So I couldn't pursue it until I got out,
but I,
uh,
when I got,

1491
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:24.710
it was hard for me when I got out,
if I'm being honest.
Um,

1492
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.820
I got to a point where I couldn't watch the news anymore.
You know,
2013,

1493
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:30.740
all of the ground in Iraq,

1494
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:34.840
that was sweat and blood and tears.

1495
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:37.550
If people that we know to gain with being eroded,

1496
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.240
and I describe it like watching the tide go out an inch at a time until all of a

1497
01:26:41.241 --> 01:26:42.080
sudden it's gone.

1498
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.590
And I used to make the news and now I'm sitting here on the couch watching it

1499
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:46.750
and I had to turn it off and it,

1500
01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.780
and I really struggled with finding something that I thought mattered and it's,

1501
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:53.030
it's,
it was tough for me.

1502
01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.820
I didn't think a lot about what I was going to do when I was out,

1503
01:26:55.821 --> 01:26:58.360
when I was in for reasons that we,
we kind of already talked about.

1504
01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:02.470
It's a natural path that you take when you're in a,

1505
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.840
but it took me like a year and a half to really get my head on straight and

1506
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:08.090
figure out what it is that I want to do.

1507
01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:10.520
I still don't even know how I'm going to do it,
uh,

1508
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.360
but I know that I want to make a difference.
I want to do,

1509
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:18.350
I want to make this country a better place than it is right now.

1510
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.770
I want to take the awesome stuff that I was exposed to when I was in the teams,

1511
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.560
from the people that I was fortunate to be surrounded by and,

1512
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.850
and make people better with that information.
How I'm going to do that.

1513
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.270
I don't know,
but that's kind of the circular path that I'm on.

1514
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.490
Like half of my year,
the other half,

1515
01:27:34.491 --> 01:27:39.350
I just dress up in a squirrel suit and jump out of airplanes and off of cliffs,

1516
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:44.780
which is nice.
It doesn't suck.
I'm not going to do it forever though.
I,

1517
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:47.990
and then I look at it as something that's enriching for me and empowering for
me.

1518
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:50.690
But,
uh,
there's a,

1519
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:53.630
there's a timeline for how long I could do it.
I mean,

1520
01:27:53.631 --> 01:27:56.310
I'm a bad landing away from not being able to jump anymore.
And I,

1521
01:27:56.311 --> 01:27:59.600
and I take it very seriously.
I have a very structured training protocol.

1522
01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:01.850
I don't let myself get out of currency,

1523
01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:05.180
whether it be jumping or packing parachutes or,
I mean,

1524
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:08.060
I treat it like a military operation.
It doesn't make it safer for me.

1525
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:12.320
But I tried to pay attention more than anybody else who was around me.

1526
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:15.680
And my goal was to never be surprised.
Like,
I don't ever,

1527
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:19.490
I want to understand what's coming and I,
and I don't like,
and it happens.

1528
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:20.061
Occasionally you'll,

1529
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:23.930
you'll jump off of a cliff or you're jumping out of an airplane or something

1530
01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:24.980
will happen that surprises you.

1531
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:27.430
And I try to avoid that at all costs because I find that,
you know,

1532
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:31.700
that's when the catastrophic stuff can occur,
but it's a,

1533
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:33.920
you got to find the next step.
I mean,

1534
01:28:33.921 --> 01:28:38.921
you and I both know people who derive their entire identity from what they used

1535
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:44.480
to do and it's tough to sit back and watch them not be able to depart from that

1536
01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:48.040
because he becomes,
it's self destructive.
Yeah.

1537
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:51.440
Because it doesn't last forever.
It can't last forever.
I mean,

1538
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:54.530
you're renting your tried and it's not yours.

1539
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:59.300
You're at best you can move the marker in the seal teams,

1540
01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:02.940
hopefully in the right direction.
Maybe leave a little bit of legacy if you did.

1541
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:03.841
You know,

1542
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:07.410
the legacy that you should leave is making it better than when you got there.

1543
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:09.990
But that's the best you can do.
And then you've got to put it away.

1544
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:13.410
Even if you did 20 years,
what's the average lifespan of an American?

1545
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.570
You got some time left and the military retirement check,

1546
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:23.520
it's not massive,
so you're going to need another job.
Uh,

1547
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:26.790
but what I needed,
I needed a purpose and that's where I started doing,
you know,

1548
01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:30.510
fundraising for the seal foundation.
That to me was huge.

1549
01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:31.980
Teaching the military guys,

1550
01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.190
goose kind of felt like I had not a foot in the fight,

1551
01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:39.360
but I had some impact again.
And just trying to shorten their learning curve.
Uh,

1552
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:42.930
cause they expect these guys to know so much stuff that if you could just

1553
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:44.310
shorten their learning curve and give him,

1554
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:47.550
I'll give you a little bit of space to breathe,
you know,
to take the stress off.

1555
01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.290
<v 4>And that's those real,
yeah,
like that stuff is real.
And when you,</v>

1556
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.470
when you impart that knowledge on young guys,
it is real.

1557
01:29:54.471 --> 01:29:58.760
When you make that learning curve shorter and steeper and faster,
that is real.

1558
01:29:58.761 --> 01:30:01.790
That has a real impact on those,
on those kids to go out there.

1559
01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:05.090
And it's those little lessons that they learned.
And I,
I mean I,

1560
01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.540
I still hear that from guys that come back and,
and they said,
Yep,
yeah,

1561
01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:11.510
we need this cover move.
You know?
I'm like,
yes,

1562
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.850
I'm so happy to hear that.

1563
01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.920
Cause I know it's kind of like the early days of Jujitsu in the fact that we

1564
01:30:18.921 --> 01:30:22.040
didn't really,
in the early days of Jujitsu,

1565
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.080
there wasn't as much knowledge as there is now.

1566
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:29.840
And now the first three days you go to Jujitsu,

1567
01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:30.950
you're going to learn about under hooks,

1568
01:30:30.951 --> 01:30:32.150
you're going to learn about body position,

1569
01:30:32.151 --> 01:30:34.940
you're going to learn about hip movement.
I didn't learn,

1570
01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:38.480
no one taught me that stuff back back the duty.
No one,

1571
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:42.050
no one taught you that stuff.
You just had to figure it out.

1572
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:45.620
And if somebody teaches it to you,
it's like you take a quantum leap.

1573
01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.090
And it's the same thing with the guys that are in the military and they can get

1574
01:30:50.091 --> 01:30:52.310
that quantum leap just by saying,
Oh,

1575
01:30:52.311 --> 01:30:57.200
here's a perspective of leadership that it took me Jack Ass Jocko,

1576
01:30:57.350 --> 01:31:00.950
you know,
14 years and screwing up a bunch of things to go,
oh,

1577
01:31:00.951 --> 01:31:03.800
this is what you need to do in these situations.
So to be able to say,
look,

1578
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.510
you don't need to be the jackass and I was,

1579
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:08.600
all you need to do is know this little bit tidbit right here in this whole thing

1580
01:31:08.601 --> 01:31:11.630
over here.
Yeah.
And that definitely has a,
has a huge impact on those guys.

1581
01:31:11.631 --> 01:31:13.520
And it's,
it is awesome to feel that.

1582
01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.050
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:16.780
When he makes him better learning the other stuff because they're less stressed

1584
01:31:16.781 --> 01:31:18.880
out,
they have a better understanding and it's just,

1585
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.830
and like 90% of this stuff I teach,
I'm like,
listen,
it's pattern recognition.

1586
01:31:23.831 --> 01:31:27.490
I saw this so many times,
then I did this and it defeated that.
So just do this.

1587
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.250
Just trust me and do this and you'll be better.

1588
01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.830
And then they do and they're like,
oh wow,
that was awesome.
Like,
yeah,
I know.

1589
01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.693
That's why I told you.

1590
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:39.330
<v 4>How about the,
uh,
you talk about the foundation.
Yeah.
What are you doing?</v>

1591
01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:42.620
Tell us a little bit about the foundation and how if people want to support the

1592
01:31:42.621 --> 01:31:43.970
foundation,
what's the best way to get that done?

1593
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:48.380
<v 2>Yeah.
Uh,
so obviously they're,
I think they're,
the last stat I heard,</v>

1594
01:31:48.381 --> 01:31:53.381
there was 40,000 service based organizations that help people peripheral to the

1595
01:31:53.961 --> 01:31:57.770
military.
So there's a variety of choices and if you're from an army family,

1596
01:31:57.771 --> 01:31:59.440
awesome,
go support and army charity,
right?

1597
01:31:59.441 --> 01:32:04.180
I obviously have a close DNA tie to seals.
So,
uh,

1598
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:09.010
a buddy of mine recommended,
uh,

1599
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.630
trying some stuff,

1600
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.490
skydiving and the sky diving world to try to drive attention to fundraise for

1601
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.390
the seal foundation because just like I've never had,

1602
01:32:18.391 --> 01:32:20.320
I think a unique thought in my entire life.

1603
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:22.900
I swear that every idea I've ever had came from somebody else.

1604
01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:25.240
It was like this one was his.
Uh,

1605
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:28.600
but to me that was the link to finding a purpose again because I realized that,

1606
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.960
okay,
my,
my days of putting my toes on the line or over,

1607
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.290
but there will always be people with their toes on the line.

1608
01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:39.700
And the next best step is let's create a buffer for the families to step in.

1609
01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:42.000
Because,
I mean,
you've seen it.
It's a,
I,

1610
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.020
the knock on the door is a tornado wrapped inside of a tsunami with a hurricane

1611
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:49.030
at the same time and it is destructive.

1612
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:53.110
So let's try to do something that helps the families.
Uh,

1613
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:54.910
and that's what the seal foundation does.

1614
01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:59.550
Everything from educational support to legacy preservation,
uh,

1615
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.000
and everything in between.
I mean,
you can go,

1616
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:04.930
the navy seal foundation has an awesome website.
Uh,

1617
01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:06.820
and there's people who do go fund me is,

1618
01:33:06.821 --> 01:33:09.430
which is what I did or go to the foundation and donate directly.

1619
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:11.980
Cause I mean there,
you can look at their rating as well too.

1620
01:33:11.981 --> 01:33:16.720
It's like 96 cents at every buck goes to what they espouse.

1621
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:21.220
It's going to go to,
it's awesome.
Like it's a great foundation.
Uh,
yeah.

1622
01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:25.480
Do some research on and get involved and skip a latte one day,
you know,

1623
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.110
donate five bucks and it goes to,
it goes to a good,

1624
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:31.420
it goes to a good cause.
Uh,

1625
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.380
I've been into some houses where kids are getting raised by a memory of a father

1626
01:33:35.381 --> 01:33:39.160
and a picture of her fireplace and no money will ever replace that,

1627
01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:43.520
but maybe we'll make their life a little bit easier.
No doubt about that.

1628
01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:48.170
What was the,
what was the record you are going after a yes.

1629
01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:52.110
He completely arbitrary distance lateral measurement of distance in a wingsuit.

1630
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.640
So I,

1631
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:57.910
that was the idea where all good ideas start,

1632
01:33:57.911 --> 01:34:01.120
which was in a bar over a cocktail and buddy was like,
hey man,

1633
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:03.970
you should go try to set a world record in your wing suit.
I'm like,

1634
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:06.190
well if I don't even own one yet,
so what are you talking about?

1635
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:11.110
I'll do it of course.
But like what's the record?
I was like,
if,

1636
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.580
I mean,
yeah,
obviously crush it,

1637
01:34:12.581 --> 01:34:16.210
but what is it exactly again and where do I get one of those?
Uh,

1638
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.240
and it was trying to set the furthest distance,

1639
01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:26.080
our farthest distance,
sorry,
the farthest distance flown in a wingsuit.
So,

1640
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:27.603
uh,

1641
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:32.080
bought a wingsuit and after jumping it for less than a year,

1642
01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:35.660
which I don't recommend to anybody to do this ever,
uh,

1643
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.090
I got hooked up with a really good mentor.

1644
01:34:37.091 --> 01:34:38.800
The Guy who actually taught me how to base jump,

1645
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.460
taught me how to fly the suit and we went up to Davis,

1646
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:46.510
California and I jumped out of a caravan at 36,500 feet,

1647
01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:49.990
got into a lovely spin,
which I had never happened before.

1648
01:34:49.991 --> 01:34:53.980
So that was a great experience.
It was new for everybody and uh,

1649
01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:58.010
got out of it and then just flew the suit as far as I could and up breaking two

1650
01:34:58.011 --> 01:35:01.610
world records,
one for the distance that you fly before opening your parachute.

1651
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:04.760
And then the second one is they tack on the distance,
uh,

1652
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:08.060
from when you open your parachute to when you touch the ground and keep flying

1653
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:10.190
forward.
Yeah.
And I had a on heading opening,

1654
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:12.680
so it just opened up in that direction and I was exhausted.

1655
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:17.180
So I just laid there like a limp piece of meat and augured into the ground,

1656
01:35:17.181 --> 01:35:21.590
into a farmer's field.
Because I had no,
I had like,
my landing zone was earth.

1657
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.010
I couldn't see the airport that I was.

1658
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:29.570
I had some visual indicators Farnworth 18.25 miles.

1659
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.450
So I got out of this bird and I passed.

1660
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:36.290
You really get into a spin when you came out.
What happened?
Just nowhere.

1661
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.580
I'm just not really good in a Wednesday,

1662
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:42.140
and I didn't have the requisite skill or competence to the attempting.
What else?

1663
01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:46.820
It's tempting,
but it was a challenge in front of me and I was like,

1664
01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.680
of course I'm going to do this.
I hadn't,

1665
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:51.770
I literally had not been jumping wingsuits I did that jump in August.

1666
01:35:51.771 --> 01:35:55.190
I got my first wing suit in December of the year prior.
It's not,
uh,

1667
01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.590
not recommended for people.
Uh,
so I got in the spin and I got out of it,

1668
01:36:00.591 --> 01:36:01.690
but I got out of the plane.

1669
01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:05.870
I knew where the airport was and I knew I was going to fly in that direction,

1670
01:36:05.871 --> 01:36:10.190
but I passed the airport at over 10,000 feet in the air and then it was just

1671
01:36:10.191 --> 01:36:13.280
looking at fields and data.
So I just put my head down and was flying.

1672
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:15.230
I didn't have an altimeter on me.
It was awesome.

1673
01:36:15.231 --> 01:36:18.770
There was so many things that were just,
I was eyeballing it,
calibrate.

1674
01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:21.350
And before I went I was like camera one,
camera two,
camera one.

1675
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:25.160
But I had just come back from a base jumping trip to Europe.

1676
01:36:26.130 --> 01:36:27.980
Thank goodness I had,
cause I'm flying,

1677
01:36:27.981 --> 01:36:30.920
I'm like this trees are looking really big.
Oh yeah.

1678
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.710
Those trees are looking really big.
I'm going to pull,
you know,

1679
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:38.690
moderately low opening altitude.
Flew straight into the dirt and yeah,

1680
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:41.930
people are like,
oh you gonna cause it's been broken since then.
Uh,
a marine did.

1681
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:47.370
And be like,
Oh,
you're going to go for it again.
But no,
never ever watch.
Right.

1682
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:52.820
I got into the spin because the plane,
the Cessna Two oh six,

1683
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.920
the caravan is not designed to be that high.

1684
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:58.730
Like you'd had a supercharged engine,
a different propeller system.

1685
01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.000
Everything was stripped out of there except for the huge oxygen bottle.

1686
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:06.040
It was just the pilot,
the oxygen tech and me.
And you know,

1687
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:07.160
normally when you're Scott having,

1688
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:09.320
they'll pull back on the throttle to slow down.

1689
01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.010
It called given you a cut cut of the airspeed.
Well,

1690
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:15.530
if he would have done that at that out,
so we'd have fallen out of the sky.

1691
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:20.600
So he's like guide his fist on the throttle with his foot on the dash pulling

1692
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.670
back.
And I opened the door and I stuck my head out.
I was like,
oh no,

1693
01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:29.450
oh no.
And I'm jumping like the biggest wing suit on the market.

1694
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.650
And they're like,
they're a combination of a prom dress and a straight jacket.

1695
01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:39.350
And I got out of the plane and it just inflated and I'm like,

1696
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:44.030
Oh boy,
here we go.
That's good times right there.

1697
01:37:44.290 --> 01:37:46.790
Ooh,
yeah.
Coming at you full speed.

1698
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.940
But you raised some money for the sort of foundation.
Yeah,
the,

1699
01:37:49.941 --> 01:37:53.120
it's like 150,000 bucks for the foundation.
And you know,

1700
01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:56.250
from that I developed a great relationship with,
um,

1701
01:37:56.790 --> 01:38:01.320
the CEO of the foundation is married to my first troop chief that I had when I

1702
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:05.130
was at the east coast.
So there's a great tie in a and anytime.
Yeah.

1703
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:10.680
Yeah.
Anytime that they call me though,
like my default answer is yes.
Like,

1704
01:38:10.681 --> 01:38:13.980
of course I'll help out anything that I can do.
And it,
I mean,
honestly,

1705
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:16.170
like I wouldn't say that it saved me,
but it helped,

1706
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.500
it helped get me back on the road that I should have been in to have a purpose

1707
01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:23.340
like that.
And then,
I mean,
I,
I bet ya,

1708
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:25.920
I hypothesize that for you,

1709
01:38:25.921 --> 01:38:29.760
working with organizations and leaders and seeing the light come on makes you,

1710
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:32.250
you know what I mean?
It's,
it gives you a purpose in life again,

1711
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:34.680
to impart those lessons is exactly the same thing for me.

1712
01:38:34.681 --> 01:38:38.310
So one built to the other,
they kind of got my feet in the,

1713
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.620
in the pool of interfacing with people like that and,

1714
01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:44.040
and I realized that it makes a difference and it's important.

1715
01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.030
<v 5>That's awesome.
Well,
it's been awesome to,
uh,
to hang out with you.
Yeah.</v>

1716
01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:49.931
I appreciate it.

1717
01:38:49.931 --> 01:38:54.931
Once every seven years we should do it pens and speaking of purpose and go,

1718
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:56.223
Charles,

1719
01:38:57.010 --> 01:39:02.010
we know you have one purpose and that is to kind of inform anybody that might

1720
01:39:02.021 --> 01:39:06.580
want to support this podcast on how they might be able to do that.

1721
01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:10.090
Just to clarify,
oh,
here we go.

1722
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:15.050
My purpose to inform is part of a greater purpose.
Okay.

1723
01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.550
Undisclosed for now.
Understand.

1724
01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:22.470
When you jumped out with a wingsuit and you went into the spin,

1725
01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.580
did you think that that was,
that was it for you?
No,

1726
01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:29.670
I never think like that day I would say somebody comment because I said the

1727
01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:33.190
other day on,
I forget.
I don't know if we had someone on the podcast,

1728
01:39:33.191 --> 01:39:37.420
but I was saying that like when I'm flying in an aircraft in a,

1729
01:39:37.421 --> 01:39:40.960
in a commercial airliner,
I think if this thing crashes,
I'm going to live.

1730
01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.270
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1731
01:39:43.271 --> 01:39:46.270
I'm going to grab this chair seat and I'm going to turn it into something.

1732
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:48.820
I'm going to throw it in the water that's going to break the surface tension.

1733
01:39:48.821 --> 01:39:50.110
I'm going to live.
What?
The next question.

1734
01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.700
I'm not saying that it was gonna work out great for me.

1735
01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.160
I'm gonna Die Missing my fingernails cause I'm clawing my way towards victory.

1736
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.810
Like that thought never enters the mind like,
okay,

1737
01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:05.290
I need to give up now because it's over about that you have that much of a

1738
01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.830
choice but you still fight period.
Yeah,
no,

1739
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:14.200
that's good because yeah.
Yeah,
I'd probably be the same way

1740
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:19.340
anyway.
Uh,

1741
01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:25.020
let's talk about some support.
Let's do it.
Let's talk about on it,
you know,
on it.

1742
01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:28.570
You heard the on it.
Yeah,
of course.
Of course.
You have everyone as you go,

1743
01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:32.590
you're good.
Perhaps just check,
hey,

1744
01:40:32.650 --> 01:40:36.820
I need it anyway on it.
Uh,
more Krill oil,

1745
01:40:36.821 --> 01:40:40.400
so I'm good to go baseline.
Um,

1746
01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:46.810
on it is a,
what do you call them?
A sponsor,
supporter,

1747
01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.673
supporter.

1748
01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:52.540
So if you want to support this podcast and or you yourself at the same time and

1749
01:40:52.541 --> 01:40:56.900
you're into,
you work out a lot,
um,
we recommend on it.

1750
01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:00.850
Supplements take on it's apartments.
It's the only one,
the best one anyway.

1751
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.880
You want 10% off on it.com/jocko that's they get the 10% off.

1752
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.440
Anyway.
Yeah,
that's a good and a good way.
The last podcast,

1753
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.970
yes people know did.
Yeah.
We had colonel reader on here,

1754
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.750
you know,
a Vietnam veteran and I pre-brief Echo.
I said,
look,

1755
01:41:19.751 --> 01:41:21.850
this guy's flying in.
He got up at three o'clock in the morning,

1756
01:41:21.851 --> 01:41:25.210
he's coming to here at six o'clock at night to do a three hour podcasts.

1757
01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:28.000
He's been in a conference all day when it comes to,
you know,

1758
01:41:28.001 --> 01:41:32.170
time to go through your stuff,
go through it quickly.
And people said,
hey,

1759
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:33.940
did you have echo on a leash?
And I said,

1760
01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.850
we just pre-brief we're just respecting the colonel's time.

1761
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:41.700
So I've get the feeling right now.
We could be paying for that.
Yeah.

1762
01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:44.200
Metaphorically I did have a leash for sure.

1763
01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:47.300
Usually,

1764
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:51.820
usually I tell us a cool story because it's not like,
hey,

1765
01:41:51.821 --> 01:41:55.630
take a krill oil and then I don't take Krill oil or I take it in and I'm like,

1766
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:56.920
whatever.
This doesn't work at work.

1767
01:41:56.921 --> 01:42:01.921
So during the week I work out and I kind of talk about my experience positive or

1768
01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:08.320
negative,
but in this case never negative cause it actually works.

1769
01:42:08.321 --> 01:42:13.321
It's one of the only a supplement companies that you know will work anyway.

1770
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:17.110
I'm not going to go into any stories that only worked out a few times this week

1771
01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.920
and it's all the same story.
Why did you only work on a few times this week?
Oh,

1772
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.180
various um,
thinks,
oh you know,
okay,

1773
01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.270
I worked out today.
What?
Okay.
No,
I'm just making sure.

1774
01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:31.930
It sounds like there might be some slack,
you know,
that goes world right now.

1775
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.250
Yeah.
And you know,
maybe,
maybe not.
Let us even,
even if I told you the story,

1776
01:42:36.251 --> 01:42:38.380
it'd be a redundant story.
You know what I'm saying?

1777
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.900
Like my joints feel good.
You know,
people know that already taking Krill oil,

1778
01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:48.430
that's what happens anyway.
If you like these supplements,

1779
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:51.130
if you don't even actually,
if you don't know about the supplements,

1780
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.270
get them and make your own evaluation,
you know?

1781
01:42:53.271 --> 01:42:57.700
Gotta listen to me anymore anyway.
So let's switch over to Amazon.
Amazon,

1782
01:42:57.701 --> 01:42:58.534
click through.

1783
01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:02.230
So how that works is if you want to support this podcast before you do your

1784
01:43:02.231 --> 01:43:02.981
Amazon shopping,

1785
01:43:02.981 --> 01:43:07.981
could@jockopodcast.com click on the Amazon banner then do your shopping

1786
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.863
supports.

1787
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:17.440
I made the sodium in the water analogy.
You know,
you know when you,
it's like,

1788
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:20.380
it's not just sodium,
it's like potassium.
It's like heavy metals,

1789
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:23.110
I think it's called.
You throw them in water.
Boom.
Big Explosion.

1790
01:43:23.111 --> 01:43:27.190
I make the analogy that clicking through Amazon is a small action.
Takes what,

1791
01:43:27.191 --> 01:43:32.080
three seconds,
right?
Yeah.
Maybe not even.
And you think,
Oh yeah,

1792
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:34.060
I'm going to,
you know,
click through and I'm going to do my shopping.

1793
01:43:34.061 --> 01:43:38.380
That doesn't because of my action.
My small action doesn't,
it's not a big deal.

1794
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:40.490
But here's the thing.
That's my action is a big deal.

1795
01:43:40.491 --> 01:43:41.680
It's just like sodium in water.

1796
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:46.300
It's a be the sodium if you want to support.
Um,

1797
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:49.180
so click through and do your shopping.
Boom.
That's a good,
good,

1798
01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:52.820
good way to support podcasts.
Also,
subscribe.

1799
01:43:52.821 --> 01:43:57.440
If you haven't already on Itunes,
leave a review.

1800
01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:03.230
Jocker runs him on stitcher,
Google play.
Not everyone has an iPhone.
I know.
Yeah,

1801
01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:07.500
I always,
somebody asked about some other thing to soundcloud,
soundcloud.

1802
01:44:07.501 --> 01:44:11.750
So I'm not 100% sure of how that works.

1803
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:16.910
I explored soundcloud before.
Um,
unless there's like a separate thing,

1804
01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.870
it does push her how to do that.
Yeah.

1805
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.830
If we're missing on soundcloud didn't then,
yeah,
I'm sure that that should,

1806
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:30.470
should be where we should be as well.
Anyway.
Subscriber time subscriber.
Yeah.

1807
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:35.160
To whatever the one that you're doing.
Google play iTunes,
whichever.
Subscribe.

1808
01:44:35.161 --> 01:44:39.000
If you haven't already leave review.
If you feel like it.
Um,

1809
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.780
youtube,
we have a youtube channel.
Subscribe to that one.
Put more videos.

1810
01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.510
I know before when you were watching you were like,
hey,

1811
01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:51.290
these are just podcasts videos,
right.
Number,
some good stuff.

1812
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.540
You got some good stuff that we do now and that's the point.

1813
01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:55.910
That's the point I'm making.
So we put more videos on there now.

1814
01:44:55.911 --> 01:45:00.530
Just made one that what yesterday.
Um,
that'll be up soon.
Anyway,

1815
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.080
subscribe to that.
If you haven't already,
you'll get that.
So there's alert.

1816
01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:08.330
Is that one going to be out by soon?
Yeah,
few days rarely go Charles Video.

1817
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:13.210
Yeah,
it's more mellow,
more cerebral.
Oh,
standby.

1818
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.170
I then want you to,
it's,
it's cool.
It's fun I guess.
Anyway,

1819
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.120
if you,
if you have the inclination to get a tee shirt as well,

1820
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:27.210
Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store Url Jocko,

1821
01:45:27.211 --> 01:45:31.220

1822
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.720

Uh,

1823
01:45:34.130 --> 01:45:38.810
the delivery time now from purchase to deliveries quicker.
No,
no,

1824
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:44.120
oh,
so yeah,
go there,
Jacqueline.
store.com.
If you like what you see,
go ahead.

1825
01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:48.140
Grab one of that.
That's a good a way to support.
There you go.
Ah,

1826
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:53.120
but psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what to,

1827
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:56.600
you know,
psychological warfare.
Yeah,
support it.
Oh,
there you go.

1828
01:45:56.601 --> 01:46:00.160
See how can you not really,
I mean,
that's a rhetorical question.

1829
01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:03.350
I think you're right about that.
So yeah,
if you don't know,
it's,
you know,

1830
01:46:03.351 --> 01:46:07.730
when you have moments of weakness,
if you're getting up early in the morning,

1831
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.110
tarred,
tired on a press news or whatever,
or you're going to,
you know,

1832
01:46:12.111 --> 01:46:13.040
you're about to work out,

1833
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:15.350
but you'll skip the workout because you're not feeling like it.

1834
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.500
Moments of weakness.
You get this album,

1835
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:22.610
you can download each individual track or um,
the whole album,
whatever.

1836
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.040
Jack will get you through it.
It's like a spot makes you want to do the work.

1837
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:32.510
I wanna wake up early anyway.
Itunes,
psychological warfare,
search,

1838
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:34.310
psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink.

1839
01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:39.580
We're actually getting some requests now for other moments of weakness.

1840
01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:42.410
Yeah.
But like,
hey,
this moment of weakness,

1841
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:46.320
we need to track this moment of weakness.
Need a track.
So like what?

1842
01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.520
I'm logging those down because someone was saying when I get tired,

1843
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.650
<v 4>oh,
in other words it's 10 o'clock at night,
I'm getting tired.</v>

1844
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:57.320
I still have work to do.
Yeah.

1845
01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:00.920
I think I'm just going to blow off the work and just go to sleep because that's

1846
01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:01.773
an easy route.

1847
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:07.020
Maybe we need a track for things like that as possible because you know the

1848
01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:09.960
whole thing biologically,
when you hit the wall,
right,

1849
01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:14.070
that's your body really in a way saying like,
hey,
you're,
you're going too far.

1850
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.730
But nowadays in our environment,

1851
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:21.690
going to far is beneficial because you have this other goal that your body in a

1852
01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:23.430
way doesn't really know about.

1853
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:28.710
So psychological warfare will help you get past that portraiture adi and check.

1854
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.170
Exactly right.
Get your mind not.
Yeah.
So anyway,
jump on that man.
That's a,

1855
01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.840
that's the one that's supporting yourself fully anyway,

1856
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:42.230
it has been number one since the day it was released straight up.

1857
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:46.110
That's pretty cool.
I'm not mad at that at all.
Know why that is.

1858
01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:50.310
Why cause useful people are supporting the podcast and that's,
yeah,

1859
01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:51.000
that's pretty cool.

1860
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.720
So thank you for way less people skipping workouts way more people are waking up

1861
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:59.040
early,
obviously Gigo and those are the leaks.

1862
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.370
Also,
while you're clicking through Amazon,

1863
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:06.540
you can pick up the books that we review on the podcast,
right?

1864
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:09.960
We just did my captivity in Vietnam through the valley,

1865
01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:13.800
my captivity tivity in Vietnam and it's a great book,

1866
01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:16.410
but there's all the other books that we've reviewed on there are on,

1867
01:48:16.411 --> 01:48:20.340
they're on here are on there.
So pick those up.
Extreme ownership.

1868
01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:25.300
There's a little book,
it's about combat

1869
01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.640
and it's about leadership.
It's about combat leadership.
Well,
what else is there?

1870
01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:36.740
What else would you want to read out about Jocko white tea?
A couple things.

1871
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:40.130
Jocko,
white tea,

1872
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.870

1873
01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.930
You Know Leo [inaudible],

1874
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:54.430

1875
01:48:54.501 --> 01:48:59.501
solid when you get the t on also I've heard it called problem solver.

1876
01:49:01.341 --> 01:49:04.730
T because of the problems that you have,
little bit of tea,

1877
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:09.620
Allston problems are getting solved.
So you can do that.
And,

1878
01:49:09.621 --> 01:49:14.290
and by the way it sounds like,

1938
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:05.500
we started out tonight talking about the debt that cannot be repaid

1939
01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.910
and that is very true.
We cannot,

1940
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:16.530
we cannot repay that debt.

1941
01:53:16.531 --> 01:53:21.531
We owe too much to those that have fallen for our freedom.

1942
01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:26.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1943
01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:29.020
<v 0>But
you know what?</v>

1944
01:53:29.021 --> 01:53:33.100
We can do and what we must do

1945
01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:40.170
is try,
try,

1946
01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:45.410
try to live every day with that thought in mind,

1947
01:53:45.511 --> 01:53:50.511
that fought of the service end of the sacrifice of those that gave their last

1948
01:53:52.921 --> 01:53:55.260
full measure for us,

1949
01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:59.580
for our freedom,

1950
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:05.183
freedom,

1951
01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.800
this nebulous concept that can be so hard for some people to grasp of,

1952
01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:18.750
I will tell you,
it is a real thing

1953
01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.320
then it's a thing that's hard to recognize until Edis taking from you and the

1954
01:54:28.051 --> 01:54:29.760
chains of oppression,

1955
01:54:29.761 --> 01:54:33.210
control your body and your mind and then

1956
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.150
win.
Your freedom is taken away.

1957
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:43.900
That is when you realize that freedom is the most important thing.

1958
01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:51.020
The singular thing that gives each of us

1959
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:56.630
be divine opportunity,

1960
01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:02.810
that owned be freedom can give
to think

1961
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:05.660
and to speak,

1962
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.250
and to do as we wish

1963
01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:18.060
and to do all of those things.
Be Holding to know,

1964
01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.073
man.

1965
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:23.303
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1966
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:26.140
<v 0>and yet,</v>

1967
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:29.380
wow with that freedom,

1968
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.690
<v 1>okay,</v>

1969
01:55:31.690 --> 01:55:33.580
<v 0>we are beholden to no one.</v>

1970
01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.360
Let us choose.

1971
01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:44.860
Let us consciously and choose to be beholden for ever beholden to those men and

1972
01:55:51.031 --> 01:55:56.031
women who have relinquished their lives so selflessly

1973
01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.520
upon the altar of freedom.

1974
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:06.743
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.230
<v 0>For them,
beholden to them.</v>

1976
01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:11.420
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1977
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.500
<v 0>let us live</v>

1978
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:19.410
with purpose and with passion.

1979
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:21.780
Let us leave.

1980
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.600
Live lives worthy of their solemn sacrifice,

1981
01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.320
but us live lives worthy of the price that has been paid worthy of the freedom

1982
01:56:40.831 --> 01:56:45.120
we are blessed with and worthy of those heroes

1983
01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:50.100
we are for ever

1984
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.050
beholden to

1985
01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:02.060
let us live for them.

1986
01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.610
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1987
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:15.390
And so until next time,

1988
01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.750
this is Andy,
an echo and Jocko

1989
01:57:23.730 --> 01:57:24.030
<v 1>out.</v>
