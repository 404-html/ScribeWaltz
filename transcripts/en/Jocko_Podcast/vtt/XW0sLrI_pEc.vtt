00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.670
This is Jocko podcast number one 27 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.590
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.620
You Owe Jima is to me,
hallowed blessing.

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
Spiritual,
sacred,
pure ground.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.200
If the spirits of the dead could speak,
what would they be saying to me?

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.040
Count off Marines and sailors.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.460
You have the vanquish dead when you're number reaches 7,000 we will know that

8
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.760
you are present and accounted for in this.
Your eternal duty station

9
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.460
serve well.

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
Your ranks are growing each passing day as some of us,

11
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.790
your mates and war are coming to join you.

12
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.730
Those endless hours of terrifying nights,
the carnage,

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
devastation and pain turned hope into despair.

14
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.740
The remnants of formally dynamic human bodies that carried hearts filled with

15
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.410
dreams of peace,
home and loved ones.

16
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.950
After the rush of battle,
my eyes became heavy with tears.

17
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.110
My body trembled with rage.
As I looked upon the broken bodies,

18
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.690
the searing invasion of human flesh,

19
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.520
aftermath of war,

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.700
an elemental suffocating fear through and through my very soul.

21
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.160
The intensely surging immediacy of the action was aggravated.

22
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.630
No place to hide.

23
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.860
There was not only an incompatibilities between the marines and the defending

24
00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:01.450
jobs,
but the very nature of this morbid little island.

25
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.023
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.520
<v 0>The sounds of battle,</v>

27
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.030
which we're intensified by the human voice with all its emotions are absent

28
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:13.654
today.

29
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.250
The moral revulsion that took place here so many years ago has been forgotten

30
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.920
except by those who fought here and survived

31
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.320
and those who lost lost loved ones here.

32
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.980
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.980
<v 0>and that is an excerpt from a book called</v>

34
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.040
Hell yes.
I do it again,

35
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.620
written by a man

36
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.710
actually written by a marine named t Fred Harvey,

37
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.280
who fought in war two in the Pacific

38
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v 2>feet theater,</v>

39
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
including in the battle of Iwo Jima where he was severely wounded for a second

40
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.524
time,

41
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600
but he survived the war and his lived an amazing life and it is an incredible

42
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.510
honor to have this hero here with us to share some of the lessons that he

43
00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:31.370
learned.
Mr. Harvey,
welcome to the show.

44
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.240
<v 3>I'm glad to be here.</v>

45
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.360
I've heard a lot about this show and I'm really pleased that you've invited me

46
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.120
to come here and to speak to the,
yeah.

47
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.990
<v 2>Well maybe you can just keep coming back because we'll just sit and listen to</v>

48
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.480
you.
We got no problem with that,
sir.
Um,

49
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.690
so I guess we always try and go back to the beginning a little bit and learn a

50
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.880
little bit about you and,
and I know you're,

51
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.060
you're growing up and your book has a bunch of incredible anecdotal stories

52
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:08.680
about what it was like growing up in Texas during the depression.
So,

53
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.690
you know,
I was talking to you earlier and I said,

54
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.950
people don't know what the depression was really like.
And uh,

55
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.130
you described it in one word.
You said hungry.

56
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.500
So that's a real thing,
huh?
During the depression?

57
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.300
<v 3>Yeah,
that was a real thing.</v>

58
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.190
I vividly remember all the good times while leading and the hungry times when I

59
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.470
was really hungry.
I joined the Marine Corps.

60
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.160
That's the first time I had adequate food.

61
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.450
Satisfied that hunger within.

62
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860
<v 2>So,
and you,
you,
you grew up with a single mom for the most part.
So you,</v>

63
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.980
I know your dad was doing good in construction,
but then the depression hit.

64
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.671
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

65
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:01.671
the depression hit and it really hit the Harvey family at one time.

66
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.870
The Harvard family consisted of 11 people,

67
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.150
nine girls,
two boys,
uh,
father and mother.

68
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.590
And My mother was the center of my universe when I went into the Marine Corps

69
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.770
and the last night that are spending,
no Dasha before I got to bootcamp.

70
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.360
<v 3>The train stopped in my hometown of Odessa.</v>

72
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.880
<v 3>And they had the band high school band and a lot of people from town are there</v>

74
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.510
to greet us.
That conductor say,

75
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520
we're going to stop for 20 minutes because people are voted as a,

76
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.950
to see off every three of us going into the Marine Corps at that time when we

77
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:51.110
got er,

78
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.720
there were girls there that were throwing kisses on me that never dreamed to be

79
00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.890
unable to even touch him.

80
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.520
And I was about ready to quit the marine corps and stay there.

81
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.490
Well,
during all,
there's some,

82
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.640
somebody grabbed my ear and jerked me around behind the depo and it was my mom,

83
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.200
Jesse Lee.
She,

84
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.490
my mom was a Comanche Indian and she was a warrior.

85
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.380
She pulled me around in the dark or the,
uh,

86
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.880
night behind the,
uh,

87
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.230
outside of the crowd so nobody could hear what she had to say.

88
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.140
And she called me Sunday because I was so bright.

89
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.580
She put these,
this hand up in front of me like this or there so I can see it.

90
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.040
She said,
Sonny,
you listen and you listen.
Good.
Yes ma'am.

91
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.450
She said,
number one,
when this war is over,

92
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.310
you come home to us

93
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.533
<v 4>ma'am</v>

94
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.580
<v 3>and don't you come home,
no drunkard</v>

95
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.420
and you don't come home,
no coward.

96
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.700
You know what that fourth one was

97
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.600
and you don't come home with no tattoos

98
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.890
and I sure don't have any tattoos.

99
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.480
And that was when she sent me off to San Diego.

100
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.920
And uh,
I'll tell you a little bit later in this session,

101
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.570
she came out to see me and you don't see the reason why she came out to see me.

102
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.580
<v 0>So,
uh,
you actually at one point,
um,</v>

103
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.740
and I thought that was a real interesting thing cause it seemed like you got a

104
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:48.830
lot of weight on your shoulders as a young,
as a youngster.

105
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.010
And I'm gonna go to the book here for a minute.
I greeted my mom cheerfully.

106
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.190
She avoided my eyes and this is just you coming home from school,

107
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.230
I had greeted my mom cheerfully,
his usual.

108
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.350
She avoided my eyes and wiped her own with her apron.

109
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.350
I noted with concern a puffy redness about them.

110
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.520
She got up and went to the oven and brought out a baked potato in a big bowl of

111
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:11.690
pinto beans thanking her.
I dug in in silence.

112
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.610
She entered that same bedroom.
My thoughts centered wholly on the food.

113
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.620
Without preamble,

114
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.820
I heard a loud beseechingly desperate cry come through the closed door.

115
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.960
No Jesse,
not that.
And that was your dad with a gasp.

116
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.700
I spewed a mouthful of food,

117
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.510
knocked over the small table and went through the door without benefit of the

118
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.750
knob in the dimly lit bedroom.

119
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.120
I viewed a scene of heart choking horror,
a picture forever etched in my memory.

120
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.940
My father desperately grappled for the pistol.

121
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.820
My mother tried to bring down on herself or him

122
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.880
without wavering or hesitation.

123
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.700
I lunged at her with all the force I could muster.

124
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.220
I caught her with a fist to the side of her head.

125
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.260
She sagged at the knees,
drop the pistol and fell forward.
A nurse.

126
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.470
She laid down on the floor.
I was horrified by what I had done.

127
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.270
My father's staggered back and slumped whimpering into a corner.

128
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.920
I headed to the bathroom and came out with a bath towel sopping wet with cold

129
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:14.490
water.

130
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.260
I applied it to her suffering face until she came around on steadily.

131
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.800
I helped her to her feet and then see it her on the side of the bed.

132
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.090
All the while dad remained in the corner to shaking,

133
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:30.270
to get up or offer any assistance to shaking,

134
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:35.220
to get up or offer any assistance sobbing.
I cried.
Why mother?
Why?

135
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.600
Why?
With a clear,
steady voice.
She said,

136
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.860
your daddy does not love us anymore.
He has another woman.

137
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.320
That's a lot of a lot for a young kid to deal with.

138
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.270
<v 5>Yeah.
It was the saddest moment my whole life.
I'll never forget that.</v>

139
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.960
And uh,
my mom was a great mom.

140
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.860
She held the family together after he left us.

141
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.300
He plowed the,
for the divorce and I want to do that,

142
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.830
the judge's chamber with my mother

143
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.900
and the judge calls me and my father to come to him and my mom was too weak to

144
00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:24.850
get up to get,
go to the judge.

145
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.130
The judge said,
Mr. Harvey,
um,
granted your divorce,

146
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.630
the six remaining children and their family will remain with their mother and

147
00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:44.671
you would pay in the sum of $42 for child care a month

148
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.120
for six children and her sale.

149
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.730
And that was her last a my dad ever spent on us.

150
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.740
And uh,

151
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.940
we just divorced him completely from our minds and so forth.

152
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.570
I had nothing to do with him after that.
And uh,

153
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.230
that we're to society this moment of my whole life when,

154
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.830
<v 1>okay.</v>

155
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.720
<v 0>That happened.
And,
um,</v>

156
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.350
it was interesting too.

157
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.910
You mentioned later in the book that you could have gotten,

158
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.030
because now you were like the sole supporter of the family.

159
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.150
You could have actually gotten a deferment from going to the war.
Yes.
Uh Huh.

160
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.420
And,
and your mom,

161
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.170
<v 1>okay.</v>

162
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.890
<v 0>Like didn't give it to you or she knew that you wanted to go in the Marine
Corps?</v>

163
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.280
Yeah.
Well if for a while she held off

164
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.470
<v 5>sign the papers for me to go.</v>

165
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.950
She always just sophomore high school

166
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.600
and I was failing all my subjects because I was trying to hold down two jobs to

167
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.530
help my mom and my sisters.
And uh,

168
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.200
it was,
it was hard times.
It was

169
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.770
really bad for her soul,
but my mom hill,
the rest of us together and,

170
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.710
and I lived through it.

171
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.420
<v 2>And then so your mom knew that you wanted to join the Marine Corps?</v>

172
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.400
<v 5>Yeah.
And uh,
she fought down it.
And,</v>

173
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:31.234
uh,

174
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.510
one day my cousin came home and I went to the recruiting office room with him

175
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930
and he signed up because he was old enough to sign and I took the papers home to

176
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:49.210
my mom.
She was at the clothes line hanging up clothes to be dried,

177
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.470
you know,
and up put that paper in front of her.
I said,

178
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:58.471
this is for you to sign on when she's decided now cause I'm going into the

179
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.213
Marine Corps.

180
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.080
She laid that wet towel on the basket,

181
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:07.300
walked down here to the end of the line.

182
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:13.050
I'd built her a land for drying clothes and there were some excess wire,

183
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.630
six strand wire.

184
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.380
She took that thing and twisted into a long whip like thing came back to me,

185
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.630
took my left hand,

186
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:30.631
her left hand and whack me cross her rear and I made a complete circle around it

187
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.820
and I stopped and glared at her and I could see that she was shedding tears the

188
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:45.910
first years have ever had ever seen her said that broke my heart.

189
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.693
And

190
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.320
I stood there for awhile and she turned and walked and went into the house.

191
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.760
And then,
uh,
I cried,
I cried hard.

192
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.980
And so about a week later,

193
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.490
I came home from school and she handed me a paper that she had signed for me to

194
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:17.440
go into the Marine Corps.
And,
uh,

195
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.990
so that was the birth of my Marine Corps.
How old were you?

196
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.930
I was 17.
I was 17 and,

197
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.203
and uh,

198
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.930
I couldn't pass English and so I quit school and join the Marine Corps,

199
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.283
but they more,

200
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.880
<v 2>where were you when,
where were you when Pearl Harbor happened?
So that was what,</v>

201
00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:47.714
a year prior?

202
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.680
<v 5>No,
I was in school,</v>

203
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.090
but it was a Sunday day and Jake roads,
my buddy had a little coop,
right.

204
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:01.091
Die and we had dates and we called her big birthers.

205
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.990
The little coop was too small for all of us to sit abreast of each other.

206
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.920
So I sit on her lap.

207
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.110
I just weighed 118 pounds and she probably outweighed me by a five or six

208
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:17.540
pounds.
And,
uh,

209
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.980
we heard that Pearl Harbor had been attacked and that

210
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.670
it was a day that I learned that I was going to be

211
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.210
involved in a war because age,
you know.
And so,

212
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.793
uh,

213
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.240
how would you heard about the marine corps as opposed to the army or the navy?

214
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:41.901
Well,

215
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:46.901
I wanted to be a paratrooper and then I thought I'd go into the army and be a

216
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:56.450
paratrooper.
Didn't have found out that the marines had paratroopers.

217
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.730
So I joined the Marine Corps and did and now found me a home.

218
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.360
Yeah.
So,
uh,
you,
you leave on that train.

219
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.120
Your mom tells you,
you know,
don't be a coward,

220
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.740
don't get any tattoos and don't be a drunkard and come home to us.

221
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:19.370
Beezer good basic fundamental rules for a lot of people I think to follow.

222
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.230
And you had off on that train to boot camp,
which is right here in San Diego,

223
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:28.760
California.
Yes.
So I got through boot camp.
Okay.
Uh,

224
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.710
but a big problem when they land us up,

225
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.810
we fitted out with shoes and clothing and everything.

226
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.120
When it came to the shoes,
they management and they said,
son,

227
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.460
you can't join the Marine Corps because your feet are too small.
And I thought,

228
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:52.370
well gosh,
he not going to send me home is,
you know,

229
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.960
I wore off size five and a half.

230
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.460
And he said,
we just don't make shoes that small.

231
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.570
And so I had an old pair of shoes that had worn out,

232
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.280
should've been thrown away and I play a lot of poker.

233
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.280
I knew how to play poker before I knew my abcs.
Well anyway,

234
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.550
I carry cards around all the time.
So when I went to Marine Corps,

235
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.990
I had to use the whole deck,

236
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.590
putting about three into my shoes that had holes in them,

237
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.530
my civilian shoes that had holes in them.
And uh,

238
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.740
they finally,
one night,
uh,

239
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.630
I'd always take the top bunk in wherever I went,

240
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.970
what Barack says in,
you know,

241
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.690
so I put my shoes on the deck under the bond and the next morning I woke up and

242
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:50.000
there was the,
it's kind of muddy,

243
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.750
taken a car tire and cut out,
sold for me.

244
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.980
It was about that thick,
you know,

245
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.850
so had a pair of shoes that I could march in and anyway,
and then,

246
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.380
uh,
when,
uh,

247
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.110
I had to cut down my Dung dungarees cut down,
you know,

248
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.400
cause it was too big and so forth.

249
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.040
And I had a lot of trouble because I was so small.
And now the,

250
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.420
at one time I was small enough that Ralph Hall,

251
00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:24.870
my captain or my platoon leader,

252
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:29.871
he was a first lieutenant at that time and not for Ferris,

253
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.580
picked me as
a runner.

254
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.600
And so one night we were sitting around the campfire and,

255
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:46.350
uh,
and I said,
why did y'all put,
picked me as uh,
as you,

256
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.420
as a runner?
And they said,
well,
you were so small,

257
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:56.450
so you made a small target and he was true fast afoot that you can run out,

258
00:18:57.771 --> 00:19:02.660
run any jap in the row in the world.
So that was redone.
That was made account,
uh,

259
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.200
uh,
company runner.
So you were saying that your mom,

260
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.220
if it's in the book too,

261
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:11.610
it's a great story about your mom bringing you something to boot camp visiting.

262
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:15.510
He's been bringing you something to boot camp?
Oh yeah.

263
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.430
Well it wasn't exactly the boot camp is when I came back from overseas and the

264
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.110
found out that the going to be in,
uh,

265
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
a a demolition man in assault squad and assault squad was composed of five men.

266
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.510
We specials and,
uh,
uh,

267
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.800
I was going to be a,

268
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.040
a a demolition man as opposed to carry so many pounds of demolition and went

269
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:52.020
back and,
and owned a front.

270
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.410
I would care my regular pack,
you know,
and so forth.

271
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.410
And so I couldn't handle a raffle.

272
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.460
So out first I said,
well,

273
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.090
we've tried to get you a pistol because it couldn't handle the rifle,

274
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.680
uh,
with all that weight and so forth.

275
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.640
And uh,
he said,
we going to get you a pistol.

276
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.550
I've waited around a week for a pistol and finally came out.
I said,

277
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.310
the Marine Corps doesn't have any pistols,
any,
any left.

278
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.350
And so I was desperate.
So I called my mom.

279
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.830
I said,
mom,
find me a pistol.

280
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.460
I'd like to have a Colt 1911 colt.

281
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.410
And my mom went out
and,
uh,

282
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.360
looked all over town.
Well,

283
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:50.361
I looked all over San here for a pistol myself and it just wasn't one to be had,

284
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:52.654
you know.

285
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.020
And so I called my mom and told her what I needed and she,

286
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.890
uh,
I centers the money.

287
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.610
I sent her $75 that had one at a poker game.

288
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.800
I sent that to her and she went around all over town looking for a pistol,

289
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.850
couldn't find one until she came to a trailer house down close to the railroad

290
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:26.200
tracks with a guy that had a gun shop there.

291
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.280
So she went to the house trailer and knocked on the door and,

292
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.290
and Mr. Armstrong came out and said,
what do you need ma'am?

293
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.350
She says,
I need a pistol.

294
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.040
What kind of pistol do you need?
She said,

295
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.430
she took out the piece of paper that I'd written it on a Colt 45,

296
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.970
1911.
And he said,

297
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.050
I just happened to have one of those.
And,
uh,

298
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.890
she said,
how much he it and he said,

299
00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:06.790
a $200.
And she said,
Oh,

300
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:10.270
I can't afford that.
He said,
well,
that's all the god.

301
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.840
Why do you need such a big pistol?
She said,
well,

302
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:17.380
my son is in the marine corps and he needs a pistol.

303
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.840
And so he said,

304
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:24.820
well this is the only one I have $200

305
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.090
and,
and so she backed it out of the door and went down to Rome.

306
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.310
Mr. Armstrong came down and tapped her.
So she said,
he said,

307
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.420
he say his son was in the Marine Corps and,

308
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.000
and needs a pistols.
Surely they can give him a pistol,
learn.

309
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:50.820
She said no,
they don't have any and she had come on back,

310
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.330
we'll work up a deal.

311
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.140
So she walked out that pistol cleaned of cosmoline and he had his $75 and she

312
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.080
needed to get to there as soon as she could,
you know.

313
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.110
So she went down to the bus station,

314
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.950
got on a bus with a paper grocery bag in it with extra clothes,

315
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:19.684
you know,

316
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.620
and got on the bus and 36 hours later she got the San Diego now seat criss

317
00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:32.440
crossed because in those days,
you know,

318
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.300
military guys had a priority and she'd be in one place.

319
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.100
He would bump her off,

320
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.950
let her guy come in and take a place and she criss cross.

321
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.930
You may go in Arizona,
uh,

322
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.220
for 36 hours or where are we at loading up to go overseas and a cobber darts.

323
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:59.321
And I were up on the truck with a bunch of sea bags and,

324
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.220
uh,
uh,
uh,
Fisher,

325
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.740
my,
uh,
uh,
sergeant at that time,
uh,

326
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.890
was sitting in the cab with the driver and everything.

327
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.720
So we went to the gate over here at Camp Pendleton and,
uh,

328
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.520
Kate Gorge said,
is there any marine up?
Our named Harvey,

329
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:26.450
Fred Harvey and Carver woke me up.
I was asleep.

330
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.810
What we have said,
hey,
they had called him for your named.

331
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.210
So it flipped over and I saw them,

332
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:37.211
a mom look up at me and I slid low thing real fast.

333
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.240
I came off a real fat.
Well,
uh,

334
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.280
after a while,
uh,
uh,
Fisher said,

335
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.620
uh,
we gotta we got to go,
uh,

336
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.360
I want to let your mom sit in a seat and I'll get up.
Are we deal?

337
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:02.020
And so we drove down town and was looking for a place for her to stay.

338
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.240
We couldn't find a place anywhere.
I mean,

339
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.260
we tried ever hold tailed and so forth.

340
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.130
So finally,
I,
uh,

341
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.790
this is around 12 o'clock at night.
And so,
uh,

342
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.660
I went to a policeman and I said,
sir,

343
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:25.661
can you tell me where we might find a place for my mom to stay a hotel or motel

344
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.280
or something,
you know?
And he said,
well,

345
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.490
I just don't know of any place and so forth.

346
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.470
I'll tell you what,
I'll call my wife.

347
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.680
If he mother was stay at with her,

348
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.620
I'll call her and we'll go out.
And so the,

349
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.340
I've said yes,
bring her van around.
So,

350
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.073
uh,

351
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.110
he called off office and the police car came out and drove into the house and

352
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:04.310
his wife well welcomed us with open arms,
you know,

353
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.670
and she stayed there three different nights.
And,
uh,

354
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.900
and then I was able to,
uh,
Fisher would let me off,

355
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.750
uh,
quite a bit.
At the time,

356
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:22.751
there were three days she was here and then she finally had to put her on the

357
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:28.520
bus.
And he wrote her a note making a priority.

358
00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:31.730
She wouldn't be bumped and everything when she got home.

359
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.940
Well that was a story of how I got my pistol.

360
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.270
And it was shortly there after that you went on,
you had an overseas?

361
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.910
Yes.
And that was on,
uh,
on,
uh,

362
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.780
a formal former cattle ship.
Is that right?

363
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:54.030
That was the first time I went overseas.
Okay.
So you came back in between,

364
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.250
in between,
so that you got the pistol after your first time going overseas?

365
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.150
Yeah,
it was the second time I went overseas.
Okay.

366
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.230
The first time I went over it was on the bloom fund team.
Okay.

367
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.450
If you want to hear about the bloom Fontane well,

368
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:12.600
I read about it and it's a pretty nasty story in many ways.

369
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.460
That was a nasty shit,

370
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.180
but I thought that was the way it was.
You know,
I hadn't seen the ocean.

371
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.310
Dylan had gotten in the Marine Corps and so,

372
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.790
uh,
they,
they put us on,

373
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:35.010
on the bloom Fontane and it was then a cattle ship at Dutch,

374
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.270
at a Dutch cat plan.
And he was,
uh,

375
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.610
he shipped a,
I mean,

376
00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:46.720
he transferred cattle from Australia over to,

377
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.380
uh,
through the Dutch,

378
00:27:50.381 --> 00:27:54.970
a holdings in them South Pacific.
Well,
when the war broke out,

379
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.660
he had just dumped out a load of cattle.

380
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.340
And when he found out that it was at war,
well he hitted for San Francisco,

381
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.760
you know,
you got to San Francisco,

382
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.720
he offered it to the navy and the navy took it,

383
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.440
made it into a troop ship that they didn't clean that up up very good.

384
00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:19.901
You know,

385
00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:23.710
they shoveled it out and they left a lot of stuff and they just painted over it.

386
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.600
Of course,
when it was started to sail that ship,
buckling and everything and that

387
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.720
cal drop and just deliver word,
you know,

388
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.460
and the bunk were stacked up eight high.

389
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.830
And I was lucky.

390
00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:41.920
I was small enough to get in there without any trouble is a lot of those little

391
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:46.900
guys at in and the head,
uh,
you know,

392
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.180
the Navy and Marine Corps.

393
00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:53.110
Then the bathroom is called the head,
you know,

394
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.850
uh,

395
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.850
the head was just alone shed from the bowels of the ship back to the,

396
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.030
uh,
holdings,
you know,
where the captain students,

397
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.300
so forth and what had happened.
They'd made it a tree.
Uh,

398
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.840
what would the dream of what

399
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.940
a terrible for water would flow down the thing,
right?

400
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.250
Then they had a pipe for you to sit on,

401
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:26.150
whether you just sit on that pipe and then,
uh,

402
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.480
do you thing and get up and leave,
you know.
Well,

403
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.580
that thing broke down.
And so here we were,

404
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:40.590
I see a with no way to dispose of,

405
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:46.660
uh,
you know,
the droppings.
Well.
Anyway,
so the Dutch captains,
Sandy,

406
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:49.330
this crude set,
uh,
uh,

407
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.790
make things on the front of this bow of the ship and it kind of like saddle of,

408
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.560
uh,
uh,
the oldest one,
the side of a horse,
you know,

409
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.400
you just go up,
burn,
drop your pants and sat down on that thing and,

410
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.460
and dog feed the fish,
you know,
well,

411
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.470
hours to bias before we go out and use that because there were 13 naval nurses

412
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:18.710
on that same ship and they set up and I held off.

413
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.360
I was trying to hold off or dark writers too embarrassed to go,

414
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:27.670
but finally I had to go shot him for no burden to drop a package like the rest

415
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:31.550
of them did.
Well,
yeah.
You know,
when you're floating along,

416
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.360
you're going up and down.
First thing you know,
you're,
yeah,

417
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.370
but it's in the water and it comes back hat on.
And uh,

418
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.690
you didn't really need toilet paper because you didn't need them because it

419
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:44.860
wasn't in on there.

420
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.930
That was a problem the whole time I was in the Marine Corps overseas was toilet

421
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:52.270
paper.
Oh,
that was something,

422
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.040
but that's the way we traveled there.
And,
uh,

423
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.110
when you go through the hour,
sea sick,
our seasick all the time,

424
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.290
they put me in a,

425
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.720
in the sick bay and for some reason there were a box or high whole crackers in

426
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:13.740
there.
I don't know what it was doing on a troop ship,
but there were so wrong.

427
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.260
And so I'd eat a couple of those ever hour and they'd hide them or nobody else

428
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:22.504
can get them.

429
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:28.170
And we're just on that ship for 29 days to get the New Caledonia.

430
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.813
And,
uh,

431
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.440
one day the ship broke down here were our drifted,

432
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:40.270
not drifted for all,
probably 30 or 40 hours,

433
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:41.104
you know,

434
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:46.230
and we was taking bets as where we are drift too and South America and,

435
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:48.663
and they,

436
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.250
they get past the word out that we're just fortunate to keep her laugh,

437
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.230
bail tall on at all times and keep your eyes looking out for,

438
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:00.920
<v 4>okay.</v>

439
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.400
<v 5>So submarines cause we didn't have any escort,</v>

440
00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:08.630
we were just out there by herself and number slow cattle ship.
And uh,

441
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.510
we was in real trouble and,

442
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:17.530
and we'd drifted for 72 hours and they finally got the engine going again.

443
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.600
So here we are going to overseas.
We didn't know where we're going,

444
00:32:23.601 --> 00:32:25.960
you know,
and uh,

445
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.600
then we got a scare that there was possibly a jap submarine in the area.

446
00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.780
So we pulled into the nearish

447
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:38.503
<v 4>okay.</v>

448
00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.430
<v 5>We were close to,
you know,</v>

449
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:45.431
we pulled in there and I fell in love without that island.

450
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.890
It was,
uh,

451
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
Tonga to pool and we just went in one of these things you see in the movies,

452
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:55.394
you know,

453
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.880
and we pulled in that bay and dropped anchor and here the natives came out

454
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:06.610
paddling canoes and they had a coconut pineapple,

455
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.660
a lot of fruit and stuff.

456
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:13.310
And so I'm up our to us and then we fast for those things.
Well,

457
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:15.320
anyway,
they came,

458
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.860
came back that night and entertained us on the deck of the ship.

459
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:23.330
We sitting around there and they were

460
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.710
doing their dances,
a hula dances,

461
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.450
and it was a beautiful island.
How many is beautiful?

462
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.630
And I swore,
rutter,
I said to myself,

463
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:40.000
Fred Harvey is a lot more in this world,
in Odessa,
Texas,

464
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.700
and I'm going to see some of it before I die.

465
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.440
And so they put on a show and it lasts.

466
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.550
They Sung there island song,
you know what it was,

467
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.680
you are my sunshine.
And we pulled away from Myron.

468
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.760
We got started,
then we stopped,
went back,
well,
what's going on?

469
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.540
Six guys had jumped shield.

470
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.520
He went ashore,
arm,
forearm,
back.
Well,

471
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.430
I didn't think about jumping ship for,
I'd thought about it.
I might've them.

472
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.640
And so we pulled out and finally got to a,

473
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.910
uh,
New Caledonia.

474
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:31.380
He'd been at sea for 29 days.
And uh,

475
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.240
we as all tickled to finally get the,

476
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.560
but that ship was a hail she up.
And uh,

477
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.090
when we got there,
it took us off to she up.

478
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.030
And this is now in New Caledonia.
You killed it on,

479
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:52.010
it's a year or a couple months out of bootcamp at this point.
Yeah.
Okay.

480
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.720
And is this the first place you stop and you're going to basically just for

481
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:57.740
people that don't know,

482
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.470
you're going to get to New Caledonia and you're going to kind of train and

483
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:02.570
prepare for,

484
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.460
for going out and taking down some islands?
Yeah,
well,

485
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.610
it was two reasons he went there.
We

486
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.050
go on a farm up with,
uh,
uh,

487
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.560
rest of the troops.
You know,

488
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.580
the first parachute battalion was already there.
In fact,

489
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.690
they were involved in Guadalcanal and,
uh,

490
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.860
so,
uh,
uh,

491
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.780
we were going down and out and replace.
The guys

492
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.490
went to the first parachute battalion.

493
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.120
They were 60 miles from,

494
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.440
<v 6>uh,
uh,</v>

495
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.860
<v 5>the base we came in on.
Uh,</v>

496
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.520
I can't remember the base that we landed at out of the port.

497
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.250
We landed that,
but,
uh,

498
00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.440
it was a capital of New Caledonia and are the parachute battalions were

499
00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:07.210
stationed out.
Oh,
about 60 miles from,

500
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.330
uh,
you may,
you may have as a capital of a place.

501
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.930
And then once you got,
does that,
where you met your,
your,

502
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.210
that where you joined up,
you're saying with your parachute company?

503
00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.520
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was assigned to the first parachute battalion in,

504
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:30.010
did you,
did you,
if I remember correct,

505
00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:34.810
did you go to Guadalcanal this at this point?
No.

506
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.080
Uh,
we went later when we went up to

507
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:45.140
our first action together after Guata canal was,

508
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.403
uh,

509
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.640
we supposed to go to the Belo Lavella and said,
we're on our way up.

510
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.920
We stopped off at,
uh,
uh,

511
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:03.080
Guadalcanal and
Guadalcanal had been,

512
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.540
uh,
uh,
secured,

513
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:11.930
you know,
and so they let a scrimmage,

514
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:15.530
we went up to find some of the old guys that had

515
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.590
escaped.
The Japanese

516
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.380
had escaped and we didn't see anything,

517
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:28.300
so we didn't get to shoot any jabs.
So we were there,
uh,

518
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.780
all a couple of days.
And,
uh,

519
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.020
we got up for child one morning just about before sunup never thing.

520
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.830
And I was up front of the line.

521
00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:44.510
I'd always managed to get the front of the line for Chow.
Yeah,

522
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:47.900
for child.
You've mentioned throughout the book that year,

523
00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:50.930
a guy that liked your chow.
Oh,
I love challenge.

524
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.280
I was trying to catch up with the hunger.

525
00:37:54.281 --> 00:37:58.700
I'll had been during the depression.
Well anyway,

526
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.220
we was in line waiting to go in and get cha,
you know,

527
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.713
and uh,

528
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.990
then I heard a lot of laughing and carrying on back to the lines.
So I ran under,

529
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.800
sees what the action was,
you know,

530
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:18.440
and there's three be Draggle Japanese had just come out of the line out of the

531
00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:23.200
jungle and got in line
and uh,

532
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.830
and an officer got the,
came down and they could speak Japanese and they,

533
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.680
he said they were hungry and everything,

534
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.920
so they took them apart and fed them and they kept him there I guess as long as

535
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.850
they needed them.

536
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.480
They was washing pots and pans and doing work there when we left and so forth.

537
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.610
They got off light.

538
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.200
And um,

539
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.400
<v 2>so as you were preparing to go,
now you're working at you,</v>

540
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.040
you had a couple of guys that you mentioned in the book.
You know,

541
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.960
I'll start with the first one.
I'm going to mention three of them.
Uh,
Major Fagan,

542
00:39:05.961 --> 00:39:09.290
faith forgotten is that he Sagan,
Sagan,
Major Fagan.

543
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.060
He sounds like one tough customer.

544
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.130
<v 5>He was to,
ah,
man he was,
I was scared.</v>

545
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.110
I'd see him coming down,
you know,
the trail or anything like that.

546
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:23.920
I jumped into the jungle,
keep with me cause I was scared of him.

547
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.520
Well everybody was scared of him because he was tough.
He just drove,
uh,

548
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.350
he found out that Japanese march,
uh,

549
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.690
full packs and a 24 hour period,
March 39 miles,

550
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.580
he said,
we're going to beat that.

551
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:47.210
And we marched 50 miles.
We're full tax,
uh,

552
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.220
down New Caledonia and we would walk up the heels and trot down the healed.

553
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.730
It came down and we went 50 miles.
And uh,

554
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.870
I don't know whether it's any kind of record book,
her name,
Tang,
but we,

555
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.240
we're proud of it,
so forth.

556
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.490
<v 2>It's a record book either,
but I know it hurt.</v>

557
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.310
Now you also did a couple of you tell a couple stories in the book about him.
Um,

558
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.750
but he,
he was,
he had no problem putting people on bread and water.

559
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.980
<v 5>Oh,
no problem.
No problem.
In fact,</v>

560
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.570
I was put it on bread and water.
I had a buddy there

561
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.270
went through the parachute per tune with me.
Right.
Tiny.

562
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.520
He nearly got us killed thing,
I won't give him his name,
you know,

563
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:41.950
but he passed away several years ago.
I don't want to say anything.

564
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.070
We don't want to incriminate his ass.

565
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:50.020
Well he uh,
when we was going through parachute school,

566
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:56.200
his name,
well I'll tell you his name,
uh,
last name,
his name was Harmon.

567
00:40:56.201 --> 00:41:00.130
So when we land up alphabetically and everything we did,
you know,

568
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.380
well he was always right behind me.

569
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.540
So when we went to a parachute school,

570
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.970
we wound up together,
you know,

571
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:14.410
because of her name's being real close to one another.
Well,
anyway,

572
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.440
uh,
now

573
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.530
when we jumped to bring cord jumps from the plane,

574
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.020
we dove out head first.

575
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.390
Their theory was that when you jump out and that parachute opens your eye to
eye,

576
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.900
he kind of swaying with a,

577
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:38.330
well the army jumped him out feet first and came down so forth.

578
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.210
So we jumped,

579
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.270
we jumped out head first while we were training there and uh,

580
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.060
out here and Camp Gillespie.
That's where the parachute school laws

581
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.513
and um,

582
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:03.650
we lined up to make our first jump will harm Harmon rows behind me.

583
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.070
Well in the plane we had,
we called it the blue goose.

584
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:12.490
Now we had to borrow that from the navy because Marine Corps didn't,

585
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.770
I wouldn't any planes sale.
So we used the blue goose.

586
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.370
So they took us out there and a truck,
you know,

587
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:25.080
the guys that had volunteered to go into the parachute school and that truck

588
00:42:25.081 --> 00:42:27.930
driver Dover's out tired and uh,

589
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.860
and the barks and the officers didn't,

590
00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:37.780
everything was on top of this hill and below was the a runway.

591
00:42:37.781 --> 00:42:38.650
And that's where the,

592
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:43.790
where we jumped into that area or a tow truck driver drove up bar and stop real

593
00:42:44.411 --> 00:42:47.380
fast.
She said they're fixing job.
Do you guys want to watch?

594
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.910
And so we all jumped out of the truckers.
There's about 10 or 15 of us,
you know,

595
00:42:51.911 --> 00:42:54.730
jumped out of the truck,
watch him.
They flew over,
man.

596
00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:58.350
Here they come dive and out one,
I'm pushing.
It was coming down fast.

597
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.800
[inaudible] like this,
his parachute didn't open.

598
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:09.000
And so just before he hit the deck,
that parachute opened.

599
00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:13.710
He had to pull out of this.
It is,
uh,
reserves shoot.

600
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.780
Now the reserve chute was on the front and it didn't have a pilot chute on it.

601
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:20.810
So when you pull a rip parties sports,

602
00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:25.280
pull out that SilkAir sale [inaudible] was now alone.

603
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.370
He is pulling that out.
Just he got bailed out,

604
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.430
he hit the deck and a jeep was on its way down there and they put him in the

605
00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:39.020
jeep,
put a parachute on him,
got him out on the plane,
the plane,

606
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.810
one of burn out.
He came again.
And that truck driver said,

607
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.470
any of you guys want to go back to boot camp?

608
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.800
And two guys got back on the truck and I thought seriously about it.

609
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.240
And uh,
yeah,
that's not a good initiation into parachute jumping,
that's for sure.

610
00:43:57.241 --> 00:44:01.820
Yeah,
well we had to pack our own shoot.
We learned how to pack,
shoot,

611
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.780
we,
and every step you took a parachute school you had to be running.

612
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.940
If you weren't running and offer an NCO or at Kashi you,
you were in trouble.

613
00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:15.810
You know.
So every step we took,
we learned how to pack shoots,

614
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.100
ran up and down.

615
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.390
I got where I could pack a chute and 12 minutes.

616
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:23.210
<v 4>Okay,</v>

617
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.300
<v 5>well one day they said,</v>

618
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.720
you're going to pack a shoot today and you're going to jump to tomorrow.

619
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.730
And I said,
uh Oh,
I better take a little bit more time.
So it took me 30 minutes.

620
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:39.630
Do that
well that night,
uh

621
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:46.380
Oh,
what was that Indian,
his name.
But uh,
it was a paper.
Hayes.
All right.
Hey,

622
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.780
he was in my platoon.
You heard of our pay,

623
00:44:50.781 --> 00:44:53.250
his hip raised the flag on the Eagle.

624
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.390
He was real quiet and there was another end in,
in there with him.

625
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.320
And that night before we jumped,

626
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.670
that guy jumped off and hollered,
Gung Ho,
you know,

627
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:09.960
and broke both of his ankles.
So that ended his parachute.

628
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:15.450
But our,
oh,
was he was,
he was a good Barain.
He's quiet,
you know,

629
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:18.810
he never,
never said much.
And I'd talk to him,
you know,

630
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:22.480
cause my mom was a Comanche Indian and I had some Indian blood,
you know,

631
00:45:22.481 --> 00:45:26.550
and not tell him that,
you know,
and,
and we became close friends,

632
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:31.420
but he's so quiet.
She know great,
great guy.
But he,

633
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.150
this is quiet.
Whether you know the history of what he did,

634
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.530
what happened to avoid guy?
Yeah.
Well anyway,

635
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:46.110
we came out and at first jump we made,

636
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:49.890
we made the jump
and when I came out,

637
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.550
I dove out.
When my chute opened,

638
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:58.700
I was standing on another shoot below me was Harmon.

639
00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:01.650
He should've been the bug me cause he's coming out of there.

640
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.410
We didn't think much about it.
You know,

641
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.070
I just started jumping was like,

642
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.760
well the next day we jumped again and we came up,

643
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.570
we were tangled together
and uh,

644
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.400
and their suits,
you know,
when they're slanting up,

645
00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:27.370
like at air was going up too fast,
you know,
when holding the Sheba,

646
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.100
the brain and when we hit

647
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.360
like a ton of bricks hit and you know,
man,

648
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:37.740
it hurt and everything cause that she hadn't,
wasn't able to,

649
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.780
those shoes weren't able to hold us up.

650
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.500
So we hit the ground pretty hard to the jump masters and the guy on the deck

651
00:46:45.661 --> 00:46:49.710
watching thing,
they just,
what happened,
and I don't know,

652
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:54.660
they didn't ask anything of Harmon.
You know,
he's always made me looking at,

653
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:56.880
you know,
well anyway,

654
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.250
when in fact it was looking at me because I didn't even have boots on the one

655
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:05.820
dominant,
where's your boots?
I said they all don't have any,
they were fit.

656
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.800
So they finally got me a pair or a six size and told me to wear four pair of

657
00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:17.880
socks,
you know,
first boots ahead,
went back to Harmon.

658
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:18.781
Well,

659
00:47:18.781 --> 00:47:23.781
the next time we jump I came out bruised up and everything when we're jump will,

660
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:31.080
uh,
I was
my shoot,
uh,

661
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.130
at,
uh,
the shroud lines had channel tangled up in my boot,
you know,

662
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.660
so I whipped up k bar knives and cut those two strategies,
uh,

663
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.770
uh,
rope,
you know,

664
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.860
to let me down just before I hit the ground wield,

665
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.620
I got my feet down first,
you know,

666
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.070
and they'd come running over to me.
And what are they going on there?

667
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:58.780
What's happening?
I don't know.
And so

668
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.240
what did it happened when my parachute,

669
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:07.820
when I jumped out our dove out of the thing,
right?

670
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.530
I was facing a plane and my Sadie Klein was playing out between my legs.

671
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:20.220
And so that's a foot got tangled up in the shroud lines,

672
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.521
man.

673
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:26.521
They came up there and they decided I was too light to be in and uh,

674
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.720
in a parachute,
you know.

675
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.340
And so the sergeant over there at the,

676
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.160
at the loft where we

677
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.430
packed our shoots,
you know,
he and a officer would talk and he said,
well,

678
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:47.410
he just too light.
And,
and I were standing there talking about,
I said,

679
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.670
I said,
y'all can't kick me out.
I want to stay in this outfit.

680
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.940
I wanted to stay in it.
And so that sergeant,

681
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.461
he said,

682
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:02.320
why don't we put him in a army navy canopy.

683
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:03.911
Now the army,

684
00:49:03.911 --> 00:49:08.860
Navy canopy was only 26 feet diameter.

685
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:14.380
And the ones we use denial on,
no one's users,
28,

686
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.170
just a bigger canopy and everything.

687
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.910
So this guy took an army navy parachute,

688
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.210
took it out and put it on me.
Uh,

689
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:31.260
all the cage,
you know,
we get what they call it,
you know,
where he folded,

690
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:34.570
you shoot and put it on there.
And so here I am with a,

691
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.910
with a parachute,
you know,

692
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:42.510
made out of silk and instead of nylon and a cl cl react a lot faster than nylon

693
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.950
does.
So.
So when that she'd opened,
I got a pretty good

694
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.270
kick out of it.
Well,

695
00:49:55.271 --> 00:50:00.271
when we came out and that day we were going to jump with weapons and so they

696
00:50:01.361 --> 00:50:05.710
gave us all a rise in gun.
You ever heard of horizon gun?
No.

697
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.110
Oh,
it was about as worthless.
The grease gun.
So we called it a grease gun.

698
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:15.150
It was a terrible weapon.
They uh,
they outlawed him in the,

699
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.730
in the military right quick.
Well,
anyway,

700
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.070
I had one of those and uh,

701
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.970
when I went out the door,

702
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:32.540
Harmon hit me and knocked my bride and gun down and it went down to stuck into

703
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:35.390
the garden and they,
they,
uh,

704
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.820
this is our fourth job.
And uh,

705
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.550
and the sergeant said they were,

706
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.900
they were considering just really dropped me,

707
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:52.900
send me back to the bootcamp to be signed somewhere else,
you know,
uh,

708
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.380
with tears in my,
I begged them,
let me stay,
you know.
Well,

709
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:01.340
and then the sergeant said,
I'm going to go up

710
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.620
tomorrow and watch and see what is happening.

711
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:08.503
And uh,

712
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:13.970
so he went up there and found out what was happening here.

713
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:19.680
We'd come and down this white line and the fuselage of the plane and then the

714
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.080
white line was raw,
authentic,
leading out the door.

715
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:29.470
So we were supposed to come down and make a sharp turn and dive out while I was

716
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:32.270
coming down and going out to the proper way.

717
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:37.271
Harmon was coming down there and he was cutting across and he was going through

718
00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:41.390
the doors,
same time I was,
and it was knocking me against the side over there.

719
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:45.190
And,
and he just knocked me out.

720
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:49.250
He was shooting,
was opening for mine,
was opening.

721
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:53.710
And so we got that straightened out and uh,

722
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:58.580
and that wasn't the only trouble I had with Harmon,
but that's a different story.

723
00:51:58.581 --> 00:52:02.250
Or maybe I shouldn't bring it up here.
So

724
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:06.510
<v 0>you actually,
you actually talk about when you did find the,
get your first jump,</v>

725
00:52:06.511 --> 00:52:09.000
everything went good.
And you said,
you know,

726
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:12.120
I had never made first string in any sport because of my size,

727
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.080
but when they pin those wings on my chest and shoved a rifle into my hands,

728
00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.690
I had a last made first string.

729
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.410
That rifle in my hands size no longer seemed relevant.

730
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.530
I had made the team and found a home,

731
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:30.950
the marine corps filled all my dreams and all my needs.

732
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.600
Harmon actually ended up getting you in trouble.
Yeah.

733
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.380
Right while you were in New Caledonia.
Yeah.
Yeah.

734
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.110
<v 5>Well I won't go into the pink house,
but I do in the book going on.</v>

735
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.093
I don't know.

736
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:50.580
Our Day off was Wednesday first got Wednesday off.

737
00:52:51.191 --> 00:52:52.780
You know,
they didn't let us all off.

738
00:52:52.781 --> 00:52:57.781
It's the same time because they didn't what one another Pearl Harbor top thing,

739
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.580
because the Japs were still on the offensive at that time.
So,

740
00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:05.380
uh,
he,
uh,

741
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.410
he got where he would go down there every Wednesday and,
uh,

742
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:16.390
he fell in love with one of those girls and they fell in love with it or she

743
00:53:16.391 --> 00:53:21.280
fell in love with him,
but he went in there and he didn't get the bus,

744
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.030
but last truck going back to base and he didn't get back in,

745
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.650
<v 3>so he had to hitchhike.
I don't know how he got there,</v>

746
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:36.430
but he got are about,
oh,
about an hour after roll call and everything.

747
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:41.190
So when he showed up,
well Fagan just put him on five days.

748
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:44.640
Bread and water.
Fagan don't play around.
Yeah.

749
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:51.000
Well when you buy it would buy us something over from the px.

750
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:55.710
He couldn't go in and buy one bar candy or one can of beans or anything.

751
00:53:55.711 --> 00:53:57.480
Like you had to buy a whole box.

752
00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

753
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.250
<v 3>So on his third day I went,
went over and got me,
uh,</v>

754
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:08.860
Joe boy.
Now Joe Boyd was a non chocolate,

755
00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.030
you couldn't have chocolate candy in the tropics because it melts,
you know,

756
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.520
so they had this new get,
uh,

757
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:21.040
covered with the peanuts and is called Joe Board.

758
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.880
So I went by there one night and I opened up not as eating.

759
00:54:24.881 --> 00:54:28.630
One of them hollered at him through the Barb wire thing.

760
00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:33.660
He was in a tent and it was kind of in a clearing in the woods,

761
00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:35.704
you know,

762
00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.900
<v 5>he said,
Harvey told me one of those things,</v>

763
00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:43.160
I haven't had anything but bread and water for three days now.
I said,
no,

764
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.700
I'm not going to tell you I was against the rules.
I'll come on please.

765
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:50.320
I would do it for you.
And just kept going.
So I looked around,

766
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.380
took two of them out and fill a carp.

767
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.810
Birla Gorg Fagan had seen me

768
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.450
when he came over and he said,
put this guy in the,
and uh,

769
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.090
art fairs happened to be the corporate of the guard at that time.

770
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.020
And he said,
well,
we can't,
we're all packed up.

771
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.910
<v 3>They're just one,
uh,
bunk.
Uh,</v>

772
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.273
<v 4>Gotcha.</v>

773
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:23.840
<v 5>What feeling you got caught in there and the rest of them are all packed and</v>

774
00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:28.370
ready to go.
And he said,
there's no place for him to sleep.
He said,
what?

775
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.670
Take that guy out and put the guy in there.

776
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:37.380
And so the next day I'm sitting there and I was all ready,

777
00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:41.020
had a couple of loaves of bread and water.

778
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.570
He came by with a box of candy.
I said,

779
00:55:43.571 --> 00:55:47.100
come on and fill me more than little things.
I though he says,
no,

780
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.860
that's against the rules.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Oh,

781
00:55:50.861 --> 00:55:55.110
he never did throw one little word to me.
Cold blooded.
Yeah.

782
00:55:55.990 --> 00:56:00.140
<v 0>How you were going to get sort of written up for that.
Um,</v>

783
00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:04.930
and Lieutenant Hall,
who you know you,
you got a lot of Spec for.

784
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.150
I'm going back to the book here.
He,
they said,

785
00:56:07.151 --> 00:56:10.840
now you're checking in with the hall and he's supposed to write you up and put

786
00:56:10.841 --> 00:56:13.300
this in your permanent record and he says,
Harvey,

787
00:56:13.301 --> 00:56:14.590
he said with a document in hand,

788
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.950
I was ordered to write you up but I can't put it in your records.

789
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.190
Has All our records had been stowed away to remain here.

790
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.840
I'll have to carry this paper with and it will surely get lost in the jungle

791
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:29.140
before we get back to civilization again.

792
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:32.360
I got a knowing smile and a pat on the back.
Now get outta here.

793
00:56:32.361 --> 00:56:35.560
Be and forget what has happened.
Get your gear in order.

794
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.240
I think we're taking a boat ride.

795
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.240
I gave him the smartest solution possible and said,
thank you sir.

796
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:41.740
I appreciate what you've done for me.

797
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.030
I think I might've skipped to my tent filled to the deep joy and the

798
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:47.800
deliciousness of being a marine.

799
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.390
I left my troubles behind me and soon got to feel the thrill of combat.

800
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.840
I realized soon after in the heat of battle that the harsh demanding training of

801
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:03.271
that Major Richard Fagan sergeant ought Ferris and Lieutenant Ralph F.

802
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.990
Hall put us through,
paid off.
We performed well under fire.

803
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.500
Ferris and Fagan received wounds in the battle of Iwo Jima.

804
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.780
Lieutenant Hall died in the Battle of Iwo Jima.

805
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.530
I shed bitter tears when I heard the news of his death.

806
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.850
He was a great marine at IIE.

807
00:57:19.851 --> 00:57:24.340
Will Fagan earn the navy cross as we fought for Bogan Ville,

808
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:29.290
Sergeant Ferris did some amazing things for which he received the coveted silver

809
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:31.810
star.
Later at the battle for Evo,

810
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.540
he earned the bronze star and purple heart medals.

811
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.160
Then he went on to win his second Silver Star and purple heart during the Korean

812
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.980
War.
Heck,
this guy hung around to fight in the Vietnam,

813
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:46.030
in Vietnam in the 1960s a marine,
a marine's marine.

814
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.320
I found serving with him a great honor.
One of the high points of my life,

815
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.940
even today,
70 plus years later,
we get together from time to time.

816
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.620
What do we talk about?
Of course,
the war and our buddies,

817
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:04.300
that bygone era.
So you had,

818
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.470
I thought that was just a great leadership story about how Lieutenant Hall just

819
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:12.540
said,
Hey,
you know what?
We're gonna,
we're gonna shred this document and it's not,

820
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:17.230
it never happened.
And then you move to your first,

821
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.870
was it your first combat was being in Bogan Ville?
Uh,
no.
Velo.
Velo was.

822
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:27.670
Okay.
Yeah.
And what,
what was,
uh,
what was going into Bella Bella,
Bella,

823
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.450
what was it?
Vella.
Lavella Vella.

824
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:33.820
<v 3>Lovell.
Lavella.
Well,
yeah,
no,
we were island hopping over there.</v>

825
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.770
What we would do would evade an island,

826
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:43.710
put it in an air strip and a thing and to use to hop to the next island,

827
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:52.430
cause it didn't when we were through and it's nearly vacated and they're loud.

828
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.760
They airfield it,
reuse you,
but he didn't ever thing.

829
00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:00.280
And so Bella Bella was,
uh,

830
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.180
one of those stages and everything.

831
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:06.900
And across the bay there,

832
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:12.110
I think something like 13 miles or something was colon Ben Garra.

833
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.930
Now that was just an island,
just sticking up,

834
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.560
a volcanic island sticking up in the ocean.

835
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:23.450
And it was,
uh,
uh,

836
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:28.700
all the jab occupied it.
And uh,

837
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.470
but we took Vela Vela and put it in an air strip there.

838
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.240
We landed there.

839
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:39.050
And that was when I had my first taste of action.

840
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.080
Uh,
we moved in to the island,

841
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.940
to the jungle and they,
CBS,

842
00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:51.770
we're supposed to follow us in,
you know,
and start building there,

843
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.140
or the cvs or the tough outfit.

844
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:59.060
They were getting ahead of us and we'd had,
she owned bank.

845
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.790
So they made an ask us,
get on the,
it's not a,
uh,

846
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.910
their tractors.
And that's what we did.
And the other thing.
But,

847
01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:09.744
um,

848
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.720
then we moved when we were moving out at the beach where we send out of the arm

849
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.830
patrolled because we had a,
when we invaded,

850
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:23.250
we didn't run into any jabs,
but we found that there were some up our,

851
01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:27.740
so we were going to go up and then attack them before they could get down and,

852
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.630
and work over the seabees that we're building the air strip,
you know.

853
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.640
And so it was so hot in the jungle was so thick.

854
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:42.320
We had to have a guy's using match.
It's,
you know,
to,

855
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.860
to chop our way through there.
Well,

856
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.100
we last only about 10 minutes

857
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.300
using those shoppers.
We get through there.
It just big blades,
you know,
just use,

858
01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:00.350
uh,
you just shopped through the vines.
Well,

859
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:04.370
we were staggered.
The guy was here,

860
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:08.420
I was here and another guy was here and we were working our way through it.

861
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.003
And uh,

862
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.240
and the JAP Nambuu opened up on us and this jap was up in a tree and he shot and

863
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:25.340
killed these two guys.
It was in this line over here and I was over here.

864
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:29.080
So they didn't get us get it all three of us.
Well anyway,

865
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:34.810
then he went out to me and I just jumped under those threads and uh,

866
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.673
uh,

867
01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.630
the brush and everything and I just crawled one place or other than,

868
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.700
and I don't think he could see me,

869
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:47.420
but he was proud to see the leaves and branches working.

870
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:52.150
He is firing at me and everything.
And so,
uh,

871
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:57.320
a guy,
a big guy,
I had an aide for machine gun,
you know,

872
01:01:57.321 --> 01:02:02.321
that's an Eric [inaudible] 30 caliber weapon and he had an asbestos glove and he

873
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:10.010
was big enough and strong enough that he could fire short bust at a time with it

874
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:13.160
and everything.
So he said,
Harvey,

875
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.350
what tree is that guy?
And I said,
that big one over here on the left,

876
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.040
he said,
that

877
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.550
<v 5>doesn't mean a thing.
They're all big and on the left and right.</v>

878
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.060
And so I said,

879
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:31.890
fire at one of them rot,
Darnell,
I'll give you directions where to go.

880
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.020
So,
uh,

881
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:39.040
at got fired at me and they saw the,
where he was shooting up.

882
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:43.530
So this guy,
I wish I could think of his name,
big guy.

883
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.350
I admired him because he was big and strong,

884
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:51.740
but he just saturated that thing that a four machine gun and sure enough here

885
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:53.400
came a jap hanging.

886
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.690
He had a rope around his foot and that,
uh,

887
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:00.510
Nambuu machine gun,

888
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:04.500
that's the first zap weapon I'd seen as the first time I'd been shot at,

889
01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:09.390
you know,
so I remember the NAM move real well.
Well,

890
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:13.290
anyway,
uh,
uh,

891
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.130
um,
what was my first action and man,

892
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:20.400
I hated those jap machine guns,

893
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.040
but if I had to go to war right now,

894
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:28.580
I would get me a Jap nambuu machine gun and there's a picture of that weapon was

895
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.250
something else.

896
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.800
And she had a magazine and hold 20 shells and boots and I ran across another one

897
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:45.240
and he will gima nuts.
Another story.
And,
but uh,

898
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.170
<v 0>and then,</v>

899
01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:50.520
then you guys pretty much mopped up that first operation and there wasn't too

900
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:51.540
much resistance.

901
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.790
<v 5>Now they went in too much resistance and then the,</v>

902
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.020
and then you moved on after that.
Was that when you had it to Bogan Ville?

903
01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.350
Is that the next place we went to Bogan veil.

904
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.820
After that you got an interesting story in about uh,
about Bogan Ville.

905
01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:08.640
That kind of,
I think it's worse.

906
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.560
<v 0>Might be worth talking about a little bit because it's kind of shows how,</v>

907
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:20.280
you know,
war is not always what it's made out to be in the movies.
Um,

908
01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.090
so here we're going you,

909
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.240
you are actually speaking of toilet paper and in this particular situation you

910
01:04:28.551 --> 01:04:31.910
were just done.
Get it done.
You'd gone to relieve yourself,

911
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.360
buy a little house and then you hear the order.

912
01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:40.310
I heard the order move out on the double as I stood between the house and the

913
01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:41.930
Banyan tree,
buckling my belt,

914
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.170
something in the vague misty light caused caught my eye.

915
01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.060
I stood in wrapped amazement as a guy came diligently down the tree.

916
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.600
I could see that he had only a piece of cloth around his waist.

917
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.990
When he reached the bottom,
he bent forward as if to pick up a sandal.

918
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.830
I watched an utter wonderment as this scene played out before me.

919
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.170
Just a little guy.
When he straightened up,

920
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:07.190
I stepped up and brought my rifle stock across the back of his head with a

921
01:05:07.191 --> 01:05:11.900
glancing blow.
He turned as he crumpled and landed fully on his back.

922
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.050
I looked down and to my horror,

923
01:05:15.051 --> 01:05:20.051
I found myself looking at a female instead of a male stoned and shaken by my

924
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:25.270
act,
I choked on a Saab and trembled uncontrollably.
What had I done?

925
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:30.580
As I stood there,
bathed and pity and compassion,
all hell broke loose.

926
01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:34.510
The shatter and clatter of small arms fire broke the silence,

927
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:39.100
trying hard to choke back the sobs.
I raced to join the firefight.

928
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:44.250
Glad to leave that pitiful pathetic scene and act and outnumbering force.

929
01:05:45.051 --> 01:05:49.480
Pin this down all day,
although desperately busy.
During this time,

930
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:52.660
my thoughts kept going back to the base of that Banyan tree.

931
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.750
At mid day our ammunition ran low.

932
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.450
The sergeant ordered me back to the rear to find more.

933
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.100
I veered from a direct path to the beach to pass by that tree of infamy.

934
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.950
I found neither her nor her body.

935
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.910
I quickly ran around the tree and under the house to no avail.

936
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:13.120
I had ventured up the steps to look inside the house.
Inside.

937
01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:16.420
It looked like an infirmary or aid station,
but empty.

938
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.530
I hope that I'd only stunned her and she had walked away from the area.

939
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.451
After the incident.

940
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:25.510
I gave a great deal of thought to that lady in the Coconut Grove,

941
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.620
definitely of Oriental heritage.
I wondered her purpose there.

942
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.760
I thought of several possibilities she could have served as a nurse in the

943
01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:37.480
Japanese military or a resident of the island.

944
01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:42.070
Brought there by the late lever brothers soap company to work in the coconut

945
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:45.130
groves.
Also,
she might come from Korea,

946
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:49.360
one of the many Korean women kidnapped by the jabs to serve as prostitutes for

947
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:50.194
their military.

948
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.450
No matter the reason I hope and pray that she survived the blow to her head and

949
01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:58.870
the war in my lifespan.
I've stored many,

950
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:01.270
many items in my arsenal of memories.

951
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:05.680
The memory of that day so very long ago.
Rest among my most vivid,

952
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:11.290
the memorable events on that lonely beach on the far side of planet earth have

953
01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:13.420
not dimmed over time nor distance.

954
01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.930
It all took place because I crawled beneath the house.

955
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.400
<v 4>Okay.</v>

956
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.400
<v 0>I think I lost the last vestige of the little boy within me that day.</v>

957
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.873
<v 4>Okay.</v>

958
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.920
<v 3>Yeah.
That was really tough on me.
You know,</v>

959
01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:36.110
I remember my sisters,
you know,
and,
and thought bad.

960
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:39.740
Terrible.
It would be if they were hit like that.

961
01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:44.930
And it stuck with me all of these years.
You know,
I remember that little,

962
01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.690
the lady in that jungle,

963
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.800
that was another story.
Uh,

964
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:59.140
there we were sitting up bar.

965
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:03.960
What was the name of that beach?
Corey.
Corey beach.

966
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:09.630
We had heard that the Jap or a fiction and come up by her.

967
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:14.610
So it was,
he sent first,
but tie in up bar and a company of Raiders at buyer.

968
01:08:14.611 --> 01:08:15.590
We went a bar,

969
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.340
left our base at about 12 o'clock and it's 12 miles up the island.

970
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.440
And when we invaded,
they did it during the night.

971
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.640
We waited until he began to get light.
Well,

972
01:08:31.641 --> 01:08:36.410
there was a Japanese officer came in,
walked into the group.

973
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.740
I didn't see him cause I was out on the flank,

974
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.030
but it was a Japanese officer.
He came down,

975
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.040
Nag Hollerin instructions and everything and he didn't know it was marines.

976
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:49.910
It had come to shore.

977
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:55.090
He thought it was cause they were building up to invade that area where we're

978
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.750
building the airstrips,
you know,

979
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.680
and so they shot him dead rotten and all hell break loose because we were

980
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:08.480
outnumbered 10 to one.

981
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.500
And when I finished with doing my job and hurting that little girl,

982
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.830
well I ran the kitchen with a bunch,
you know,

983
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.060
well the first car caught up with him,
why did he mains?

984
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.390
And he was in my company and everything.

985
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:31.690
So we went on an apparent and we use on the very end the flank and uh,

986
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.900
we both had Johnson rifles and that's all we had to protect that flank with.

987
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.400
And that's a weak part of the line.

988
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:45.970
And Hall came up there or I'd say about nine or 10 o'clock,

989
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:50.930
he said,
uh,
what do you all doing down here?

990
01:09:50.931 --> 01:09:52.610
You're supposed to be up there with us.

991
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.200
And they'd gone on up there and we've worked a B company.

992
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:02.540
We were with B Company and a company was in the middle of the,

993
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:07.820
of the group,
you know.
And so he just said,

994
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:11.390
well stay here and I'll get,
get a name for down here,

995
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:16.070
protect this blank.
You know,
the flank is a weak point in the line,

996
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:17.300
said Y'all protect it.

997
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.400
Whether it was a coconut grove that we hit into and they had a road behind that

998
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:31.001
coconut grove and those Japs were using that whole material up power to invade

999
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:37.870
that airstrip.
And so here,
why the,

1000
01:10:37.871 --> 01:10:41.930
and our own the flank that and that's where we're detecting whether they began

1001
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:43.550
to send,
uh,

1002
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:48.500
planes a diner and they would stray from that road,

1003
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:52.860
uh,
that we were,
uh,

1004
01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.160
struck out alone,
you know,

1005
01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.910
and those planes were coming hard and fast and fat and to come up our

1006
01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:01.970
protectors,

1007
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:06.310
they don't have wiped us out cause it a whole regiment of Jeff [inaudible]

1008
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.680
fixing to invade that deal.
Dot Day.

1009
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.560
And those planes were coming just one after another and it didn't even bother to

1010
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:17.880
put up the landing gears.

1011
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:23.010
They just left them down and we'd come along.

1012
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:25.950
Strafe nude drop bombs along the way.

1013
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:30.690
And we were on the very end.
We,
we've afraid there's going to start,

1014
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:33.870
they're shooting for,
they got to,
we'd get out there and wave,

1015
01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:38.820
I don't rotten and they'd go buy signal wave at us and start strafing.
And uh,

1016
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.470
we were there all day long and uh,

1017
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:49.500
and the commander down at,
uh,
at the dire just told him to,
to,

1018
01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:53.380
uh,
uh,
sending it up,
uh,
uh,

1019
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:58.020
crafts to take us off and vegans answered,
no,

1020
01:11:58.021 --> 01:12:02.760
we're not going to be the first man,
uh,
marines to be pushed off of a beach.

1021
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.440
We were scheduled to be taken off at seven o'clock and that's when we will start

1022
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:10.290
boarding oh boat.

1023
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.560
So we was out all day long and it was a long day and haul.

1024
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.140
It came up are few times and we've had Johnson rifles.

1025
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:26.370
We didn't have the n one rifle.
We had Jerry Johnson.

1026
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:30.240
Ralph was a 30 caliber,
a cylinder fed.
Uh,

1027
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.460
they didn't even use clips in them.

1028
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:37.960
Not Thought it was the best weapon that I had besides in the,
in the war,

1029
01:12:37.961 --> 01:12:42.961
beside the Nambuu and a hollowed bring us ammunition up there.

1030
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:49.170
And then he finally come up there late in the afternoon.
He said,

1031
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.060
you guys make this last cause there's,
we're nearly out of ammunition.

1032
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:59.990
And so here we were and we couldn't do anything until seven o'clock.

1033
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.060
So ships,
Higgins boats were out there circling,

1034
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.700
waiting for seven o'clock,
I guess,
because then,
uh,

1035
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.710
uh,
odd fairs came up and he said,
now we're going to be taken off.

1036
01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.180
And we started at seven o'clock and that's about an hour and a half from now.

1037
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.120
And the guys next to you,
they're in company B now

1038
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.790
because of the mix up.
You know why he remains.

1039
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.370
And I was involved in,
well,
anyway,

1040
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.800
uh,
at first told us,
said,

1041
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:43.530
when these guys over here,

1042
01:13:43.531 --> 01:13:46.140
they're going to leave and when they leave,

1043
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:49.680
they're going to Holler and let you know that they're leaving.

1044
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.060
You count to 50 as fast as he can and then get down to the beach.

1045
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.420
Okay.
So we sit there and we sit there.

1046
01:13:57.421 --> 01:14:01.060
We hear these boats coming in and taking off and uh,

1047
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.130
shooting and everything on it right there.
I said,
why did he,
Gosh,
what time is,

1048
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:06.300
uh,

1049
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.300
we should be getting out of here and everything and why did you shed hollered

1050
01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:15.790
over our,
those other guys,
right.
Done.
They didn't answer us.

1051
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:20.560
So I walked over there and they'd already lived and didn't call it out.

1052
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.180
So here we were,

1053
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.500
only two guys left on the beach,
I guess.

1054
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.020
And we started running a lot of,
it's pretty fast.
So I took,
uh,

1055
01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:35.590
why this uh,
uh,

1056
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.150
Johnson rifle and I cared both of them down there and it's still beat him down

1057
01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:45.040
to the bus.
I mean,
who the
Higgins boat.

1058
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:48.670
But it wasn't the Higgins boat.
It was a,

1059
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.260
<v 6>okay,</v>

1060
01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.590
<v 3>it was a one l CVP.
Oh,</v>

1061
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.550
CVT is heavier than the Higgins boat is all steel.
Right?

1062
01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:03.430
So here we are running down there and Hollerin don't leave it on leave and

1063
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.080
everything.
Well,

1064
01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.830
odd Ferriss was on the deck and uh,

1065
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.700
and the ramp on that LSV was at about a 45 degree angle because that was taking

1066
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:21.630
shots from the Japs.
And Out Ferris was,
they'd done.

1067
01:15:21.631 --> 01:15:26.190
Now he and uh,
and uh,

1068
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:30.980
uh,
uh,
uh,
Captain Hayes,

1069
01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:35.981
he captained by this time he was trying to hold us up and everything.

1070
01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:40.470
And Fagan was on that boat and this little toxin on the thing right there.

1071
01:15:40.471 --> 01:15:45.290
I said,
we're moving out.
We leave and not a Vegan city.
Forties,
we'd feed,

1072
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:50.310
there's guys down there and put the pistol in that kids have put this back on.

1073
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.000
I'm blow year bleep,
paid off,

1074
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:58.420
we put it back on there and the guys that are around that they,

1075
01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.800
this telling us about what happened.

1076
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:04.640
And so here we are running and so forth.

1077
01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.400
And I got down there and,

1078
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:12.490
and unfair stucco's to Ralph and threw them up on up there into the boat and uh,

1079
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.450
uh,
hall got them to the Lord a little bit throughout the thing.
And then,

1080
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:26.840
uh,
uh,
unfair took us by our foot,

1081
01:16:26.841 --> 01:16:27.051
you know,

1082
01:16:27.051 --> 01:16:31.640
and he's just up there and haul full of this on the in and I got up burn here,

1083
01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.380
uh Oh,
why remains finally got there.
And uh,

1084
01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.570
that's how we got off the island.

1085
01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:44.060
But you held the line until seven o'clock yeah.
As you were ordered.
Yeah.

1086
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.220
Yeah.
The,
uh,

1087
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:51.580
it took about 30 to 40 minutes,
I guess to get everybody off there.

1088
01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:54.820
And we were the last two to get off the,
I don't know.

1089
01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:56.933
<v 6>And uh,</v>

1090
01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.080
<v 3>I'd been on the beach before.</v>

1091
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:05.530
I didn't want to be on a beach again and Japanese territory.
Now,

1092
01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:10.100
once you got back on the boat or you got back out,
now the

1093
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.930
<v 2>next thing to do is prepare for you.
Oh,</v>

1094
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.810
<v 5>well we got back,
uh,
uh,</v>

1095
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:16.630
<v 4>okay.</v>

1096
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:21.600
<v 5>They take shot.
We got back on a destroyer and which headed heading back in,
uh,</v>

1097
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.850
two,
uh,
and purser gutters bay.

1098
01:17:24.851 --> 01:17:29.851
That was on Bogan vls where we invaded if set up a script in order to attack New

1099
01:17:32.831 --> 01:17:35.050
Guinea.
But anyway,

1100
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:37.723
<v 6>uh,</v>

1101
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:40.960
<v 5>we got the word,
uh,</v>

1102
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.620
I forget exactly when it got to that breaking up.

1103
01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:48.730
The paratroopers were just coming back to this stage.
Okay.

1104
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.480
And so we got back to the states and

1105
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:53.730
<v 4>okay.</v>

1106
01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:56.680
<v 5>Well integrated into the fifth division.</v>

1107
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:59.950
<v 2>Oh,
okay.
Well that's interesting that you do,</v>

1108
01:17:59.951 --> 01:18:02.710
so that this is when you told the whole story about your mom coming to bring you

1109
01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:06.970
45.
This is when this is now happening.
Yeah.
That one.

1110
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.970
And did you,
did you guys just sailed back to America?

1111
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:11.970
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1112
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:15.270
<v 5>Yeah,
we came on back to America.
It was on liberty ship.</v>

1113
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.460
<v 6>Okay.
And,
uh,
and they got</v>

1114
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:26.360
back to Pendleton and,
uh hmm.

1115
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.290
<v 5>We got a little leave.
I don't know how long it was.</v>

1116
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.750
It might've been 30 days leave,
you know,

1117
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:37.700
and then we started farming up in the fifth division

1118
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.010
<v 6>and that's when I,
uh,</v>

1119
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.160
<v 5>oh,
when we got back
hours,
uh,</v>

1120
01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.400
I had,
what do you call,

1121
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:52.913
<v 4>uh,</v>

1122
01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.900
<v 5>the could,
you know,
I broke out all over the body.</v>

1123
01:18:57.901 --> 01:19:01.650
It just like having athlete's foot on their whole body.

1124
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:06.540
And,
uh,
so they brought us back and,
uh,

1125
01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:11.700
and then another story I might throw in here,

1126
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:16.770
we were stationed over there at Camp Pendleton.

1127
01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:22.860
And,
uh,
we landed up one morning to go to chow,
you know,

1128
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:27.510
it was still about half dark,
you know,
and we were standing there and,

1129
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.260
and art fairs is out in front

1130
01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:33.843
<v 6>and there's</v>

1131
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.030
<v 5>a group come marching up there,
turned out to be women.</v>

1132
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.950
<v 6>And uh,
yeah,</v>

1133
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.070
<v 5>God first said,
well,
this,</v>

1134
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.450
this man's outfit is going to go into pots.

1135
01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:53.770
We have dogs in our,
and then we have this group in here and everything.

1136
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:55.350
Now we've got women in here

1137
01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:01.560
shaking his head and then we heard holding her.

1138
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:05.440
The guy up here said fire too for effect.

1139
01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.420
Another guy down here hollered back,
Bam,
Bam,

1140
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:15.390
and overwhelming,
nearly broke ranks.
Okay.
On out to those guys.

1141
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:20.480
And I found out what Bam meant,
the broad ass marine,

1142
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.730
and they then go for that.

1143
01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.210
It won't break Gregson come out of her room.

1144
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.233
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1145
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:34.070
that was when I first found out that there were women in the Marine Corps.

1146
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:37.700
<v 5>And so now you're preparing,
at this point,</v>

1147
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:42.440
you're preparing to go back overseas or with the fifth?
The fifth marines.
Yeah.

1148
01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:47.720
And your division,
or sorry,
fifth division,
which is in the 26th marines.

1149
01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.800
Got It.
Got It.
And is this when you,

1150
01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:54.860
is this when you met Basil loan back here in California?

1151
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1152
01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.360
<v 3>Uh,
yeah.
Uh,</v>

1153
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.980
his group was over there at the chow line one time and several of the guys that

1154
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.960
are just mashed it alone,
there's bashed alone.
Of course.
He was my,
he rode to,

1155
01:21:08.961 --> 01:21:12.890
you know,
so as soon as we got there,
land up there,

1156
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.390
go into the Chow Hall,
I snuck over and I said,
sir,

1157
01:21:17.391 --> 01:21:20.400
can I shake your hand?
He certainly,

1158
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:25.590
he shook my hand bag and that was my experience with now copper Darcia had told

1159
01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:30.380
me quite a bit about and loan because they were,

1164
01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:50.690

1165
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:53.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1166
01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:58.000
<v 3>And uh,
and then,
uh,
you know,
he came back,</v>

1167
01:21:58.150 --> 01:22:01.030
it was in prayed,
oh,

1168
01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:03.580
bond drives and so forth.

1169
01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.740
And he had it made,
but he wanted to get back to who?

1170
01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:11.680
The Marine Corps and work

1171
01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:13.810
<v 1>okay.</v>

1172
01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:15.940
<v 3>With the Marines groups again.</v>

1173
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.940
So we joined up and came back and he got killed at,
he will Jima.

1174
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:22.130
Okay.

1175
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:25.430
<v 5>Now was wasn't a,
and we'll get to that for sure.
It wasn't,
um,</v>

1176
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.170
well did I read that copper was actually chesty polars runner?

1177
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.240
Yeah.
In Guam was at Guadalcanal water canal.
Yeah.
He was

1178
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:37.280
<v 3>talking about water canal all the time,
you know,</v>

1179
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:40.550
and I had never heard of the heart,
uh,

1180
01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.940
chesty puller Carbor shard telling him about it and there was a thing and uh,

1181
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:54.470
cobber load that all of the marines load though chesty puller and uh,

1182
01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:59.990
I'd like to have served under it,
but are served under some good guys.

1183
01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:03.290
Uh,
Fagan was one of them.
He was,

1184
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:08.950
<v 5>uh,
you know,
he wasn't little like chesty puller waters,</v>

1185
01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.490
but he was an efficient leader of man,
not that.

1186
01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.890
And then went to the w two.

1187
01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:19.190
You're back home in America for how long are you back home for getting ready to

1188
01:23:19.191 --> 01:23:20.024
head back over?

1189
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:25.200
<v 3>Well,
let's see.
Wasn't one too long,
you know,
they,</v>

1190
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.000
uh,
I had to go,
go over that.

1191
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:35.001
I told you had to go to the hospital and be treated for,

1192
01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.290
we called it Japanese crud,
no Chinese crud.

1193
01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:43.320
And it was just breaking out,
you know,

1194
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:48.060
kind of like I always started kinda like athlete's foot or with their whole

1195
01:23:48.061 --> 01:23:53.061
bodily and the only treatment they'd put some kind of blue medicine on this,

1196
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:54.483
another thing.

1197
01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:59.930
And so I was over here in the bar bell ball hospital for nearly a month before I

1198
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:06.660
was released from there or I got rid of,

1199
01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:10.260
there was a lot of us in that same position,
you know,

1200
01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.713
and then

1201
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.580
<v 5>back on another ship to head back overseas.</v>

1202
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:20.720
<v 3>Well we trained over here for a couple of months and then</v>

1203
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.340
we,
uh,
we was trained up for,

1204
01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.830
to go overseas and we may,
uh,
uh,

1205
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:35.510
practice invasion of one that is Lyle and is off,
uh,
off of here.

1206
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:39.800
And we invaded it,
you know,
practicing.

1207
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.553
And,
uh,

1208
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:45.110
<v 5>and when we got there,
we land up on the beach,</v>

1209
01:24:45.111 --> 01:24:49.710
knew he kept sitting there waiting to be told to move on the end or something

1210
01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:53.530
that we set our and sit there and everything.
Finally,

1211
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:57.600
the officers that came out and told her said,
hey,
we're going back on the ships.

1212
01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.610
We had an overseas he and,

1213
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.720
<v 3>and so we went back a board,</v>

1214
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.360
she up and went over here,

1215
01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:12.360
came over here to Camp Pendleton and started getting ready to go back overseas

1216
01:25:12.361 --> 01:25:13.194
again.

1217
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.610
And that's when I asked my mother,

1218
01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:21.600
find me a pistol and she,
she came over.

1219
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.870
<v 5>And then what you do more training and kept target.</v>

1220
01:25:23.871 --> 01:25:26.180
That's the big island of Hawaii.
Yeah.
Okay.

1221
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:28.910
So your name was called Camp Tara Rural.

1222
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.920
<v 3>So we trained and I was us when I was assigned to an assault squad and,</v>

1223
01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:43.240
uh,
it was a demolition guy in that thing

1224
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.610
and that was quite an experience.
And uh,

1225
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:51.303
let's see,

1226
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:55.570
then we trained and got ready to go to,

1227
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.320
to,
uh,
he will

1228
01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.190
and while we training there,

1229
01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:07.070
their camp tolerable on the big island,
you know,

1230
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:10.520
Atlanta's up ever Tuesday.
No,

1231
01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:14.450
I mean Wednesday and give us two cans.
Oh,

1232
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:19.910
lucky lager beer.
I didn't drink route,
but covered,

1233
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:20.990
loved that beer.

1234
01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:26.650
And so I would give my to to him and he would take an hide those and drank his

1235
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:32.870
two would the boys,
you know,
and he swore me to secrecy.

1236
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:34.790
Don't you tell anybody that I got to,

1237
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:39.260
so when he hit the island of [inaudible] Jima,

1238
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:42.590
he was carrying 14 cans of beer.

1239
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.700
<v 5>Well anyway,
on the way over there,</v>

1240
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:50.510
I see there's a picture in your book and you got hit with a little demo Satchel

1241
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:54.290
law,
but you say there's no demo in that saturates all beer beer.

1242
01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.520
And he threw away his a gas mask and had four cans of beer and that gas mass.

1243
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.470
Oh,
that's what it was.
Gas Mask.
Dictator bag,
you know.
Well,
anyway,

1244
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.680
uh,
we heard on the ship,

1245
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:13.070
we listened to Tokyo rollers,
you know,

1246
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:17.120
we like to listen to her because she played good music.
You know,

1247
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:19.850
when she's supposed to be breaking our moat morale down.

1248
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:23.690
But she was helping our morale.
Well,
she said,
well,

1249
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:25.160
I hear that the marines,

1250
01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:30.340
but she always had heard that the little marines are going to be hitting one of

1251
01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:35.300
our islands soon.
And uh,
she said they better brang their yes.

1252
01:27:35.301 --> 01:27:39.430
Mass.
And we heard that,
you know,
and I said,

1253
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.040
[inaudible] once you're going to do,
I'm going to shoot you.

1254
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.620
And so
they didn't use gas gas on us.

1255
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.430
Thank goodness.
Did you,
uh,

1256
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.910
when do you find out back then,
when did you find out,
hey,
the target,
is he,
oh,

1257
01:27:57.911 --> 01:27:59.240
Gima that's where you're going.

1258
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:03.080
When did you start getting that briefing and know where you're actually heading

1259
01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:07.730
was at once you're on board the ships?
Yeah,
we were on the board ship for,

1260
01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.830
well,
we've got a board ship

1261
01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:16.010
<v 3>and we sailed around and we went over and made a couple of practice landings in</v>

1262
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:20.100
those islands.
And,
uh,
Hawaii,
you know,

1263
01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.010
and so we went ashore,
uh,
uh,

1264
01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.500
be anchored out at Pearl Harbor,
you know,

1265
01:28:28.501 --> 01:28:33.501
and they gave us three or four hours leave off the ships,

1266
01:28:33.511 --> 01:28:34.344
you know,

1267
01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:39.710
so it was a group of us together was bound in town here in Hawaii.

1268
01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:48.090
This is not Hawaii though,
is close.
Anyway,

1269
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.870
anyway,
we were all then and,

1270
01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:55.860
and one of the guys in my group was walking around and,

1271
01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.370
and golf knows everything,
you know,

1272
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:01.970
on the island and it's got

1273
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.910
<v 5>named Lucas.</v>

1274
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:08.310
It was in my group when was walking around,
he lived,
he said,

1275
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:10.440
there's my cousin over there.

1276
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:17.210
And so we went across the street and it was uh,

1277
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:23.490
uh,
Lucas,
his cousin,
you know,
what was his name?

1278
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.160
Jacqueline Lucas,
you know,

1279
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:31.910
and so he stayed with us and walking around and everything and we say,

1280
01:29:33.711 --> 01:29:35.190
we got to go back to the ship.

1281
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:40.680
And so we went back to her ship and Jacqueline and Lucas was still with us.

1282
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:44.040
And when he went,
oh boy,
we got a board.
He went in and checked in.

1283
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:49.050
He was on there about three days out.
I said,
uh,

1284
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:53.610
I talking to the other Lucas,
you know.

1285
01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:55.150
<v 2>So was he a civilian?</v>

1286
01:29:55.151 --> 01:29:59.200
Was Jack was the cousin of civilian or was he had another marine or here's

1287
01:29:59.201 --> 01:30:02.880
another marine.
Lucas was marine.

1288
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.970
And so he just wanted to board

1289
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.790
<v 5>with us and uh,</v>

1290
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:11.490
and he was there for about three days and I said,

1291
01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:16.491
you better take your cousin over there and tell him that he's not a board his

1292
01:30:16.951 --> 01:30:19.560
ship where you're supposed to be with his outfit.

1293
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:23.400
He was going to be a replacement in a first division,

1294
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.360
but he wound up in the fifth division.
What was

1295
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:35.640
in the 26 marines?
Yeah,
26 marines with us.

1296
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.670
And uh,
he,
uh,

1297
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.903
he got hurt.

1298
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:47.150
He threw himself on a hand grenade and our two hanger UNAIDS and saved him his

1299
01:30:49.591 --> 01:30:53.490
buddies,
you know,
and he got the congressional medal of honor.

1300
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:58.920
You've probably seen or heard of him cause he,
and uh,

1301
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.450
he was from Mississippi.

1302
01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:06.720
I forget the name of the town.

1303
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:12.350
And I just thought I was going over to see this guy and in Georgia and I,

1304
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:18.360
uh,
went through that town and,

1305
01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.590
and I got past it.
So I said,

1306
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.840
I'm just go back and see old Lucas.

1307
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:31.790
And so I'll turn around as the turnaround is going back as heard on the radio

1308
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:37.730
that he had passed away during the night and that was the last I seen a heard of

1309
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:44.250
him,
you know,
then,
um,

1310
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:49.620
<v 2>so you finished up your training in Hawaii.
Now is your next stop going to be?</v>

1311
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.650
Yeah,
he will.
Yeah.
Did you guys,

1312
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:58.370
did you guys know what did the intelligence that you got paint the picture that

1313
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.100
he will was going to be

1314
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.860
<v 0>a really,
really hard fight.
Did you guys know that going in?</v>

1315
01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:09.000
<v 5>We had no idea what was just another island.
But when,
uh,</v>

1316
01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:13.170
when it got light and I looked around and saw all the battleships and,

1317
01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:15.180
and just

1318
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.750
<v 0>so you weren't any more nervous for that?
You just thought,
well,</v>

1319
01:32:18.751 --> 01:32:21.940
I'm going to go do what I've done the last few times.
No hours,

1320
01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:26.430
<v 5>Garrett today.
Fair enough.
Well,</v>

1321
01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:32.640
you know,
uh,
odd fares and Captain Hall.

1322
01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:37.470
I reserved runner and I was telling him before I'd ever seen any action,

1323
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:42.300
I said,
well,
I don't remember how it will be when we see action.
I,

1324
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.020
I'm afraid it'll be scared to death.
And everything.

1325
01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:51.390
And Captain Hall said,
that's what you want to be.

1326
01:32:51.391 --> 01:32:54.180
You want to be scared to death.

1327
01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.100
He said he should be scared half to death.
And you know,

1328
01:32:59.101 --> 01:33:03.660
there's no meaning to that being scared half to death because I was just scared

1329
01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:06.600
half to death.
And a lot of times,
you know,
I'm still alive,

1330
01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.710
but they said,
when you're scared,

1331
01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:14.640
when they're taking sober at dumps,

1332
01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:19.230
adrenaline into your brain and to your muscles and you react and everything.

1333
01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:23.730
And I know that's what happens to me because when I got hurt,
I was,

1334
01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:28.030
uh,
knew what was going on and knew what I had to do,

1335
01:33:28.031 --> 01:33:30.540
but a steel just scared that I can be.

1336
01:33:31.230 --> 01:33:33.840
And that's what saved me.
I think.

1337
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.830
<v 0>Um,
three already.
Did you already get,</v>

1338
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:42.460
why'd you already been wounded at this point before you vote?

1339
01:33:42.461 --> 01:33:46.360
Who you wounded in any of the other,
uh,
on [inaudible] so you're still,

1340
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:49.200
you're still as lucky as they come right at this point?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1341
01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.200
<v 5>Um,
uh,</v>

1342
01:33:50.690 --> 01:33:55.690
when wounded at all now copper had been wounded before we hit a will.

1343
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.740
He had been wounded at Guadalcanal.
And,

1344
01:34:01.741 --> 01:34:06.450
uh,
he got,
uh,
that night,

1345
01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.050
that bass alone,
uh,

1346
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:14.390
did his thing and he was all about 30 or 40 yards from bashed alone and on that

1347
01:34:15.841 --> 01:34:18.270
line,
you know,
and the shale hit him.

1348
01:34:18.271 --> 01:34:23.271
So they took him off and he had a lot of those guys got malaria and he had

1349
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:27.510
malaria real bad,

1350
01:34:27.511 --> 01:34:31.380
and they took him to Australia

1351
01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:36.330
and there was a ship,
they're going back.

1352
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.270
And he was so with that,

1353
01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:45.710
that wound that they hadn't been able to treat it because the navy took off with

1354
01:34:46.411 --> 01:34:50.910
all the,
the,
uh,
medical gear and everything.

1355
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:55.620
So he actually didn't see a doctor until he got back to Australia.

1356
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.273
And

1357
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:59.960
<v 3>so he went back,</v>

1358
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:05.390
got back to the states and he wouldn't take a discharge.

1359
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:09.590
And they sent a corpsman back with him.
You know,

1360
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:14.030
he just put it on a merchant ship going back.
It wasn't a navy ship at all.

1361
01:35:14.031 --> 01:35:18.200
The emergency,
if it was going by and that Korman said,

1362
01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:19.761
carver,

1363
01:35:19.761 --> 01:35:24.761
this is in your home to die and they're going to discharge you.

1364
01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.360
And,
uh,
so cover,

1365
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:33.350
he said he didn't know whether to believe that Korman or not,

1366
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:38.410
but they sent him up to till them my Gargen and uh,

1367
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.490
there was,
they had a balloon station up,
uh,
you know,

1368
01:35:43.491 --> 01:35:48.320
they put big balloons up in the area or we own cables,
you know,

1369
01:35:48.321 --> 01:35:52.370
to protect areas,
you know,
uh,

1370
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:54.740
military areas.

1371
01:35:55.060 --> 01:36:00.060
The Japanese would probably sleep if they tried to invade us.

1372
01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:06.670
So he got in with a cross bill Krause up at time and a guy named halls fly.

1373
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:13.580
He hosts flower,
I can't think of his name,

1374
01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.980
but he's from Wichita falls and we nicknamed the horse flies.

1375
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:23.510
He's always talking about horses.
Well,
anyway,

1376
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:27.920
uh,
they were up our garden,

1377
01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:30.560
a naval base at Tillamook,
Oregon,

1378
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:36.230
and they was trying to get back,
uh,
fleet marines,
you know,

1379
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.720
and they wouldn't send them.

1380
01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.860
So they was doing things that they shouldn't be doing.

1381
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:46.930
They wrecked the jeep and that brought it to a head and they said,
here,

1382
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:50.150
going back there to a rifle company.

1383
01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.420
So that's the way he got back in to the rifle.
Okay.
Yeah,
there's,

1384
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.070
that's where you want those guys that are out wrecking jeeps.

1385
01:36:58.071 --> 01:37:03.070
Put 'em right back and rifle company.
Yeah.
Well,
uh,
I'd,

1386
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:05.600
uh,
I was,

1387
01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:09.530
when I was putting in the hospital where the Chinese crud and,

1388
01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.140
and lost,
uh,

1389
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:18.160
contact with my outfit and so forth and wind up with a,

1390
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:23.090
uh,
nails Copeland.
And,
uh,
in the barracks over there,

1391
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:26.390
there's nearly empty.
And so,
uh,

1392
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:31.810
I went over and checked in and,
uh,

1393
01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.230
Copeland was the sergeant in charge and he was the only guy in the whole

1394
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:39.740
barracks.
And I said,
where is,
everybody said,
well,

1395
01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.480
this is emptied out.
We were waiting to fill up again.
He said,

1396
01:37:44.481 --> 01:37:47.690
just go down there and find the bunk anywhere in the end.
I said,
well,

1397
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:51.980
what room do you want me to be in it?
Well,
the lower floor,

1398
01:37:51.981 --> 01:37:55.010
they said they're not three or four guys down and I anyway,

1399
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.910
take any and they bunk you won't,
you know.

1400
01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:03.240
So I've fooled around our and ate supper and everything and,

1401
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.530
and got in in the bunk,

1402
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:11.090
hung my uniform on the end of the bunk on the hanger.

1403
01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:12.913
And uh,

1404
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:14.583
<v 1>okay.</v>

1405
01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.580
<v 3>And I was sound asleep</v>

1406
01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:22.560
and about 10 o'clock lights went on and all these guys are hollering,

1407
01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:25.710
saying,
and then everything right there,
I said,

1408
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:29.010
you guys knock it off and turn out that light.

1409
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:32.070
Who said that big boy

1410
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:38.290
who said that?
Like I said,
I said,

1411
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:43.310
I get those last turned off and here he comes over a warrior warriors.

1412
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:47.760
So He'd come down there,
he was going to fight me.

1413
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.340
So I jumped over that bunk order,

1414
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.980
mad enough to fight anybody.
So here he come.

1415
01:38:55.981 --> 01:38:59.550
He was not much bigger than I was,
you know,

1416
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.110
because he been hurt,
you know,
and everything.

1417
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.190
And he saw my uniform and I had my ribbons on [inaudible],
hey,

1418
01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:10.500
you're a combat marine,
welcome aboard.

1419
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:15.240
Come on over here.
And we got some,
uh,
uh,

1420
01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:21.000
some sandwiches and some beer and so forth.
Come on over here and join us.

1421
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.610
I said,
I'll eat a sandwich so I don't drink beer.

1422
01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:28.710
And so that's how I met cupboard doors.
And,

1423
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:32.020
uh,
we'd go on liberty together and

1424
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:33.783
<v 1>okay.</v>

1425
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.110
<v 3>And they liked their booze and uh,</v>

1426
01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:41.180
and horsefly I liked his booze too.
And he,
he drank pretty heavily.

1427
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.960
So the Windup,
I didn't drink,

1428
01:39:44.961 --> 01:39:49.961
so I haven't just take care of horse fly and they would add dates and he hadn't

1429
01:39:52.581 --> 01:39:57.581
cross covering costs would go off to somewhere and I had to take,

1430
01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:02.270
uh,
care of a horsefly while we,

1431
01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:07.290
we were out in alieve Grover someplace here in

1432
01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:13.180
post to San Diego,
I guess what is closer to La I guess.

1433
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:18.880
And we couldn't find a taxi or anything and I didn't know what to do.

1434
01:40:18.881 --> 01:40:22.420
I couldn't find a place to stay with him and everything.

1435
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:27.010
So it was an all night movie going on showing porno films.

1436
01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:31.990
So we went in there and we won't went to sleep,

1437
01:40:31.991 --> 01:40:35.770
woke up next morning.
Films were still showing.
So I got him out.

1438
01:40:35.771 --> 01:40:40.540
We finally got home or back to camp and,

1439
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:41.880
uh,
uh,

1440
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:47.070
my experience with Hall Sfla a housefly was killed and he will and a cover and,

1441
01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.213
<v 1>okay.</v>

1442
01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.810
<v 3>And Carlos were wounded too.</v>

1443
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.283
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1444
01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:02.890
<v 2>let's see,
I end the book.
I told him how to copper was wounded,
didn't,
uh,
yeah,</v>

1445
01:41:02.891 --> 01:41:07.360
you did.
That's a,
that's,
you want to hear that now?
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.

1446
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.890
You hit the beach at,
I mean let's,
let's just take it from you.

1447
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:14.350
You hit the beach at,
at,
at he will.

1448
01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.940
And I mean you weren't the landing at Iie.
Whoa.

1449
01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:22.330
Relative to some of the other landings at the Marine Corps done at this point

1450
01:41:22.331 --> 01:41:25.720
was,
well,
I mean,
what was your,
what was your

1451
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:27.540
<v 3>well,
low for an,</v>

1452
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:32.590
the Japanese always tried to stop us before we got to the beach and he will,

1453
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:38.210
they let us get on the beach and that's when they really opened up with

1454
01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:41.870
everything to had,
you know,
and uh,
and it was

1455
01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:48.410
more effective than trying to stop this before we got to the beach or we were on

1456
01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:51.204
the beach and,

1457
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:56.760
and a lot of officers and NCL was where kills,

1458
01:41:56.761 --> 01:42:00.990
you know,
off the beach.
So here we are laying on the beach and,

1459
01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.800
and it sloped and guidance were laying down on that thing.

1460
01:42:04.801 --> 01:42:07.700
And when were smarter Shit,
uh,

1461
01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:12.540
Marcell coming in like land raindrops when they'd hit.

1462
01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:17.700
And this explosion goes out and up.
You know,
what did,

1463
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.800
we was all laying on the ground and not resist inviting those shelves to come in

1464
01:42:23.131 --> 01:42:26.400
and close to us,
you know,
and,
and so congress said,

1465
01:42:26.401 --> 01:42:29.700
we got to get off this off this beat.
So we started

1466
01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:35.370
hollering,
get off the beach run.
So we ran,
man,
I ran.

1467
01:42:35.371 --> 01:42:39.600
And the first thing,
you know,
all along the beach on the other side,

1468
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:43.380
that's when I realized there's only little line.
And uh,

1469
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:49.040
so we got over there and,
and,
and uh,

1470
01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:52.680
I heard that hall,
it had been killed on the boat.

1471
01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:56.640
And I cried because I loved that man.
I mean,

1472
01:42:56.641 --> 01:43:01.641
he treated me like a son and art fairs had been wounded too,

1473
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.790
but,
uh,

1474
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.640
<v 4>uh,
uh,</v>

1475
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:12.130
<v 3>hallway got it off right on the beach and one of those sales and got him.</v>

1476
01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:16.630
And I was,
uh,
we,
we got over there and,

1477
01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:21.160
and it wasn't,
they weren't firing in that area.

1478
01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:25.990
So we spread out waiting for somebody to come or to take over.
You know,

1479
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.490
we didn't know what to do.

1480
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:32.670
So I was laying are propped up against a deal and I heard a shot real close to

1481
01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:37.180
us and everything.
I looked around and uh,

1482
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.510
and I couldn't see anybody shooting,
you know,

1483
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:46.800
and then looked over about 20 to 30 yards as a piece of tn raised up.

1484
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.930
And,
uh,
Ralph would come out,
shot some,

1485
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:54.590
made it another shot show.

1486
01:43:54.630 --> 01:43:59.540
I told him the guy in and over next to me and he had a riot gun.

1487
01:43:59.541 --> 01:44:00.141
We called them.

1488
01:44:00.141 --> 01:44:04.930
It was a 12 gauge shotgun with just a few balls and a,

1489
01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.740
uh,
uh,
cadre is,
you know,
I said,
come on,

1490
01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:11.960
follow me.
He said,
where are we going?
I said,

1491
01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:15.020
we're going to go over and have some fun.
So I said,

1492
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:17.720
as a sniper in this whole,

1493
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:21.400
under this piece of tea and I'm going to raise that up and you just shoot to

1494
01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.210
shoot in there.
And so I raised a Jap,
looked upon that guy,

1495
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:28.830
cut loose.
We're about shotgun,
about tap far.

1496
01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.540
What'll Masset well that God never seen.
Nice.

1497
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:35.750
And before with how the shotgun he threw up.

1498
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:41.910
And,
uh,
but that's,
that's the first real thing I did on,

1499
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.730
uh,
on the will

1500
01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:48.800
<v 2>you,
a couple things that I wanted to just real quick ask about.</v>

1501
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:50.610
One of them was you,

1502
01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:55.620
you described in the book how the ground was literally hot from like the lava

1503
01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.210
and it was uncomfortable to lie down on,

1504
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.190
<v 3>couldn't lay on the scholar,</v>

1505
01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:06.260
the it's steam heat coming from up to that volcanic ash.

1506
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:11.240
You know,
they keep talking about the sands of Iie will gym.

1507
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.450
I wasn't saying that was,

1508
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:16.310
it was ash volcanic ash.

1509
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:21.320
It was like BB size,
the old,

1510
01:45:21.970 --> 01:45:25.210
and it's
not saying

1511
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:25.740
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1512
01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.600
And it was literally too hot to lay down on a lot of places and it was too cold.

1513
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.100
I was going to say,
you know,

1514
01:45:32.101 --> 01:45:36.140
in the military we always get the worst of both worlds.
Yeah.
And you end,

1515
01:45:36.150 --> 01:45:39.950
it was too cold at night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was cold at night.

1516
01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.710
You need something over here.
So we'd lay something on the deck,
you know,

1517
01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:49.100
box or cardboard or extra blankets or something just to get off the thing.

1518
01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:56.370
And then you put a Poncho over and that would hold the heat to keep you warm,

1519
01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:01.320
but it wouldn't scholarly and no.
Yes.
And then what about the,
uh,
the,
uh,

1520
01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:05.430
razor burn razor grass?
I've heard about that.

1521
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:09.660
Let me tell you.
When I heard about,
uh,
we heard about

1522
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.220
<v 3>the razor grass,
uh,</v>

1523
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:15.643
uh,

1524
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:20.770
Mac Arthur decided he wanted to use paratroopers in the jungles of you Guinea.

1525
01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:25.070
And so they decided to send in a regimen,

1526
01:46:25.071 --> 01:46:27.110
I forget how many are sent in.

1527
01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.030
And they took pictures of reward the warm to the land in the jungles,
you know,

1528
01:46:32.031 --> 01:46:36.810
and they found this place at grassed in area and uh,

1529
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:41.490
no trees in that part and so forth.
Ideal Place Lens.

1530
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:46.580
So the jump in there and that was that and raise our glass 12 feet high.

1531
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:52.660
And they had guys all cut up on it doing all the parachutes and grass was

1532
01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:55.530
terrible.
And,
uh,

1533
01:46:56.610 --> 01:47:01.610
two of them are killed in the Jumpman and a couple of them landed in the jungle,

1534
01:47:02.191 --> 01:47:04.950
you know,
on or hurt bad by then.

1535
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:10.020
And then they told us two guys were never heard of or seen again.

1536
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.080
They never didn't had to march out because it couldn't land a planning playing

1537
01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.180
in the jungles to take them out.

1538
01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:22.440
And it took them six weeks to get back to their base and they had to be,

1539
01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.970
uh,
uh,
you know,
fed along the way.
They,

1540
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:30.120
that parachute stuff into them and so forth.

1541
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:34.230
So that's when the Marine Corps that,
hey,

1542
01:47:34.231 --> 01:47:36.840
we're not using the fire tubes in the jungle.

1543
01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:41.250
So that's when they brought us back to the states and put this in

1544
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:45.080
now,
uh,

1545
01:47:45.330 --> 01:47:50.330
how long was it after you guys landed that John Basilone was killed?

1546
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.770
Well,
as well as I can remember,

1547
01:47:55.771 --> 01:48:00.750
I guess it's a first day because I was,
I had to go back,

1548
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:05.790
get some tea and tea and,
and the guy was with me,
he had to get some napalm,

1549
01:48:05.791 --> 01:48:09.090
you know,
he's a flame thrower.
And,
uh,

1550
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:13.500
and we saw this group of guys over there.
And,
and,

1551
01:48:14.670 --> 01:48:18.130
and a guy give him the last rites to someone.

1552
01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:23.040
What's going on here?
And this guy's head bashed alone.

1553
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:25.590
This was just killed.

1554
01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:27.813
<v 4>And</v>

1555
01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:33.550
<v 3>it was a sad moment for me because he,
like all the other marines,</v>

1556
01:48:33.551 --> 01:48:38.230
he was a,
he wrote to us all,
you know,
and,
uh,

1557
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:40.690
that was bad.

1558
01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.400
And then I heard that hall had been killed.

1559
01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.440
I cried again.
I cried.
And unashamedly,
you know,

1560
01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:53.920
because they,
they,
they meant a lot to me,
you know,

1561
01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:00.010
<v 4>and,
uh,
uh,</v>

1562
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:05.070
<v 3>I just found out we're hall was buried,
you know,</v>

1563
01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:08.130
he didn't evidently didn't have a family.

1564
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:13.320
I mean the wife or anything like that.
And I couldn't find out,

1565
01:49:13.321 --> 01:49:17.340
worry,
worry was,
you know,
where it had been buried or anything.

1566
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:23.960
And this girl that found this thing for me,
she was,
her name was,
uh,

1567
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.740
uh,
Liberty Phillips.

1568
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.880
And I'd been trying for 20 years to find this guy,

1569
01:49:36.661 --> 01:49:40.830
you know,
and what happened to him and everything.
And I told her my problem.

1570
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:43.200
And three days.

1571
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:47.860
She had this magazine on the way she found out food,
computer,

1572
01:49:47.861 --> 01:49:52.861
you know what it was all about and hours amazed at that.

1573
01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.320
And then she found out that hauled it had been buried and uh,

1574
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.870
well at first and he will,

1575
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:11.910
they got so many dead that the hospital ships couldn't take them and so forth.

1576
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:14.170
So they had to do something with a body.

1577
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:19.170
So they begin to bury him there and they stayed there temporarily for several

1578
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:24.670
years and brought them back to the states.
And,

1579
01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:30.370
uh,
he was buried and no one claimed it body.

1580
01:50:30.371 --> 01:50:33.150
And he was buried here in,

1581
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:39.090
I mean in Hawaii at the punchbowl I thing rose and I'm going to go over some day

1582
01:50:40.281 --> 01:50:44.500
to visit his grave because possibility,
you know,

1583
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:48.520
I've found a second cousin to Amy's uh,

1584
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:53.590
he uh,
works with the Symphony Orchestra,

1585
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:58.910
Orchestra and Cincinnati and he didn't,
uh,

1586
01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:04.650
he never met WRAL but he just heard his second cousin and he didn't know

1587
01:51:07.121 --> 01:51:10.150
anything about kin folks or anything to him,

1588
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:17.410
you know,
as we progress through the,
the battle here,
um,

1589
01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:23.010
you wrote about it obviously here in the book and I think,

1590
01:51:23.471 --> 01:51:24.304
uh,

1591
01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:27.900
<v 0>this,
this description here is</v>

1592
01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:33.900
worth reading.
So I'm going to go,
you're out on patrol.

1593
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:37.590
You're trying to get back to friendly lines,
daylights common.

1594
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:40.800
And here we go.

1595
01:51:40.801 --> 01:51:45.801
I brought up the rear when we took off in a low moving dog trot cause lights

1596
01:51:46.171 --> 01:51:48.930
coming.
So you're,
you're trying to make some movement here.
Yeah,

1597
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:54.510
we're not going far.
When from within five yards of my five o'clock position,

1598
01:51:54.570 --> 01:51:58.920
I heard the bolt action on a machine gun declaring the operator had embraced it

1599
01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:03.270
for firing.
I had heard this harbinger of death before.

1600
01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.450
It stood as one of the hard lessons I've learned in the jungles during the

1601
01:52:06.451 --> 01:52:08.250
Solomon Islands campaigns.

1602
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:12.540
I recognized this telling sound of a Nambuu,

1603
01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:14.760
a Japanese light machine gun.

1604
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:19.080
This deadly weapon could spit out a clip of 20 cartridges in less than two

1605
01:52:19.081 --> 01:52:20.370
heartbeats.
Damn,

1606
01:52:20.371 --> 01:52:25.371
I hated that nasty little 25 caliber weapon at that first metallic sound.

1607
01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:27.180
I shouted.
Hit the deck.

1608
01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:32.250
I landed on the ground at the same instant that assured short burst of gunfire

1609
01:52:32.251 --> 01:52:34.200
rip through the air just inches above my head.

1610
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:39.240
I lay so flat on the deck that I could have crawled under a snakes belly for
Joe.

1611
01:52:39.241 --> 01:52:43.950
The guy in front of me,
luck and played out.
He had taken luck,

1612
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:48.290
had played out.
He had taken one or more slugs in the back.

1613
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.400
The other man ran helter skelter,
skelter toward our lines.

1614
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:56.870
His head long dash grabbed the attention of the Nambuu and it continued to spit

1615
01:52:56.871 --> 01:52:59.270
short bursts at this hustling marine.

1616
01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:04.250
While this happened to the adrenaline and sense of reasoning within me worked in

1617
01:53:04.251 --> 01:53:08.720
tandem,
each feeding off each other.
My situation was critical.

1618
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.900
I lay in the Japs backyard.

1619
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:14.300
My position exposed with only my pistol to defend myself.

1620
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:17.480
I took a quick peek at the inner body,

1621
01:53:17.481 --> 01:53:20.360
seven or eight yards ahead of me seeing no movement.

1622
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:22.460
I reckon Joe had bought the farm.

1623
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:27.050
He carried an m one rifle to survive this untenable fix.

1624
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.690
I needed that rifle and a position of concealment.

1625
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:34.370
I knew that the NAM booze clip held 20 cartridges and the gunner fired in short

1626
01:53:34.371 --> 01:53:36.320
bursts of three to four bullets.

1627
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:39.380
I figured he had only a burst or two left.

1628
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.420
He had one when the clip played out,
it ejected.
The sharp,

1629
01:53:44.421 --> 01:53:48.320
tinny sound singled me,
signaled me to move and move.
I did.

1630
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.220
I came out of that prone position like a bolt of lightening man.

1631
01:53:52.221 --> 01:53:55.700
In that span of eight yards,
I could've beaten Jesse Owens.

1632
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:59.650
My plan was simple.
I'd race by,
pick up,

1633
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:04.490
pick up on a dead run and try and make it to the line of Boulder's about 20

1634
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:08.030
yards beyond dam.
About a third,

1635
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:12.230
about on about the third step,
I saw Joe move slightly.

1636
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:17.090
The plan had changed.
I opted to take him instead.
When I got there,

1637
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.880
I grabbed the back of his collar,
utter panic,

1638
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:22.640
Poured Raj adrenaline into my engines.

1639
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:25.070
I could never have dragged him that far fast.

1640
01:54:25.071 --> 01:54:29.270
Otherwise the rocks as a safe haven no longer stood as an option.

1641
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:33.800
We couldn't make it that far out.
Out of gut wrenching terror.

1642
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.750
I reacted on impulse,

1643
01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:39.620
not rooted in thought or reasoning with Joe.
Now,

1644
01:54:39.621 --> 01:54:43.610
until we moved into a slight depression in the volcanic ash.

1645
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:48.560
No more than a shallow dip.
It had to do as duty.

1646
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:53.360
It had to do duty as shelter for the time being,
what?
A poor place to defend,

1647
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:55.820
and it offered very little in way of protection,

1648
01:54:55.910 --> 01:55:00.020
but nothing else showed any more promise by instinct.

1649
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.200
I hit the deck,
my timing proved perfect.

1650
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:07.370
The rattling peel of gunfire passed within inches of our heads.

1651
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.060
Well,
I figured we were safe for the time being.

1652
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.560
Then problems began to escalate faster than I could resolve them.

1653
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:20.270
So this is a bad situation you're in right now,
man.

1654
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:24.360
And then you look down and you see there's a thermite grenade that's,

1655
01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:28.850
that's that he's got on his gear that Joe has on his gear and it looks like it

1656
01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:32.810
has been shot or it's been hit with a glancing bullet.

1657
01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.910
And it looks like that thing could go off at any time as well.
Not only that,

1658
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:41.600
you got the Nambuu being reloaded.
So from there you,

1659
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:43.980
I think you stick Joe

1660
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.650
<v 2>with some,
some,
uh,</v>

1661
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:50.550
some morphine and you kind of hold station.

1662
01:55:50.551 --> 01:55:55.551
How long were you in that little depression in volcanic ash waiting?

1663
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:58.123
<v 3>Well,
they,</v>

1664
01:55:58.390 --> 01:56:02.980
we estimated it was about a six and a half hours that we were in that,

1665
01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.963
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1666
01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:09.130
<v 3>Deprivation and a volcanic ash.</v>

1667
01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:12.640
And it was kind of a slope.

1668
01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.760
And then the depression and the

1669
01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:21.610
bullet hit that above us,
you know,

1670
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:25.480
that was no way she could get,
you know,
and who is safe at that?

1671
01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.250
As long as we stayed down

1672
01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:30.840
<v 2>and on top of all that,
you start receiving friendly fire for mortars,</v>

1673
01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:33.210
mortars start going on.
Oh yeah,
they were,

1674
01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:39.190
<v 3>I was just normal,
you know,
or they were throwing a lot of the martyr shalers in,</v>

1675
01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:40.840
uh,
and,

1676
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.830
and the ships were firing a heavy stuff but not rotted in that there where we

1677
01:56:45.831 --> 01:56:48.860
were.
And,
uh,

1678
01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:51.150
<v 4>okay.</v>

1679
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:54.810
<v 2>What do you think,
what prevented the Japanese from maneuvering on you?</v>

1680
01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:57.960
Will you just holding that position to the best of your ability?

1681
01:56:57.961 --> 01:56:59.250
Throwing grenades and whatnot?

1682
01:56:59.570 --> 01:57:03.440
<v 3>Yeah,
that's the only thing we could do it,
I couldn't move,
so I just had to,</v>

1683
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:05.010
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1684
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:07.100
<v 3>Hope.
But he didn't come.</v>

1685
01:57:07.101 --> 01:57:12.101
And then when they gave out hope or why I was prepared,

1686
01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:13.420
I had a pistol.

1687
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.660
I was gonna make sure that we didn't take,

1688
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.790
we didn't take him prisoner,
you know,

1689
01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:21.973
<v 4>because</v>

1690
01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:29.670
<v 3>at Velo Lavella we were on a patrol and a platoon of us.</v>

1691
01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.530
And,
uh,
we met some jabs and,
uh,

1692
01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:43.650
one guy was hurt and we didn't know he was hurt and we failed back a little bit.

1693
01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:49.800
And then we realized that this guy,

1694
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.610
his name was Joe shot,
my fucking thank for his last name now,

1695
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:59.340
and the Jap should captured him.
And we dug in for the night.

1696
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.100
And,
uh,

1697
01:58:03.650 --> 01:58:04.483
<v 4>uh,</v>

1698
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:11.440
<v 3>they begin to target your ham
and,
uh,
and he would,</v>

1699
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:16.270
you know,
screaming and everything and our officers that don't move,

1700
01:58:16.271 --> 01:58:20.680
don't move.
We can't help him.
I'm just trying to get you in position,

1701
01:58:20.681 --> 01:58:22.810
don't move,
don't move and everything.

1702
01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:27.900
We sit there and listen to him and into the night and then the morning when it

1703
01:58:28.691 --> 01:58:30.100
got lunch,
you know,

1704
01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.280
we went and after him and he was tied to the base of a tree with his penis cut

1705
01:58:38.291 --> 01:58:43.291
off and then was in his mouth and it taking scripture of the scan and pulled it

1706
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:49.960
off that long and just really tortured,
deem something terrible.

1707
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.370
And uh,
we were not,

1708
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:56.350
we found out that they were

1709
01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:02.800
Royal Manchurian marines,

1710
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:04.300
you know,

1711
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:09.300
Japanese had in Manchuria had a colony up there and they were bigger than a

1712
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:16.000
regular Japanese.
They might've been Chinese and uh,

1713
01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:20.060
but,
uh,
they were big guys and uh,

1714
01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:24.300
and we got,
got back at him,

1715
01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:28.180
everyone about 10 of them,
I guess in that group.

1716
01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:31.000
And we finally caught up with them.

1717
01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.390
But that poor guy suffered.

1718
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:37.870
And it was hard not to jump up and go,

1719
01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:41.270
but that's what they want us to do,
you know,
to come out of the household.

1720
01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:44.740
Because once we got there in a foxhole at night,

1721
01:59:44.741 --> 01:59:47.260
we were not forced to move for any reason.

1722
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:54.060
If you had to use the toilet where you use dug a hole in your hole and uh,

1723
01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.190
an old holes and the John with water would seep in,

1724
02:00:00.191 --> 02:00:01.960
I'm overnight and you're constantly

1725
02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:07.390
a Tin Cup to take water out,

1726
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.740
throw it out button.
And the Joan builders,
it was terrible.

1727
02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:16.930
Really terrible in all the conditions were bad.

1728
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:20.860
Uh,
the mosquitoes were bad,

1729
02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:25.940
just jungle robot and I hated that and he didn't get that at the gym or you

1730
02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:29.530
know,

1731
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:34.170
I don't remember seeing a mosquito or having a mosquito bite then,

1732
02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:38.590
uh,
uh,
w Jima.

1733
02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:41.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1734
02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:45.100
<v 0>And with that and your mind,
there's no way that you were going to get captured,</v>

1735
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.330
you or

1736
02:00:47.610 --> 02:00:51.170
<v 3>governor be captured?
I Wa I was ready to.</v>

1737
02:00:53.670 --> 02:00:53.990
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1738
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.201
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1739
02:00:54.201 --> 02:00:59.201
take Joe out myself because I didn't want him to suffer like that either.

1740
02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:04.870
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1741
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:08.160
<v 3>Or started.
I didn't tell him I was going to shoot him,
but uh,</v>

1742
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:09.820
I was ready to do it.

1743
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:15.570
<v 0>You spend the whole day there and I'm going back to the book.</v>

1744
02:01:15.571 --> 02:01:20.130
As the long lonely hours ticked away,
thoughts root ran the gauntlet of my mind.

1745
02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.950
Early in the weight I resolved to go down fighting.

1746
02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:26.700
I considered surrender out of the question and never an option.

1747
02:01:27.110 --> 02:01:30.510
I had heard and seen the results of the enemy's treatment of prisoners.

1748
02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:35.040
No words can describe the pain and suffering the jabs laid on a person before

1749
02:01:35.070 --> 02:01:36.330
permitting him to die.

1750
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:41.780
While the political correctness these days might frown on calling them Jabs,

1751
02:01:41.781 --> 02:01:45.500
I'll call them anything.
I please my buddies and I have that right.

1752
02:01:46.050 --> 02:01:50.180
We have earned it.
Yes.
When a show down came,

1753
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:55.580
I intended to see that the enemy didn't take me or the marine lying next to me

1754
02:01:55.581 --> 02:01:58.790
alive as my longest day.

1755
02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:02.360
Near the halfway point through the dean of battle,

1756
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:08.750
I heard my name called damn the voice of Bull Fisher.

1757
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.520
My platoon sergeant boomed over the other noise he had brought in a combat

1758
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:17.880
patrol to find us.
Now you,

1759
02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:22.940
you kind of link up and he's trying to figure out where the Nam Bo is Nambuu is

1760
02:02:23.411 --> 02:02:27.280
located.
We see you now throw I did in the Nambuu answered,

1761
02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:28.510
giving away its position.

1762
02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.960
A platoon laid down a withering barrage of small arms fire,

1763
02:02:31.961 --> 02:02:34.540
putting the Nam boot company out of business.
Peter.

1764
02:02:34.541 --> 02:02:37.330
Adam got to be first along with several other guys.

1765
02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:41.050
He directed them to put Joe on the stretcher and sent them on their way.

1766
02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:44.320
He said he,
he said,
let's get you out of here.
I'll cover you.

1767
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:48.160
I got set to make a run for it,
but as an afterthought,

1768
02:02:48.161 --> 02:02:50.500
I told Pete that I wanted to pick up Joe's rifle.

1769
02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:55.000
I took one last look at the shallow deaf laid in the sands of Ego Jima.

1770
02:02:55.630 --> 02:03:00.190
What a life saver,
the dearest plot of ground that I ever occupied.

1771
02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:04.810
Joe and I owed our lives to it in a state of rage.

1772
02:03:04.811 --> 02:03:09.190
Pete said we would have found you sooner,
but ski came back a blithering idiot.

1773
02:03:10.150 --> 02:03:13.720
You refuse to go back to show us the way to you guys.
He reported you dead.

1774
02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.570
Some of the guys wanted to shoot him.

1775
02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:20.470
The bowl sent him under guard to be taken off the island.

1776
02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:25.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1777
02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.680
<v 0>And now I'm going to a</v>

1778
02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:30.660
read a an award citation.

1779
02:03:30.661 --> 02:03:33.510
The president of United States takes pleasure in presenting the silver star

1780
02:03:33.511 --> 02:03:38.511
medal to private first class deal f Harvey Jr United States Marine Corps for

1781
02:03:39.691 --> 02:03:44.691
services set forth in this following citation for conspicuous gallantry and

1782
02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:49.800
[inaudible] while serving with company c First Battalion 26 marines,

1783
02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:54.801
Fifth Marine Division in action against enemy Japanese forces on Eog mud volcano

1784
02:03:55.591 --> 02:03:58.350
islands 20 February,

1785
02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:00.600
1945 when he's three man patrol,

1786
02:04:00.690 --> 02:04:03.870
which was sent out to establish contact with the adjoining company,

1787
02:04:03.871 --> 02:04:08.470
was ambushed by heavy fire from an enemy machine gun and one of the men were

1788
02:04:08.471 --> 02:04:09.420
seriously wounded.

1789
02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.190
Private FirstClass Harvey drag the fallen marine under heavy fire to the shelter

1790
02:04:14.191 --> 02:04:17.700
of a nearby whole remaining with the wounded man.

1791
02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.680
While his companion went for aid,

1792
02:04:19.770 --> 02:04:24.390
he held off the hostile forces with his rifle in hand grenades until the arrival

1793
02:04:24.391 --> 02:04:29.391
of the rescue party then exposing himself to enemy fire and directing accurate

1794
02:04:29.761 --> 02:04:31.620
heavy fire on the Japanese position.

1795
02:04:31.770 --> 02:04:36.770
He successfully covered the evacuation of the casualty by his initiative,

1796
02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:40.170
courage and unselfish devotion to duty.

1797
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.320
He undoubtedly saved the life of his comrade and upheld the highest traditions

1798
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:50.790
of United States naval service for the president,
John Sullivan.

1799
02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:52.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1800
02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.440
<v 0>Secretary of the navy.</v>

1801
02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:54.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1802
02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.250
<v 0>Don't really know what to say after reading that,
sir.</v>

1803
02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:03.243
<v 3>Oh,</v>

1804
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:09.550
well that was a long day for me,
but uh,

1805
02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.250
I didn't think,
oh

1806
02:05:12.370 --> 02:05:16.620
<v 0>they the reward.
I was just doing what the Marines are taught to do.</v>

1807
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:18.930
<v 3>No,
and uh,</v>

1808
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:24.300
I was surprised when they pinned a oh man.

1809
02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:26.691
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1810
02:05:26.691 --> 02:05:31.691
You talked a little bit earlier about what it was like at night and I thought

1811
02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:33.450
this was a really good section

1812
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:34.760
<v 3>of the book.</v>

1813
02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.520
<v 0>Here's the way we handled the nights on the front line.
Once darkness set in,</v>

1814
02:05:40.610 --> 02:05:44.780
everyone went to his foxhole,
orders,
said no one left the hole for any reason.

1815
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:46.101
As I pointed out,

1816
02:05:46.101 --> 02:05:50.000
we seated the night to the enemy from caves and tunnels within our lines in

1817
02:05:50.001 --> 02:05:52.910
units,
these adversaries info infiltrated our positions.

1818
02:05:53.210 --> 02:05:56.450
They sought to come into our holes and kill with knives.
Bayonets,

1819
02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.590
bayonets are guns.

1820
02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:01.160
Some simply moved in close enough to toss in a hand grenade if they found the

1821
02:06:01.161 --> 02:06:02.660
occupants on the alert for them.

1822
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:07.250
So we declared open season on anyone moving around above ground

1823
02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:10.590
to combat this type of warfare.

1824
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:15.180
Each foxhole comprised more or less a mini fortress within itself.

1825
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:18.780
The man on watch with weapon ready sat near the top of the hole.

1826
02:06:18.781 --> 02:06:21.390
So we had a panoramic view of his surroundings.

1827
02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:25.980
This proved vital as the deadly nocturnal infiltrators came in from all

1828
02:06:25.981 --> 02:06:29.520
directions while on watch,
you had to stay mentally alert,

1829
02:06:29.521 --> 02:06:33.480
clear headed and responsive to any movement near your position.
Uh,

1830
02:06:33.481 --> 02:06:37.440
moving shadow in the night presented a target to challenge with gunfire.

1831
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:42.540
I had the first two hour watch when tired,
sleepy,
hungry,
scared,

1832
02:06:42.541 --> 02:06:46.380
lonesome and hones sit homesick.
A two hour watch seems like an eternity.

1833
02:06:47.190 --> 02:06:51.720
The constant booming of incoming and outgoing cannon blast filled the night air

1834
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:56.990
intermingled with the ear splitting blast came the prevailing rattle of machine

1835
02:06:57.031 --> 02:07:01.380
gun and rifle fire interwoven with the Blair and the clamor of these machines of

1836
02:07:01.381 --> 02:07:01.950
war.

1837
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:06.390
You heard desperate or human utterances filled with all the emotions that life

1838
02:07:06.391 --> 02:07:10.980
allows when you're watching ends.
The night calls on you to sleep.

1839
02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:15.810
Sheer debilitating exhaustion will put you to sleep usually a restless,

1840
02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:17.430
troubled slumber.

1841
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.460
I'm going to continue on in the deep of the night after my second round of

1842
02:07:26.461 --> 02:07:27.390
sentinel duty,

1843
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:31.590
a Staccato of pistol fire at point blank range startled me awake.

1844
02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:34.200
I leaped to my feet at full alert.

1845
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:39.220
I could see Masseria crouched up beyond the dividing Ridge in a horse whisperer.

1846
02:07:39.221 --> 02:07:43.300
I asked what's up?
He answered,
we have a visitor.
Did you get him?

1847
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.920
I don't think so.
Where on your side then?
I heard it.

1848
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.660
The dreaded sound of metal striking the wooden stock of a rifle.

1849
02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:58.180
A Japanese grenade activates by whacking it's firing pin against a solid object.

1850
02:07:58.810 --> 02:08:03.160
This whack ignites a fuse that Burns for seven seconds before detonation.

1851
02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:08.650
Beyond the rim of my whole hidden in the darkness and enemy soldier had the drop

1852
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:12.760
on me.
I had no options or defense for the inevitable.

1853
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:18.370
Then I saw it coming in a looping arc toward me,
a harbinger of death.

1854
02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:23.830
The burning fuse gave off a radiant sparkling light like a kid sparkler on the

1855
02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:24.700
4th of July.

1856
02:08:26.210 --> 02:08:30.500
I had to get it out of a hole before it exploded with a sense of urgency

1857
02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.160
enhanced by stark terror.
I copped both hands together.

1858
02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.280
I caught it in mid air and shoveled it over the rim of the hole out of harm's

1859
02:08:39.441 --> 02:08:42.580
way.
Sadly,
the rapid,

1860
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.450
rapidly burning fuse did not give me time to scoop the missile back in the

1861
02:08:46.451 --> 02:08:50.800
direction from whence it came.
Masiya had my pistol else.

1862
02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:54.400
I could have scrambled to the top of the hole and possibly got some shots off at

1863
02:08:54.401 --> 02:08:57.640
the adversary,
but I could only crouch and weight.

1864
02:08:58.580 --> 02:08:59.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1865
02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:02.970
<v 0>The interval didn't last long as out of the darkness came a notifying sound</v>

1866
02:09:02.971 --> 02:09:06.810
telling us they had armed another grenade and send it on its way.

1867
02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:10.650
However,
this granite dear showed some smarts.

1868
02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:14.580
He held the grenade for about two seconds before tossing it.

1869
02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:19.590
This delay gave me only five seconds to do my thing out of anxiety.

1870
02:09:19.591 --> 02:09:22.290
I reacted too quickly and bobbled it.

1871
02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:24.690
As I hit the deck,

1872
02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.160
I kicked it at the same time throwing up my arms instinctively to protect my

1873
02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:33.030
chest and head the kick and the explosion occurred simultaneously.

1874
02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:37.950
My feet and legs took most of the shrapnel and volcanic ash hatched by the
blast.

1875
02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:43.560
I fell to my butt to a sitting position on the slanting side of the hole.

1876
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:46.620
I felt very little pain in my lower limbs,

1877
02:09:46.621 --> 02:09:49.260
but my head throbbed with the mother of all headaches.

1878
02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:53.910
I had a deafening ringing in my ears accompanied by excruciating pain.

1879
02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.250
I couldn't feel her move my legs.

1880
02:09:56.430 --> 02:10:00.120
I sat there stunned deaf and trying to recollect my notions.

1881
02:10:01.230 --> 02:10:05.190
Another grenade landed within inches beside me.

1882
02:10:06.330 --> 02:10:08.070
Without thought or reason,

1883
02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:11.310
I hoisted my hips to come down on the glittering missile.

1884
02:10:12.450 --> 02:10:16.950
This witless act placed the right cheek of my buttocks on the device.

1885
02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:20.550
My weight pushed the grenade into loose volcanic ash,

1886
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:24.720
which are absorbed a great deal of the energy generated by the blast.

1887
02:10:25.730 --> 02:10:26.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1888
02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:28.410
<v 0>Now this one really laid some heard on me.</v>

1889
02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:32.400
I knew that I had to get some help quick like,

1890
02:10:32.401 --> 02:10:35.870
or I might leave that paid alive help.

1891
02:10:35.871 --> 02:10:38.600
I realized sat about 25 yards away.

1892
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:41.030
I couldn't stand or even feel my legs.

1893
02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:44.540
So walking or even crawling exceeded my ex,
my options,

1894
02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:50.270
dragging myself with my elbows and hands appeared my only option getting to the

1895
02:10:50.271 --> 02:10:53.720
top and out of a hole took just about all my strength,

1896
02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:59.090
kind of like swimming upstream in the waters of a flood of a river at flood

1897
02:10:59.091 --> 02:11:01.640
stage,
at the top of the hole,
I lost it.

1898
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:06.620
I either fainted or out of futility,
a seated to death.

1899
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.720
I know not which lying there and that state of oblivion.

1900
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:17.750
And if the euro entity began to take form in my mind's vision,

1901
02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:20.450
out of this ghostly apparition,

1902
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.210
I came face to face with the voice of my mother.
She commanded sunny.

1903
02:11:26.630 --> 02:11:30.980
You wake up and get to those who can help you.
Don't you dare give up.

1904
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:36.050
We all love you and need and you need to return to us.

1905
02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1906
02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:43.600
<v 0>And then my former football coach,
Joe Coleman appeared</v>

1907
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:50.150
and he said,
Harvey,
you sorry,
Little Shit.
Get off.

1908
02:11:50.151 --> 02:11:54.560
You're dead ass and move out.
There's hell to pay and you got to pay it.

1909
02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:58.880
I ain't,
I ain't and none of your quitting.
Now Hustle,
Alice.

1910
02:11:58.881 --> 02:12:03.260
I'm kicking your skinny.
But
when the old coach spoke,

1911
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:08.090
it came out as demanding commands.
You listened and you reacted.

1912
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:09.411
You know,

1913
02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:13.970
I reached deep inside myself and find the strength and power to drag my failing

1914
02:12:13.971 --> 02:12:17.240
body the last few yards to help and safety.

1915
02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:18.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1916
02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:22.870
<v 0>Thanks coach Joe
at the brink of the whole,</v>

1917
02:12:22.871 --> 02:12:27.850
I came to a halt to alert those inside of my presence before exposing myself to

1918
02:12:27.851 --> 02:12:32.140
possible friendly fire.
I called out Sam.
This is Harvey and I'm hurt bad.

1919
02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.010
I'm coming in now.
Don't shoot.

1920
02:12:43.230 --> 02:12:44.063
So

1921
02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:51.260
three grenades thrown at you in your whole fear saved me.

1922
02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:58.140
You were able to throw the first one back.

1923
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:01.940
<v 3>Well,
just kind of shoved it back out.</v>

1924
02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.690
That actually catch it out of this shell.
Read it out.

1925
02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.100
Just struck my hand and I got it out of the whole completely,

1926
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:14.080
but not where our shooter a warranted it.

1927
02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.530
Go back toward the guy that the donut,

1928
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:19.730
but that didn't happen.

1929
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:23.280
<v 0>And then the second one,
you Bob,
a little,
a little bit.</v>

1930
02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:24.990
Lands at your feet.

1931
02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:30.970
<v 3>Yes,
it landed at my feet.
I kicked it,
kicked,</v>

1932
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:33.540
took me out of the game.

1933
02:13:37.730 --> 02:13:38.690
How many days?

1934
02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.720
This was six or seven days into the battle of this happened the ninth,

1935
02:13:44.341 --> 02:13:48.470
the night.
Okay.
Everyone's the same.
That my buddy the dark,

1936
02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.390
whereas we're going to do and so forth.

1937
02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:56.310
And you were going to tell that story about how he got wounded?
Yeah.

1938
02:13:56.930 --> 02:14:01.550
Which is,
I mean it's in the book.
It's,
it's crazy.
Yeah.

1939
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:08.840
You want to tell us how he would,
how he explained that situation to you?

1940
02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:11.450
Yeah.
I'll tell you.
Hey,

1941
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:16.910
he was a good marine.
I mean,
when the chips were down,

1942
02:14:16.911 --> 02:14:21.200
he played the game.
He was put out front.
Uh,

1943
02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:24.290
uh,
he was a scout sniper.

1944
02:14:24.490 --> 02:14:29.320
That was his designation.
And they had in the whole [inaudible],

1945
02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:34.100
uh,
a young guy that never been in action for Dan.
It cruel.

1946
02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:37.100
And then it was a,

1947
02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:39.420
<v 1>okay,</v>

1948
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:44.310
<v 3>uh,
B a r man,
brr to Browning automatic rifle.</v>

1949
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.000
So they're in the whole carvers and there's Poncho getting arrest.

1950
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:53.730
And then they were supposed to be on watch.

1951
02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.130
Well,
uh,

1952
02:15:00.630 --> 02:15:05.630
carburetors were sound asleep and they were awakened by a gash.

1953
02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:12.380
Cry Out in know and he rolls the Poncho Edge,

1954
02:15:12.381 --> 02:15:13.680
real slow light look.

1955
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:19.550
And you saw that the jab straddled a den it crew and it cut his throat

1956
02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.290
or copperhead is k bar nine

1957
02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:29.040
brought Darba beside him stuck in the thing.

1958
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:34.041
So it took the math and was able to get the job and in the end the back and took

1959
02:15:36.601 --> 02:15:40.290
him out of the picture.
But there were two other jobs in the home.

1960
02:15:40.291 --> 02:15:45.291
They didn't know that carver was under that Poncho and he didn't know that there

1961
02:15:45.631 --> 02:15:47.220
was in the,
oh sorry.

1962
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:49.250
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1963
02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:54.240
<v 3>you got to his knees,
it turned and there was a jail begin to ban it.</v>

1964
02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:57.220
Name show where they got him in the chest.

1965
02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:59.590
Got One long,

1966
02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:03.730
they've got them in shifts three times and he had his arms up,

1967
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.510
fruit protect himself.
And One jab stuck is,

1968
02:16:08.590 --> 02:16:13.330
is a band through his forearm here.
Came out here,

1969
02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.940
went through the muscle here.
Out here.

1970
02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:18.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1971
02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:19.700
<v 3>And the other jobs,</v>

1972
02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:24.480
but the same hurt on this on his left side.

1973
02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.360
So here he is.
Lexan is mushroom lake.
Kate dry get,
uh,

1974
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:31.270
<v 5>they're abandoned.
It's out.</v>

1975
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:34.090
Of course when they flex the muscle that tied them up.

1976
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:36.070
And so he's struggling there.

1977
02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:40.660
Well a guy back up on side of the hill,

1978
02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:45.880
he saw this action figure that copper and then the girl that had it.

1979
02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:50.830
So he told us a hand grenade down there and it didn't go in the hole,

1980
02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:56.140
but it must have done some damage to the uh,
uh,

1981
02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.000
uh,
guys that,
uh,
uh,

1982
02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:03.610
the ban in Japanese,
you know.

1983
02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:06.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1984
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:10.670
<v 5>Well the Japanese are scared off.
So they left</v>

1985
02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:17.420
scrambled out of the hole and carver was able to get his arms divorced from the

1986
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:23.730
ban it and it was,
took Danny accruals,

1987
02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:29.010
B a r n shot overs to jobs as he ran down the hill

1988
02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:34.950
and he was awarded a Silver Star for that.
He deserved it.

1989
02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:37.560
Well,
is there told you before,

1990
02:17:37.561 --> 02:17:40.840
carver loved his beer when he hit dial in,

1991
02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:45.860
he had 14 cans of beer alone that that ninth not left.

1992
02:17:47.550 --> 02:17:48.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1993
02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:52.180
<v 5>On the ninth night when both of us were hurt,</v>

1994
02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:55.720
he had only eight cans of beer left.

1995
02:17:57.550 --> 02:18:00.820
Well,
they finally get to Carber and get him on a stretcher.

1996
02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:04.930
And there's Karen and back now this is dark or the night

1997
02:18:06.670 --> 02:18:11.250
and they gave him on a stretcher and takes him to the rear for help and

1998
02:18:11.251 --> 02:18:12.084
everything.

1999
02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:17.190
And he's having trouble cause bloat is farming in his mouth,

2000
02:18:17.210 --> 02:18:21.120
his nose and so forth,
but is able to tell the guys,

2001
02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:28.720
I forget to sergeant,
where's Karen named Rod?
Uh,
but he said,

2002
02:18:29.290 --> 02:18:33.160
when you guys get back,
there's beer in my

2003
02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.710
backpack.
Plop a dropping.

2004
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:46.010
They run back there.
You got the beer and drank it.

2005
02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:50.420
And while they're still in the hole,
come back.
I can't find dark.

2006
02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:52.641
It's dark.

2007
02:18:52.641 --> 02:18:57.641
And he's calling out to him and he can't be heard because he had so much blood

2008
02:18:58.461 --> 02:19:00.870
in his mouth and everything.
Right.

2009
02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:05.890
So he laid there until dawn until it got loud enough to find it.

2010
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.421
Well,

2011
02:19:08.421 --> 02:19:13.421
he loves to tell his story when he gets around a bunch of guys at the Uso and

2012
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:18.350
the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars,

2013
02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:21.320
and I'll take them over those from the hospital.

2014
02:19:21.321 --> 02:19:25.340
I'll take him over and he tells that story.
So this is my buddy.

2015
02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:26.990
He needed to got me killed.

2016
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:33.950
They're not telling the true story,
you know,
he nearly got himself killed.

2017
02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:40.100
He was a character.
And although that guy,

2018
02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.530
he was really a guy.

2019
02:19:44.350 --> 02:19:49.350
And I guess the lesson to be learned there is marines love their beer.

2020
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:52.310
Oh yeah.
I love their beer.

2021
02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:58.640
Now you get,
and you already seen the flag be rate been raised?

2022
02:19:59.370 --> 02:20:04.050
<v 3>Well,
uh,
I think I were raised about the third day there.</v>

2023
02:20:04.051 --> 02:20:06.150
I guess it was somewhere like that,

2024
02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:11.610
but I was on the far side of the island on the other beach.
I think I'd,

2025
02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:16.530
uh,
alluded to that earlier tonight.
Well,
anyway,

2026
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:19.063
<v 6>uh,</v>

2027
02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:23.410
<v 3>let's see how that was happening.
Oh,</v>

2028
02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:28.240
I was working,
it was a big cliff there.

2029
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:31.970
And uh,
and there was a,

2030
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:36.850
a field box on the side of that other beats.
You know,

2031
02:20:36.851 --> 02:20:38.890
we ran to the beach over there,

2032
02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:44.230
whether there's a pillbox boxer and it was,
they had a,

2033
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:46.640
<v 6>uh,
uh,</v>

2034
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:51.810
<v 3>[inaudible] I guess was firing that those ships are sitting out there.</v>

2035
02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:55.230
There are small boats and everything.
Well,

2036
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:57.630
we're sitting up there and uh,

2037
02:20:58.470 --> 02:21:03.470
and this pill boxes on the side of this slope and healed down to the s down to

2038
02:21:04.351 --> 02:21:06.900
the beach,
you know,
and uh,

2039
02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:12.440
so they loaded me on a rope to put a shape charge on the top of that.

2040
02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:17.490
A pillbox,
you know,
is concrete.

2041
02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:22.940
So the Dourdan me down or not put a shape charge on that and that didn't phase

2042
02:21:22.951 --> 02:21:24.320
that the stuff.

2043
02:21:24.810 --> 02:21:29.810
So the pulled pulled me back up and then a guy was with us radio that uh,

2044
02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:34.693
<v 6>uh,</v>

2045
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:40.320
<v 3>oh that little ship out there,
let's see as a,
uh,</v>

2046
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:43.200
landing craft emptor Lci.

2047
02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:48.120
And they had a twin barrel,

2048
02:21:48.690 --> 02:21:52.740
a 40 millimeter Mo,
uh,
deal up there.

2049
02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:57.120
And they began to firing the right time and they just pumping thing.

2050
02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:01.500
They were bringing in these clips with,

2051
02:22:01.501 --> 02:22:05.760
for those sales on it,
putting them up by,
and this guy would firing.

2052
02:22:05.761 --> 02:22:09.020
And another guy had pulled him off our need to get through it and they laugh.

2053
02:22:09.210 --> 02:22:14.210
And then we've been up and they finally just drilled a hole in that thing that a

2054
02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:16.620
pillbox just exploded.

2055
02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:19.810
We use a power chair and every cheer and one of the things is,

2056
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:25.620
and later on that day,
uh,

2057
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.480
we'd come up to a cliff,

2058
02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.720
a healed thing and a really big door over a cave,

2059
02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:39.690
uh,
on the side of that cliff.

2060
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:44.580
And it was heavy with wood and metal,
so forth.

2061
02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:47.580
So I had to use,

2062
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:51.570
I was going to use a TNT blasted in,

2063
02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:56.660
so I put the t and t,
uh,
but,
uh,

2064
02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:01.880
the whole pack on the polls and I was carrying it and I was going to come up the

2065
02:23:04.201 --> 02:23:08.190
side there and the guys were protecting me,
you know,

2066
02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:12.720
around in the end he Jepser came out to meet me or anything.

2067
02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:15.170
So I'm slipping up or,

2068
02:23:15.171 --> 02:23:18.180
and I have my pistol that my mom had sent me.

2069
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:23.370
I had that Mariah at hand and I had this,
uh,
uh,

2070
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:24.390
uh,

2071
02:23:24.390 --> 02:23:29.390
charge of t and t own on a pole and I was slipping up on that thing from that,

2072
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:32.730
from the side.

2073
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:37.470
And I was going to put that down there and put a short fuse on it and blow it

2074
02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:40.320
out.
Well as I was walking up,
or

2075
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:47.570
a jump come runner from around a rock rock darling at abandoned come charging

2076
02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:53.040
that and that took a pistol and shot him about three times in the belly.

2077
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:58.100
And that's the only time I'd ever knew that I'd killed.

2078
02:23:58.101 --> 02:24:00.260
That was my kill right there.
Nobody fired.

2079
02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.050
Cause other times when we'd see a job,

2080
02:24:04.051 --> 02:24:07.830
there may be four or five of us firing at the same time,
you know,

2081
02:24:07.831 --> 02:24:10.350
so he couldn't click.
But that was my key.

2082
02:24:11.250 --> 02:24:14.610
They all cheered me back over here.
And,
uh,

2083
02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:19.900
so I sent off that t and t and it didn't phase that a door at all.

2084
02:24:23.010 --> 02:24:27.330
And so,
uh,
as I,
as coming back and we were looking at,
uh,

2085
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:32.130
that guy's rifles and he was now the bullets,

2086
02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:34.260
the one that doesn't songs,
you know,

2087
02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:38.910
and so about that time heard a cheer,

2088
02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:43.360
men a charity,
there's like somebody who made a touchdown,
you know,
and,

2089
02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:47.370
and a step back and look,
a burner.
That flag just been raised.

2090
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:52.230
And I was about
all about 50 yards,

2091
02:24:52.231 --> 02:24:55.500
I guess from a base of that,
uh,

2092
02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.090
volcanic volcano of that.
Sarah bace.

2093
02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:05.430
And a,
and I thought,
man,
the war's over.
I'd say we have one,

2094
02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:10.230
but it went on for for another 30,
30 days,

2095
02:25:10.231 --> 02:25:14.460
you know.
But,
uh,
our Hayes,

2096
02:25:15.050 --> 02:25:15.883
uh,

2097
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:20.900
was one of the guys lifted that thing and I knew him and uh,

2098
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:24.110
of course,
Yep.
One

2099
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:28.100
<v 5>time I thought I was the only guy on the island that didn't help raise that flag</v>

2100
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:32.090
because everybody was sitting.
I was one of those guys that raises the flag.

2101
02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.490
Eh.
And that was one of the last things you saw as you,

2102
02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.320
before you got evacuated out.
I know you,

2103
02:25:40.321 --> 02:25:44.480
you talk about in the book you had him turn your a stretcher so you could see

2104
02:25:44.481 --> 02:25:48.480
the flag before you left medically evacuated.
Yeah.

2105
02:25:49.810 --> 02:25:54.660
<v 3>Well,
I always hurt lead arts and I were both hearts the same night,</v>

2106
02:25:55.330 --> 02:25:59.400
uh,
the night night,
but there were some,

2107
02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:03.830
uh,
uh,
discussion about,
uh,

2108
02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:08.040
we were hurt the third night or something.
Was it third now?

2109
02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:13.910
That's just poor reporting.
Yeah.
Well anyway,
uh,

2110
02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:18.960
he was hurt.
Same that I was and,
and uh,

2111
02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:22.363
<v 6>uh,</v>

2112
02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:26.680
<v 3>I was taking the out to,
uh,
put on,
well,</v>

2113
02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:31.690
I wound up in a long ditch that did just use the bulldozer and uh,

2114
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:35.180
in the volcano cast,

2115
02:26:35.210 --> 02:26:40.210
just dug a hole there and it was about a hundred yards alone and it was just

2116
02:26:41.361 --> 02:26:45.890
lined with guys on the stretcher and you guys are working on.

2117
02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:50.690
And uh,
I woke up and

2118
02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:54.860
I had been doped up,
you know,

2119
02:26:54.861 --> 02:26:59.861
and I walked up and I knew somebody who was working over me and,

2120
02:26:59.931 --> 02:27:04.310
uh,
it got to my boots and I wanted my boots.

2121
02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:09.080
I was proud of those boots,
paratrooper boots,
you know,
and he said,

2122
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:13.670
aw,
one of them is no good.
And then I said,
I want to make him be fixed.

2123
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:17.810
And I was nearly in tears,
you know,

2124
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:23.170
because I was hurt and that is under the influence of morphine and stuff like

2125
02:27:26.391 --> 02:27:30.170
that.
So I said,
I know I want my boots,
I won't my boots.

2126
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:35.040
And so he took them off and I was laying on my stomach hug.

2127
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:36.500
Those boots are right here.

2128
02:27:36.890 --> 02:27:41.890
Pull them up to me because I wasn't going to lose my boots are so proud of.

2129
02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.830
And then,
uh,

2130
02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.570
I went out and the next thing I know I'm being put on the,
uh,

2131
02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.393
a board.

2132
02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:58.480
I was in the eldest,
uh,

2133
02:27:58.870 --> 02:28:03.750
a below an lst and they were going to take me off that board with,

2134
02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:04.430
uh,

2135
02:28:04.430 --> 02:28:09.240
for the guys with a platform on cables and you're going to pull it.

2136
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:12.670
They started pulling up and one of those

2137
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:18.520
stretchers fell off.
It was metal,

2138
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:23.380
uh,
uh,
farmed and uh,

2139
02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:28.720
chicken wire on the bottom of it because it was a metal stretcher and that went

2140
02:28:28.821 --> 02:28:33.821
to the bank and it was about 12 sailors on that,

2141
02:28:34.290 --> 02:28:38.410
on the Higgins boat and on the lst men.

2142
02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:41.090
They dove in there trying to get to that guy,

2143
02:28:41.091 --> 02:28:46.091
but he just went down so fast and it was when he wasn't able to save him.

2144
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:52.280
And so they pulled me around to the front of the rest of us around.

2145
02:28:52.281 --> 02:28:56.540
There's about
four or five of us still on,
on those,

2146
02:28:56.541 --> 02:28:59.160
sort of pulled us around and they open,

2147
02:28:59.161 --> 02:29:02.570
those doors are on the lst and that the ramp down,

2148
02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:05.210
that bolt just went up.

2149
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:09.950
The Higgins boat just went up on the tech itself.

2150
02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:12.170
It took us up on the top deck,

2151
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:16.340
pulling alongside the USS Ozark.

2152
02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:20.960
Now that's a mountain.
So the uh,

2153
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:26.810
uh,
supply ships,
uh,
and troop trench,
uh,
ports.

2154
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:32.270
We're named after mountains.
So the ls,

2155
02:29:32.370 --> 02:29:35.190
uh,
the USS,
uh,

2156
02:29:35.390 --> 02:29:40.010
Ozark us where I was taken up there and I was on the deck.

2157
02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:42.470
It was raining and uh,

2158
02:29:43.970 --> 02:29:48.970
and a doctor was going through and picking them out and he got to me and said,

2159
02:29:49.350 --> 02:29:54.200
he said,
take this guy and first take him right on the end.
And I said,

2160
02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:58.250
I wanted to see the flag.
He said,
well,
he's upfront router.

2161
02:29:58.970 --> 02:30:03.970
And just like a miracle at ship slid around on anchor because the season was

2162
02:30:05.121 --> 02:30:08.750
really rough that day and it rain and everything,

2163
02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:14.350
but all of a sudden there's a shafts of light and come and light coming through

2164
02:30:15.501 --> 02:30:19.950
the clouds.
And you could see that flag up.

2165
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:26.120
And I cried and then they took me down there and I still had my boots.

2166
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:32.870
And the doctor,
Dr. Anderson,
uh,
he said,

2167
02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:35.360
take him on in Iraq quick.
But uh,

2168
02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:41.200
and so went in and they put me up on a table and I still hadn't my boots and a

2169
02:30:41.390 --> 02:30:45.980
corpsman tried to take my boots and I wouldn't get dull.
You don't take my boots,

2170
02:30:45.981 --> 02:30:50.420
you're not,
don't take my boot.
And Dr. Anderson said,

2171
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:55.370
let him keep his boots.
Well,
the next thing I know,

2172
02:30:55.371 --> 02:30:59.420
I'm in a,
in a room about this big,

2173
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:05.360
and it's in the room where the ship's crew,
Leo,

2174
02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:08.630
that's had their bunks in there.
So I'm on a bunk.

2175
02:31:08.631 --> 02:31:13.631
It's about four or five feet high a here and then another bunk below.

2176
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:17.330
But up there above,

2177
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:21.930
I could reach those pipes going through there.
Uh,

2178
02:31:22.490 --> 02:31:24.090
two of the book held up here.

2179
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:28.770
So a reach up there and now I'm under an influence of something that should

2180
02:31:28.771 --> 02:31:33.180
never have been given to me.
It wound up,
it was,

2181
02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:38.460
I was allergic to it,
so I know what I'm doing,
but I can't keep from doing it.

2182
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:44.030
So I grabbed that pipe and pull myself off the bunk and I was going to hand over

2183
02:31:46.561 --> 02:31:51.300
hand to my boots.
I was going for my boots,
I was desperate,

2184
02:31:51.301 --> 02:31:54.900
you know,
I was crying out and it was calling from a boots.

2185
02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:58.530
The other thing I look back on,

2186
02:31:58.570 --> 02:32:02.700
I thought I was crazy as it should have been crazy or something.
Well,
anyway,

2187
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:05.190
I get to a door

2188
02:32:07.530 --> 02:32:10.320
and above that door,
the pipes went through the,

2189
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:13.830
the bulkhead up there.

2190
02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:19.280
And so I reached up and an hour is going to the other's room and a lost,

2191
02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:23.010
it all fell on the deck.
And uh,

2192
02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:27.510
and I don't know what happened,
but there was on the deck,

2193
02:32:27.511 --> 02:32:30.210
but a wound up in the big room.

2194
02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:31.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2195
02:32:31.770 --> 02:32:36.770
<v 3>He was a big area on this ship and it was lit up and there was all kinds of cots</v>

2196
02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:40.510
all around here.
And you guys laying on it.
And they were the thing,

2197
02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:44.860
a lot of wake up and I'm thirsty.

2198
02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:48.880
I've got to use,
uh,
I've got,
uh,

2199
02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:52.360
do other bowel movement.
And I was real men,

2200
02:32:52.690 --> 02:32:54.340
so hollered real loud.

2201
02:32:54.370 --> 02:32:59.370
Korman there's no Korman and I didn't have any needles in me,

2202
02:32:59.651 --> 02:33:04.630
you know,
uh,
feeding me,
you know,
uh,
uh,
uh,

2203
02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:10.180
all that stuff.
And so I hollered and all of these guys,

2204
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:14.200
he had head wounds and bandages on their head,
you know,

2205
02:33:14.201 --> 02:33:19.060
and they all hollered everything and we've got what's going on.

2206
02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:23.910
So laid there and there was a guy next to me and of course he has hit his

2207
02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:28.520
hearing.
My head's over here and I could see he was looking up at the ceiling.

2208
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:31.540
I said,
hey mate,
we're the Corman's here.
And he didn't answer me.

2209
02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:37.240
And I got real mad about him.
I said,
let me know what's going on here.

2210
02:33:37.450 --> 02:33:38.041
So a hall,

2211
02:33:38.041 --> 02:33:43.041
a real loud again and all these guys begin holler and scream and everything.

2212
02:33:44.131 --> 02:33:44.800
And,

2213
02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:49.210
and I was shaking my head and mad and everything hungry and,

2214
02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:52.570
and it's miserable.

2215
02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:57.220
And so I gave up and uh,

2216
02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.580
and I laid there for a wall leader.
Well,

2217
02:34:00.581 --> 02:34:05.000
the heard the door open and I looked up it over,

2218
02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:07.240
hears about 30 yards,

2219
02:34:07.241 --> 02:34:10.850
I guess for me and this big room.
Well,

2220
02:34:10.851 --> 02:34:14.020
there was a truck or or something over there,
park,

2221
02:34:14.530 --> 02:34:19.310
and they use those called tanks,
trucks and things that are shipped or tie.

2222
02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:25.260
But this room was well lit and all these guys with this laying on a cots,

2223
02:34:26.621 --> 02:34:29.050
you know,
when I heard the door slam

2224
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:34.660
and I look up and it's Dr. Anderson got it.

2225
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:38.020
That operated on me.
So a hauler real loud,

2226
02:34:38.021 --> 02:34:42.550
Dr. Anderson and all of these guys begin to Holler and scream at me and

2227
02:34:42.551 --> 02:34:43.384
everything.

2228
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:47.290
And he walked on down there and he just kind of shook his head and kept walking,

2229
02:34:47.291 --> 02:34:51.520
you know,
and uh,
and then man,

2230
02:34:51.521 --> 02:34:55.480
I knew I was in trouble and needed help,
you know,
I said,

2231
02:34:55.481 --> 02:34:59.110
I'm going to watch that door if he comes through again.

2232
02:34:59.111 --> 02:35:03.220
And when he walked in and went out the door on the left side,

2233
02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:08.050
so I waited and sure enough,

2234
02:35:08.051 --> 02:35:11.180
about 30 minutes or something like that,
I don't,
I have,

2235
02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:16.210
I heard this door open and he was,
Dr. Anderson comes in,

2236
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:21.580
so I'm smart.
I'm not going to Holler that these other guys fade me out.

2237
02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:27.210
So I began waving,
I begin to waven.
He's the walking,
kept walking up there.

2238
02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:31.840
Then I said,
I had to Holler.
So Ha,
uh,
hollered again,

2239
02:35:31.841 --> 02:35:36.640
Dr. Anderson and uh,
all these guys begin to Holler.

2240
02:35:37.090 --> 02:35:41.800
And then he stopped and kind of shook his head and I was waving at this time.

2241
02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:46.090
And so he comes over there.
He said,
what Harvey,

2242
02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.190
what are you doing down here?
I said,
I don't know.
He said,

2243
02:35:51.191 --> 02:35:56.191
I've been looking two days for you and I just presumed you'd been buried at sea.

2244
02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:03.700
And uh,
he said,
you don't know how you got down here?
And I said,

2245
02:36:03.701 --> 02:36:07.150
no,
I don't know how I got down here.
So he said,

2246
02:36:08.290 --> 02:36:12.520
I'll go get help.
They don't go anywhere.
And I said,
I'm not going.

2247
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:15.210
Oh wait for him.
While I was waiting for him,

2248
02:36:15.211 --> 02:36:18.250
there was a group of about 12 guys came in

2249
02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.370
and I could tell they were doctors in corpsman did everything.

2250
02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:27.870
And they started over here and they come to a thing,
God,

2251
02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.950
it'd be two guys had put,

2252
02:36:30.850 --> 02:36:34.060
they had stem scopes on it,

2253
02:36:34.061 --> 02:36:36.610
put on these guys that were laying there.

2254
02:36:37.180 --> 02:36:40.450
And sometimes they'd just shake their head.

2255
02:36:40.451 --> 02:36:44.290
And it was Corbyn would take them off and put him on a,
a,
a,

2256
02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:46.013
<v 6>uh,</v>

2257
02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:50.630
<v 3>a stretcher and take him away.</v>

2258
02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.320
And he's working longer and God is hoping to,

2259
02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:59.440
Dr. Anderson would get back and these guys would come to one Yadda Raton and

2260
02:37:00.771 --> 02:37:04.190
they'd shake him off leaving [inaudible] and going around.

2261
02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:09.330
<v 6>So,
uh,</v>

2262
02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:14.070
<v 3>Dr. Anderson came back down there.
Well,
these guys going,
I said,
doctor,</v>

2263
02:37:14.430 --> 02:37:19.190
what are these guys do?
And they,
some of these guys out,
he said,

2264
02:37:19.191 --> 02:37:20.024
Harvey,

2265
02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:22.600
<v 1>okay,</v>

2266
02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:27.370
<v 3>these guys,
we,
there's nothing we can do to happen.
They have head injuries,</v>

2267
02:37:27.550 --> 02:37:31.900
brain injuries,
and they're brain dead right now.

2268
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:36.100
You said there's no hope for him.
We can't do anything for them.

2269
02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:39.760
So we're bearing most of them.
But see,

2270
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:45.580
and I said,
uh,
I said,

2271
02:37:45.730 --> 02:37:47.770
what was I doing down here?
And he said,

2272
02:37:47.771 --> 02:37:50.320
I don't know how in the world that got you down here.

2273
02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:53.560
And I told him what I'd done,
you know,

2274
02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:55.930
and they didn't know what to do with me,

2275
02:37:55.931 --> 02:37:58.990
so they just put me down there with those guys.

2276
02:38:00.250 --> 02:38:03.370
And so he said,
you wait here.
And I said,
I'll wait here.

2277
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:08.770
So you went up and came back with four Korman the with them and they put me on

2278
02:38:10.061 --> 02:38:10.894
the,

2279
02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:16.200
on the stretcher and took me over to the door and a doctor,

2280
02:38:19.310 --> 02:38:23.490
he got done on a drop down on one knee and these guys were working together.

2281
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:24.970
I said,
doctor,

2282
02:38:26.260 --> 02:38:26.920
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2283
02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:30.370
<v 3>you can't help.
These guys are saying no,
we can't help them.</v>

2284
02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.640
There's nothing we can do there in God's hand.
And I said,

2285
02:38:35.641 --> 02:38:39.560
well I guess I was in God's hand to for awhile.
He should.
Yeah,
I guess so.

2286
02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:45.040
So said we're going to poorly into Guam,

2287
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.410
we would be taking you off,

2288
02:38:47.411 --> 02:38:52.390
you'll be taking back to Hawaii and so forth.

2289
02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:57.160
And so sure enough,
about an hour they took me off,
she up,

2290
02:38:57.750 --> 02:39:00.130
Dr. Anderson came down and,

2291
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:04.720
and thanked him.
I guess he saved my life

2292
02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.350
and then they took me I the heights,

2293
02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.560
the Pearl Harbor and that's where I was.

2294
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:21.220
I was in a full body,
cashed up to here all the way down.

2295
02:39:21.410 --> 02:39:24.560
Dad Split each leg,

2296
02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:28.570
had a cast over it to all one piece.

2297
02:39:29.410 --> 02:39:33.910
And uh,
they put me in a room with this guy here.

2298
02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:35.313
Now

2299
02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.640
<v 2>when you,
before we talk about that,</v>

2300
02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:43.320
I know you brought up a photograph today,
a big photograph of um,

2301
02:39:44.010 --> 02:39:47.970
uh,
you know,
very kind of typical,

2302
02:39:47.971 --> 02:39:52.140
a picture that you see of a,
of a bunch of military guys.

2303
02:39:52.141 --> 02:39:55.230
And this is a picture of,
of marines clearly.

2304
02:39:55.950 --> 02:40:00.390
And this picture right here is a picture of the first

2305
02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:05.430
<v 3>it in seat company 26 marines invasion.</v>

2306
02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:09.640
<v 2>And these are,
this is your,
in this photograph.
This is,</v>

2307
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:12.490
this is your company that you went into [inaudible] how many people are in this

2308
02:40:12.491 --> 02:40:14.880
picture?
243

2309
02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:21.240
<v 3>to a,
at the end of the Bible.</v>

2310
02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:23.280
After 36 days,

2311
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:28.290
I think 14 of these guys walked off the island,

2312
02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:33.050
rest of them were wounded,
carried off or died.

2313
02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.680
A lot of them were buried at sea because they had six hospitals,

2314
02:40:40.481 --> 02:40:45.481
ships and they filled up real fast and they had to go to Guam and SAP pan to be

2315
02:40:47.941 --> 02:40:50.610
taken off.
Flown back to Hawaii.

2316
02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:55.930
243 started in 14.
Walked off the island.
Yeah.
Uh,

2317
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:57.383
unbelievable.

2318
02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:03.380
And I've had this picture for years and one of them hanging in east to hang out

2319
02:41:04.351 --> 02:41:07.800
with my bed.
Never.
Not that I would look at these guys,
you know,

2320
02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:13.820
and then I moved into my living room right there and watch it.

2321
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:19.410
I'd looked at it every day cause I don't want to forget these guys.

2322
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:21.530
I,
I won't forget and,

2323
02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.810
and I can remember their faces,

2324
02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:29.010
but it's hard for me to still put names to a lot of them.

2325
02:41:29.770 --> 02:41:33.870
I like darts.
I remember him,
Peter,
Adam member,
him,

2326
02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:37.830
uh,
uh,
officers,

2327
02:41:37.890 --> 02:41:40.590
I remember him and uh,

2328
02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:48.470
and just 14 guys walked off that island and,

2329
02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:54.330
or really costly in lives and everything.

2330
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:57.930
And I'm not going to ever forget these guys.

2331
02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:03.600
We won't either,
sir.
Yeah.

2332
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:09.960
Which when you're in Guam now you're,
you're basically in a medical ward,

2333
02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:14.290
right?
Yeah.
Uh,
I ate a highest was the name of the hospital.

2334
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:16.830
It overlooks Pearl Harbor.

2335
02:42:17.490 --> 02:42:21.570
It was built there after the war started,
you know,

2336
02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:26.080
and so I'm in this,
uh,

2337
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:30.690
and you get reunited with,
with a copper at this point,
right?

2338
02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:35.520
Yeah.
You guys couldn't get away from each other.
Let me digress here.

2339
02:42:36.330 --> 02:42:41.060
I was put into a room in that hospital,
I,

2340
02:42:41.061 --> 02:42:44.040
the heights and Hawaii.

2341
02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:49.520
I was put in this room with another bed and a guy in that bed and he had a head

2342
02:42:50.071 --> 02:42:50.904
bandage

2343
02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:58.310
over him and I was laying next to him and I couldn't see him and he wouldn't

2344
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:06.850
talk to me and everything.
So I didn't say anything to them and everything.

2345
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.903
And uh,

2346
02:43:10.650 --> 02:43:15.290
and the had come in there and they'd take him off bringing it back out to a

2347
02:43:15.291 --> 02:43:19.570
wall.
And,
and he never talked to,

2348
02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.860
never say anything.
I gave up trying to talk to him and so forth

2349
02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:30.400
while I'm laying there feeling sorry for myself.
And,
uh,

2350
02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:35.980
I hear somebody,
Fred Harvey,

2351
02:43:35.981 --> 02:43:38.980
are you in this war?
Just loud,
you know,

2352
02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:41.920
not a recognized carvers voice.

2353
02:43:41.921 --> 02:43:46.300
He has a Washer to carry for a mom.
Everything.

2354
02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:51.610
So I'm raised up,
I'm in this room is about this big here,

2355
02:43:51.611 --> 02:43:52.444
you know,

2356
02:43:52.450 --> 02:43:57.450
I'm in the bed here and this other guys in the bid over here and I raise up

2357
02:43:58.091 --> 02:44:02.860
enough and I could see cover down there and he's hollering,

2358
02:44:03.130 --> 02:44:07.940
kept Paul and Fred or this little nurse ran down there and got in his face and

2359
02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:13.390
he said,
you just keep your mouth shut down to,
I mean,
she really read him off.

2360
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:19.160
Well I'm looking for my buddy.
They said he,

2361
02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:20.363
he said,

2362
02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:25.300
she said he's in this ward but he's in the room on the end on here.

2363
02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:27.790
And so she pointed,

2364
02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:32.791
laid him down there and he came in there and everyone was covered.

2365
02:44:33.011 --> 02:44:37.350
Man,
now he's in
it,

2366
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:40.620
bandaged up like this,
you know,
his arms and everything,

2367
02:44:40.621 --> 02:44:45.621
you know that taking over band nets and he is pushing bill Krause who's in a

2368
02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:52.150
wheelchair
with one of his legs missing.

2369
02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:57.650
And carbon was pushing him like this.
And,
and uh,

2370
02:44:57.670 --> 02:45:02.620
Bill was sitting,
I directed him and everything,
so

2371
02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:09.740
cover their standing in the door and he said,

2372
02:45:10.571 --> 02:45:11.050
what are they?

2373
02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:16.050
He got was Harvey and this guy standing here in this little room by themselves,

2374
02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:21.730
they said,
well,
because of the injuries,
you know,
on everything,

2375
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:24.640
why aren't out here with the other marines?
What?

2376
02:45:24.641 --> 02:45:27.760
She went over and closed the door,

2377
02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:33.310
but she didn't close it all.
I could hear him talk.
He said,
well,

2378
02:45:33.311 --> 02:45:35.980
you buddy over here,
we don't know what to do with him.

2379
02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:39.900
He got injuries and uh,

2380
02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:43.700
his legs are blood clotted and so forth.

2381
02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:48.140
So we don't know what to do for him.
And,
uh,

2382
02:45:48.690 --> 02:45:52.940
and this guy over here,
he's,
he's lost his face.

2383
02:45:52.941 --> 02:45:57.730
He can't communicate.
He wants to die.
And Gosh,

2384
02:45:59.590 --> 02:46:04.230
I kind of scared me,
you know,
and everything.
So carver said,

2385
02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:08.420
put 'em out of here with the other marines.
Right.
Uh,
and um,

2386
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:13.200
so we went up burn and the nurses area,

2387
02:46:13.201 --> 02:46:16.250
Roger Hears about halfway down the hall,

2388
02:46:16.490 --> 02:46:18.640
that Hall Ward,

2389
02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:22.190
most of them 70 yards long anyway,

2390
02:46:22.191 --> 02:46:27.191
and vegetate on each side and nurses right here in the middle.

2391
02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:32.680
Well,
they put me over here and put,
uh,

2392
02:46:33.350 --> 02:46:37.720
this go here on the right side.
And uh,

2393
02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:42.820
governor said we'll take those bandages it off of his face and nurses.

2394
02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:48.830
Well,
he doesn't want them taken,
although I should take them off right there.

2395
02:46:48.860 --> 02:46:52.400
People got,
have to see him.
He's going to have to live with it.

2396
02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:57.530
And so a large scene it when they a doctor,

2397
02:46:57.531 --> 02:46:59.280
do you mean when I looked over there,

2398
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:05.880
this was all gone.
You could see the back of his neck,
back diaries,

2399
02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:08.760
backbone and everything on it,

2400
02:47:08.770 --> 02:47:11.000
dying on his face versus his eyes.

2401
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:14.060
And he had his ear and uh,

2402
02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:18.410
and I'm way they can feed him,
you know,
nobody,

2403
02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:23.680
he could eat anything and they just fed him like we were feeding me too,

2404
02:47:24.771 --> 02:47:28.040
you know,
just intravenously right there.

2405
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:34.030
And they put them over and that Guy Cabo would talk to him,

2406
02:47:35.381 --> 02:47:39.130
you know,
he said,
Tai Chi bandages off,
you're going to have to live with that.

2407
02:47:39.250 --> 02:47:44.250
[inaudible] you're with marines and we all understand and lug it and everything.

2408
02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:49.810
And so he took off the bandage and left them off.

2409
02:47:52.090 --> 02:47:55.260
All of these marines come by and glance at him and then patty,

2410
02:47:55.261 --> 02:47:58.910
me and on and so forth.
And he

2411
02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:03.800
a spiritual rose,
you know,

2412
02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:07.070
and of course she couldn't tell us that,
you know,

2413
02:48:07.071 --> 02:48:11.290
but you could tell about his actions and everything.
So Macabre.

2414
02:48:11.850 --> 02:48:15.920
Uh,
this is uh,
uh,
plastic surgery award we're on.

2415
02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:19.000
And the guy that headed up was named,

2416
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:23.970
I can't think of his name right now,

2417
02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:29.300
but it was an all American football player and Wisconsin and had a big massive

2418
02:48:30.511 --> 02:48:34.950
guy with big hands and broad shoulders.

2419
02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:39.300
He was doing delicate operations on,
uh,

2420
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:44.550
on guys,
you know,
plastic surgery.
And so,

2421
02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:46.973
<v 4>uh,</v>

2422
02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:48.970
<v 3>they did,</v>

2423
02:48:48.970 --> 02:48:53.390
they didn't know what to do with me because a blood clot,

2424
02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:58.300
they couldn't start operating on maybe because both of her legs had blood clots

2425
02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:01.510
all up in my stomach and so forth.

2426
02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:04.890
Carver told me later that,
uh,

2427
02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:10.040
that nurse had told him that there was way to not do them through it and not

2428
02:49:11.310 --> 02:49:14.250
been in our about a week.
And uh,

2429
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:19.470
and cobber talk to this doctor,

2430
02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.500
what was his name?
He was an all American football player.
Well anyway,

2431
02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:30.750
he said,
is,
uh,
how are you going to fix it?
He said,
well,

2432
02:49:30.751 --> 02:49:33.150
we just gonna have to build him a new face,

2433
02:49:34.490 --> 02:49:38.970
but we can't start on him until he gets strong enough to take it,
you know,

2434
02:49:38.971 --> 02:49:41.430
and so forth.
And,
uh,

2435
02:49:43.470 --> 02:49:48.260
and so commerce said,
well,
the house something that,
things that she said,

2436
02:49:48.350 --> 02:49:48.570
yeah,

2437
02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:53.570
we got a little booklet over here that has six facial features on it.

2438
02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:59.080
[inaudible]
said,
let me see it.
So you'd look at six pages with

2439
02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:02.790
six facial features on it.

2440
02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:08.720
So carver gave it to Harold here and he took him to each bed and it had a note

2441
02:50:12.991 --> 02:50:17.010
on our written pick out the best looking face in this,
in this book,

2442
02:50:17.011 --> 02:50:21.750
but something,
oh voted on which face he wanted to know.

2443
02:50:22.170 --> 02:50:26.970
And this guy,
you know,
he was,
of course,

2444
02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:32.460
he was happy to be out with the other guys and everything and he would stay in

2445
02:50:32.461 --> 02:50:35.430
the wheelchair lot and go from place to place.

2446
02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:39.690
Guys would come over and talk to him and if he had anything to say,
you know,

2447
02:50:39.691 --> 02:50:43.530
he'd ride it out and so forth.
And,
uh,

2448
02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:47.150
then they,
uh,
uh,

2449
02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:52.020
started operating on him and they didn't know what to do with me.

2450
02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:54.330
I'm still laying there,
my cash.

2451
02:50:54.930 --> 02:50:59.040
And then one day the little nurse came up,

2452
02:50:59.041 --> 02:51:02.630
she's from Austin,
Texas is not king,

2453
02:51:02.650 --> 02:51:04.560
or he called her name rotten down,

2454
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:09.030
but she was 65 years old at that time.

2455
02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.170
And they were trying to discharge her and she wouldn't let them discharge.

2456
02:51:13.470 --> 02:51:18.270
She said,
I'm going to stay in here until this war is completely over.
And she did

2457
02:51:21.150 --> 02:51:24.570
well,
she came home and told me,

2458
02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:29.070
we think we might have found a way to help you.

2459
02:51:30.270 --> 02:51:34.410
And she told me,
he said,
there's a guy as the,

2460
02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:37.710
uh,
item in the New England

2461
02:51:39.450 --> 02:51:43.700
medical journal or something like that.
And he,

2462
02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.120
he was in,
uh,

2463
02:51:45.690 --> 02:51:48.990
New Orleans and his name was Faust,

2464
02:51:50.060 --> 02:51:51.720
not member of the word south,

2465
02:51:51.721 --> 02:51:55.560
because there's an opera or written about Dr Files,
you know,

2466
02:51:55.770 --> 02:52:00.590
so I've remembered that name all alone.
And so,
uh,

2467
02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:03.450
she told the,
uh,

2468
02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:08.240
the commander of that hospital,
you know,
that she wanted that,
yeah.

2469
02:52:08.250 --> 02:52:13.180
To come over and look at me.
So they put him on a plane,

2470
02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:15.580
flew him over there,
and they look at me,
he says,
well,

2471
02:52:15.581 --> 02:52:20.110
we can't do anything until we operated on him.

2472
02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:25.420
And he said,
I have a way,
I think I might be able to help you.

2473
02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.740
When they came in there and they took a machine,

2474
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:33.790
a vibrator or something and cut the top of that cast off of me and set it aside.

2475
02:52:37.931 --> 02:52:42.280
And then they put me on a table on my stomach

2476
02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:44.753
<v 6>and,</v>

2477
02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:50.010
<v 3>and doctor [inaudible] puts six needles along my spine.</v>

2478
02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:51.750
And,
uh,

2479
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:56.750
you know what a football or basketball needle looks like needle about that long

2480
02:52:58.291 --> 02:53:03.240
and a little head on it,
you know,
screw into a pump.
Well,

2481
02:53:03.241 --> 02:53:06.540
anyway,
that's the way that there was things looked,
you know,

2482
02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:10.590
there's needles and built like that.
They weren't,
weren't the real thing,

2483
02:53:11.070 --> 02:53:12.440
but that's what lear,
well,

2484
02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:17.550
they stuck her nose along my spine and then he put some kind of fluid in there

2485
02:53:20.010 --> 02:53:24.480
and I thought they'd put gasoline on me and sent me a fire.

2486
02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:28.040
Yada did burned out.

2487
02:53:28.041 --> 02:53:30.460
I thought I was on fire that hey,

2488
02:53:33.260 --> 02:53:37.410
I thought they started killing it really.
And they said,
no,

2489
02:53:37.411 --> 02:53:42.060
that's just a symptom.
They're not burning up their thing.
And,

2490
02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:45.540
and so they gave me about six of those

2491
02:53:47.130 --> 02:53:51.860
treatments and the legs begin to clear up,
uh,

2492
02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:57.030
dissolved in the,
uh,
uh,
blood clots.

2493
02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:01.920
And then the doctor started operating on,

2494
02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:05.970
on me and plastic surgery.
And,

2495
02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:09.950
<v 6>uh,
they,
uh,</v>

2496
02:54:11.170 --> 02:54:13.810
<v 3>a took skin off my legs and put it on my,</v>

2497
02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:17.770
on my butt and everything.
And,

2498
02:54:19.270 --> 02:54:22.450
and then they took a picture of me and it looked like

2499
02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:27.550
my legs and my buttocks.
It had been worked over by a

2500
02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:30.540
<v 6>dye that,
uh,</v>

2501
02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:33.060
<v 3>made tattoos on.</v>

2502
02:54:33.061 --> 02:54:36.810
Guys looked like if a doctor had a tattoo,

2503
02:54:36.811 --> 02:54:39.570
artists had fouled up.
And this thing,

2504
02:54:39.770 --> 02:54:44.770
my whole back side was just black and it was that volcanic ash.

2505
02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:51.940
<v 6>And,
uh,
so,
uh,</v>

2506
02:54:52.810 --> 02:54:53.643
they got me,

2507
02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.760
<v 3>got me up and got me fixed.
My legs begin to throw out,
you know,</v>

2508
02:54:59.761 --> 02:55:03.860
the thing and,
uh,
it's going to take me,

2509
02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:09.080
they came in and asked me where I wanted to be taken to the hospital and the

2510
02:55:09.081 --> 02:55:12.290
closest one to my hometown,
where's Carpus Christian?

2511
02:55:12.291 --> 02:55:15.770
That was nearly 900 miles.

2512
02:55:16.430 --> 02:55:21.230
And so this doctor said,
hey,
uh,
Harvey,

2513
02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:24.890
how about coming to New Orleans?
We have a hospital there,

2514
02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:29.510
naval hospital there and I can look after your mower.
And I said,

2515
02:55:29.511 --> 02:55:30.440
well that's great.

2516
02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:37.480
So I was in and the harsh sent down there and carver had been sent before he had

2517
02:55:41.961 --> 02:55:44.870
left and gone to the east coast.

2518
02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:48.530
And so they uh,

2519
02:55:48.890 --> 02:55:52.940
they put me on a plane and flew me to California.

2520
02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:57.710
Well that blame was at constellation and I was told it was used for was in

2521
02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:02.720
hospital thing and we got nearly halfway home and the plane,

2522
02:56:03.410 --> 02:56:04.850
well problems.

2523
02:56:05.690 --> 02:56:10.690
And so here I am with a bunch of other guys that were all thrown into,

2524
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:16.070
one was on a stretcher and so the nurse came in there and put things around me

2525
02:56:16.891 --> 02:56:20.450
and,
and gave instructions and all of these other guys would wait because I was

2526
02:56:20.460 --> 02:56:23.030
expecting that plane to go down.

2527
02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.860
And so they decided that it was one to the point of no return.

2528
02:56:27.861 --> 02:56:31.770
So the turnaround took us back to Honolulu.

2529
02:56:32.530 --> 02:56:35.660
All the hula girls medicine I thought were doing,

2530
02:56:36.350 --> 02:56:38.600
coming in raw vacation.

2531
02:56:39.050 --> 02:56:44.050
They put on a show for us and then they fixed the plane and finally got me over

2532
02:56:46.221 --> 02:56:51.050
to,
oh,
what's that town across the bay.

2533
02:56:51.051 --> 02:56:55.220
Dale.
A football team.
Learn a San Francisco.

2534
02:56:55.221 --> 02:56:58.490
What is the name of that?
Alameda.
Alameda.
Yeah.

2535
02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:01.850
And that's where the landed may rot.

2536
02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:07.240
And they put me out on the tarmac and I had my hands over my eyes like that.

2537
02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:11.030
The Sun was shining it

2538
02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:17.970
and somebody kicked me.
She said,
you little bastard,
the word and the hail,

2539
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:21.130
that big van to cover the Scarborough.

2540
02:57:23.310 --> 02:57:28.310
Well he had been taken to another hospital further down the coast about 20,

2541
02:57:29.490 --> 02:57:30.630
30 miles from there.

2542
02:57:30.930 --> 02:57:35.930
And he had been hitchhiking the last three week hitchhiking over ever day to

2543
02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:41.670
meet and these planes that were bringing guys in.
And they finally found me.

2544
02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:47.390
And so
they took me over there and uh,

2545
02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:52.440
I can bring up the name of that hospital.
He was in

2546
02:57:54.900 --> 02:57:58.700
a side important.
So they,
uh,

2547
02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:00.750
doctor wanted,
admitted,
brought,

2548
02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:05.220
they brought back to New Orleans.

2549
02:58:06.330 --> 02:58:11.160
Well cobber we're still lowered in California.

2550
02:58:11.161 --> 02:58:16.060
When I lay out,
well,
I was,
uh,

2551
02:58:16.570 --> 02:58:19.020
I got in pretty good shape.
You know,

2552
02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:24.021
I walk around with a cane and crutches at time and,

2553
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:25.463
and,
uh,

2554
02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:30.270
I heard that the air was a farm out outside of,

2555
02:58:30.450 --> 02:58:35.340
over across the river in,
uh,
in Algiers,

2556
02:58:36.540 --> 02:58:37.380
Louisiana.

2557
02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:43.640
And the Navy had an ammunition dump over there on the river across the river.

2558
02:58:44.970 --> 02:58:49.350
And,
uh,
and they lit marines go over there and Rehab,

2559
02:58:49.410 --> 02:58:53.730
Rehab,
uh,
you know,
get better.

2560
02:58:53.731 --> 02:58:56.100
And they didn't take care of things on the farm.

2561
02:58:57.570 --> 02:59:01.350
And so I heard about it and I begged him to let me go over there.

2562
02:59:02.010 --> 02:59:07.010
So they let me go over there and with his stipulation that I would take care of

2563
02:59:07.081 --> 02:59:10.170
chickens because it didn't take care of anything else.

2564
02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:16.100
And so here I went over and I was taking care of chickens and they had these

2565
02:59:16.441 --> 02:59:21.441
white Legere and chip chickens and the great facilities form live on.

2566
02:59:22.500 --> 02:59:26.220
They never got on the ground,
his own wire,
uh,

2567
02:59:26.880 --> 02:59:31.440
uh,
chicken wire,
you know,
and uh,
they had,

2568
02:59:31.770 --> 02:59:36.290
uh,
uh,
oats or something are planted,

2569
02:59:36.350 --> 02:59:40.140
the seeds thrown in there and these chickens or walk around.

2570
02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:42.590
And eat that green is called Ohana.

2571
02:59:43.100 --> 02:59:47.100
Well I would together up the eggs and take a man and uh,

2572
02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:50.980
doing that,
you know,
well the guy that was taken care of,

2573
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:53.760
they got real mad cause that was a cushy job,

2574
02:59:54.180 --> 02:59:56.520
but as the only job I could do,
you know,

2575
02:59:57.450 --> 03:00:00.340
and so I was taking care of the chickens,
you know,

2576
03:00:00.341 --> 03:00:03.760
and feeling sorry for myself and,

2577
03:00:04.050 --> 03:00:05.610
and everything.

2578
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:10.090
And I had a bucket full of eggs and uh,

2579
03:00:10.440 --> 03:00:14.660
I'd take him over there and they'd take them up the naval base,
uh,

2580
03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:19.590
uh,
uh,
eating place,
you know,

2581
03:00:20.130 --> 03:00:24.810
and uh,
he took care of all the eggs and so forth.
Well,

2582
03:00:24.811 --> 03:00:27.580
anyway,
I was out there,

2583
03:00:27.581 --> 03:00:31.500
I had a bunch of that and I had a walking on my using the cane and,

2584
03:00:32.250 --> 03:00:37.250
and I heard the horn are out there and guys screaming and I look up and,

2585
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:41.550
and his lead darts,

2586
03:00:41.730 --> 03:00:46.730
he sitting up on the Kava the truck and they were hauling slop form the

2587
03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:53.540
cafeteria and no,
and it was covered.

2588
03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:57.130
He had found me and then he told this story.
Well,

2589
03:00:57.131 --> 03:01:01.090
he was sipped to an area up on the east coast.

2590
03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:04.720
Do you remember what that place was?
Well,
anyway,

2591
03:01:04.990 --> 03:01:08.560
he was taken up there and he was discharged.

2592
03:01:08.561 --> 03:01:13.561
So he tried to buy a motorcycle and he called my mother and found out where I

2593
03:01:14.141 --> 03:01:17.650
was stationed and he said,

2594
03:01:17.651 --> 03:01:20.740
don't tell her co Harvey where I'm at and everything.

2595
03:01:22.030 --> 03:01:26.530
And so he couldn't buy a motorcycle.
You didn't have enough money.

2596
03:01:26.531 --> 03:01:27.970
So he hitchhiked down there.

2597
03:01:28.810 --> 03:01:33.810
So he hitchhiked down there and took him three days to get down there.

2598
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:39.460
And he got,
his uniform was a soils,
you know,

2599
03:01:39.461 --> 03:01:44.461
and he'd been in it for about six days and so,

2600
03:01:46.330 --> 03:01:51.010
and he's one of the guys that meant it had to be dressed completely.
Lynn,

2601
03:01:51.011 --> 03:01:54.660
that picture,
we'd tell him,

2602
03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:59.730
tell him that he was the only marine did ever invaded with a pressed Daenerys.

2603
03:02:01.270 --> 03:02:03.320
All that.
Yeah.
And fixed her the book

2604
03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:07.250
<v 2>where it shows him from behind,
you can see the beer in his gas mask thing.</v>

2605
03:02:07.251 --> 03:02:11.340
And you can also see this,
that is a uniform is pressed and starched.
Oh yeah.

2606
03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:13.560
And they had initially,

2607
03:02:13.930 --> 03:02:18.360
<v 3>yeah.
I mean,
he's named Spanish to the dorm is,
uh,</v>

2608
03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:24.170
is a spade,
you know,
and trenching to,

2609
03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:29.660
well he hid
it,
took him six dry,
uh,

2610
03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:33.690
six days to,
uh,
number six trips,
uh,

2611
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:37.730
arrives to get down night.
I was about three or four days.

2612
03:02:37.731 --> 03:02:41.720
It took him to get on the east coast down to New Orleans.
Well,

2613
03:02:41.721 --> 03:02:43.690
it gets New Orleans and you know,

2614
03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:48.900
World War I knew I was on a naval base down there,

2615
03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:53.590
so he has no idea what to do and everything.

2616
03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:59.630
So he goes to a tailor shop cleaning place,

2617
03:02:59.631 --> 03:03:04.400
you know,
and that guy cleaned his uniform,
you know,
and,

2618
03:03:05.130 --> 03:03:07.510
and pressed it and everything for him because he had,

2619
03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:12.450
he needed to look good all the time.
So he,
he uh,

2620
03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:15.860
I was walking around and having no idea of what to do.

2621
03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:21.160
So he saw a Red Cross car parked in front of a building right there and it was a

2622
03:03:22.401 --> 03:03:27.250
Red Cross office day.
So he walked over and looked and it was lady,

2623
03:03:27.470 --> 03:03:29.330
the lady sitting at the desk.

2624
03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:32.810
So he has his discharge papers,

2625
03:03:32.850 --> 03:03:37.670
never thing in 90 left to see bag out outside.
Say,
walked in there,

2626
03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.900
he looked around,
you know,
like he was being fallen,

2627
03:03:42.470 --> 03:03:44.100
got the closest lane.
He said,

2628
03:03:44.570 --> 03:03:49.100
I've got to find a man now more on a special mission and I've got to find him.

2629
03:03:49.101 --> 03:03:53.830
You know,
it's a,
it's a real critical thing.
She said,
I'll help you.

2630
03:03:53.831 --> 03:03:58.040
She got fired up and she out that,

2631
03:03:58.730 --> 03:03:59.563
uh,

2632
03:03:59.810 --> 03:04:04.810
hours over that I ate a heights at that naval ammunition base or the,

2633
03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:10.970
and so she said,
I'll take you over there.
Sure.

2634
03:04:10.971 --> 03:04:15.971
She closes up his office or her office and in carvers holding his discharge

2635
03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:22.950
papers on their own,
look around,
you know,
it's,
you see,
I can put it on all night.

2636
03:04:23.420 --> 03:04:25.330
She'd go to town to town,
you know,

2637
03:04:25.870 --> 03:04:30.870
running stop lives cause this and that thing that had big red crosses on it,

2638
03:04:31.191 --> 03:04:32.024
you know,

2639
03:04:32.270 --> 03:04:37.270
and he gets him down now to the ferry boat.

2640
03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:41.780
That's where they had a bridge built across.
I,
so,

2641
03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:46.450
and she had called over to bass and they had the,
uh,

2642
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:51.580
a van over to meet him,
you know,
and everything.
And,
uh,

2643
03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:57.050
so he pulls the car up on that,
uh,
that,
uh,

2644
03:04:57.110 --> 03:05:02.110
ferry boat was waiting on him and so calmer got out and he hugged that lady and

2645
03:05:03.081 --> 03:05:07.890
she had tears in her eyes and did her part for the country.
Oh yeah.

2646
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:08.743
Secret message.

2647
03:05:10.430 --> 03:05:14.560
So he gets over there and this guy,
then this thing,

2648
03:05:14.910 --> 03:05:15.743
the old,

2649
03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:20.270
he looks around and he thought it shouldn't be on that admiral or something,

2650
03:05:20.271 --> 03:05:22.580
you know,
what needed to Pfc.

2651
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:27.000
And so this,
uh,

2652
03:05:27.180 --> 03:05:32.180
his car had a siren on his third turn on his salary and run him down to,

2653
03:05:33.130 --> 03:05:37.420
uh,
uh,
the town,
uh,
uh,

2654
03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:41.360
a little town across,
uh,
uh,

2655
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:46.510
and you got him to the base and the [inaudible] gone.

2656
03:05:47.210 --> 03:05:50.090
Th th that God's going to take him to the,

2657
03:05:50.680 --> 03:05:54.950
to the headquarters office.
He said,
oh no,
I can't stop.

2658
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:59.420
I've got to go and said,
I'll get down there some way.

2659
03:05:59.870 --> 03:06:04.870
So He's standing there and you see this truck coming around the corner and he,

2660
03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:11.320
it just coming out and it had two barrels of slop from the mess hall and they,

2661
03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:16.460
they'd tell him,
said,
I ain't going there.
And he said,

2662
03:06:16.461 --> 03:06:20.660
I'm not getting up of the thing.
Million flyers around it there the thing.

2663
03:06:21.560 --> 03:06:26.180
And so he,
uh,
there's two guys in the trucks,
so they put him,

2664
03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:27.030
uh,

2665
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:32.030
they take the a sea bag and put up between them and then he gets up on the hood

2666
03:06:34.101 --> 03:06:35.830
and sits on the cab ride die.

2667
03:06:36.440 --> 03:06:39.410
And when they get close to that farm where I was,

2668
03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:44.900
they began to honk their horn and Howard carver stomping the

2669
03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:50.150
hood of that truck,
hollering my name in there,
the thing.

2670
03:06:50.810 --> 03:06:54.380
And I was so happy to see my cry.
He came,

2671
03:06:54.680 --> 03:06:57.970
he came home and uh,
or,

2672
03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:01.310
oh really glad to see him,
you know,

2673
03:07:01.320 --> 03:07:06.320
it's just like losing the best friend and on the plan name and the end.

2674
03:07:07.170 --> 03:07:12.170
And so here I am and I'd take him over there to the sergeants.

2675
03:07:12.991 --> 03:07:16.500
So then charge over this on that farm that,

2676
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:20.040
that owner of that farm,

2677
03:07:20.041 --> 03:07:25.041
when the war started donated his farm lands to be used,

2678
03:07:25.170 --> 03:07:27.930
bailed ammunition,
dumps,
you know,

2679
03:07:28.650 --> 03:07:33.650
they're worthy bar or mileage where the dig and decide my ground and,

2680
03:07:36.210 --> 03:07:39.960
and had the thing is about 50 those mounds along there.

2681
03:07:40.920 --> 03:07:44.930
And so this sergeant,
God can't fag for names,

2682
03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:49.740
is in charge of the farm,
you know,
because that guy orange farm farm back,

2683
03:07:49.741 --> 03:07:51.120
just like it was

2684
03:07:53.260 --> 03:07:58.260
after the war was over and they had to take care of the horses on the and the

2685
03:08:00.250 --> 03:08:04.240
pigs and well,
the whole eggs and uh,

2686
03:08:04.930 --> 03:08:08.410
take care of the house and everything.
Well,

2687
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:13.630
they had the is used in the house and there were six other marines and a beside

2688
03:08:13.631 --> 03:08:18.550
the sergeant that was,
but it was in charge of.
So,
uh,

2689
03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:20.500
when carver got,
uh,

2690
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:25.160
Tucker [inaudible] sergeant sergeant or working on a weekend alone,
a,
uh,

2691
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:30.650
a tractor,
and I said,
hey sarge,
it's just lead dark.
He's my buddy.
Uh,

2692
03:08:31.450 --> 03:08:35.800
and he just got into town and they stay here.
He said,
yeah,

2693
03:08:35.801 --> 03:08:38.440
he can stay here.
So,
uh,

2694
03:08:39.070 --> 03:08:42.500
he took us in his day.
I start turning,
gave to him,
uh,

2695
03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:47.560
a,
uh,
a card,
you know,

2696
03:08:47.561 --> 03:08:50.860
to get to me out of now that I have a guy that are already left,

2697
03:08:51.250 --> 03:08:56.250
so here covers another name and he's own base without not even the Marine Corps

2698
03:08:58.620 --> 03:09:02.980
anymore.
And so,
uh,

2699
03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:07.540
uh,
we,
he was going to help me with the chickens.

2700
03:09:10.130 --> 03:09:14.780
And so,
uh,
we take with the chickens and this guy,

2701
03:09:14.810 --> 03:09:19.310
big old red hit a guy,
he was the guy that had the chicken job,

2702
03:09:19.311 --> 03:09:23.780
which he did the best job on the,
on the farm.
You had to give it up.
He,

2703
03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:27.770
he was mad at me,
he wouldn't even speak to me.

2704
03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:32.930
So here carver was owned by [inaudible] with a

2705
03:09:34.430 --> 03:09:35.250
<v 1>okay.</v>

2706
03:09:35.250 --> 03:09:40.140
<v 3>Where the cards in order to let him get and all the base and uh,</v>

2707
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:43.870
it was just another marine did this then drawing the pay,
you know.

2708
03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:50.750
And so we stayed down there for quite a while and uh,

2709
03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:56.800
we decided that the chickens,

2710
03:09:57.250 --> 03:10:01.750
some of those chicken Jordan during the job and copper said we need to call out

2711
03:10:01.751 --> 03:10:06.380
the non layers.
So he called a,
uh,

2712
03:10:06.940 --> 03:10:07.773
<v 4>yeah,</v>

2713
03:10:08.450 --> 03:10:13.450
<v 3>a vet veterinarian and ask him how you decided which one was layered.</v>

2714
03:10:16.490 --> 03:10:20.210
And he said,
well,
put two fingers,
this pot and everything,

2715
03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:25.780
we got the wrong information and then we took it wrong and we killed a bunch of

2716
03:10:25.851 --> 03:10:29.990
those layers and it cut the production of vagues out.

2717
03:10:29.991 --> 03:10:32.690
We got in trouble,
they brought us,

2718
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:37.370
they brought me and cause there's copper couldn't go before the man,
you know,

2719
03:10:37.820 --> 03:10:41.930
and they were going to send me back to the heart of the revolution and it really

2720
03:10:41.931 --> 03:10:46.480
mad.
And,
and this,
this sergeant where that uh,
he should run,

2721
03:10:46.481 --> 03:10:48.920
let them stay and I'll put them on in the hallway.

2722
03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:52.790
And so they put us on the hall.

2723
03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:55.620
That was the worst job on the deal.

2724
03:10:56.420 --> 03:10:59.840
<v 2>So how long were you down there at the hospital and told our at the,</v>

2725
03:10:59.841 --> 03:11:00.920
at the farm and total

2726
03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:06.280
<v 3>all probably three months.
And then that was,</v>

2727
03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:09.980
that was the end of your career,
you got discharged at the end of that?
Yeah,

2728
03:11:10.020 --> 03:11:14.920
from the hospital.
I was discharged from the hospital.

2729
03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:17.650
And so a free to go.

2730
03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:22.240
Why don't you read that out loud?

2731
03:11:22.420 --> 03:11:27.420
Because that introduces carbon or what they were meant to each other.

2732
03:11:28.130 --> 03:11:30.360
<v 2>Yeah.
It's a,
a picture of you two,</v>

2733
03:11:30.361 --> 03:11:33.380
and I guess this is the day you were discharged.

2734
03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:37.280
<v 3>Yeah,
we did.
It took us out,
uh,
lieutenant,</v>

2735
03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:41.650
their sergeant drovers out to the edge of town and,
uh,

2736
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:43.460
I'd drink a coke or cola.

2737
03:11:43.850 --> 03:11:48.850
Cobre had a beer and the board lists and uh,

2738
03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:55.460
and that sergeant and in charge of,
he was in tears.
He aid to see us go.

2739
03:11:56.320 --> 03:11:57.680
And so

2740
03:11:58.210 --> 03:12:00.760
<v 2>it says our faces are bathed in sadness.</v>

2741
03:12:01.450 --> 03:12:05.530
We had just been medically discharged from the Marine Corps.
The corps,

2742
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:08.350
which had been our home was now just a memory.

2743
03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:12.610
We loved the Marines and thought we'd always serve the flag,

2744
03:12:13.090 --> 03:12:16.720
but circumstances intervened.
I left us homeless.

2745
03:12:17.050 --> 03:12:20.740
We now faced an uncertain future.
However,

2746
03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:25.420
it didn't mark the end of the friendship that had been forged and nurtured by

2747
03:12:25.421 --> 03:12:27.790
war.
Like brothers.

2748
03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:30.640
We have remained close ever since.

2749
03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:38.360
Let's see it.
Yeah.
And there's great detail in the book,
um,

2750
03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:42.300
that,
that you've got to tell even more stories and,
and it's,

2751
03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:45.920
it's great to hear those.
And I'd definitely,
anybody,
um,

2752
03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:50.340
should get this book and it's available right now.
Um,

2753
03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:51.830
and,
uh,

2754
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:56.830
I got to say there's two versions of the book and the version that you want to

2755
03:12:56.961 --> 03:13:01.310
order.
I will have it on our website so that people will get the right one.

2756
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:03.170
It's called Hell yes.

2757
03:13:03.171 --> 03:13:07.640
I do it again by t Fred Harvey and it's got a blue cover and the other version

2758
03:13:07.641 --> 03:13:12.500
of it has a similar title.
Just get this one.
Um,
that's in blue.

2759
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:14.000
What made you decide to write the book?

2760
03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:16.131
<v 3>Well,</v>

2761
03:13:16.131 --> 03:13:21.131
people learning to hear the story and I'd taken a lot of notes and so I decided

2762
03:13:24.411 --> 03:13:28.670
to write a book,
but it was Kinda hard for me because,

2763
03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:32.210
uh,
I had,
I quit high school.

2764
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:37.060
<v 2>The English,
well,
he did a great job because the book and you know,</v>

2765
03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:41.840
reading the book,
it's a,
it's a great read.
And then you know,
you spent,
you spent,

2766
03:13:41.841 --> 03:13:42.630
once you retired,

2767
03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:47.630
you said you coached football for 45 years and worked with kids and you still

2768
03:13:47.781 --> 03:13:50.510
were telling me you still work out every day.
Yeah.

2769
03:13:50.690 --> 03:13:54.330
You still get after it every day.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2770
03:13:55.580 --> 03:13:58.650
<v 3>Uh,
weights and,
uh,
uh,</v>

2771
03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:00.960
apartment I work on,

2772
03:14:00.970 --> 03:14:05.970
on the weights and a one will run the machines where you pump paddle and,

2773
03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:10.750
and I stay in shape and eat the right kind of food

2774
03:14:11.900 --> 03:14:12.733
<v 1>and uh,</v>

2775
03:14:16.220 --> 03:14:19.120
<v 2>I want her to die happy.
So what I'm saying,</v>

2776
03:14:19.130 --> 03:14:23.600
name good to health and that's awesome.
You know,
I wanted to,
I want to close out,

2777
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:26.780
um,
by reading one,

2778
03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:30.930
one last little piece of the book and um,

2779
03:14:32.530 --> 03:14:34.070
yeah,
well I'll just do it.

2780
03:14:34.270 --> 03:14:35.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2781
03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:40.700
<v 2>And,
and this is,
um,
this is you.</v>

2782
03:14:40.701 --> 03:14:44.330
We went to visit,
uh,
Eol Jima.

2783
03:14:44.390 --> 03:14:46.550
You went back to the island in the early eighties,

2784
03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:51.640
and this is something that you wrote as you were leaving the island after you

2785
03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:56.150
went and visited the place where you had fought and where you lost so many

2786
03:14:56.151 --> 03:14:56.984
friends.

2787
03:14:57.770 --> 03:15:01.730
And the book says for each and every wave that has crashed upon these shores

2788
03:15:01.731 --> 03:15:03.680
since those days so long ago,

2789
03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:08.240
the mother has shed a tear for a son who fought and died here.

2790
03:15:09.970 --> 03:15:14.380
Many of those mothers at this time have gone to be with their sons.

2791
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.943
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2792
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:18.470
<v 2>Here,
pride took over.</v>

2793
03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:22.490
You screamed loudly and ran straight ahead.

2794
03:15:23.620 --> 03:15:24.220
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2795
03:15:24.220 --> 03:15:28.210
<v 2>it's notoriety was written in blood and courage.</v>

2796
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:34.460
Absent are the sounds of battle that emphasized the human voice in all its

2797
03:15:34.461 --> 03:15:39.461
emotions against a backdrop of roaring cannons and small arms fire.

2798
03:15:42.050 --> 03:15:45.140
The engines of war are silent now

2799
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:50.220
you owe Gima today offers an innocuous view

2800
03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:55.400
<v 0>in stark contrast to what took place here in the winter of 1945</v>

2801
03:15:57.550 --> 03:16:02.200
but hurtful and injurious qualities that it supported those days so long ago.

2802
03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:04.270
No longer are in evidence.

2803
03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:05.630
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2804
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:08.750
<v 0>Yes,
the engines of war are silent here,</v>

2805
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:12.710
but man has cranked them up many times since in other lands.

2806
03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:19.640
You whoa today still offers a landscape that features a rugged coarseness.

2807
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:23.870
Everything that took place on this spot emphasize strength,
power,

2808
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:28.530
and courage
time and it's help mates.

2809
03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:32.790
Wind and rain have erased the scars of war on the landscape,

2810
03:16:32.910 --> 03:16:36.660
but still it presents a paradox with a rugged beauty about it.

2811
03:16:38.170 --> 03:16:41.970
Time on the contrary has not healed.

2812
03:16:41.971 --> 03:16:46.080
The scars left on the hearts and bodies of those who fought here.

2813
03:16:48.350 --> 03:16:53.350
There's nothing so brutal as when men point their brutality toward each other.

2814
03:16:54.800 --> 03:16:55.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2815
03:16:55.570 --> 03:17:00.330
<v 0>My plane is rising to take me back to Japan.
I looked down on he,
whoa.</v>

2816
03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:02.440
As a new day is having its beginning,

2817
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:06.070
loneliness and sadness have crept a board.

2818
03:17:08.060 --> 03:17:13.060
My heart holds many unsaid words as I can't put into words,

2819
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:15.650
the fragments of my thoughts and feelings.

2820
03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:17.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2821
03:17:17.310 --> 03:17:20.340
<v 0>Thoughts and feelings that I can't ignore.</v>

2822
03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:23.460
A pain of unreasoning desolation.

2823
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:25.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2824
03:17:25.650 --> 03:17:30.270
<v 0>I'm engulfed by a gray veil of sadness.
I leave with mixed emotions.</v>

2825
03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:33.570
I'm glad that I came while I regretting the return.

2826
03:17:35.010 --> 03:17:35.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2827
03:17:35.490 --> 03:17:39.570
<v 0>Though great distances separate me from this island.
The thought of it,</v>

2828
03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:40.660
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2829
03:17:40.660 --> 03:17:42.310
<v 0>Is always just a heartbeat away.</v>

2830
03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:48.000
I'm determined not to ever forget the man I marched among.

2831
03:17:48.980 --> 03:17:49.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2832
03:17:49.540 --> 03:17:53.440
<v 0>All my tears will not ever wash away.</v>

2833
03:17:53.590 --> 03:17:54.550
The memories.

2834
03:17:57.790 --> 03:18:00.220
Now in the twilight of my years,

2835
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:05.790
all I've got on my yesterdays and a whole arsenal of memories

2836
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:11.920
and hell yes,
I do it again.

2837
03:18:13.940 --> 03:18:17.570
Once a marine,
always a marine.

2838
03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:25.620
That wraps up the books or

2839
03:18:27.810 --> 03:18:32.640
I don't know if you have any thing else you want to say before we wrap this up.

2840
03:18:33.250 --> 03:18:35.580
Uh,
thank you.
Just said it far,
made that

2841
03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:38.953
<v 6>Aye</v>

2842
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:40.670
<v 0>loved the Marines</v>

2843
03:18:41.460 --> 03:18:45.990
<v 6>and uh,
don't know it.
Sometime and</v>

2844
03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:49.150
<v 7>future.
Oh,
John,</v>

2845
03:18:49.151 --> 03:18:53.800
those moraines march through eternity with each other.

2846
03:18:55.210 --> 03:18:59.950
It'd be a home comment.
Thank you.
Thank you sir.

2847
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:03.220
And obviously thanks for coming on.

2848
03:19:04.450 --> 03:19:09.450
More important thanks for your service and your sacrifice for our great nation.

2849
03:19:12.250 --> 03:19:17.250
Well it was an honor to serve you in this great country of ours and God bless

2850
03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:24.550
the soul.
Thank you sir.
Thanks for coming on.
My pleasure.

2851
03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:31.680
And Mr t Fred Harvey has left the building and that was pretty,

2852
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:39.030
pretty incredible and thanks to everyone of you listeners for giving us the

2853
03:19:41.891 --> 03:19:46.750
opportunity to speak to these incredible heroes and share their stories.

2854
03:19:48.100 --> 03:19:52.120
And none of this would be possible without your support.

2855
03:19:52.810 --> 03:19:57.810
So if you do want to support this podcast and actually at the same time you can

2856
03:19:59.921 --> 03:20:04.270
support yourself.
Of course.
That's kind of the way we've set things up.
Now,
Echo,

2857
03:20:04.271 --> 03:20:08.860
perhaps you could show us the way to properly support.
Sure,

2858
03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:10.900
of course.
Be Happy to.
All right.

2859
03:20:10.901 --> 03:20:15.530
First way is origin main.com game.

2860
03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:17.710
So origin.
That's the company,
our company,

2861
03:20:18.430 --> 03:20:21.580
Pete Robert's company in Maine,

2862
03:20:22.270 --> 03:20:25.330
so it's called the origin main.com.
Anyway,
this is where,
okay.

2863
03:20:25.331 --> 03:20:27.640
At first the first thing you want to do to support yourself.

2864
03:20:27.641 --> 03:20:31.870
Very important by the way,
joint supplements,
Krill oil.

2865
03:20:32.170 --> 03:20:34.090
That's to me in everyday stuff.
Actually both,

2866
03:20:34.091 --> 03:20:36.130
all of these are most of these everyday supplements.

2867
03:20:36.131 --> 03:20:40.540
I think there's some that might not necessarily be classified as an everyday

2868
03:20:40.541 --> 03:20:45.200
supplements.
Yeah,
like the monk named not be everyday.
Well for Sir.

2869
03:20:45.570 --> 03:20:48.580
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That that's like maybe could,
maybe could.
Yeah,

2870
03:20:48.581 --> 03:20:52.600
I guess I would say the one that I would say discipline.

2871
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:56.260
You don't need that every day.
Straight up.

2872
03:20:56.261 --> 03:21:00.830
Krill and joint.
Yeah.
Joint Warfarin.
Krill oil.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's daily.
So Chris,

2873
03:21:00.900 --> 03:21:03.070
Super Krill oil to be,
not to split hairs,

2874
03:21:03.071 --> 03:21:07.780
but Jocko Super Krill oil is a Krill oil supplement and when people ask me still

2875
03:21:07.781 --> 03:21:12.190
now like,
hey,
there's fish oil is krill oil?
What's better?
Krill oil is better.

2876
03:21:12.220 --> 03:21:15.130
Not just because I like it better,
factually better.

2877
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:19.240
This is why has more antioxidants,
better absorption,

2878
03:21:19.270 --> 03:21:24.270
better meaning like numbers wise chat and I can go into why you want me to do,

2879
03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:26.860
I will.
I'm not really sure,
but I make it.

2880
03:21:26.861 --> 03:21:31.861
Three is the Omega threes get attached to your phospholipids as opposed to do

2881
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:39.040
inquiry in fish oil.
Don't make it three skid attached to the triglycerides,

2882
03:21:39.460 --> 03:21:40.690
so,
oh,
very.
Yeah.

2883
03:21:40.730 --> 03:21:45.730
That method of delivery delivers a higher percentage of Omega threes.

2884
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:48.590
Boom into your situation,

2885
03:21:49.580 --> 03:21:53.120
decides to stop the thing you had limited science.

2886
03:21:53.330 --> 03:21:58.130
I still don't understand how it works if you know that as a fact,

2887
03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:02.750
unless I'm lying,
which I'm not.
You know how it works as a fact.

2888
03:22:02.751 --> 03:22:06.110
You see what I'm saying?
There's a difference between me saying,
I tell you what,

2889
03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:10.110
I know.
You feel better.
All right.
See,

2890
03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:14.090
that's a very unscientific.
You'd be like,
okay,
I feel better.
Wait a second.

2891
03:22:14.180 --> 03:22:18.830
Honestly,
if I came to you with a book and explain this to you,

2892
03:22:18.831 --> 03:22:23.510
technically,
what would,
what would have more weight?
Me being like,
Hey,

2893
03:22:23.511 --> 03:22:27.470
here's how this works with the phosphorous genic materials moving through your

2894
03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:32.110
membranes.
Or if I was like,
Bro,
you got to try this cause it,
it works.
Yeah.

2895
03:22:32.180 --> 03:22:37.160
Which one would carry more weight with me?
You well know with me,

2896
03:22:37.161 --> 03:22:37.980
I think the book,

2897
03:22:37.980 --> 03:22:42.980
Oh Trump's I because the reason that you're making the action of really good

2898
03:22:43.731 --> 03:22:48.410
point in my opinion,
that one,
you know the whole,
it's like a social proof,
right?

2899
03:22:48.411 --> 03:22:50.180
Social proof.
That's it.
That's like a real thing.

2900
03:22:50.240 --> 03:22:53.660
But you started oil because I told you.
Cause you,
yeah.

2901
03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:57.950
Despite everything that the [inaudible] speaking of not telling a lie,

2902
03:22:58.260 --> 03:23:01.760
I'm saying Nah.
Well you know what?
You're absolutely right.
It actually,

2903
03:23:01.761 --> 03:23:03.980
I'll do you one better.
Actually.
You'll do your cell phone better.

2904
03:23:04.190 --> 03:23:08.360
You told me to take Krill oil.
I took real.
My father in law has been taking me,

2905
03:23:08.390 --> 03:23:12.770
telling me to take krill oil for a decade.
Literally one decade.
No krill oil.

2906
03:23:13.460 --> 03:23:15.000
Does he listen to the podcast?
I hope not.
I don't.

2907
03:23:15.010 --> 03:23:17.080
I'm not to cause otherwise you're in trouble,

2908
03:23:17.081 --> 03:23:20.930
but highly disappointed nonetheless.
I'll tell you what it does.

2909
03:23:20.970 --> 03:23:24.410
It keeps your joints healthy.
Healthy joints are happy.

2910
03:23:24.450 --> 03:23:28.790
Julian's as far as joints being happy because that's near the little jingle

2911
03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:33.230
saying it's true.
It's true.
Anyway,
it's,
yeah.

2912
03:23:33.231 --> 03:23:36.030
This is one of those things where it's like,
it's,
it's like a,
it's a marked.

2913
03:23:36.860 --> 03:23:39.710
When I said it's not the kind of like,
Hey,
I just feel better.
It's,

2914
03:23:40.090 --> 03:23:43.100
it's not that that's really ambiguous in my opinion.
When you're like,
Hey,

2915
03:23:43.101 --> 03:23:45.950
I just feel better,
you know,
I just feel bad.
You're like,
all right bro.

2916
03:23:45.970 --> 03:23:47.960
You don't like,
there's a lot things that can make you feel better.

2917
03:23:48.140 --> 03:23:50.560
Like you get a good TV show on it.
That'll make you feel better.

2918
03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:55.130
Tech technically no.
Technically no.
Technically for most people that are not,

2919
03:23:55.131 --> 03:23:57.770
you bet.
No problem.
Then the last,
you see one of these,
see what I'm saying?

2920
03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:01.640
When you watch a good,
let's say a good TV show.
Okay.

2921
03:24:01.641 --> 03:24:05.310
You Watch Hawaii five o yes.
You're saying you,
if I have,
I mean,

2922
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.823
I'm not gonna speak for you.

2923
03:24:07.010 --> 03:24:12.010
If I watch a TV program the whole time I'm watching a good TV program,

2924
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:14.930
there's something nagging in the back of my mind that's saying like,

2925
03:24:14.931 --> 03:24:17.450
you could be doing something else.
You could be improving yourself.
Yeah,

2926
03:24:17.451 --> 03:24:19.270
you're right.
You could be making progress somewhere.

2927
03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:22.610
You could be prepping for a pot.
You'd be doing another workout.

2928
03:24:22.611 --> 03:24:25.560
He'd be swinging a kettle bell.
I'm not sitting there going,
oh,
Michelle,

2929
03:24:25.650 --> 03:24:28.460
so awesome.
I feel so good about it.
Am I right or wrong?

2930
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:31.280
But you are right for yourself.
I can see how you could think that.

2931
03:24:31.450 --> 03:24:33.650
There's times where you're watching the TV and you're pumped up,

2932
03:24:33.651 --> 03:24:37.040
like saying you're okay.
Yeah,
that's cool.
If it was one of the things,
well,

2933
03:24:37.041 --> 03:24:40.850
here's the thing though.
You Still Watch that TV program.
It wasn't on this week,

2934
03:24:40.851 --> 03:24:43.440
this past week,
because that's the season finale was last week,

2935
03:24:43.441 --> 03:24:46.620
so you know we're off.
I don't know if you sell wash after the incident,

2936
03:24:50.650 --> 03:24:55.620
the incident.
Anyway,
my point is if you,
someone says,

2937
03:24:55.650 --> 03:24:59.250
it makes me feel better or better in the way they say it is a real general way.

2938
03:24:59.251 --> 03:25:03.360
It's less compelling than them saying like me in my situation,

2939
03:25:04.230 --> 03:25:06.750
I'm like,
Hey,
when I woke up freaking,

2940
03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:11.070
I did like practice perfect form in getting up out of my bed for my back,

2941
03:25:11.071 --> 03:25:13.980
not to bother me.
Super Bad to the point of it,

2942
03:25:14.040 --> 03:25:18.090
I actually admitting that it's painful sometimes.
Actually it's not painful.

2943
03:25:18.091 --> 03:25:19.690
It's just like,
you know,
he just got to do it.
Yeah,

2944
03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.080
and my daughter would jump on the back.
All this stuff.
Your backyard

2945
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:30.060
sometimes.
Yeah.
Anyway,
take Krill oil,
boom.

2946
03:25:30.061 --> 03:25:33.210
Six days a week later,
boom and dog jumping on my back.
No problem.

2947
03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:37.860
I fly out of bed like I just warmed up.
Same deal.
See,

2948
03:25:38.130 --> 03:25:41.900
here's the thing,
I didn't look as much into the scientific part of joint.
Poor.

2949
03:25:41.901 --> 03:25:42.960
Fair.
Speaking of science,

2950
03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:47.370
why don't you explain your arm injury before?
Yeah.

2951
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:52.110
Joint Warfare Current.
Yeah,
so this is pretty compelling.

2952
03:25:53.370 --> 03:25:55.830
Very compelling in my opinion too.
So,
so same deal.

2953
03:25:55.831 --> 03:25:58.410
This is an anecdotal situation where,
okay,
all right.

2954
03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:04.260
Some of us may know I tore my bicep tendon off the bone again,

2955
03:26:04.440 --> 03:26:08.400
again,
the other side.
Now,
hey man says that bicep life,
you know,

2956
03:26:09.420 --> 03:26:13.780
it happens anyway.
So yeah,
this was what,
three weeks ago?
Slavery.
Proud.

2957
03:26:14.420 --> 03:26:17.730
The way I made a joke.
I thought I was proud of the joke,

2958
03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:23.300
but the way you explained to me that because your biceps are so massive,

2959
03:26:23.371 --> 03:26:27.330
it puts extra tension on the tendons and that's why they got torn.

2960
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:30.450
Even though you're explaining it like it's your hard done by.

2961
03:26:30.451 --> 03:26:32.610
But the reality is you kind of got a big smile on your face.

2962
03:26:32.611 --> 03:26:35.650
All proud of the guns anyway.
No,

2963
03:26:37.410 --> 03:26:42.230
I'm proud of the joke.
Okay.
Okay.
Anyway,
is that real though?
Oh,

2964
03:26:42.420 --> 03:26:45.930
I think here's a more accurate way of putting it.
So yeah.
So okay.

2965
03:26:45.931 --> 03:26:49.280
When you train biceps,
right?
Typically,
typically then some people did,

2966
03:26:49.290 --> 03:26:50.210
people turn messed up there,

2967
03:26:50.460 --> 03:26:55.460
but typically you don't go all the way down to straight like no elbow mobility

2968
03:26:56.731 --> 03:26:58.720
and then all the way up with a super heavyweight,

2969
03:26:58.770 --> 03:27:01.830
you just can't do that heavy weight unless you train that way the whole time.

2970
03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:07.120
So the corners and training in a way,
you know you can,
you can tell her that and,

2971
03:27:07.121 --> 03:27:12.000
and I dig it.
Yeah.
So when it comes to is there cheating

2972
03:27:15.870 --> 03:27:19.590
is total 90 sweat bodybuilding.
I was bro,
that's real though than that.

2973
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:23.880
So when you develop strength in your biceps with size and all that stuff,

2974
03:27:23.881 --> 03:27:25.140
when you do develop the strength,

2975
03:27:25.141 --> 03:27:29.730
the strength exists mainly on a certain part of the curve of the range of
motion.

2976
03:27:29.731 --> 03:27:30.510
Right.
So,

2977
03:27:30.510 --> 03:27:35.010
but that strength is still there big time your biceps muscle or super strong.

2978
03:27:35.370 --> 03:27:39.030
But when you extend it to this flight you still kind of have that strength in

2979
03:27:39.031 --> 03:27:42.670
the muscle.
But down there it's,
I don't know,

2980
03:27:42.671 --> 03:27:46.750
it's like the stability of the structure just isn't as much.

2981
03:27:46.770 --> 03:27:50.830
And I know this is me.
Was your arm fully extended?
Both.
Both.
Both Times.

2982
03:27:50.831 --> 03:27:55.100
Both Times fully extended and me just,
just a little flex,
flex,

2983
03:27:55.320 --> 03:27:58.600
flex in Rd.
I just going to hard,
you know,
at the time one was in a tournament,

2984
03:27:58.601 --> 03:28:01.330
which obviously makes sense cause you're,
yeah,
if you're at an after it.

2985
03:28:01.331 --> 03:28:04.630
And the other time I was just got too excited training with the training partner

2986
03:28:04.631 --> 03:28:09.520
I haven't trained with for long term escalation.
Yeah,
yeah.
Little fire up,

2987
03:28:10.390 --> 03:28:12.580
we'll say escalation.
Yeah.
But anyway,

2988
03:28:12.610 --> 03:28:16.170
nonetheless tore off the bones.
Bad deal.

2989
03:28:16.180 --> 03:28:18.010
It's not one of those deals where it's like,
oh,

2990
03:28:18.011 --> 03:28:21.340
I pulled my muscle or whatever this is.
So you gotta go in and they cut it open.

2991
03:28:21.341 --> 03:28:25.000
Whenever they stretch it back down,
they staple it or whatever.

2992
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:29.260
Back to the Mamon actually they drill in your bone.
He told me that this is,

2993
03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:32.170
they drill in your bone,
make little holes and they staple it inside the hole.

2994
03:28:32.171 --> 03:28:36.790
They didn't,
they staple it up,
stitch you up.
So I got that less than a week ago,

2995
03:28:36.791 --> 03:28:41.360
by the way.
Less than a week,
literally.
And so I'm like,
all right,

2996
03:28:41.410 --> 03:28:43.690
I gotta,
you know,
I'm out of the game for a little bit.

2997
03:28:43.691 --> 03:28:47.080
I got to get back in as quick as I can.
I upped my dosage of during warfare.

2998
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:50.470
Krill oil stayed the same.
Joint Warfare,
uh,
doubled.
Actually didn't double it.

2999
03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:53.860
Almost double.
I was taking two a day.

3000
03:28:53.920 --> 03:28:58.120
Now I'd take three and in the morning and then two at night.
Right.

3001
03:28:58.140 --> 03:28:58.973
It's almost double.

3002
03:28:59.740 --> 03:29:03.310
So I do have a basis of comparison cause like you said,

3003
03:29:03.311 --> 03:29:07.360
like we know I had the exact same injury,
exact same injury on the other side,

3004
03:29:08.110 --> 03:29:11.530
same surgery,
same everything nine years ago.
By the way,

3005
03:29:12.070 --> 03:29:14.830
I wasn't like I'm older now so that's something too.

3006
03:29:14.950 --> 03:29:18.880
So this recovery like given right now it's like way quicker.

3007
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:22.360
Like this morning while I'm putting it on,
I'm putting on pants or pants.

3008
03:29:22.361 --> 03:29:25.960
By the way,
I literally forgot I had the injury just for a sec.
You know,

3009
03:29:26.010 --> 03:29:28.660
you're just like doing it or whatever.
And we're not even a week out.

3010
03:29:28.890 --> 03:29:29.960
Not even a week yet.

3011
03:29:30.190 --> 03:29:34.530
Cause you were laid up for a while for the other nine years ago when you were

3012
03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:39.460
young buck.
Yep.
Same exact injury.
Boom.
Yeah.
And nothing,

3013
03:29:39.490 --> 03:29:40.030
nothing.

3014
03:29:40.030 --> 03:29:44.980
Nothing is good for that is more compelling than you explaining the science

3015
03:29:44.981 --> 03:29:48.100
behind it.
I am not saying I don't believe the science.

3016
03:29:48.130 --> 03:29:52.330
I'm saying I'm talking to you right now and I've seen this with my own eyes.

3017
03:29:52.331 --> 03:29:56.650
So that's like,
to me it makes more sense.
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3018
03:29:56.940 --> 03:30:00.670
This is,
yeah,
it's,
it's,
to me,
I'm more surprised.
Like my wife gets mad at me.

3019
03:30:00.850 --> 03:30:03.160
It's like,
you're injured,
you're injured,
you're going to this and that.

3020
03:30:03.161 --> 03:30:05.620
Cause I'm just like,
cruising tip off the slang or whatever.

3021
03:30:06.010 --> 03:30:09.580
Who's around lifting weights?
Not with this arm eating nuts.
Actually,

3022
03:30:09.581 --> 03:30:13.660
I'm kind of doing push up,
push up on it.
Um,
but yeah,
it's like,

3023
03:30:14.400 --> 03:30:17.020
like there's no paint,
nothing,
no inflammation.
Well,

3024
03:30:17.530 --> 03:30:22.360
very little inflammation nonetheless.
Um,
you,
I think the,

3025
03:30:23.380 --> 03:30:28.020
like,
what do you call it?
The scientific kind of information versus the pier,
um,

3026
03:30:28.540 --> 03:30:31.480
the approval,
you know,
what do you call,
period.
It's called something.

3027
03:30:31.540 --> 03:30:36.040
I said it earlier.
Then the less like if I tell you like,
oh,
this works for me.

3028
03:30:36.041 --> 03:30:40.460
And like legitimately,
um,
if you're a of the whole deal,

3029
03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:42.410
like a very like,
I don't know if this works,

3030
03:30:42.411 --> 03:30:44.900
then the scientific lake stuff for some reason,

3031
03:30:45.860 --> 03:30:50.210
if there's some reason for me to be telling you like to do something like go to

3032
03:30:50.211 --> 03:30:54.330
a psychic,
then in a terrible,
yeah.
Yeah.
And then I'll be like,
no bro,

3033
03:30:54.331 --> 03:30:55.880
you're dumb for doing that.

3034
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:59.190
And then you see some scientific literature they need have more compelling if it

3035
03:30:59.200 --> 03:31:03.050
song.
No,
I read the scientific literature and obviously as we were putting it all

3036
03:31:03.051 --> 03:31:05.270
together,
it was like,
all right,
let's get the right stuff in there,

3037
03:31:05.271 --> 03:31:09.110
which is stuff that I had used from other supplements in the past.

3038
03:31:09.111 --> 03:31:12.140
But combine it all into one.
There you go.
Boom.
Alright.

3039
03:31:12.260 --> 03:31:15.440
Jocko supplements all still speaking of which discipline,

3040
03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:18.970
this is the one you mentioned that you don't take every day.
See it.

3041
03:31:18.980 --> 03:31:23.720
Who does take it every day?
Dave bird,
Dave,
which is kind of all about it,

3042
03:31:23.780 --> 03:31:26.950
which is kind of something because is one of those smart guys like Dave,

3043
03:31:26.951 --> 03:31:31.220
he's kind of one of these guys who's like you said,
achiever,
that guy,

3044
03:31:31.430 --> 03:31:35.450
he met his brother by the way.
So if he's doing it every day,

3045
03:31:35.451 --> 03:31:38.330
there could be something to do that.
That's what I think is another one of those.

3046
03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:40.250
He,
the way he talked to me about it,

3047
03:31:40.251 --> 03:31:43.790
he got all crazy like big smile and it was like I got it on it.

3048
03:31:44.390 --> 03:31:47.230
I take it at this time at night,
that way I could up and down and it gets me off.

3049
03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:51.080
I was like,
Dang Dave Dang.
Even though micro dose of caffeine.
Yeah,

3050
03:31:51.081 --> 03:31:53.870
no microdose before you go to bed.
Well he's probably used to the caffeine.

3051
03:31:53.871 --> 03:31:55.040
That's why I said,
well no,
he does it.

3052
03:31:55.041 --> 03:31:58.490
He takes it far enough ahead of when his family goes to bed.

3053
03:31:58.910 --> 03:32:03.710
He's like taking it and then he gets a couple hours worth of good solid output.

3054
03:32:03.970 --> 03:32:08.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then when he goes to,
now here's a weird thing about caffeine.

3055
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:12.650
Just as a side note,
I've drank a coffee before and went to sleep.

3056
03:32:12.680 --> 03:32:16.430
It's almost like the coffee put me to sleep.
I'm not like that.
No,

3057
03:32:16.431 --> 03:32:19.980
because you don't drink caffeine.
I don't drink a lot of caffeine.
Breath.

3058
03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.910
You drank like a big cog light blue one.
I drink bro.

3059
03:32:22.911 --> 03:32:26.720
Leave me like during the muster cause we're getting limited sleep during the

3060
03:32:26.721 --> 03:32:30.950
muster.
Even limited for my standards.
I take caffeine.
I mean I take,

3061
03:32:30.951 --> 03:32:33.950
I take this right here,
I take this right here.

3062
03:32:33.951 --> 03:32:38.220
I think Jocko white tea and I take the discipline but you just keep drinking in

3063
03:32:38.230 --> 03:32:39.100
the hydro and a lot of it.

3064
03:32:39.300 --> 03:32:44.300
Yeah cause you know busy our coffee that you figure what 15 per serving

3065
03:32:45.290 --> 03:32:48.690
milligrams and then so like one of those things I was drinking,
no,

3066
03:32:48.720 --> 03:32:51.350
not today but the other day is 300 milligrams of caffeine.

3067
03:32:51.620 --> 03:32:54.800
That's just done so that if you sipped on that like over a two,

3068
03:32:54.801 --> 03:32:59.660
three hour period and just drink the whole thing.
Ultimately you will be no,

3069
03:33:00.020 --> 03:33:02.660
there's times where I've drank like tons of red bull and just been like,

3070
03:33:04.280 --> 03:33:07.490
which is why I tried to taper off the heavy caffeine,

3071
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:09.810
taper off the heavy caffeine.

3072
03:33:09.950 --> 03:33:14.570
That's why I don't make beverages that have 900 milligrams caffeine because it

3073
03:33:14.571 --> 03:33:19.550
does.
It doesn't and you don't need that.
You don't want that.
You started getting,

3074
03:33:19.551 --> 03:33:21.200
it starts,
it starts having other effects.

3075
03:33:21.201 --> 03:33:26.000
You start getting to like you talk too much.
Right.
You talked too much.

3076
03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:27.860
Actually speaking of talking too much,

3077
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:32.030
I just met someone that came to roll and they were like,
oh yeah,
you know,

3078
03:33:32.031 --> 03:33:34.700
it's really good to meet you because I listen to podcasts.
He's like,
cool.

3079
03:33:34.701 --> 03:33:36.290
And then we rolled in,
we talked a little bit and he's like,

3080
03:33:36.890 --> 03:33:40.170
you're just like on the podcast.
And I said,
well,
I mean,
yeah,

3081
03:33:40.171 --> 03:33:42.840
I mean it's just we're hitting record as we discuss things.

3082
03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:47.490
And then I said probably the biggest difference between me on the podcast and me

3083
03:33:47.491 --> 03:33:51.540
and real life is that in real life,
I don't,

3084
03:33:51.630 --> 03:33:53.610
in the podcast I talk the whole time.

3085
03:33:53.700 --> 03:33:58.670
And in real life I actually don't talk very much.
I talk a lot less,
I should say.

3086
03:33:59.590 --> 03:34:02.280
Yeah.
Especially with people.
I don't know what people,
I don't know.

3087
03:34:02.281 --> 03:34:05.280
I'm not very conversational when I know someone of them.
Cool.
Talk.

3088
03:34:05.281 --> 03:34:10.281
But so if you put 200 milligrams of caffeine rather than 15 he'd be talking to a

3089
03:34:11.140 --> 03:34:16.020
lot your whole thing.
Well,
it would be making me act out of character.

3090
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:20.220
It'd be,
it'd be influencing me in a negative way.
In a negative way,
I believe.

3091
03:34:20.420 --> 03:34:24.210
Yeah.
But if you can just get in the zone.
Yeah.
It sharpens the mind.
I mean,

3092
03:34:24.211 --> 03:34:28.080
caffeine is proven,
proven to sharpen you up.

3093
03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:32.850
So anyways,
to each his own,
you know,
I think most people who like caffeine,

3094
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:36.450
like coffee and stuff,
like they liked that and that's what,
that's one thing.

3095
03:34:36.451 --> 03:34:40.350
If you,
if you know you might need more discipline,
you might need more caffeine.

3096
03:34:40.351 --> 03:34:44.010
They get feel it if you're not,
if you're used to it,
if you have a,

3097
03:34:44.011 --> 03:34:48.270
what's that tolerance,
low tolerances or if high telling him through,
but yeah,

3098
03:34:48.271 --> 03:34:51.090
and deal with face it.
Discipline Jocko white tea.
That's not why you drinking.

3099
03:34:51.091 --> 03:34:55.490
You don't drink it.
That's not why.
That's you'll include the caffeine,

3100
03:34:55.570 --> 03:34:58.170
the caffeine,
definitely.
It's a little microbus get you,

3101
03:34:58.260 --> 03:35:00.810
get you rocking and rolling.
But yeah,
that's good.
Discipline.

3102
03:35:00.840 --> 03:35:04.000
Cognitive enhancement.
That's what you're going to get for free.

3103
03:35:04.001 --> 03:35:08.970
You do some stuff,
stuff that needs braid output.
That's when you take it.

3104
03:35:08.971 --> 03:35:10.110
That's what I take it.
That's what good.

3105
03:35:10.290 --> 03:35:14.270
That's when good deal Dave takes it and that's when Jocko takes it all.

3106
03:35:14.271 --> 03:35:16.740
So milk,
this is

3107
03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:19.410
protein powder,

3108
03:35:19.650 --> 03:35:24.090
but to call it protein powders kind of discern a disservice for sure.

3109
03:35:24.130 --> 03:35:27.780
Cause it's just go with mold.
Here's the thing though,
I don't,

3110
03:35:27.870 --> 03:35:31.020
we don't want someone I person,
I know I'll speak for myself.

3111
03:35:31.021 --> 03:35:33.870
I don't want someone to hear,
hey mark,
Hey,
what is that?
Okay.
Tastes good.

3112
03:35:33.871 --> 03:35:36.480
All this stuff.
But like,
you know,
there's less stuff that tastes good.

3113
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:42.040
You will get good protein from milk.
Yes.
Your will to do it.

3114
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:45.960
All that.
And there's probiotics.
Oh no kidding.
See it and see what's good.

3115
03:35:46.020 --> 03:35:49.650
What doesn't.
Probiotics.
Okay.
Maybe for you it's not like this.

3116
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:53.800
When I hear probiotics,
I always think like,
oh,
that's something that,
um,

3117
03:35:55.350 --> 03:35:57.900
you know,
someone's like,
oh,
you gotta take your probiotics.
Right.

3118
03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:01.470
It's not something,
you know,
for me it's like,
oh,
I'm gonna drink protein.

3119
03:36:01.471 --> 03:36:05.820
Good probiotic says I'm not worried about that.
But,
so I never,

3120
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:08.970
I've taken them a couple times before,
but there's probiotics in it.

3121
03:36:09.060 --> 03:36:12.870
And so now I realize like,
I feel good,
like my gut feels good.

3122
03:36:12.871 --> 03:36:15.090
So maybe there's something to that probiotic activity.

3123
03:36:16.210 --> 03:36:19.440
When you say maybe I'm not like that.
You're correct.
And I'm not like that.

3124
03:36:19.441 --> 03:36:24.360
Probiotics are good antibiotic.
Well antibiotics are good,
but,
and

3125
03:36:26.730 --> 03:36:30.450
so probiotics are like their probiotic

3126
03:36:32.410 --> 03:36:36.430
Welson
basically like your Gut biome,
right?

3127
03:36:36.690 --> 03:36:39.790
It promotes healthy,
healthy bacteria,
all this stuff.
And you're thinking proud.

3128
03:36:40.080 --> 03:36:42.950
It's a huge deal actually.
I know,
I know.
And now,

3129
03:36:42.980 --> 03:36:45.790
now I'm starting to realize that I started to realize I've been rolling for 46

3130
03:36:45.791 --> 03:36:50.590
years.
It's Kinda like,
it's Kinda like if I have like a metaphor right now,

3131
03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:55.660
if I have the,
you're the key to life,
right?
The whole,
the answer to life,

3132
03:36:56.470 --> 03:36:59.080
right?
What is the meaning of life and have it,
I have been a man.
I'm going to,

3133
03:36:59.081 --> 03:37:00.280
I'm about to tell you right?

3134
03:37:01.870 --> 03:37:05.230
But you have your plugs in so you can't hear me.
I still told you.

3135
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:07.810
But you can't get in your brain because you have your foot.
Well,

3136
03:37:07.811 --> 03:37:10.870
you put that probiotics,
boom takes earplugs out.
Boom.
You got it in your brain.

3137
03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:15.550
Same thing.
The same exact thing.
Except I own two or an advertisement.

3138
03:37:15.551 --> 03:37:19.250
I think that's just incredible.
Maybe I will.

3139
03:37:20.050 --> 03:37:23.770
It's called milk.
And it is mint chocolate,

3140
03:37:24.910 --> 03:37:27.550
peanut butter,
peanut,
peanut butter,
chocolates,
comments,

3141
03:37:27.900 --> 03:37:31.780
and then it's just going to do,
I think we're good on chocolate.

3142
03:37:31.781 --> 03:37:33.920
Just straight chocolate because you were good.

3143
03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:39.120
Like I've got the sample and I had it this weekend and and yes it is g o double

3144
03:37:39.661 --> 03:37:43.150
d.
Good.
Well I think the chocolate is kind of the staple,
right?

3145
03:37:43.170 --> 03:37:47.160
Is it is and that's why it seems a little while because it's hard to nail.
It

3146
03:37:49.350 --> 03:37:53.360
tastes like chocolate and not die and chocolate or something like
it.

3147
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:57.190
Diet,
anything.
Cool.

3148
03:37:57.220 --> 03:38:00.520
Well nonetheless be that look up for that and that is if you're taking protein

3149
03:38:00.521 --> 03:38:03.370
powder and they're like,
hey,
I want some good quality protein powder.

3150
03:38:04.090 --> 03:38:08.470
Forget about the term protein powder because that gives you the idea that this

3151
03:38:08.471 --> 03:38:11.860
is going to taste like crap and this is,
this is the miracle.

3152
03:38:12.070 --> 03:38:16.980
It tastes delicious and it tastes delicious and it's got no sugar in it.
Yeah.

3153
03:38:17.730 --> 03:38:22.510
Yeah.
That's awesome.
Very cool.
Awesome.
Whatever it is.
I have a gram,
it's got,

3154
03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:27.850
I might have like a gram,
we'll put it this way.
It's not full with sugar.

3155
03:38:27.851 --> 03:38:32.710
Like the old school mega math 5 million.
Oh yeah.
In the big dog knockoff bag.

3156
03:38:32.711 --> 03:38:35.410
Remember that?
Remember that?
Oh yeah,
that was good.

3157
03:38:35.411 --> 03:38:39.540
That tastes it kinda good with monk fruit.
Yeah,
that's what that,

3158
03:38:39.580 --> 03:38:42.100
so if you're wondering like well how does it taste?

3159
03:38:42.101 --> 03:38:45.760
Not like the artificial sweeteners that people serve up,
which tastes nasty.

3160
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:49.510
Like no matter what it tastes like crap.
It's monkfruit creamy.

3161
03:38:49.900 --> 03:38:53.530
I mean that's a weird question but like monk fruit because it doesn't taste
like,

3162
03:38:53.531 --> 03:38:57.490
you know how you use like a,
um,
I guess,
you know,
like a sweetener.

3163
03:38:57.491 --> 03:39:00.580
It has a fruity sweet and thing like the chocolate mint.

3164
03:39:00.610 --> 03:39:02.470
I don't know what it looks like,
its raw form,

3165
03:39:02.860 --> 03:39:04.720
but I know that it tastes freaking delicious.

3166
03:39:04.930 --> 03:39:08.380
I'm gonna look into that one and I will report back.
Speaking of reporting back,

3167
03:39:09.850 --> 03:39:11.410
if in fact you want to look at it this way,

3168
03:39:11.411 --> 03:39:15.040
I am reporting back to the three people this week.
They asked me what gee,

3169
03:39:15.041 --> 03:39:18.970
should I get when I started Jujitsu.
So I know to most of us,

3170
03:39:18.971 --> 03:39:22.630
this is obvious right now,
but I will answer this question in anyway.

3171
03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:26.590
It is an origin,
Geeky and rash guard.
If you're doing it,
don't keep by the way,

3172
03:39:27.130 --> 03:39:30.880
but you get an origin get,
you'd get the origin g for many reasons.

3173
03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:33.520
Not only because it's the best seat,

3174
03:39:33.521 --> 03:39:36.740
but because it's made in America as well and there's plenty options on there.

3175
03:39:36.741 --> 03:39:39.500
So me saying get an orange gene.
It's not just one origin.
Gee,

3176
03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:43.580
I guess technically in a way you just get if it's an orgy as good and,

3177
03:39:43.581 --> 03:39:47.900
but you have many different options within the brand of origin.
Jeez.

3178
03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:49.370
So go there.
Like I said,

3179
03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:51.950
origin main.com that's where you get everything made in America.

3180
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:55.640
Made in America from the dirt to the shirt.
Meaning,

3181
03:39:56.900 --> 03:39:59.570
cause if you don't really know what that means,
it might not make as much sense.

3182
03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:02.090
But when you do know what I mean to,
we'll make sense.
This is what it means.

3183
03:40:02.840 --> 03:40:07.760
The cotton is grown from America or in America from the dirt.
Get it.

3184
03:40:07.770 --> 03:40:11.840
No.
Then on the shirt at the end,
we're technically,
it's a g or whatever,

3185
03:40:11.841 --> 03:40:15.980
whatever you get,
boom.
Anyway.
Made America everything.
Origin main.com.
Also

3186
03:40:17.930 --> 03:40:22.630
there's an immersion camp.
Jujitsu immersion camp filling up by the way.
Yeah.

3187
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:26.200
Showing up quick.
He'll get on that.
Well the space is big,
so which is good.
The,

3188
03:40:26.260 --> 03:40:31.160
yeah.
Yeah.
The jujitsu at them at the muster was how big.
That was.

3189
03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:36.140
Good man.
And he was still not big enough,
I think.
Yeah.

3190
03:40:36.170 --> 03:40:39.130
We're ready to order more match,
but yeah,
it was gonna be awesome.
Yeah.

3191
03:40:40.430 --> 03:40:42.980
I sort of have an announcement to make on that too.
All right.
You know,

3192
03:40:42.981 --> 03:40:47.870
he's coming up to that camp.
They don't meet uh,
a guy by the name of Dean lister.

3193
03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:51.980
Yay.
Okay.
Good.
The knowledge.
Exactly.

3194
03:40:52.130 --> 03:40:55.160
Just to just straight knowledge and if you come up,

3195
03:40:55.220 --> 03:40:59.880
you get a chance to learn from dean lister and yeah.

3196
03:40:59.930 --> 03:41:03.320
That's as good as it's gonna get.
Yeah.
He was one of those guys,

3197
03:41:03.321 --> 03:41:08.210
like kind of those wizard types.
Yeah.
Like I remember it and grind it out.

3198
03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:12.830
Not even a kind of like thing.
So straight up he's got,
he's got a,

3199
03:41:13.370 --> 03:41:17.450
he's got a,
um,
uh,
a gift,

3200
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:21.860
like a legit gift that people do not have you ever,

3201
03:41:21.861 --> 03:41:24.650
and I'm not even asking who do you have you ever,

3202
03:41:24.651 --> 03:41:26.380
cause I know you have probably many times what you need,

3203
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:30.500
you're asked dean of question about like this problem that you're having and

3204
03:41:30.501 --> 03:41:33.980
you're having it because the guy who's doing it to you this too is just super

3205
03:41:33.981 --> 03:41:36.920
good,
but you're having this problem and you're kind of halfway thinking,

3206
03:41:37.220 --> 03:41:40.250
actually more than halfway thinking this is not really an answerable question,

3207
03:41:40.251 --> 03:41:42.020
but whatever the more info I have in the ass for him.

3208
03:41:42.020 --> 03:41:44.720
And then he solves your problem and you're like,
oh,

3209
03:41:44.721 --> 03:41:47.390
have you been thinking about this the whole time?
You know,

3210
03:41:47.391 --> 03:41:50.630
all this Jujitsu stuff or whatever while all of us have been living life kind of

3211
03:41:50.631 --> 03:41:55.610
thing.
That's what it seems like.
He taught something the other day and it's from,

3212
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:57.820
Oh,
you know,
I used a crucifix a lot.
Sure.

3213
03:41:57.950 --> 03:42:02.570
So he taught something from the crucifix that I'd never saw before.

3214
03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:06.110
Never thought of.
And he did it like it was just like,
you know,

3215
03:42:06.140 --> 03:42:08.570
like taking a breath.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
when you get this,
you do this.

3216
03:42:08.930 --> 03:42:13.010
And I'm like,
are you serious?
I've been training with you for 20,
um,

3217
03:42:13.250 --> 03:42:16.910
23 years and you never maybe gave me a heads up on that.
And Yeah.

3218
03:42:17.900 --> 03:42:21.320
And the reason is,
the reason is there's so much in his brain,

3219
03:42:21.860 --> 03:42:23.060
there's so much that discern his brain.

3220
03:42:23.060 --> 03:42:27.050
He can't even figure out what to tell you unless you come to him with a problem.

3221
03:42:27.051 --> 03:42:29.180
That's why it's great that when you,
if you're coming to the immersion camp,

3222
03:42:29.181 --> 03:42:31.560
come with problems for dean.
Come with,

3223
03:42:31.561 --> 03:42:34.080
come with questions for dean cause that's what you want.

3224
03:42:34.081 --> 03:42:36.210
And then you can draw the answers out that you need from him.

3225
03:42:36.211 --> 03:42:39.180
Cause there's too much.
You can't download everything from his brain.
You can't,

3226
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:44.210
it's not like he's going to teach you like you learned this one thing.
No,
you,

3227
03:42:44.220 --> 03:42:47.880
you're going to have to bring questions to him that then he'll solve problems

3228
03:42:47.881 --> 03:42:52.590
for you.
That's what I,
real quick,
did you get to camp uh,
immersion camp?
Yes.

3229
03:42:52.620 --> 03:42:56.190
26 September through May 2nd did you say that already?
Oh,
sorry.

3230
03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:58.470
I guess I said it wrong.
End of August.
Oh good.

3231
03:42:58.620 --> 03:43:01.200
You know I remember that because that is my son's birthday.

3232
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:05.550
August one August 26 through September 2nd two sessions.

3233
03:43:06.600 --> 03:43:09.100
Or you can say for the whole set of the whole time.
The whole deal.
Yeah,
man.

3234
03:43:09.390 --> 03:43:13.480
Good deal.
Good.
Register at a register at origin.
May Not call late.

3235
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:16.770
He's going Leif Babin.
Dave Berg.
Good deal,
Dave.
Yep.

3236
03:43:17.100 --> 03:43:21.780
I'm going Jj.
Easy.
I think it's going.
How's this dean?

3237
03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:25.560
When I got my surgery last week,
I'm going in for my surgery.
Dean is,

3238
03:43:25.561 --> 03:43:28.710
they're just coming out of his surgery,
so how is he going to be as far as,

3239
03:43:29.310 --> 03:43:31.290
he won't be able to go roll hard,

3240
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:35.610
but yesterday I trained yesterday just a little in house,

3241
03:43:35.611 --> 03:43:37.080
little core group of guys.

3242
03:43:37.081 --> 03:43:41.140
We came and trained and dean came and coached and he was showing moves.
Yeah.

3243
03:43:41.150 --> 03:43:46.120
Yeah.
So this is,
yeah,
he was putting crash.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3244
03:43:46.220 --> 03:43:50.490
I'll,
I'll be there kind of on the,
on the you'll be on the,
yeah,
on the fence.

3245
03:43:50.490 --> 03:43:54.180
They're like,
I rolled with Pete,
um,
like,

3246
03:43:54.260 --> 03:43:56.610
you know where before I got my surgery,

3247
03:43:56.611 --> 03:44:00.660
but my bicep was Dan and I just put my hand like this.
I couldn't,
can eat,

3248
03:44:00.661 --> 03:44:05.280
just basically can't pull,
I can't name it.
This is my injury.
I said I can't pull,

3249
03:44:05.430 --> 03:44:08.430
you just have to be careful.
Yeah.
So I could do a lot of that kind of rolling,

3250
03:44:08.460 --> 03:44:11.820
but I got it.
It's,
it's hard.
I can't roll probably with like,
you know,

3251
03:44:11.821 --> 03:44:16.400
like a level 12 and less experience or something like that I'll be with,

3252
03:44:16.410 --> 03:44:19.020
you know,
you can't roll with me.
I'll roll with Pete.
That's all.

3253
03:44:19.021 --> 03:44:23.460
I basically just trust Pete.
That's it.
Pretty one.
But yeah,

3254
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:27.030
go to that.
That'd be fun.
Don't worry.
What level did you see your ad?

3255
03:44:27.270 --> 03:44:28.930
Even if you're at literally level zero?

3256
03:44:29.020 --> 03:44:32.100
We had level level zero people came last year,
like a burst.

3257
03:44:32.120 --> 03:44:34.740
Just a group of them too,
for sure.
It's good for me to get it.

3258
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:39.700
Say I'll come and get it all.

3264
03:45:00.181 --> 03:45:04.380

these can be dangerous Rao swinging around big cannon balls.
Yeah,
sure.

3265
03:45:05.310 --> 03:45:08.720
Can have a mishap.
Yeah,

So when I put on an expert,

3284
03:46:18.161 --> 03:46:21.700
maybe that's the one that really you're waiting for rather than sifting through

3285
03:46:21.701 --> 03:46:24.460
all the episodes and then 15 through the episode,
which is three,

3286
03:46:24.461 --> 03:46:27.670
four hours long sometimes,
and then,
oh,
there it is.

3287
03:46:27.671 --> 03:46:29.920
And then listening to it kind of thing.
You know,

3288
03:46:30.220 --> 03:46:32.990
I don't know how practical that is sometimes.
So boom,

3289
03:46:32.991 --> 03:46:35.560
I try to put all the excerpts,
all the points,
all the significant points.

3290
03:46:35.561 --> 03:46:38.220
And there's a lot,
by the way,
that Jocko makes,

3291
03:46:38.640 --> 03:46:40.990
had to put them in excerpts on the youtube channel.

3292
03:46:41.230 --> 03:46:43.060
Maybe that's the one you were looking for.
It's a good witness,

3293
03:46:43.100 --> 03:46:45.820
a good reason to subscribe in my opinion.
So yeah,
do that.

3294
03:46:45.850 --> 03:46:49.300
Good way to support it as well.
Also,
chocolate is a store.

3295
03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:53.920
It's called Jocko Star,
so let me ask you this,
not you,
Jocko.

3296
03:46:54.130 --> 03:46:58.960
That's the people.
Have you ever looked at Jocko shirt and been like,

3297
03:46:58.961 --> 03:46:59.710
you know what?

3298
03:46:59.710 --> 03:47:04.060
I wish I had that shirt or have you ever looked at a shirt that I wear that says

3299
03:47:04.061 --> 03:47:06.880
discipline equals freedom.
If you ever looked at that and said,
Dang,

3300
03:47:07.570 --> 03:47:10.960
I want that shirt.
Guess what?
This place you can get,

3301
03:47:11.140 --> 03:47:14.170
it's called Jocko store.com that's where you can get it.

3302
03:47:14.350 --> 03:47:16.390
Discipline equals freedom.
Get after it shirt.

3303
03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:18.670
The actual shirt that Jack was wearing right now,

3304
03:47:18.720 --> 03:47:20.710
literally the one that Jack was wearing right now,

3305
03:47:20.740 --> 03:47:23.170
you can get that shirt represent big time.

3306
03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:25.570
Good way to support and support yourself.

3307
03:47:25.571 --> 03:47:30.520
There's also rash guards and stuff on their patches.
Hoodies,
hats,

3308
03:47:30.521 --> 03:47:35.170
new hats.
By the way,
trucker hat,
trucker hats had left truck.
Yeah,
the flex it.

3309
03:47:35.171 --> 03:47:38.050
I thought you'd like to flex it is,
I don't like flex.
It actually,

3310
03:47:38.680 --> 03:47:39.430
but I know that's,

3311
03:47:39.430 --> 03:47:43.420
that's probably the preferred hat in the population of the of the world is the

3312
03:47:43.421 --> 03:47:46.340
flex fit.
Yeah.
I think select trucker hats.
Old School Burke.

3313
03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:51.260
Have you ever worn a flex fit hat?
Yes.
Yes.
I'll straight up.

3314
03:47:52.040 --> 03:47:55.960
You don't like that one?
You don't like the convenience of this?
The flex fit,

3315
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:57.500
I guess if you have the snap back,

3316
03:47:57.501 --> 03:47:59.800
you just put it on one side and not with your head gets bigger.

3317
03:47:59.860 --> 03:48:03.490
My head does not get bigger or smaller on a day.
Really?

3318
03:48:03.491 --> 03:48:06.760
Cause after we roll sometimes I feel like your head's kind of bigger.
No,

3319
03:48:06.761 --> 03:48:10.520
I think that just made,
it might be the way you feel.
Mine's just,

3320
03:48:13.080 --> 03:48:14.650
I get it.
None the less.

3321
03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:18.070
Both types of hats on their women's stuff on there as well.

3322
03:48:18.071 --> 03:48:20.620
I'm putting tank tops on there,
so look,
be on the lookout for that.

3323
03:48:20.830 --> 03:48:23.530
Like for for dudes tank tops.
There's,
yeah,

3324
03:48:23.531 --> 03:48:27.150
there's already women's tank tops on there,
so we're going to get dudes going.

3325
03:48:27.260 --> 03:48:31.910
Going to school.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly right.
Boom.
Summer,
summertime.
Yeah,
right.

3326
03:48:32.420 --> 03:48:35.450
Boom.
Shot the gun,
Sun's out.
Guns out.
Beans out.

3327
03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:39.680
Beanies that are in for just in time for summer.
All good.
Um,
but you know,

3328
03:48:39.681 --> 03:48:43.250
some places like Alaska summertime's called to,
so boom,
get the beanie.

3329
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:48.140
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

3330
03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:52.580
it's an album jockos album on iTunes with tracks,

3331
03:48:52.730 --> 03:48:56.840
Jocko tracks in his what is not Jocko singing.
It's chocolate talking to you.

3332
03:48:56.841 --> 03:49:00.020
Every track has chocolate talking to you.
And what he's telling you,

3333
03:49:00.021 --> 03:49:04.190
his reasons why you shouldn't give in to the weakness that you will be giving

3334
03:49:04.191 --> 03:49:05.780
into sometimes if you don't have this,

3335
03:49:06.080 --> 03:49:08.750
you will be giving into this weakness on your path,

3336
03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:13.970
on your campaign against weakness,
on the path,
on the war path.

3337
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:19.370
We're all on the path by the way,
are we not?
Oh,
so yeah.
Well here's the thing.

3338
03:49:19.371 --> 03:49:24.050
I think you're kind of a leader on this path.
I kind of evaluated this.
Okay.

3339
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:27.740
No and,
and I'm,
I was into working out before I get it,
you know,

3340
03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:31.790
but it's the kind of where like if I didn't feel like working out,

3341
03:49:31.880 --> 03:49:35.900
it's like I just kind of won't work out.
I'll do it tomorrow cause I will.

3342
03:49:35.901 --> 03:49:37.910
And I would usually,
you know,
kind of thing.

3343
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:43.330
But when you kind of quantify it as this path and when,

3344
03:49:43.430 --> 03:49:46.760
when when the the term campaign against weakness,

3345
03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:48.120
the weakness kind of got introduced to,

3346
03:49:48.130 --> 03:49:50.780
that's a really good thing too because generally speaking,

3347
03:49:51.980 --> 03:49:55.720
that's really what jams you up in,
in my opinion,
in my experience where yeah,

3348
03:49:55.721 --> 03:49:57.980
if I don't feel like doing it right,
I don't feel like doing it.

3349
03:49:58.010 --> 03:50:00.560
That's a weakness,
right?
If I say,
oh number do cause I don't feel like it,

3350
03:50:00.561 --> 03:50:03.500
then you go through life not feeling like doing stuff and not doing it and most

3351
03:50:03.501 --> 03:50:05.180
of the time we don't feel like it.
Especially as you get older,

3352
03:50:05.181 --> 03:50:07.700
especially as you take on other responsibilities.

3353
03:50:08.120 --> 03:50:13.120
But if you make it a point to understand that I'm gunna consciously not feel

3354
03:50:13.941 --> 03:50:16.430
like doing something,
understanding that it needs to be done,

3355
03:50:17.210 --> 03:50:19.220
then kind of fight that kind of weakness there.

3356
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:26.490
That's a bath I'm talking about and this will help you with that.
Yeah.
Oh sorry.

3357
03:50:26.540 --> 03:50:29.190
Yeah.
Back to the psychological worker.
I think you wrapped it up nicely

3358
03:50:31.010 --> 03:50:35.210
to me.
It's more to understand that because the more that in my opinion or in my

3359
03:50:35.211 --> 03:50:38.420
experience,
the more I understood that the more like kind of affective,

3360
03:50:38.480 --> 03:50:40.970
you know you are in staying on this path.
So anyway,

3361
03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:43.580
when you reach like a little small point of weakness,

3362
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:47.690
you listen to this album specific track that is designated for that weakness,

3363
03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:52.910
hundred percent hundred percent you will not give in to that weakness.

3364
03:50:53.420 --> 03:50:56.420
That's good.
Psychological warfare.
We need to make a second album.

3365
03:50:56.880 --> 03:50:58.700
People need to ask what they want to hear,

3366
03:50:59.510 --> 03:51:01.720
what moments of weakness and need to be overcome.
Yeah.

3367
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:04.200
I know had some for like smoking.
Yeah.

3368
03:51:05.060 --> 03:51:09.940
Some for a drinking.
Drinking would be good on check.
Yeah,
it is.

3369
03:51:11.120 --> 03:51:16.120
The way it was born was because of a weakness that I specifically specifically

3370
03:51:16.221 --> 03:51:21.200
had like something that it kind of like got to me late,
you know like later on,

3371
03:51:21.260 --> 03:51:23.420
like during the,
at the time I'm like,
Hey,
whatever.

3372
03:51:23.421 --> 03:51:26.250
Or why should I put this much pressure on my shell itself is that,

3373
03:51:26.310 --> 03:51:29.690
<v 2>you know,
is that healthy?
You ever do that?
None of you,
I know you don't do that.</v>

3374
03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:31.291
Come on,
let's face it.

3375
03:51:31.291 --> 03:51:33.840
It's kind of like one of those things where it's like it's a justification,

3376
03:51:33.841 --> 03:51:37.770
but it's like,
ah,
like hey,
you shouldn't put so much pressure on yourself,

3377
03:51:37.771 --> 03:51:40.530
you know,
don't add this stress.
Hey,
life is stressful.

3378
03:51:40.560 --> 03:51:43.440
Don't add more stress like this.
You don't want to,
when it's like,

3379
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:49.500
it's just an excuse and my stress,

3380
03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:54.090
it's true sound effect thing.
Are you ready?
So Jocko white tea,

3381
03:51:54.750 --> 03:51:59.750
obviously for a long time we've had tea bags that you can get a,

3382
03:52:00.420 --> 03:52:03.450
what's that called?
Dry Tea is what it's called.
Jocko.

3383
03:52:03.451 --> 03:52:06.390
White tea available on Amazon.
Real tasty

3384
03:52:07.890 --> 03:52:09.030
and good for you.

3385
03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:13.920
And we just got it made and put into cans.
So here we go.

3386
03:52:13.921 --> 03:52:17.310
Sound effects.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
This is a Jocko white tea opening.

3387
03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:25.020
Oh,
there you go.
So now you can get Jocko white.
Tina can,
it is

3388
03:52:26.970 --> 03:52:30.590
delicious and it's good for you.
And you know,

3389
03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:33.780
even if even if you don't like the taste,
even if you don't play like that,

3390
03:52:33.781 --> 03:52:37.070
it's good for you.
You will like the fact that after you drank one can,

3391
03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:41.520
you'll be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds minimum minimum.

3392
03:52:41.521 --> 03:52:45.570
That's the minimum and it's been proven scientifically backwards and forwards.

3393
03:52:45.571 --> 03:52:50.090
Double Blind,
placebo,
placebo,
whatever you want to call it.
Yeah,
John,
it's,

3394
03:52:50.091 --> 03:52:53.700
it's available only Amazon.
Eventually we'll get it everywhere.
That's the goal.

3395
03:52:53.701 --> 03:52:56.760
But right now it's available on Amazon because that's the quickest way to get it

3396
03:52:56.761 --> 03:53:01.470
out to everyone.
So there you go.
Get it.
Victory and a can organic.

3397
03:53:01.471 --> 03:53:02.304
Did I tell you that?

3398
03:53:02.650 --> 03:53:07.650
Certified organic certified organic in the beginning and just because I'm

3399
03:53:08.761 --> 03:53:10.340
impressed.
No Gmos,
no,

3400
03:53:10.500 --> 03:53:15.500
no reason to go and drink a drink that's going to have filled with a bunch of

3401
03:53:16.021 --> 03:53:19.740
stuff that you don't want your body agree.
Just drink Jocko white tea.
All right,

3402
03:53:19.741 --> 03:53:20.550
books.

3403
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:25.550
We've got the way the warrior kids series and I got um,

3404
03:53:26.520 --> 03:53:29.430
here's just a little note.
A kid,

3405
03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:33.330
a guy wrote my eight year old who read your Breck way of the warrior care to in

3406
03:53:33.331 --> 03:53:35.640
January of 2018.
Since then he's gone.

3407
03:53:35.641 --> 03:53:40.641
Beast mode runs 1.3 kilometers most mornings before school and 2.6 kilometers on

3408
03:53:42.301 --> 03:53:45.690
the weekends.
He trains,
plays and enjoys life.
Since reading your book,

3409
03:53:46.050 --> 03:53:50.700
his room was immaculately tidy.
Your book switched something in him.

3410
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:53.730
He is self motivated and strives to achieve.

3411
03:53:53.970 --> 03:53:58.770
We talk about 1% in life and doing the small things well in school and sports.

3412
03:53:59.610 --> 03:54:04.500
Thanks for your service and the book.
So there you go.
No big deal,
right?

3413
03:54:04.530 --> 03:54:08.520
Can you imagine that?
That's freaking awesome.
I love this room is immaculate.

3414
03:54:09.150 --> 03:54:11.730
He's on the path.
You know the path.

3415
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:17.280
So pick up way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
Get your kid on the path.

3416
03:54:18.060 --> 03:54:21.900
If you want to support a war,
your kid named Aiden that's making things happen.

3417
03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:24.820
Go to Irish ranch.com

3418
03:54:25.060 --> 03:54:28.960
<v 0>and get some of the soap that he makes on his farm from goat milk.</v>

3419
03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:33.580
He makes Jocko soap so you can stay clean.

3420
03:54:34.390 --> 03:54:38.650
Don't forget about the discipline equals freedom field manual.
Of course.

3421
03:54:39.720 --> 03:54:41.410
Um,
this was awesome.

3422
03:54:41.470 --> 03:54:46.000
I was at the muster and we're doing PT.
It's for whenever,

3423
03:54:46.001 --> 03:54:47.860
four 35 in the morning or something.

3424
03:54:48.250 --> 03:54:53.250
And this woman comes up to me and she's a little older and she just looks at me

3425
03:54:55.391 --> 03:54:58.150
and she's like,
can I tell you something though?
That look was on her face.

3426
03:54:58.151 --> 03:55:00.580
And so I gave her the nod of like,
go ahead and tell me.
And she's like,

3427
03:55:00.610 --> 03:55:02.890
it was November 7th,

3428
03:55:02.890 --> 03:55:07.890
2017 and I was at Sam's Club and I saw this book as Black Book and I never saw a

3429
03:55:11.891 --> 03:55:16.891
book like that and I picked it up and looked at it and said this,

3430
03:55:18.251 --> 03:55:19.300
I've never seen anything like this.

3431
03:55:19.360 --> 03:55:24.360
She bought it and since that time that she's lost 23 pounds and she said she's

3432
03:55:26.471 --> 03:55:29.470
got her life back.
Boom.
That's awesome.

3433
03:55:29.860 --> 03:55:33.160
So you know who you are out there,
so thank you for letting me know that.

3434
03:55:33.161 --> 03:55:37.480
That was a very cool story to hear and I appreciate that feedback.

3435
03:55:37.540 --> 03:55:41.950
That's the discipline equals freedom field manual thoughts and actions both

3436
03:55:41.951 --> 03:55:45.070
inside.
If you want the audio version of that,

3437
03:55:45.071 --> 03:55:48.370
which people still ask me every single day,
you can't get it on audible.

3438
03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:53.230
It's not on audible.
It's on Amazon music,
iTunes,

3439
03:55:53.231 --> 03:55:53.741
Google play,

3440
03:55:53.741 --> 03:55:58.360
and other MP3 platforms as an album with tracks.

3441
03:55:59.440 --> 03:56:03.550
Also for leadership.
Of course,
there's the first book,
extreme ownership,

3442
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:06.940
the leadership book for the battlefield,
business and life,

3443
03:56:06.941 --> 03:56:08.620
and actually somebody else,
the muster said,
hey,

3444
03:56:08.621 --> 03:56:12.070
you never talk about the audible version of extreme ownership because that is

3445
03:56:12.071 --> 03:56:16.450
available on audible,
and guess who reads it?
Leif Babin and me and the,

3446
03:56:16.520 --> 03:56:19.330
and this guy was saying,
you should,
everyone should be listened to that.
It's,

3447
03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:21.610
it's,
it's better to listen to it then to read it,

3448
03:56:21.990 --> 03:56:25.540
which that depends on who you are,
but for this individual,
he was like,

3449
03:56:25.541 --> 03:56:26.680
you need to tell people about that.

3450
03:56:26.681 --> 03:56:30.640
That's awesome that you guys and anyone else's on that audio book sound effects.

3451
03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:35.530
We put sound effects in their machine gun,
fire explosions,
things like that.

3452
03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:40.510
You know why?
Because immersion immersion,
so yeah,
so you can get that.

3453
03:56:41.140 --> 03:56:42.430
I'll also

3454
03:56:44.020 --> 03:56:48.250
coming out September 25th we have the follow on book two extreme ownership.

3455
03:56:48.251 --> 03:56:49.750
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

3456
03:56:49.780 --> 03:56:54.090
It's available for preorder wherever you want to preorder Amazon,
Barnes,

3457

3458

which you do.

3459
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:05.690
If you want to be a book,
a book person like me,

3460
03:57:05.960 --> 03:57:10.960
you want to get that first edition because that's cool and if you don't order it

3461
03:57:11.001 --> 03:57:14.510
then you won't get it in time because the publisher won't make enough because

3462
03:57:14.511 --> 03:57:15.500
they have no idea.

3463
03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:20.420
They don't understand how many people are out there waiting for this book.

3464
03:57:20.421 --> 03:57:24.650
So if you it order it,
that'd be cool.
