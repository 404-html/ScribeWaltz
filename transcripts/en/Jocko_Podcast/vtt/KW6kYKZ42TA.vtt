00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.830
This is Jocko podcast number one 49 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.740
Jocko Willink.
But Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.590
<v 0>All my life,
I've waited for this.</v>

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.600
<v 1>Okay,</v>

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.040
<v 0>now I've joined you and your losses are a strength to me.</v>

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 1>I ache.</v>

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.540
<v 0>And yet I know that Alec retched with pain on the dust road that went to
Corinth.</v>

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.340
I breathed the dust and yet I know that grandpa brief the gas that made a hero

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.590
out of purging.

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.800
I flinch when bullets tear the air in angry rents.

12
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.850
And yet I know that father and three farmer boys at Pickett's charge felt a

13
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.900
cutting edge that dropped them dead.

14
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.760
How can I be bitter?

15
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.500
You are my strength.
You ghosts.

16
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.770
And I have learned those things,

17
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.450
those esoteric skills and knowledges that mark me as one of you

18
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.370
that loose bowels,
piles of shit.

19
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.370
Too much shit from overeating.

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.570
PLOP randomly around the outer dykes of a Ville mean trouble.

21
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.230
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.590
<v 0>catching the aroma,
seeing the groupings,
watching flies,</v>

23
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:39.591
dance laser Lee rejoicing in their latest fitted morsel that bends the low grass

24
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.110
and a muddy glob like a bomb of cow dung

25
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.853
<v 1>trouble.</v>

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.700
<v 0>I can tell from the crack of a rifle shot the type of weapon fired and what</v>

27
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.780
direction the bullet is traveling.
I can listen to a mortar pop and no,

28
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.730
it's size,
how far away it is.

29
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.400
<v 0>I know instinctively when I should prep a tree line with artillery before I move</v>

31
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.234
into it.

32
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.470
I know which draws and fields should be crossed online which should be assaulted

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.030
and which are safe to cross in column.

34
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.670
I know where to place my men when we stopped and form a perimeter.

35
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.580
I can shoot a rifle and throw a grenade and direct air and artillery on to any

36
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.080
target under any circumstances.

37
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
I can dress any type of wound.
I have dressed all types of wounds,

38
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.930
watered protruding intestines with my canteen to keep them from cracking under

39
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.700
sun bake,
patched,

40
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.230
sucking chest with plastic tied off stumps with field expedient tourniquets

41
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.200
I can call and Med evac helicopters.
Talk them,
cajole them,

42
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.880
dare them into any zone.

43
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.443
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.700
<v 0>I do these things,
experience these things repeatedly.
Daily.</v>

45
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.750
They're terrors and miseries are so compelling and yet so regular that I have

46
00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:12.590
ascended to a high emotion that is nonetheless a crusted numbness.

47
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.700
<v 1>Okay?</v>

48
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.700
<v 0>I am an Automaton bent on survival agent and prisoner of my misery.</v>

49
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.710
<v 0>How terribly exciting</v>

51
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.110
and how to,

52
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:31.860
what purpose will these skills serve me when this madness ends?

53
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.580
What lies on the other side of all this?

54
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.103
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113
<v 0>it frightens me.</v>

56
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.300
<v 0>I haven't thought about it.
I haven't prepared for it.</v>

58
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.890
I am so good.
So ready for these things that were my birthright.

59
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.800
I do not enjoy them.
I know they've warped me,

60
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.570
but it will be so hard to deal with a life empty of them

61
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.230
and there are the daily sufferings you go,
so have known them,

62
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.443
but who else

63
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.600
I can sleep in the rain wrapped inside my poncho listening to the drops.

64
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:22.820
Beat on the rubber like small explosions.
Then fuel the water pour to reveal.

65
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.130
That's inside my Poncho soaking me as I lie in the mud.

66
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.760
I can live in the dirt,

67
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.320
sit and lie and sleep in the dirt.

68
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.640
It is my chair and my bed,
my floor,
and my walls.

69
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:40.480
This clay

70
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.070
and like all of you,

71
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.480
I've endured diarrhea as only an animal should endure it.

72
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.160
Squatting a yard off the trail and relieving myself.
Unceremoniously.

73
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.170
Naturally.
Animaly

74
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.870
deprivations of food festering,

75
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:06.871
open source worms eat aching crotch that nags for fulfillment.

76
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.410
Any emptying hole that will relieve it.

77
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.240
<v 0>Who appreciates my sufferings?</v>

79
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.750
Who Do I suffer for?

80
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.730
And that right there is an excerpt from a book.

81
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.070
<v 0>That is called fields of fire.</v>

83
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.400
And it was written after the Vietnam War by a marine who served there.

84
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.990
<v 0>In this book paints a picture of,
of combat and it,</v>

86
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:48.670
and in fact it actually does more than that because a picture,

87
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.760
no picture supposed to paint a thousand words or say a thousand words,

88
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:59.660
but pictures don't always properly convey thoughts and emotions.

89
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.140
<v 0>You need words to make that happen.
And this book really captures all of it.</v>

91
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.070
Horror,
fear,
disgust,
love,
hate,
indifference.

92
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.820
The chaos of combat,
the sorrow of loss here.
Wisdom.

93
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.640
<v 0>And of course,
in all of that human nature</v>

95
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.163
and

96
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.020
<v 1>okay,</v>

97
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.650
<v 0>as I always say about this podcast,
while yes,
it is about ward,</v>

98
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.170
it's about leadership.
And it's about atrocities.
And it's about struggle.
It is,

99
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.820
most importantly,
it's about human nature.
And on top of that,

100
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.850
the incredible power of the human will.

101
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.390
And this book fields of fire gives us a very close examination of human nature

102
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.310
in all of its glory

103
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.980
and of course in all of its horror as well.

104
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.990
And the book was written by a man by the name of James Webb,

105
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.990
who was a marine officer,

106
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.470
Vietnam recipient of the Navy Cross,

107
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.090
former secretary of the navy,
former senator from the great state of Virginia.

108
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.840
He's written a bunch of other books,
10 I believe.

109
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.880
<v 0>He's written and produced movies,
all kinds of stuff.
On top of that,</v>

111
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:26.860
east has five children,
if I'm correct,
or one of those children.

112
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.460
Jim also served in the Marine Corps and it was actually whose time in Ramadi

113
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.030
overlapped with my time in Ramadi,
where he served as a,

114
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.290
as an oh three 11 rifleman as a member of the one six marines and also as a

115
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:48.310
radio men in Stapleton.
So

116
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.030
it's awesome to read these books and know their history and it's even more

117
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.380
awesome and an absolute honor to have with us here today,

118
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.930
the author of the book,
fields of fire

119
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.080
and also his son.
So sir,

120
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.720
thank you for coming,
Jim.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I witness,

121
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.010
I was kind of wondering because you've,
you know,

122
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.220
James and Jim and I decided when I was trying to figure out what to call you

123
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:26.390
guys,
I,
I figured I'd call you young Jim,
Jim,
and I just keep calling you sir.

124
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.820
Just call me Jim.
I call him young easier.
So,

125
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.620
uh,
yeah,
I,
I can't thank you guys enough for coming on,

126
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.100
for coming all the way out here from the east coast and to come on this and um,

127
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.570
for me to revisit fuel to fire,
which is just a,
uh,
a book and what,

128
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:46.130
we'll get into that a little bit later.

129
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.580
It's an iconic book about not just the Vietnam War,

130
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:52.400
but really about Warren and the,
the way you've laid it out.
And again,

131
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.900
we'll get into that a little bit,

132
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.060
but I also wanted to talk to you and really get some of your backstory as well

133
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.500
and your upbringing.
You know,

134
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.950
we always try and start with the guests kind of talking about where they came

135
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.320
from and what their background was.

136
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.530
And you have a lot of that actually laid out in your memoir.

137
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.960
So I was going to ask if it's cool to call this a memoir,

138
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.220
but there it says it on the cover,

139
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.250
a memoir I heard my country calling and I guess what one little section of this

140
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:27.420
that that stuck out at me and I think you know,

141
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.660
obviously we'll let you expand on it,
but I'm going to the book.
So again,

142
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.500
this book is called,

143
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.210
I heard my country calling and here we go back to the book when it hurts,

144
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.150
just grit your teeth and take it.
Don't ever,
don't you ever back down?

145
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.630
Never start a fight.
But if somebody else does never run away,

146
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.030
if you run from a bully,
you will never stop running.
But if you fight,

147
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.860
he won't risk coming back at you again.
Stand up,
fight back,
mark him,

148
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.940
give him something to remember every morning when he looks in the mirror,

149
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.260
then even if you lose,
you win.

150
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.260
And by the way,
if you ever run from a fight,
I will personally beat your ass

151
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.440
and you go on.
My father was not exactly a mellow guy.

152
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.450
He did not spare the Rod,

153
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.870
but he taught me early that there is no substitute for moral courage,

154
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.900
whatever the cost and that the ultimate duty of every leader is to take care of

155
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.710
the people who rely on him when otherwise they would be forgotten or abandoned.

156
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.920
Courage in the face of those above you and loyalty to those below you where my

157
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.500
father's in alterable standards,

158
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.660
the only true way to measure the worth of another human being.

159
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.390
So there you go.
Those are some,

160
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.660
those are some standards your dad laid out for you.
He was a tough guy,

161
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.240
<v 2>not a tough guy.
You know,
listening to you read the,
um,</v>

162
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.830
the excerpt from fields of fire.

163
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:03.831
I was just thinking about how long it has been and the journey that I've had

164
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.040
since I wrote those words.
And learning.

165
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.630
I think we were talking about this last night,

166
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.870
learning how to write by writing this novel,
writing a novel.

167
00:11:13.871 --> 00:11:17.500
It was an act of will for a lot of different reasons.
And

168
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.580
one of the things when,
when I think about growing up in our family,

169
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.740
uh,
was,
uh,
uh,
my dad was a leader,
uh,

170
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.260
more than anything.
He was a leader and you know,

171
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:33.650
bit different families have different conversations when you,

172
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.740
when you're sitting around the dinner table.
But his was always,
you know,

173
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:41.700
he would talk about different issues,
but it was always,
how do you lead?

174
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.930
How do you motivate people?
Uh,
one of his,
uh,

175
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.340
slogans was you can make people do something or you can make people want to do

176
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.550
something.
And so in a nutshell,
you know,

177
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:55.690
learning from him,

178
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.000
he was a career military person.
He enlisted in World War II,

179
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.020
became a bomber pilot,
uh,
be 17 to be 29 in Zen,

180
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:08.920
was in Berlin airlift.
And when I was very young and,
uh,

181
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.330
was transitioning into a jets for the Korean War and uh,
uh,

182
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.810
air pressure in the cockpit blew out the jet blue blue's your out.

183
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:20.460
He got grounded.
I'll never forget that day when he came home,
when he,

184
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.610
he couldn't fly anymore.

185
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.750
We're getting worried from to walk into the door and my mom says they took your

186
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.270
dad's when he's away,
don't ever mention it.

187
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.070
He walked in and he was still wearing his wings.
You know,
once you qualify them,

188
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.590
they don't take off.
And so first thing I said to him was,
Hey dad,
you,

189
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.860
they let you keep your wing.
So he said,
go upstairs.

190
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.170
But then he was a pioneer and the muscle programs still didn't have a college

191
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:47.680
degree.
Put the first atlason for the air force.
And one of the,

192
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.130
one of the great things to observe as a teenager was when they gave him the

193
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:55.210
command of a,

194
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.190
an atlas Thor scout junior and missile squadron that the success rate on the

195
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:02.440
atlas at this time out of Vanderburg,

196
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:06.340
we had opened up van and it was an 85,000 acre wilderness when I first went out

197
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:07.300
there in,
in eighth grade.

198
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.900
But the success rate and that squadron was 11% and he made it 100% 12 out of 12

199
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:19.270
successful launches.
And I'd go with them out to the,
the pads don't,
you know,

200
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.570
went out in 1617 and and watch how he dealt with his is people,
wait,

201
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.960
you just trumped,
cause I was talking about how I bring my,

202
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:28.750
I used to bring my son out to the training grounds and let them shoot machine

203
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.990
guns and stuff.
But your dad brought you out and let you shoot missiles.

204
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:36.690
Let me watch you just trumped me as the,
you know,

205
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:37.960
you could back then,
you know,

206
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:42.760
I could go sit a cinder block house like a thousand yards away from where one of

207
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:47.250
these outlets are going up.
But watching how he treated his people and on a,

208
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.520
you know,
he'd been deployed a lot when he went back into the million.

209
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.300
He got rift at the end of World War Two because he didn't have a college degree

210
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.370
when they brought him back in.

211
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.560
He was either deployed or stationed at basis that did not have military housing

212
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.410
for three and a half years.
And we were up in Saint Joe,

213
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:04.020
Missouri where I was born.
Uh,

214
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.320
my father's family had come in from the Appalachian Mountains and ended up in

215
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:12.100
Saint Joe.
My mother was from East Arkansas.
Uh,
very,

216
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:15.400
she had a very tough life.
Early life.

217
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:18.540
Three of her seven siblings had died with childhood disease.

218
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:20.590
The kinds of things you don't even see anymore,
like her,

219
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.280
her sister that was nearest to her died of typhoid fever.

220
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.530
When's the last time we'd seen in American with typhoid fever?
Um,

221
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.830
so we were up in Saint Joe,
Missouri.

222
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.460
My mother had four kids by the time she was 24 years old and my dad was gone and

223
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.860
she didn't know hardly anybody at Saint Joe Missouri.

224
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.490
We didn't have these family assistance programs like they do now.

225
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:46.120
And it's been one of the great privileges of my life to try to put those into,

226
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.060
into our military.
So my grandmother moved in,
she,

227
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.870
she was living on Arkansas,
I mean,

228
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.880
from Arkansas to California and came back and lived with us for several years

229
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:02.630
and there was an iron hand in a house.
But you know,
my dad would come back,

230
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.570
he'd leave Friday night and get off work at one point.

231
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.600
But Scott Air Force Base Illinois drive 380 miles one way every weekend.

232
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.930
No interstates drive all night.
Friday night show up.

233
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.440
We never knew what time Saturday morning,
but he'd be in there with,

234
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.090
with my mom's Saturday morning raise hell,
uh,

235
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.710
Friday afternoon,
getting,
getting the car and drive back.
Uh,

236
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.780
but his example taught me more about the axioms of leadership than anything I

237
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:38.330
learned anywhere else.
And being able to apply it in the Marine Corps,

238
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.220
which you know,
was one of the great prides of,
of my life,
uh,

239
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.083
was,
uh,

240
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.480
really an extension of what he'd put on the Table Day in a day out.

241
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.750
And you know,
Jim got the new son,
Jim got to know,
uh,
you know,

242
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.910
his grandfather and my dad very well.
We spent a lot of time fishing,
hunting.

243
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.130
We are an outdoor family.
Um,

244
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.190
and we've had a same kind of few thousand hours of discussions,

245
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:07.304
I think.

246
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.740
<v 3>Yeah,
you can very easily say that the passage you read will qualify as the 11th</v>

247
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:14.150
commandment in our household.
Growing up,

248
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.800
I always passed down to him and it passed down to me.
Very,
very,
very simple.

249
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.310
You never walk away from a fight.
Um,
I've never start a fight,
but,
uh,

250
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.310
never walk away from one,
ever quit.

251
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.220
And you'll be judged how you treat those around you.
And it's a,
it's a,
it's,
it's,

252
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.580
it's been,
uh,
one of those things I've kept with me my entire life and it's,

253
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.080
I was lucky to have that kind of formative influence at a very young age.
And,
uh,

254
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.840
I love the Marine Corps myself,

255
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.600
but everything I've learned about leadership is from him and being around his

256
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.630
platoon growing up.
And it's absolute blessing.

257
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.500
<v 4>Yeah,
that's awesome.</v>

258
00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:52.740
I know and we talked about this a little bit last night cause I would have guys

259
00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:54.420
that are concerned that hey,

260
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:58.890
I'm not around and I got two kids and I'm doing another deployment.
And,

261
00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:01.890
and you know,
I always would tell guys,
look,
guys have been,

262
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.150
I don't know what you call it in,
you know,
Viking years or whatever,

263
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.640
but I don't know if they called it a deployment back then,

264
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.850
but guys have been going on deployment and leaving their families for thousands

265
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.790
and thousands of years.
And,

266
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.110
and that to me is an example that you might not be there to directly influence

267
00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:22.860
your kid on a day to day basis.
But the,
when when,
uh,

268
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.400
the young man looks up or a kid looks up and sees,
hey,

269
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:28.740
this is what hard work is this,
what commitment is this is,

270
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.620
this is what sacrifices and they can emulate that.

271
00:17:31.621 --> 00:17:33.660
You don't have to be there everyday to instruct them.

272
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:36.660
And every single little thing that they do.
And I mean,

273
00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:41.100
clearly both of you are examples of that.
You can turn out just fine,

274
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.020
even if dad isn't around every night.

275
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.850
<v 2>Oh,
you know,
when I was really,
uh,</v>

276
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.530
when I was really young and he was deployed the Berlin airlift,

277
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.070
I used to go to a better reunite with a picture of him on the runway and the

278
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.270
flight line,
uh,

279
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.870
that air force public affairs had taken with him and his first sergeant or some

280
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:02.710
visiting general.
I still have that picture over my desk today.
Uh,

281
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.670
but that was,
you know,
that was good night dad.
You know,

282
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:07.110
and you look at that and you,

283
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.460
you gain an understanding of what it means to serve and what,
what your country,

284
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.900
uh,
is all about and,
you know,
serving your country,
you know,

285
00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:15.601
those sorts of things.

286
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:19.650
The one thing I would say it was my dad really didn't want me to go in the

287
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.530
Marine Corps.
He,
uh,
uh,

288
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.760
from the job that we were just talking about,
you know,
when you had the,
uh,

289
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.810
the missile squadron,
he had gone to night school for 26 years.

290
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.330
He graduated from college in my senior in high school and you meet,

291
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.790
it was deep selected for colonel.
Um,

292
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.020
and then they send him to the Pentagon to do legislative affairs and it was the

293
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:44.820
Mcnamara era and he would just,
he would just go crazy about,

294
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.620
uh,
the whiz kids who were running the Vietnam War and we would have these long

295
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:53.180
discussions about,
you know,
you're,
you're just going to be meat.
You know what,

296
00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:56.220
you're going to be meat.
You know,
the Marine Corps is a political football,

297
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.080
don't do it.
His,
his line was go in the navy,
stay on the ship,

298
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.980
eat ice cream.

299
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.250
And then when I went in the marine corps,
it was like,
oh man.

300
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:11.060
And then when my brother went into the marine corps,

301
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.030
my brother was a Huey pilot in the Marine Corps.
It was like,
my boys are marines.

302
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.013
Uh Hm.

303
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.300
<v 0>I,
you know,
going back to your childhood a little bit,</v>

304
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:24.630
you talk about how you moved around a ton.

305
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.060
I'm grown up.
I mean,

306
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.420
you sound like your dad was a little bit of a habitual house mover.

307
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:33.030
Even when you get somewhere he would move.
No,
you're talking about you.

308
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:33.601
When you were in England,

309
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:37.230
you live in 303 different houses and it seems like everywhere you went you would

310
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:38.070
move around a lot.

311
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.330
And one of the things you say about that in the book is a,

312
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.210
I'm going back to the book here.
I not only learned how to read a room,

313
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.770
but by necessity became an acute observer of subtle body language of each new

314
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:50.910
tribal circle.

315
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.270
In each place I learned valuable distinctions that helped me to develop skills

316
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:56.610
and insights that carried over into leadership challenges during,

317
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.550
during my later life.
In order to lead people,

318
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.950
you must first motivate them in order to motivate them.

319
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.380
You must understand them in order to understand them.

320
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.200
You must be able to grasp not simply their words,

321
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.540
but the emotion behind their words.

322
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.730
The same words and gestures can have vastly different intentions in Alabama and

323
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:19.140
southern California and Nebraska.
And sometimes even within the same town.

324
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.950
I learned to be a receiver of information as well as a careful broadcaster.

325
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.620
So

326
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.290
<v 2>absolutely.
You know,
and first of all with,
with my dad moving.
Yeah.
We,</v>

327
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.720
I think the longest we've ever lived in a house,

328
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.420
it was like 17 months while I was growing up,
you know,
part of it was the,

329
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.120
you know,
the Scotch Irish tradition of the,
uh,

330
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.110
the Ulster Scotts at settled Appalachian mountains and then spread further west

331
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:47.590
and,
uh,
you know,
they're there,
they like to say,
you know,
you,
you haven't,

332
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.000
you don't stop moving to,

333
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:51.880
you've lived in at least two or three houses or something over the mountain that

334
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:56.530
you haven't seen yet.
And uh,
yeah,
I'd eat that.
Literally,
we,
yeah,
we got,
we got,

335
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.540
you know,
the does post World War Two military,

336
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.700
uh,
was,
you know,

337
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.760
it would still solid sort of receipting itself in terms of having large standing

338
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.060
military and where the missions were going to be with the space program,

339
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:18.040
all this stuff,
missile program going on.
So yeah,
we by necessity moved a lot,

340
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:21.520
but then yeah,
we'd get in a house,
Amarillo,
Texas,
women,
Amarillo,
Texas,

341
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.180
one year it would have been three different houses.
You know,

342
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.610
I saw one down there.
So I'm done there on sunset.
I'm upset to the street,

343
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:29.410
we're going to move in that house.
And my brother and I,

344
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.180
we lived on the back porch,
you know,
that with the,
you know,

345
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.480
the windows rattling a,
you know,
et cetera.

346
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.140
But as we're testing to either become marines or start a moving company,

347
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.003
you are really,

348
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.890
so then there was an upside is the downside of that.

349
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.440
And that is,
you know,
academically like,

350
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.010
and went to I think nine different public schools in five years at one point

351
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:54.590
with three different schools in eighth grade.
No,
you know,

352
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.760
continuum in the academic curriculum.
Um,

353
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.430
when I started in the eighth grade that was in Santa Maria,
California,

354
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.960
when they first opened up,
Vandenberg,
uh,
they tested the whole class.

355
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.710
They took four of us.
They put us in different rooms.

356
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.930
I said is it was like the beginning of gt,
you know,
or whatever.
Uh,
you know,

357
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:16.390
you're going to,
you're going to be like an experiment.

358
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:21.220
You're going to grow it academically at your own rate.
By the time I got to one,

359
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:24.700
two,
three,
like the fifth school in,
in Nebraska,

360
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:28.480
I was on non college prep work release,
get this Guy Outta here.

361
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.430
You know what I ended up,
you know,

362
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:32.830
like they let us go an hour early and I went to work,

363
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.040
but I can always take a standardized test.

364
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:39.750
And that's really how I was able to get into the,
the,
uh,

365
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.260
scholarship program that later led me to go to the,
to the Naval Academy.

366
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.380
But the most important lesson from all of that was I was able to see such a

367
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:54.980
cross section of America,
uh,
first in the military.
You know,

368
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.360
the military was the first institution in the country that was racially

369
00:22:58.361 --> 00:22:59.170
integrated.

370
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.410
And we had a totally different environment than if I had grown up in east

371
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:07.270
Arkansas or somewhere else,
but also so many different communities.

372
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:11.170
And you walk in and you're the new guy and you read the room and you figure out

373
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:14.440
where the problem is.
But you also,
as you know from,
from the,

374
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.550
from the quote that you read,

375
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:21.180
you learn that a big part of leadership is knowing what motivates people and

376
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.330
understanding that different things motivate different people,

377
00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:28.000
not only culturally but individually.

378
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.920
And so sort of figuring out,
uh,
what,
you know,

379
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.480
what a person is thinking when they are saying certain things to what body

380
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:39.010
language means,
et Cetera.

381
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:43.840
And you translate that into the combat environment,
particularly in,
in Vietnam,

382
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:48.841
during the Vietnam War when I was there and we had an incredible cross section,

383
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.010
particularly of the,
the working side of American society.
Uh,
and,

384
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.000
and uh,
I,
by that time I'd been a boxer for eight years.

385
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.190
I had been around,
you know,
a lot of African Americans.

386
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.930
My hero when I was in high school was African American.

387
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.850
Incredible fighter wins the Olympics in 1964.
Um,
but uh,

388
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.620
the uh,
Hispanic communities,
California,
the farming communities,

389
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:20.270
the southern,
the southern mentality of which my culture deprived.
Um,

390
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.710
and so when you look at a problem,
we look at a potential problem.
You know,

391
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:27.430
I got cat and ones,
I got cat four's in terms of,
you know,
the,

392
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.070
the testing scores of people out there.
You learn how to,

393
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.430
how to listen and then how to make decisions and how to preclude a lot of

394
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:38.270
problems that were going on.

395
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:43.271
We had racial problems and in the military writ large during that period we are,

396
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.450
society had these problems.
I never had a racial problem in any,
you know,

397
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:48.284
documented.

398
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.150
Did you now one of the things that while you are jumping from school to school,

399
00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:55.550
and that was prob problematical,

400
00:24:55.551 --> 00:24:59.300
although you would learn in this stuff about human nature and the way people
are,

401
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.650
you know,
one part of the book here,
you say from,
from the time I was 10,

402
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.650
my dad had challenged me to read a book a week and if,

403
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.490
and if that did not remedy my restlessness to try and read two books a week,

404
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:11.810
read,
read,
read,
hears me,

405
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.700
and I had including poetry fiction history and anything I could get my hands on

406
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:21.230
that was about sports and the military.
Did you read that much as a young kid?

407
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.150
Constantly.
And I thought really saved me in terms of the,
you know,

408
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.840
the differing standards and whatever in the schools that I was going to.

409
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.480
And the other thing that,
uh,

410
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.010
my dad and I would do from the time I was very young,
it was,
had poetry contests,

411
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.150
you know,
he was a big,
big reader too.
And,
uh,
so,
you know,

412
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:45.830
all the way through his,
his lifetime,
we would do that when,
uh,

413
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.360
you know,
uh,
up until,
you know,
very soon before he passed away,

414
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:52.770
we would go every summer we'd get the,

415
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.730
the males in the family of the different generations,

416
00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.660
get a fishing camp in Minnesota for two weeks and hang out,
build a fire,

417
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.310
goof around and catch fish,
clean fish,
talk,
talk,
talk.

418
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:06.800
And my dad and I would always,

419
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980
we'd do Kipling or we'd do the British and Irish poets and you know,

420
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.950
one of us had give a line and another would give another line to see who really

421
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:20.900
remembered,
you know,
and I always knew when I was in high school when he,

422
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:24.730
when he was wanting to go,
go up to Minnesota,
even at that point,

423
00:26:24.731 --> 00:26:26.780
cause he would go and he started talking to my mother.

424
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.140
This one was one poem called,
do you fear the wind to do you?

425
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:34.250
If you're the force of the wind,
the slash of the rain,
go face it and fight it.

426
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:37.940
Be Savage again.
I'm going to go cold and hungry like a wolf.
Okay.

427
00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:42.650
I think we're going to Minnesota.
That's awesome.

428
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.690
Yeah.
And,
and you also say in the book,

429
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.060
I knew and as I had always known that I was born to be assaulter

430
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.950
growing up,
you know,

431
00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:00.300
we were and still are an outdoors family hunt,

432
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.590
fish,
shoot.
You know,
I taught gym from the time you were sick.

433
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.250
Jim starts shooting when he's six years old.

434
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.710
I got my first rifle when I was eight years old.

435
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:13.050
It was a part of a long going tradition from the pioneer,
a pioneer days,

436
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.720
you know,
here's your,
here's your rifle.
Uh,

437
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.780
I loved being an outdoors and I love all of the mechanics of that part of the

438
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.230
world.
And of course
at that time,
post World War II,

439
00:27:26.231 --> 00:27:31.020
you turn on a TV and a weekend and you've got victory at sea and uh,
you know,

440
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.640
Arab power,
an Oldie shows and,
and uh,
um,

441
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.590
I loved military history.

442
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.100
I've watched this stuff and I said I'm going to be a soldier.

443
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.640
And I didn't know at that time really it was a,

444
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.620
it was a close call in high school,

445
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:51.030
what I would go in the army or what I'd be a marine.
I wanted to do that.
Um,

446
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.150
and when I got to,
I didn't know what college was we do,

447
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.230
it was not part of our family heritage at that time,
you know,

448
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.620
directly go into college and figuring out what school you should go to and those

449
00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:02.454
sorts of things.

450
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.120
So I wouldn't remember when I was 14 years old and my dad and I said,
dad,

451
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.670
I want to,
I want to be a soldier,
says go to college.
I said,

452
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.490
what are you doing in college?
He says,
you're going to be an engineer.
I said,

453
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:13.460
what an engineer's do.
We said they invent things.
I said,

454
00:28:13.461 --> 00:28:17.920
I don't want to invent anything.
I want to see.
That's right.

455
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.340
I want to go in the woods.
I want to,
I want to lead people.
I know.
And,
uh,

456
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.320
so I,
uh,
found out that the,

457
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.260
the Navy had this ROTC scholarship,

458
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:34.160
this first scholarship full scholarship program because I could not have gotten

459
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.710
the naval academy out of,
out of high school.
My grades weren't that great.

460
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.850
You know,
the other things I had in place,
I think,
uh,
but,
uh,
uh,

461
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.090
the army did not have an ROTC scholarship at that time.

462
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:48.510
They had a program where after two years you could get a full scholarship,

463
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:52.800
but you only had a partial at the beginning.
So I,
I,
uh,
applied to the,

464
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.510
uh,
Navy scholarship program.
And at that time,
uh,

465
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.380
you took a standardized test and anybody who passed a standardized tests got

466
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:04.170
into the interview process and you could go make your case.

467
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.620
So I went was the school that was heavily military kids in the school.

468
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.850
We had 12 people from our school who passed the test and got into the,
the,
uh,

469
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.440
interviews,
our Valedictorian or Salutatorian,
all state basketball player,

470
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.830
all district football player and me.
It's like,
Hey,
pump your gas,
you know,

471
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.210
come see me fight.
And,
uh,

472
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.840
I really lucked out because the two interviewers,

473
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.790
the first one was a Mustang commander,
uh,
who had seen me fight.

474
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.660
And it just totally by coincidence I think it was commander Lasseter.

475
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.490
And he says,
you know,
where have I you before?
And,
uh,

476
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.750
<v 5>wasn't me.
And I know you talked about what do you want to do?
I said,</v>

477
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.600
I want to do this.
This is what I want to do.
He says,

478
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.160
what are you going to do if you don't get it?
I said,

479
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:53.610
I'm going to be here next year,
you know,
if you,
you know,

480
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.520
if I don't get it this year,
I'll be here next year.
Uh,
and we,
you know,

481
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:00.220
we talked about working through high school because I worked all through high

482
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:04.690
school.
Um,
and uh,
he would come after this,

483
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.441
he'd come over,

484
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:09.040
I was packing groceries at the base comments or he'd come by and say hello.

485
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.210
And uh,

486
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.620
the second interviewer was a naval academy graduate who had graduated and the

487
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:19.120
bottom two thirds of his class and from South Dakota.
And he,
he,
he was saying,

488
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.280
we don't,
we got enough brains in this world.
We need leaders.

489
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.130
And he through examples out,
you know,

490
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.410
like things you're not supposed to be able to solve.

491
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.530
You probably know those from different interviews and went through and in your

492
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:36.550
time in the navy.
So he goes,
we got all this mud and the Mississippi River,

493
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:38.920
what are we going to do about the mud and the Mississippi river?
And I said,

494
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.020
commander,
I've been thinking about this.
I said,
look,

495
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.330
you know,
here's what you do.

496
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:50.680
You shut that river down for eight hours a day and you run a big,
uh,

497
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:55.090
like a screen through there,
like a filter,
big filter on,

498
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.920
on a rotator,
a.
And on each end you put like a carwash,

499
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.560
you know,
with the,
the sprays.
And so you run,

500
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.800
you run the filters through and you spray the,

501
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.990
the mud out and you put it in a covert and you get a truck under there.

502
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:10.690
And I said,
Kevin,
that's topsoil,
send it back up,
you know,

503
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:14.620
sell it back to the farmers.
So you said,
oh,
I know.
Okay.

504
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.780
And so I got the scholarship.
And uh,
when you,
when you,

505
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.890
you mentioned fighting and you mentioned boxing and you know that you mentioned

506
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:28.840
it a couple of times and,
well obviously I like fighting and uh,

507
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.650
one,
one of the things,
I mean I always,
I,
I'm,
I'm more of a Jujitsu player,

508
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.640
but the things that Jujitsu teaches you about life and about everything really.

509
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.400
And I know a lot of those similar lessons come from boxing.

510
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.640
You had a nice little,

511
00:31:40.641 --> 00:31:45.400
a nice little thing about boxing in here and I just wanted to throw it out there

512
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:47.530
before we jump too much further because you know,

513
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:49.980
boxing stays with you through your,
through your,

514
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.050
through your Navel Academy career and whatnot.
But um,

515
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:57.400
here we go back to the book boxing and Rough Hewn World in which the sport

516
00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:01.690
resided taught me valuable lessons about human struggle and the thin line

517
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:04.660
between success and failure in the ring.

518
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:09.810
You quickly learned that life was not always fair and that it's not always offer

519
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:13.780
you a face saving time out when things were going badly.

520
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.730
Once the bell rang,

521
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.780
you were out there by yourself exposed for all the world to see until it rang

522
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:23.140
again.
No excuses,
no sitting out for a couple of plays.

523
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.640
Just because somebody hit you so hard,

524
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:27.760
you couldn't see straight and your toes felt numb.

525
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.600
When,
um,
you know,

526
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:36.490
my kids would compete in Jujitsu a lot when they were little and I would see

527
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:38.720
these kids would go to these tournaments in Jujitsu.

528
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.160
Tournaments are very popular,

529
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.630
<v 0>especially out here in California at that time.</v>

530
00:32:42.631 --> 00:32:47.000
And they're popular everywhere now.
But I would notice that when a kid loses,

531
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.010
you know,
cause my kids played all kinds of sports,
whatever,

532
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.290
soccer and basketball and this and that.
The kid,

533
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.810
if the team loses the soccer game,
the kids,
you know,

534
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:56.960
they walk off the field when a kid loses a Jujitsu match.

535
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:58.490
And this is just not just my kids,

536
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:01.850
but like 90% of kids when they lose that Jujitsu match,

537
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:03.680
when they're six years old,
when they're seven years old,

538
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:09.410
they're gonna start crying.
And you know,
it made sense to me instantly.

539
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:12.980
There's two parts of it that makes sense to me.
Number one,
they're by themselves.

540
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.550
There's no one to blame.
It's not anyone else's fault them team,
it's just them.

541
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.450
And number two,
when you get beat in a con,

542
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.380
in a combat sport,
it's,
there's,
there's a,

543
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.440
a primal thing that you just realize you got beat by another human being in this

544
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.480
game and,
and it's not a game.
And so it's,
it's like you said,

545
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:38.930
it's like there's no,
there's no way out of it.
And for me,

546
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:43.040
those lessons that people take away from combat sports are extremely important.

547
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:45.140
And it's the things that you just talked about right here.

548
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.880
<v 2>The,
you're absolutely right.
And an on a,
on a number of different levels,</v>

549
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.470
you know.
And one thing about,

550
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.300
well first of all on one thing about judo and Jujitsu,
you know,
when I was a kid,

551
00:33:55.301 --> 00:34:00.070
I used to read a lot and read a lot about Asian history and you learn the,

552
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.430
the Japanese philosophy behind it,

553
00:34:03.431 --> 00:34:07.390
which is to take your opponent's strength and use it against him,
you know?

554
00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:09.580
And it was just a kind of a different thing than boxing.

555
00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:13.830
But I've always thought about that,
you know,
and,
and other areas of,
of,
of,

556
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.400
of my life I've thought about that.

557
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.830
And in terms of a boxing,
you know,

558
00:34:20.831 --> 00:34:25.740
you never know who the judges are.
Uh,
you know what,
you know,
you,
you're,

559
00:34:25.741 --> 00:34:28.090
you're,
you're absolutely right.
I mean,
nothing,

560
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.200
nothing is worse than losing when it's just you out there.

561
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.170
If it wants a team out there,
you know,
you've got,

562
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.710
you've got people you can pat on the back and whatever,
but it's just you.

563
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:43.180
Or as a,
one of the great fighters in Omaha,
when I was fighting,

564
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.870
used to say it's just you and the other guy and all that smoke.

565
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:54.250
But so you,
you learn to deal with.
And,
you know,
when I say,

566
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.960
you know,
you may perceive unfairness,
you know,
you,
you all right.
You know,

567
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.380
I think I won that fight,
but you can't talk about it for the rest of your life.

568
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.450
You just say,
all right,
you gotta you got to swallow it.

569
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:06.160
And then you got to say that was that.

570
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.560
And the other thing is you have to prepare,
you know,

571
00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:15.220
when you,
when you say I'm going to,
you know,
like 15,
16 years,
I could,

572
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.820
I could be fighting in front of 3000 people,
you know,
Omaha lows.

573
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.600
And then I'm a lot going on in the winter and it was cold and then coming into

574
00:35:22.601 --> 00:35:25.270
the coliseum and watch watch.
And there were good fighters,
you know,

575
00:35:25.271 --> 00:35:27.880
really well my head Almaha good fighters at back then,

576
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.430
including a professional,
uh,
uh,
stable as well.
But,
uh,

577
00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:36.910
yeah,
I'm going to be in front of 3000 people and I don't wanna look like an ass,

578
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.320
you know?
And so you put it on yourself,
you put preparation on yourself,

579
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.510
which actually is a great learning tool for being a writer.

580
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.250
You know,
you,
you might think you're working hard or are,

581
00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:52.710
you may think you're just passing the time,
but when the book comes out,

582
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.160
you're going to be exposed to all these reviews and that sort of stuff,
you know.

583
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.690
So,
um,

584
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.590
and also it's kind of interesting cause I was just talking to uh,

585
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.650
a friend of mine who is in,

586
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.710
in government right now who was a very fine football player.

587
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:10.270
And we were comparing,
he was talking about how,

588
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.320
how hard it was to deal with a certain individual because he'd been a wrestler

589
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.430
and he doesn't understand how,
you know,
you get the team around you to,

590
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.570
to solve these problems.
Well,
you know,

591
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:23.040
you learned to step forward and take responsibility for solutions.

592
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.470
You know,
if you're an individual sport,

593
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:29.340
I mean probably more than any other kind of a sport,
you know,
it's like,
alright,

594
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.150
this is what I believe and this is what I'm going to fight for.
And if we lose,

595
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:37.530
we lose.
But this is what we're going to do.
And in my life,
combining that with,

596
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.950
with the Marine Corps,
you know,

597
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:45.951
where you are responsible for the lives of other people and you have to make

598
00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:50.700
decisions that affect other people.

599
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.980
There couldn't have been better training for any other leadership situation that

600
00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:57.900
I've been in.
When,
when,
uh,

601
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.590
going back to where you got selected amongst for this,

602
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.550
for this scholarship program,
you,
one thing you said is here,

603
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:07.320
nobody's going to outwork me to have,

604
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:11.610
so as I remember the day I got that cause I,
I said okay,

605
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:13.740
I'm going to wrap myself a little tighter here.
You know,

606
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:17.720
somebody up there likes me.
I remember that one.
I,
you know when,
uh,

607
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.650
you got the,
the letter from the navy in the mailbox.

608
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.570
If it was a thin little letter,
you knew it was a no you're not.
I got the packet,

609
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.220
it was cold.
I got that pack and I went,
I did this,
you know,

610
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.050
and I am going to bust my tail,
you know,
and then who came?

611
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.820
All right.
Ooh.
At back then,

612
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:42.870
it was like they were 51 schools that had these programs.
And you,

613
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.160
you listed the top six in order and then yes,
no,
yes,
no.
Well,

614
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:50.760
I go to these others and I'm sitting in Omaha,
Nebraska,
freezing.

615
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.930
I'll go anywhere.
I put down the six warmest schools.

616
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:59.610
I did not know the University of California from the man in the moon,

617
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:02.290
but I said university,
California sounds when warm.
And I,

618
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.540
and I put it on the top and I got into University of California.
I mean,

619
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:10.260
they didn't have their Nebraska quote of the year or something,
I don't know.
And,

620
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:15.150
uh,
had a great time there,
uh,
and did very well in the military program.

621
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:19.630
And My,
uh,
my marine corps,
the Marine Corps officer in the program said,
you,

622
00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.920
you really should go to the academy,
you know,
and so did my dad,

623
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:27.210
my dad's saw how much fun I was having down there.
We need to lock this boy up,

624
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:31.110
you know?
And so,

625
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.170
so you applied then for the Naval Academy while you're at USC and it was that,

626
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.900
were you surprised to get in there?
Well.
Um,

627
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.990
I think first of all,
I had,

628
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.500
I had ranked first in the leadership programs at southern cal and I got strong

629
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:53.500
recommendations,
uh,
major ontercor off where was the,

630
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.770
the marine and,
uh,
and my,
uh,
uh,

631
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.520
Lieutenant Colburn was the naval instructor and they both wrote strong letters

632
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:01.970
for me.
Um,

633
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.950
and I had to get letters of recommendation from high school.
And you know,

634
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:10.180
when I was in high school,
um,
I did really well in the literature programs,

635
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:14.110
even though I've got put in dummy English,
my city,
my,
my senior year,
you know,

636
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:16.510
and,
you know,
we were like,
what did you do last summer?

637
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:19.640
While they were studying the great artists,
but the woman who was,
uh,

638
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:24.650
was my teacher,
she saw how much I loved to write and,

639
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.610
and read and the sort of thing.
And,
uh,

640
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.770
so she wrote me a wonderful letter and had done an a and you know,

641
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.070
I was on the presidential appointment side,
which was the active duty military.

642
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.730
Uh,
uh,
and I think they took,

643
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.640
I can't remember now whether they took 50 or 75,

644
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:45.900
but they took a certain number from the,
from the country and I got in.
So,

645
00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.900
so the,
you know,
the naval academy is a,
is a,

646
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.110
is a story unto itself.
Uh,
you have one section.

647
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.810
I obviously didn't go to the Naval Academy.

648
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:58.840
Of course I worked with a ton of people over the years that,
that did.

649
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.790
<v 0>But I,
I thought that this little,
uh,
story,</v>

650
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:05.501
well,

651
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:08.960
I just thought it might capture some stuff about the naval academy and I'm going

652
00:40:08.961 --> 00:40:12.040
to read this going again.
This is still from the book.
I heard my country calling

653
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.451
after dinner.

654
00:40:14.451 --> 00:40:19.451
I reported to the room across the hall where the four who had joined evening

655
00:40:19.811 --> 00:40:24.520
come around towards its end,
took turns beating me with a cricket bat.

656
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.560
Touch your toes.
I,
I sir,
I would lean over and touch my toes.

657
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.540
They would hit me swinging the bat as if taking batting practice for slow pitch

658
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:39.340
softball game.
I would then come to attention and resume my brace,

659
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.780
which is standing at the position of attention beat army.
Sir,
did that hurt web?

660
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.700
No,
sir.
Touch her toes.
I sir,
the bat would connect again.

661
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.890
Beat army,
sir.
Did it hurt?
No,
sir.
Okay.
Touch your toes.

662
00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.080
I sir.
The blow would come.
I would straighten up again.
Beat army,
sir.

663
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.820
Did it hurt?
No,
sir.

664
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:06.250
After they had each hit a couple of slow pitch home runs and it apparently

665
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.370
stopped being fun and their exuberance diminished.

666
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.550
One of them finally told me that if I would simply admit that it hurt,

667
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.110
they would stop beating me,

668
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.100
but for all I knew even this guarantee could have been double.
Think.

669
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.390
If I told them it hurt,

670
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.430
would I really be allowed to leave or would it just bring yet another lecture

671
00:41:22.431 --> 00:41:26.470
and then another round or worse yet did they really want to send me back across

672
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:29.980
the hallway?
I had already dealt with doctor no pain before dinner.

673
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.830
I did not want to survive the cricket bat only to go back to toothpick,

674
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.710
which was another torture.
They were putting me through the pain.

675
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.640
Actually left my body,

676
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:41.060
or maybe it was merely my brain's reaction as I would later find out with

677
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:44.360
marines who were wounded so severely that their nervous systems became

678
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:48.200
overloaded in shut down so that they could not feel any pain I had.

679
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:52.970
I had detached myself from the moment it was this as if I was watching myself

680
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.300
from another room.
Did it hurt web?
No Sir.

681
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.210
Just tell us that it hurt.
Idiot.
Did it hurt?

682
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.630
I could hear worry in his voice somehow.

683
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.920
The very abuse that they were now weary of perpetrating had inspired me by

684
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:11.090
refusing to lose.
I felt that I was somehow winning.
No Sir.

685
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.680
Touch your toes.
Another blow beat army,
sir.
Behind me.

686
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:20.390
I heard them discussing that the bat had split length wise on my ass.

687
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.600
All right,
get out of here.
Web III,
sir.

688
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.610
So yeah.
What year was this?

689
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:30.680
1964.

690
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.080
<v 2>Yeah.
Naval Academy was a different place.
A needless to say,</v>

691
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.560
um,
than it,
than it is now.
Um,

692
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.510
yeah.
When Bob Timberg was writing his book,
Nightingale Song,

693
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:48.010
we discussed that that incident in one of the comments he made was,

694
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.130
um,
he meaning me,
uh,

695
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.910
was not particularly bitter about it,

696
00:42:54.911 --> 00:42:59.140
but he could still give me the individual's names and I still could,

697
00:42:59.141 --> 00:43:02.080
I'm not going to,
um,
but you know,
the,

698
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.370
the Naval Academy at at that time,
you know,

699
00:43:06.371 --> 00:43:09.450
the pendulum swings in terms of indoctrination and the,

700
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:14.240
where education fits in and what type of education,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,

701
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.280
but that are this class,
the class of 1968,

702
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:23.770
I'm depending on them in terms of plebe indoctrination had swung very far and it

703
00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:25.480
was by company really.

704
00:43:25.481 --> 00:43:29.800
They words like tribal systems were 36 different companies and some of them were

705
00:43:29.801 --> 00:43:32.680
relatively loose and some of them them were really,
you know,

706
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.460
actually we had a two,
two companies in,

707
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.330
in my class that ran out,
physically ran out more than half of their plebes.

708
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.370
And these were people were highly screened.

709
00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:45.880
I give some details in the book about the number of class Valedictorians,

710
00:43:45.881 --> 00:43:50.680
varsity athletes,
Eagle Scouts,
etc. Which actually when people have asked me,

711
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:51.670
you know,
what,

712
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.340
what's the great benefit you got out of going to the Naval Academy?

713
00:43:54.341 --> 00:43:55.450
And one thing I said as well,

714
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.400
I knew that I could achieve among these people who had achieved in different

715
00:44:00.401 --> 00:44:02.780
ways in,
in high school than I had.
I learned,
you know,

716
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.250
that I could compete in and that,
you know,

717
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.580
why was on the right track attitude and everything.
But this class,

718
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.430
I think we started with 1350 and um,

719
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:20.020
the first week or two of,
of,
of plebe year when some people resigned,

720
00:44:20.021 --> 00:44:23.800
they allowed a new increments to come in just for very short period of time.

721
00:44:23.801 --> 00:44:27.490
So let's just stick with 1350.
I think we graduated eight 41.

722
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.060
We had the highest attrition rate of any postwar,

723
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.440
a naval academy post World War II Naval Academy class.
Uh,

724
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:40.550
and there were some really people who would have been fine officers who were run

725
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:44.140
out for one reason or left.
Uh,

726
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.760
and that time period too,
um,

727
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.230
coincided with the very beginning of the Vietnam War,
the civil rights movement,

728
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.380
a lot of different things that were tearing the country aside.

729
00:44:55.381 --> 00:45:00.180
I can remember coming back from boxing practice in the summer of 1964 and we had

730
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:01.014
to know the,

731
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.670
one of the rates when you went down on the tables was to know the three top news

732
00:45:04.671 --> 00:45:08.220
stories of the day and they're on the front page with the Gulf of Tonkin

733
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:11.850
incident in the off of the coast of Hanoi,

734
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.130
the picture of the CEO.
And we were like saying,
okay,

735
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.010
this is,
this is really going to happen.
And we,

736
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.890
the year that I graduated in 1968 was,
was the,

737
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.820
the worst year for American casualties.
Um,

738
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.830
and it also was,
uh,

739
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.850
the year where in April Martin Luther King was killed in June.

740
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.940
The night before we graduated,
Robert Kennedy was assassinated.

741
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.160
It was just an end tobacco,

742
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.290
it up into the tet 68 offensive happened beef right before Martin Luther King

743
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.760
was killed.
So that was just boom,
boom,
boom.
The,
uh,

744
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.550
the last year and different people reacted in different ways,

745
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:57.270
but I think the majority of the people that I was with there during that period,

746
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.290
it gave us a real seriousness of purpose.
We knew where we were going.

747
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:03.630
It wasn't going to go away,
particularly for the Marine Corps.

748
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.370
We know all knew that we are going.
Um,
and so,

749
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.780
um,
by the time I graduated,

750
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.640
there was no doubt in my mind where,
where I was going to go.

751
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.160
It was one of the reasons why on FirstClass cruise,
you know,
at,

752
00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:24.870
at the Naval Academy,
you,
it used to be after your first year,

753
00:46:24.871 --> 00:46:28.400
you cruised with the enlisted folks.
You know,
we,

754
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.970
I lived with the snipes on a cvs,
uh,
after my first year.

755
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.100
It was a great learning experience too,
by the way,

756
00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:37.200
to see how hard those guys worked down here.

757
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.520
It hardly ever saw the light of day and they were a trip to,

758
00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.840
in a living spaces.
Um,
I remember when they,
you know,

759
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:50.841
that we had like six or seven mid ship and in as big living space and you know,

760
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:55.400
they're giving us the dirtiest job.
They could give us a,
you know,

761
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.280
get down in the bilges and scrubbed whether we've saved this for you,
et Cetera.

762
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:01.710
And I took whatever they want me to do,
man,
I'll do.
And uh,

763
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.080
so I remember the day they accepted me,

764
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:07.700
we had this first class petty officer who was kind of like the,

765
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.260
the guy there and they had one wall lockers,

766
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:15.261
four by four wall locker where they kept all of their different types of books

767
00:47:16.771 --> 00:47:20.790
and other supplies
and area.

768
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.590
Okay.
Web come on over here.
And they gave me the combination.

769
00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:30.591
So that logger and then broke out a bottle of booze in a set of boot up to the,

770
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.770
to the mess hall and [inaudible] scored a can of apple juice.

771
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:39.870
And it came back and we said,
okay,
you know,
you're all right web.
Uh,

772
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.180
and after my third year,
cause I knew I was going to Vietnam.

773
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:45.610
I said I didn't really like,
like maybe a see the med.

774
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:49.050
So I signed up for a med cruise,
um,

775
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.160
and got on the Saratoga USS Saratoga.
And I was like,
I,

776
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:54.370
as I wrote about in this book,

777
00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:00.270
we graduated the morning after the Arab Israeli war of 1967 began.

778
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.560
And so we,
we went to,
we flew to Rota,
Spain,

779
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:10.330
then out to Suda Bay Crete where the Saratoga came in to pick us up.

780
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:15.070
Uh,
and they had just met evac.
The USS Liberty.
Uh,

781
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.630
the hangar deck was littered with casualties from the USS Liberty.
And when we,

782
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:23.860
uh,
when we took the,
the small boats out and start bringing our gear in and,

783
00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.760
and got to the hangar deck and,

784
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.550
and there were marine guards around it and they said,

785
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.600
do not talk to any of these people.
And you know,

786
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.300
we went up to our spare 48 of us that were on the Saratoga.
Uh,

787
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:39.301
we went up to our living spaces and that was an incredible cruise cause the

788
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.790
Soviet Navy had just broken down into the med and we were playing games with

789
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:45.640
them the whole time.
Uh,
they crossed the deck,

790
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.750
the liberty casualties into the America,
which took them into,
into Athens.

791
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:54.580
But it was,
you know,
constant air ops on that carrier while we were there.

792
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.890
Incredible learning experience.
Yeah.

793
00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.630
That's why if you have it seeing air ops on the aircraft carrier,

794
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.340
the first time that I saw it I was,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's insane.
It's what it is.

795
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:10.390
It's insane.
And that's just normal life on a carrier and you know,

796
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:11.940
the difference.
Uh,

797
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.600
and same thing I'm talking about my dad and the muscle squad.

798
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:19.900
The difference back then and now was I had a little eight millimeter movie

799
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:21.430
camera and you know,

800
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:25.780
after a evening meal I could go sit on the flight deck and take pictures of

801
00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:27.530
flight ops.
You know,
now you know,
for,

802
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.270
for safety reasons and whatever other reasons you can't do that.

803
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:32.970
But I've got some great shots of some of the,
you know,

804
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.980
they are a five taken off for those things and we had spans on there and that

805
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:43.690
whole cruise,
we had a an a four they said with a nuke on it in the front,

806
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:46.900
right catapult because of the situation that was going on in the Middle East.

807
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:48.220
So yeah,
that's a,

808
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.270
<v 0>this is a,
I thought pretty pertinent here is you're,</v>

809
00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:55.300
you're at the academy and this is what you're talking about right now,

810
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:58.810
but going back to the book as the Vietnam War gathered intensity,

811
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.280
the leadership of the brigade began posting pictures and biographies of alumni

812
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.121
who had been killed,

813
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:08.140
a war missing in action on a large board in the middle of the Rotunda just

814
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:10.810
inside the main entrance to Bancroft Hall.

815
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:16.590
The pictures and short biographies were taken from the lucky bag,

816
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:21.610
the class year book from the year that each alumnus who graduated the board on

817
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:24.010
which the notices were placed was large,

818
00:50:24.011 --> 00:50:27.220
perhaps eight feet high and four or five feet wide.

819
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
At its top was a boldly lettered inscription to those who went before of us

820
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.023
before us

821
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.700
as the class of 1968 and year of graduation.
The two,

822
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:44.600
those who went before us board had become two boards.

823
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.320
And then three high percentage of the alumni listed were either marines or naval

824
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:56.420
aviators.
Many of their names and faces were familiar to all of us,

825
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:58.790
more than a few included friends.

826
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.330
And some of these were especially close.

827
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.060
So that's a,
that's a reality for everyone there.

828
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:11.150
Especially because in 1964 that wasn't happening.

829
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.060
And then you go to 1968 and you're filling up this board,

830
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.760
<v 2>do all but every day.
And look at the,
you know,
you,</v>

831
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:22.440
you looked to see what the new faces are.
Um,

832
00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.540
and the classes of 66 and 67 in the marine corps were hit very hard.

833
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.680
Protect 68.
Uh,
yeah.
And I think I wrote about this,
but I didn't,
one of the,

834
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:38.410
one of the toughest moments of that period of my life was when I was the brigade

835
00:51:38.411 --> 00:51:41.740
administrative officer.
And so,
you know,
my job,

836
00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.590
which wasn't much of a job,

837
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.720
was to go to one of the things was to go to the main office,

838
00:51:46.721 --> 00:51:50.170
clear out all the correspondence in they're sorted out,

839
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.720
pass it to the rest of the brigade staff,
et Cetera.

840
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:57.250
And one of them was bringing a casualty reps to the brigade first lieutenant who

841
00:51:57.251 --> 00:52:01.960
get the board on and without even a knowing it,

842
00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.920
while I picked him up,

843
00:52:02.921 --> 00:52:05.740
I picked up the casually a report of one of my good friends.

844
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.713
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

845
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.320
<v 2>And um,</v>

846
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.050
<v 0>you,</v>

847
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:21.050
you graduate from the academy and it's time to go to God,

848
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:28.150
go to comp time to go to the basic school and learn and doing it.

849
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.670
I've talked to her a bit about the base school.

850
00:52:29.671 --> 00:52:32.310
I've had marines on here that went through it.
Uh,
Brian,

851
00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:36.870
Stan and he gave us pretty good details on the basic school and,
but um,

852
00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.100
obviously at this time for you,

853
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.950
and I'm going to just going to go to the book for the Marines combat and

854
00:52:43.951 --> 00:52:45.750
overseas deployments were unending.

855
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:49.640
The greatest burden fell on the privates and lance corporals fresh from bootcamp

856
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.640
who populated the lower ranks of the rifle platoons and the lieutenants just out

857
00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:57.810
of the basic school who commanded them.
The basic school,
which we called TBS,

858
00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:02.070
was now starting a new class of 250 lieutenants every three weeks.

859
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.740
In pre Vietnam days,

860
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:09.720
TBS had taken 30 weeks to complete as Vietnam accelerated the time a new

861
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.780
lieutenant spent at TBS was reduced to 26 weeks and then to 21 but true to the

862
00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:19.890
traditions of long held disciplines of the core.

863
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:23.280
This reduction took place not by cutting the quality or the content of the

864
00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:28.200
curriculum by rather by the number of hours spent in class and in the field

865
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.850
every work week.

866
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.200
Almost every week TBS companies worked late into Saturday evening.

867
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:37.380
They spent a high percentage of their time in the field and a large percentage

868
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:40.650
of that time was dedicated to night maneuvers and bivouacs.

869
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.680
Our company was given the day off on Christmas,

870
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.130
working late into the evening of December 24th and assembling on the tarmac for

871
00:53:48.131 --> 00:53:52.530
a field activity as zero six 30 in the morning of December 26th.

872
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.300
Within a month of,
within a month after finishing TBS,

873
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:02.010
the infantry lieutenants among us would be boarding military flights to Travis

874
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:02.011
Air Force Base,

875
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:06.720
California to report immediately for 13 month tours in Vietnam as individual

876
00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:10.320
replacements in infantry battalions that were already

877
00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.620
<v 2>engaged in sustained heavy combat.</v>

878
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.370
Well,
of course lemme lemme just say something about,

879
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.310
about the basic school at that time.
Um,

880
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:30.190
that's probably the best school I've ever been to a day as a,

881
00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:32.560
as I wrote the,

882
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.710
the course got condensed in its time,

883
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:40.630
but not in the quality of what they were preparing us to do.
Uh,

884
00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:44.240
on the one hand,
the Marine Corps had dropped,
um,

885
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:49.030
a 60 millimeter mortar out of its,
uh,
Arsenal.
After the Korean War.

886
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.480
They decided that they didn't need it with more artillery,
close air,
et cetera.

887
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.040
They learned early in the Vietnam War that it was a valuable a weapon.

888
00:54:57.041 --> 00:54:59.980
They put the 60 Mike Mike package back into basic school.

889
00:54:59.981 --> 00:55:04.570
So it actually added a tactical package in,
into the basic school curriculum.

890
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.940
They cut out a,
Oh,

891
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.050
some of the dress and ceremony stuff.
You know,
they,
they did,

892
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:15.130
they did take that stuff out.
Uh,
not,
not all of it,
but what some of it,

893
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:19.750
but we worked six days a week and we worked.
Yeah,
we worked,
uh,

894
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.460
on the 24th and the 26th of December.

895
00:55:24.461 --> 00:55:28.480
We worked on the 31st and the 2nd of July,
I mean,
of January.

896
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.770
Um,
and uh,
you know,
it was,

897
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:36.170
I think the intensity actually helped prepare us,
uh,

898
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.590
some of the great friends in my life where people that I,

899
00:55:38.591 --> 00:55:41.830
that I met in basic school,
we were constantly together.

900
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.720
And by doing this every day,
you know,

901
00:55:46.721 --> 00:55:49.240
in intensely every day,
uh,

902
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.600
you got a better feel for what you actually were going to be required to do.

903
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.880
The interesting thing about basic school,

904
00:55:54.881 --> 00:55:58.550
one of the reasons I say it was the best school I've ever been to was,
um,

905
00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.350
it was educational,

906
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.550
it was practical and it was looking toward the future friends,

907
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:10.630
any weapons system.
And we,
we learn every weapon in the infantry battalion.

908
00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.480
In basic school.
They would teach it to you in class,

909
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.020
then you would walk out and assemble,
disassemble,
familiarize it,

910
00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:21.850
and then you would go shoot it every single weapon.
Um,
my,
uh,

911
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:26.170
first my first night as a rifle platoon commander,

912
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:30.970
I took the platoon that I had just picked up into a night,

913
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:35.971
move a night ambush and hit a north Vietnamese unit with a 51 cal machine gun.

914
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:41.920
Used every supporting arm in the Marine Corps except for close air.
Uh,

915
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:45.760
very first patrol,
did all the on calls,
et Cetera.
And you know,

916
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.260
that was basic school.
Um,
so they,

917
00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:51.430
did they go out?

918
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.360
How did they run problems with you in the field during the basic school?

919
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.940
Would they take her out on patrol?
They have opt for brands.

920
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.610
They would attack you planes.
Um,

921
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.830
we ran close there.

922
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.310
There weren't any planes attacking us and it's the same Vietnam.
Oh,
no,
no.

923
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.970
I said,
I said role players.
So when you would,

924
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:16.070
when you're doing a patrol in the basics,
oh,
I see.

925
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.390
How did you simulate and how well did they simulate it?

926
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.120
Some of it was,
was a walkthrough.
You know,
you would start with the walkthroughs.

927
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.280
Um,
first of all,
we had,

928
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:32.110
we had really talented,
uh,

929
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:36.940
combat experienced instructors and all of our,

930
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.510
where platoons brook or a company is broken down to five pollutants

931
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.340
alphabetically.
You know,

932
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.440
you know how that works when you're sort of at the end of the alphabet.
You know,

933
00:57:47.441 --> 00:57:52.420
we've got the worst gear,
the last in line for everything.

934
00:57:52.421 --> 00:57:56.770
And I can remember one night we were getting dismissed or in a company

935
00:57:56.771 --> 00:58:01.680
formation.
And,
uh,
one of the,
it was a former enlisted,
uh,

936
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.730
marine and our platoon,
we were Robert's through Zell something,
you know,

937
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:10.930
and he's,
he just started yelling at this fucking zoo.

938
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.970
And from that point for a lot of times when we'd March and we would go to zoo

939
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.860
zoo.
Uh,
but we had,
you know,
our,

940
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.300
our,
uh,

941
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.680
staff platoon commander had been seriously wounded as a rifle platoon commander

942
00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:30.160
in fifth marines.
Um,
you know,
all of,

943
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:34.930
all of our po step tune commanders had,
had been,
uh,
in,
in combat.

944
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.420
Uh,
there were a lot of talks,
you know,
those sorts of things.
Um,

945
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:43.810
but then on the tactics side,
you'd go out,
you'd learn it,
you know,

946
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.760
you learned it in class.
You could go out and walk through it,

947
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:50.030
and then you'd have aggressors.
[inaudible] we're a SDT.

948
00:58:50.031 --> 00:58:52.980
You called Stt,
aggressors,
which were,
uh,

949
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.620
enlisted marines just back from Vietnam who just loved to mess with the,

950
00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.340
with the,
the basic school lieutenants,
the big problem.

951
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.560
And the greatest surprise,
I have to say,
uh,
in,
in moving into combat,

952
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.940
the big problem was if,

953
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:11.530
if you're a say for this exercise,

954
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:16.180
if you're the platoon commander on this platoon,
in the attack exercise,

955
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.780
you've got 49 other lieutenants sitting near Saint.
No,
but I can do it that way.

956
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:23.120
No,
five ya'll come,
man,
you know,
there's no,
which you don't need to be online.

957
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:26.120
We need to be in a wedge,
you know,
or you know,
you need to,
whatever,
whatever,

958
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:26.954
whatever.
You know,

959
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:32.290
and I will never forget the feeling of actually commanding a rifle platoon in

960
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:36.590
combat and being on the move.
And I just said,

961
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:40.880
hold it up and everything just stopped,
you know,
that we're just right now,
boom.

962
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.060
I mean,
when that is,
everybody stopped,
you know,
and I went,
wow,

963
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:49.540
this is pretty good.
But uh,
you know,
the,

964
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:54.470
there were,
there were things that could have been taught better.

965
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:55.890
The one thing is,
uh,

966
00:59:56.390 --> 01:00:00.440
one of the things that I am very proud of in terms of the way that we did

967
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:04.480
operate in Vietnam,
we had had a lot of leeway to innovate.
It's,

968
01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:08.500
that's kind of been lost I think in the,
in the history of it.
Um,

969
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.260
and there were,
I mean,
it's in letters.

970
01:00:12.261 --> 01:00:16.760
I wrote back to officers that I knew talking about,
you don't really,
you didn't,

971
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:20.900
you have a petroleum package over here and you've got a platoon attack package

972
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:24.500
over here.
But really what we do all the time is we patrol.
Then we assembled.

973
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:25.334
Then we attack.

974
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.840
Or if we're going to go into a built up area is from the uh,

975
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:35.210
the uh,
uh,
section.
You read the expert you read from,
from fields of fire.

976
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.770
You know,
I know when to go online.
I know when to put my troops on.

977
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:43.460
I know where to put my guns.
Uh,
that didn't come from,
from basically a school.

978
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:47.150
The separate,
the separate entities did.
We connected it in the,
in,

979
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.430
in the reality of,
of,
of what we were doing.

980
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.640
And I'll tell you there's a long line,
we're getting a little ahead of things,

981
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.060
but they're there.
There's a long line of things that,
uh,

982
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:03.490
the young leaders in Fifth Marines had done before I got there.

983
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:04.694
And,

984
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:09.180
and also in what I was able personally to do as a rifle platoon in particularly

985
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:12.170
as a,
as a,
as a company commander.
One of the things we saw,

986
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:15.530
and I wrote an article about this concept when I got back from Vietnam,

987
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.340
was that the Marine Corps fire team,
this is,
this is simple and small,

988
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:24.050
but it really is,
you know,
institutionally,
uh,

989
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.500
important,
the Mokoro fire teams for four Marines.

990
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.060
It was built around the bar Browning automatic rifle.
It had,
it had,

991
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.150
it had a been put into place in,

992
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.830
in World War II because at the beginning of World War II,

993
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.360
the marine reigns only operated with squats like 1111 marine squat.

994
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:46.100
And they found that a squadron couldn't control directly control 11 people.

995
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:50.180
So they went into the triangular concept with the,
you know,

996
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.530
the former marine fire teams.
Uh,

997
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.890
but the problem with that was if you took two casualties,

998
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.110
you don't have a maneuver element.

999
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.560
And it is built around an artificial notion because the [inaudible] could be

1000
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:11.330
fully automatic.
You know,
I had,
I kept some in fourteens in my platoon as well.

1001
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:16.100
Um,
so what,
what the,
the young leaders in a,

1002
01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:19.950
in a fifth marines just sort of over time,
start,
uh,
doing,

1003
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:24.420
was cannibalizing the third rifle squad.
Uh,
and so in,

1004
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:27.770
in our rifle platoon,
instead of having three rifles,
squads,
and in a,

1005
01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:32.400
in a gun team attached from this notional weapons platoon,

1006
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:38.070
we put,
uh,
the rifleman into two squads.
Uh,

1007
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.300
and then brought the gun team in as the third squad for the triangular concept.

1008
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.710
Uh,
and that just kind of happened,
you know,
uh,
no one told us to do it.

1009
01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:48.720
We just said,
you know,
you can't,

1010
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.890
with the casualties casualty flow that we were taking,
you just couldn't do it,

1011
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:57.330
uh,
any,
any other way and be effective with the fire teams has maneuver elements.

1012
01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:02.280
Um,
we moved at night,
constantly.
Fifth Marines.
We moved at night.

1013
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.690
We were known from moving at night.

1014
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.650
We walked when we moved for the helicopter assets,
uh,
in,

1015
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:12.651
in Vietnam for the Marine Corps were scarce to the h 46 was,

1016
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.680
was built to standards from,
uh,

1017
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.370
amphibious carrier's and Fibia assault ships.

1018
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.980
So they were built to deck space,
um,
and you know,

1019
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:28.890
for amphibious assaults.
But then when you get an as continuous ground operation,

1020
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.560
there just weren't enough of them and they were very vulnerable to ground fire.

1021
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.590
Uh,
so in,
in areas where the army would have been,
you know,

1022
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:40.940
picking up with,
uh,
you know,
a,
a Huey,
you know,

1023
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:44.070
getting breakfast and getting on a huge reason.
I'm not running him down.

1024
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:48.150
This was a great concept,
that air mobile concept.
Uh,
and,
and moving in on,

1025
01:03:48.151 --> 01:03:52.690
on areas we walk,
we have,
we had for a long,

1026
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:56.460
long time.
We had two h 46 is for our,
uh,

1027
01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.940
entire sector during the day,
you know,
resupply or medivacs,
whatever.

1028
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:03.790
So we had a lot of walking.
Uh,
it,
it taught,

1029
01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.550
it taught you how to fight at night,

1030
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:10.360
but also when something happened to casualties were high because your ass

1031
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.320
asshole to belly button when you're walking along,
you know,
um,
if you could,
uh,

1032
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.540
you know,
we,
it was not,
not an uncommon practice.

1033
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:23.880
They get a booby trap and IED go off and you get an ambush on it at night,

1034
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.140
you know,
your people are packed in,
uh,
at et cetera.
But,
uh,

1035
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.180
and 60,
Mike,
Mike Mortar,
um,
I decided,

1036
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:37.010
I,
there were people who taught us as a company,
tactics in basic school district.

1037
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:40.140
60 millimeter mortar is the company commander's personal weapon.

1038
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.060
So I decided when I was a company commander,
I would get sent and I liked this.

1039
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:46.860
I would get sent,
you know,

1040
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.210
wait away at the edge of our battalions sector kind of operating independently.

1041
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.240
But I,
I'd fire sometimes 600 pounds a day and I'd send a,

1042
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:01.560
a a rifle platoon end to secure an area when we're on the move,

1043
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:05.400
you know,
payment,
combat patrol to get a new spot,
send a rifle,

1044
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.560
platoon insecurity or I take a resupply,

1045
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:11.960
haven't dropped a pallet [inaudible] hundred rounds.
No,
no,

1046
01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.090
see that was the old,
that was the tradition beforehand.
Yeah,
you can,

1047
01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:17.590
you can hump maybe 40 rounds,
you know.
Uh,

1048
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.680
but I'd have him drop a pallet in and have them build to sandbag a of parapet

1049
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:27.760
areas for the 16 weeks to the t o was three.

1050
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:32.590
We kept two and I use him for prep fires.
I use them for h and eyes.

1051
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.470
Uh,
you know,
we,
and,
and I,
my guys got really,
really good.

1052
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:43.320
<v 0>Yeah.
The,
uh,
the,
the mortar teams I've been out in the field with,
uh,
with,
uh,</v>

1053
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:46.330
the Marine Corps when they,
you watch those guys set up and fire mortars,

1054
01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:49.320
you know,
just in training and it's ridiculous how good they are.

1055
01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:51.840
It's awesome thing to watch.
It's a beautiful thing to watch.
Yeah.

1056
01:05:51.841 --> 01:05:54.420
The reason I kind of dug in a little bit about the training because when I came

1057
01:05:54.421 --> 01:05:57.600
back from my,
from my last deployment to Ramadi,
I took over the training.

1058
01:05:57.601 --> 01:05:59.880
And so it was,
it was all that,

1059
01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:02.640
that's all all I was trying to do was getting guys ready for what they were

1060
01:06:02.641 --> 01:06:06.420
about to face.
And we had,
we had this incredible opportunity,
you know,

1061
01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:10.950
we had this,
um,
you ever heard of miles gear and such?
Yeah.

1062
01:06:10.951 --> 01:06:13.680
So we had something that wasn't miles gear.
It was like miles gear,

1063
01:06:13.681 --> 01:06:17.100
but it was infinitely better.
It was super high speed.

1064
01:06:17.101 --> 01:06:20.690
Multimillion dollar system has little speakers on your shoulders.

1065
01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:22.110
So when you were getting shot at,

1066
01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:25.860
you'd hear snaps from these little speakers or you'd get mortared.

1067
01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:30.090
And there'd be explosions going off in your ears.
It was,
it was awesome.
It was,

1068
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.340
they actually had a,

1069
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:37.430
the very beginning of that concept when we went live fire early on where they

1070
01:06:38.821 --> 01:06:40.080
had targets would pop up.

1071
01:06:40.081 --> 01:06:43.440
And when she did the target with that was the most sophisticated we get in.

1072
01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:45.290
What I found with live fire was my fire.

1073
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.960
Cause when I came in it was all we do everything live fire and that was the big

1074
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:51.570
deal.
And we still,
we never got away from lab live fire,

1075
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:56.780
but we added to it this whole force on force training where you're going against

1076
01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.660
guys with either with lasers,

1077
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:02.790
with paint balls and that was infinitely more realistic because the paper

1078
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.770
targets never maneuvered on you.
And same thing when you had the,

1079
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.430
the guys returning from Vietnam who were maneuvered on you and you were at the

1080
01:07:08.431 --> 01:07:09.030
basic school.

1081
01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:13.020
I had all my seals that had just come back from combat deployments and they were

1082
01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:16.050
the guys that were going against the platoons that were getting ready to deploy.

1083
01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:20.370
So it's uh,
it was awesome.
And I would get,
the feedback I would get was always,

1084
01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:25.170
hey,
it was,
it was actually easier in combat,
you know,

1085
01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:29.430
minus the,
the actual death,
but the,
the threat of actual death,

1086
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.590
the maneuvering that would happen,
you know,

1087
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.670
they were used to maneuvering against seals who were bad ass and now they're

1088
01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:38.190
maneuvering against someone else.
It's not quite as,
you know,
in the game.

1089
01:07:38.191 --> 01:07:41.100
And also the enemy doesn't know our tax as well as we know it.

1090
01:07:41.101 --> 01:07:44.160
So my guys would know the tactics that there was going to be used against him.

1091
01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:46.200
So it was,
uh,
it was awesome.

1092
01:07:46.201 --> 01:07:50.160
But it's just when you talk about showing up in Vietnam and,

1093
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.060
and your first patrol,
you're going out and you're in that and you handle it,

1094
01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:58.950
that's,
that's a complete testament to the quality of that training because it's

1095
01:07:58.951 --> 01:08:02.760
freaking crazy.
Well,
you know,
I think when we were talking about this last night,

1096
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.150
<v 2>attitude development is the key to everything,
you know,</v>

1097
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.170
and getting your mind right as in terms of what you're going to do.

1098
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.610
And um,
uh,
knowing the,
that are available.

1099
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:20.050
And,
you know,
I spent a lot of time thinking about this too,
you know,
uh,

1100
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.920
in terms of what,
what I was going to face to eye,
I had a,

1101
01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:27.870
I had one really terrific mentor.
Um,
uh,

1102
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.250
when I graduated from the Naval Academy,

1103
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.320
I spent like two months as a drill officer at the,

1104
01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:41.540
at the end with the new class coming in before we reported to,
to basic school.

1105
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.170
And I was a battalion drill officer.
There were six of us,

1106
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.250
there were six battalions.

1107
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.280
I got the marine battalion officer who had just gotten out of the hospital from,

1108
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:55.850
had been wounded and content.
It was a company commander,
Alpha one one.

1109
01:08:56.690 --> 01:09:01.400
And uh,
he was terrific.
Bill Stenson was his name and uh,
you know,

1110
01:09:01.401 --> 01:09:04.040
he'd been shot,
he'd been blown up and,

1111
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.830
and he was like so easy.
I mean,

1112
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:12.080
no bullshit,
easy,
um,

1113
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.760
and easy as a leader.
And so the other,

1114
01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:20.780
the other five drill officers in my class,
they,
they got their own office,

1115
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.200
you know,
with their battalion officer.
And Stensilan goes,

1116
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:28.280
why do you need an office?
He said,
you know,
so you're a lieutenant,

1117
01:09:28.281 --> 01:09:29.810
now you get an office,
why do you need an off?

1118
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:31.100
Why don't you just sit in my office?

1119
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:35.990
So I'd sat in his office and every day was like,

1120
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:40.930
you know,
talking back and forth,
you know,
and I'd go out and I do,
you know,
lunch,

1121
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.580
I go do my four miles and do all my stuff.
And he'd come back and he said,

1122
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:47.900
what are you doing?
That's all.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm getting ready to go to Vietnam.

1123
01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:50.870
He says,
you would've noticed like in Vietnam,
he said,

1124
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:53.570
I'm going to take you out tonight and we're going to get really,

1125
01:09:53.571 --> 01:09:56.450
really drunk and I'm going to keep you up all night.

1126
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.300
And then tomorrow you're going to work.

1127
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.380
<v 0>That's what it feels like.
And he did,</v>

1128
01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.870
you know,
in the next day it was like,
aw man,
please don't talk so loud,
sir.

1129
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:12.850
And then,
uh,
before I,
before I left,

1130
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.550
<v 2>one of the things I,
you know,
I talked to him about four,
I left for basic school.</v>

1131
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:19.270
I said,
what did it feel like to get shot at?
And he goes,

1132
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.860
look,
don't even think about that stuff.
I mean it's just,
you know,

1133
01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.960
forget about that stuff.
Just do your job.
You know,

1134
01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.080
and I was the very first thing I thought about when I took that that patrol out.

1135
01:10:29.081 --> 01:10:31.990
I could hear a stunt,
someone gone,
just don't even think about that stuff.

1136
01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:32.853
You know,

1137
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.350
<v 0>I'm going to take it to the book here for a minute cause uh,</v>

1138
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.020
well this is the chapter called Helen,

1139
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.240
this very small place and it talks about exactly what you're saying here.

1140
01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:43.021
So back to the book.

1141
01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:46.620
From the day of my arrival as platoon commander with dying Delta,

1142
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.350
we had been engaged in continuous combat operations,

1143
01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:54.360
intensified in recent weeks by a series of unpredictable vicious firefights

1144
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:56.910
despite a steady flow of individual replacements.

1145
01:10:56.911 --> 01:11:00.780
The numerical field strength of our rifle company had been reduced by about half

1146
01:11:00.781 --> 01:11:05.490
over the past three months.
This was an equal opportunity battlefield.

1147
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:09.480
We lost marines through every possibility that infantry combat offered,

1148
01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:12.990
including gunshot wounds from several different caliber weapons,

1149
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:17.460
all kinds of shrapnel,
large caliber rockets,
rocket propelled grenades,

1150
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:20.600
RPGs,
different sorts of hand grenades,

1151
01:11:20.601 --> 01:11:25.601
61 and 82 millimeter mortar fire recoilless rifles plus landmines of every size

1152
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:29.880
from a grenade to large caliber artillery shells.

1153
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:35.540
The rifle platoons were largely made up of young both officers and enlisted by

1154
01:11:36.151 --> 01:11:40.110
1969 the vaunted ranks of the career and staff Nco.

1155
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:43.170
Those who historically been the backbone of the Marine Corps.

1156
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:48.270
We're showing the effects of four years of heavy combat in the infantry

1157
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:48.841
battalions.

1158
01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:53.841
That impact was both visible and profound within a few days of my,

1159
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.230
within a few days,
my platoon sergeant,
the fourth marine,

1160
01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:03.231
to hold this key position in the past three months would leave us a severe case

1161
01:12:03.241 --> 01:12:05.160
of ringworm covering his torso,

1162
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.370
including his entire crotch area up front and back.

1163
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:12.900
My first platoon sergeant had been hit by a booby trap while maneuvering one

1164
01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:16.740
segment of our platoon onto original line during an extensive firefight,

1165
01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:21.660
suffering,
suffering shrapnel wounds in his hands and arms and stomach area,

1166
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.900
blowing off pieces of his fingers and slicing his bladder.

1167
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.120
The second platoon sergeant had served with us for a couple of weeks and then

1168
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:32.220
was sent by the company commander to another unit.

1169
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:37.050
The third had picked up his third purple heart after being hit by an RPG and

1170
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:38.910
thus had been rotated out of Vietnam.

1171
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:44.550
The fifth on his second Vietnam tour became sick of the constant combat and

1172
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:48.390
suddenly decided to leave the Marine Corp and our rifle company when his

1173
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:51.750
enlistment expired.
Toward the end of this very operation.

1174
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.940
In practical terms,

1175
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:57.840
this turbulence intensified the relationships between the platoon commanders in

1176
01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.960
the squad leaders as daily life and death.

1177
01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:05.250
Tactical decisions would need needed to be made in these relationships.

1178
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:10.460
I often ended up being the oldest and most wizened voice at the age of 23 I was

1179
01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:15.660
now on my fourth platoon radio operator,

1180
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:17.760
who within weeks would be shot through his elbow,

1181
01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.790
ending his days in the Marine Corps.
Two months before in April,

1182
01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:23.100
I had lost two radio operators in one day.

1183
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:27.630
The first shop through that the hand by the end by an enemy sniper as he held

1184
01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:31.230
the receiver of our PRC 25 radio in the middle of a firefight.

1185
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.650
Luckily for our platoon,
if not for him,

1186
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.970
his handed partially shielded the radio handset which survived the bullet.

1187
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.661
Otherwise,

1188
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:43.950
we would have been isolated surrounded by hundreds of mobile and highly adept

1189
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:47.040
enemy soldiers on combat patrols.

1190
01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:49.800
That ranged far away from our company headquarters.

1191
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.850
The tactical radio was our sole means of communicating our position and to call

1192
01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:55.680
in artillery support and medivacs.

1193
01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:01.020
This of course was why the enemy loves to shoot at it.
An hour later,

1194
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:03.510
the second radio operator had been blown off.

1195
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:07.350
His feet hit below the knees in both legs by a booby trap.

1196
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:12.310
As we assaulted a ridge radio operators did not have much luck in my platoon.

1197
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.030
By the time I left the platoon,
I had gone through six.

1198
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.230
Two of my original three squad leaders had been killed,

1199
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.580
one by an enemy rocket and the other from a gunshot wound to the chest.

1200
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:30.220
The third had been shot through the lung and in the liver during the onset of an

1201
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:33.040
enemy ambush.
Although grievously wounded,

1202
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.940
he had survived the fire fight and was later medivac to a navy hospital ship.

1203
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:42.220
And so it had been for the officers who had initially staffed our rifle company.

1204
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.820
The first platoon commander had been killed three weeks before.

1205
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:48.220
The second platoon commander had been lightly wounded.

1206
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:49.750
Less than two weeks before,

1207
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:53.800
and within the next few weeks would suffer a serious gunshot wound in his upper

1208
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:56.650
thigh.
A bullet narrowly missing it and artery.

1209
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.690
I had been lightly wounded and would be seriously wounded a month later.

1210
01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:14.090
<v 2>Well,
let's set the stage.
Um,</v>

1211
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.160
let's start the final a couple of days in and basic school because one of the

1212
01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:23.220
most important,
uh,
what's a speech?

1213
01:15:23.221 --> 01:15:27.420
But one of the most important speeches that I had listened to during my

1214
01:15:27.421 --> 01:15:31.650
preparation time was given that,
and there was a burrito lieutenant colonel,
uh,

1215
01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:36.770
who was assigned to the basic school who asks to talk to the infantry

1216
01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:37.861
lieutenants.

1217
01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:42.861
We had to think s it's somewhere in the 70s of our 243 who finished basics,

1218
01:15:44.131 --> 01:15:47.520
who all were assigned to the infantry.
And

1219
01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:53.530
the sky was highly respected.
He had been,
uh,

1220
01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.720
an enlisted marine or rifleman,
well Jima.

1221
01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:00.630
He had been a platoon commander in Korea,
recipient of the navy cross,

1222
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:05.610
and had just finished commanding a battalion in Vietnam.
And he said,

1223
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:08.250
I,
I want you to understand something.

1224
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.720
Vietnam is the hardest war the marine corps has ever fought,

1225
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.840
not simply because of the casualties,

1226
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:19.740
which by the way ended up being higher even than World War II if you combine

1227
01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:22.610
killed and wounded,
more killed in World War II.
Um,

1228
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:27.000
but because of the living conditions that,
that these marines are facing,

1229
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.370
um,
were you,

1230
01:16:31.371 --> 01:16:34.700
at this excerpt you were reading was sort of in the middle of an,

1231
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:39.660
of an operation?
Uh,
in addition to those types of,
of,

1232
01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:44.340
uh,
experiences people rarely understand in,

1233
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:49.290
in America the America of then and particularly in America to have today for

1234
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:54.310
what it was like to be in the marine infantry in Vietnam.

1235
01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:00.160
Tickly of all of them put particularly out in [inaudible] province were we

1236
01:17:00.471 --> 01:17:05.400
fought.
Um,
the marines fought in five provinces,
uh,
in,

1237
01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:10.420
in Vietnam.
Um,
Kwong tree,
which is where case on and,
uh,

1238
01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:14.930
up next to the DMC,
uh,
to attend,
which has worked way,
was,

1239
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:19.640
uh,
quite numb.
I would west of Denang,
we're where we fought,

1240
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:20.893
uh,

1241
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.900
in a quiet and shy and quiet tin was also a province then.

1242
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.140
It's not a province now,

1243
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:32.830
but a plurality and almost a majority of the marines killed in Vietnam were

1244
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:40.130
killed in [inaudible] province.
And I can't give you a really major battle.

1245
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:41.780
I mean,
there's some,
uh,

1246
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:47.050
operations that are notable in sort of Marine Corps law,
but you know,

1247
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:49.460
no one in the country would,
would even recognize them.

1248
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.760
These were squad platoon company size engagements.

1249
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.810
Um,
and we're the constant,

1250
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:02.690
constant combat activity.
Uh,

1251
01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:07.760
and where the marines operated,
we're usually outside of anything.

1252
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.720
We didn't have tents,
Barb wire,
we didn't have cots,

1253
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.040
we didn't have electricity,
didn't have hot food,
didn't have clean water.

1254
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.333
Uh,

1255
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:21.710
it was an extraordinarily rough environment in terms of hygiene,

1256
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.970
potential disease and just the wear and tear foot put on human bodies.

1257
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.120
So you put that on top of the combat side.

1258
01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:34.430
And then on top of what you had mentioned earlier,

1259
01:18:34.431 --> 01:18:39.431
which is the constant flow of people through the apparatus that was the combat

1260
01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:43.760
unit and the political tensions.

1261
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:47.960
And in the country you put all that together,
you have a very,

1262
01:18:47.961 --> 01:18:50.690
very tough,
uh,
environment where,
uh,

1263
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.280
where the marines lived and also where the young leaders operated.
Um,
so,

1264
01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:59.270
you know,
when I'm taking over a rifle platoon,
uh,
in,
in,
uh,

1265
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.490
that area called Anwar Basin,
um,

1266
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:08.090
I'm just off the plane.
You know,
we've graduated from basic school at 10 days,

1267
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:12.440
travel 10 days,
proceed a little bit of leave,
get on the plane,
um,

1268
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:17.210
go through Okinawa for,
uh,
you know,
to kind of get your,
your,
uh,

1269
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.380
time zones straight.

1270
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.520
And then I didn't even know what regiment over division I was going to.

1271
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:26.070
When I hit Vietnam Day,
you,
we got to uh,
um,

1272
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.700
actually an on Okinawa.
They decided whether you,

1273
01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.240
which division you were going to go to.
Okay,
we're looking at the casualty flow.

1274
01:19:32.241 --> 01:19:35.810
You guys,
you're going to third MAR DIV,
you guys,
you're on the first smart.
If,
uh,

1275
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.380
and then when you got to done ang headquarters of the first marine division,

1276
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:41.210
they would kind of sort us out to which,

1277
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.000
which regiment we were going to a regimen.
They say,
okay,

1278
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:46.610
you're going to first battalion or first battalion.
I said,

1279
01:19:46.611 --> 01:19:49.530
Delta Delta needs a platoon commander.
Um,

1280
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:54.090
and get on a convoy,
take off the,
the,
the,

1281
01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:56.270
the company had been through some,
you know,

1282
01:19:56.271 --> 01:20:01.271
some serious combat and the previous days I think they'd had five platoon

1283
01:20:01.821 --> 01:20:05.080
commanders and the previous five or six months.
Uh,

1284
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:08.650
so Diane Gunther was the,
where was the nickname?
Yeah.

1285
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.770
Is that like a derogatory or was that just gallows humor?
We kind of liked it.

1286
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:18.740
You just got a deadly dying Delta or dog tired Delta,
whatever.

1287
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:23.130
But you're constantly on the move.
Um,
and you know,

1288
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.140
I'm new and they are justifiably,
they're gone.
Oh man,
here we got a new guy here.

1289
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:29.580
Now what?
Um,

1290
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:34.450
and there's always in the realm of leadership,
the,

1291
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.610
the relationship that you have to put into place and you don't,
you know,
some,

1292
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:43.200
some people like to say like to say,
okay,
when lieutenant comes in,

1293
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:47.570
you can be like the observer for a while and go along and patrol.

1294
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.570
And what rarely did those people ever fully take over their platoon?

1295
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:56.040
You're the ready or you're not ready.
And so I,
and I,
I picked up my platoon,

1296
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.970
I got them on a side of a hill and I explain,
you know,

1297
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.160
did you insert into the field to take home over?
Did you,

1298
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:06.360
did you go right into the foyer?

1299
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.300
They were on the move that we're on the move from liberty bridge,

1300
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:13.400
the Henderson Hill on a company move the convoy pass by.
I jumped off the convoy,

1301
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:17.790
I talked on the radio to our,
our,
our company commander,
you know,
before,

1302
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.940
um,
and I didn't even get three days in Ann Wass.
I'm,
you know,

1303
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:23.280
usually at three days in a handoff for familiar racing.
He said,
this,

1304
01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:27.090
this guy's class aren't a mentor and basic school.
Get 'em out here now and a,

1305
01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:31.020
so I took these guys overhead,
I'm on the side of the hill and I said,
you know,

1306
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.980
this is Bob Tinbergen is booked at Nightingale song called us and audition for a

1307
01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:39.570
fragging.
I said,
uh,
all right,
I'm Lieutenant Webb,

1308
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:44.310
you call me lieutenant or you call me Sir and this is what I expect.

1309
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:49.200
And I laid it all out,
you know,
and uh,
and one of the things I said,

1310
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.590
which I think is very important,
and when you're,
when you're leading anything,

1311
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:55.470
I said,
I want you to know something.
Anything you tell me,

1312
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:58.980
I will believe anything.
You tell me,
the sky's Brown.
I'll believe you.

1313
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.940
And if you lie to me,
you're dead meat.
And so there was like,

1314
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.730
the hell does this guy think he's doing,
you know?

1315
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:08.800
And then we went out that night,
you know,
and I sat down,
I planned it,
we,
we,

1316
01:22:08.801 --> 01:22:12.530
we moved to the new perimeter.
I went in,
I called my squad leaders together,

1317
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:16.410
company size,
perimeter,
company size perimeter.
Um,
I've got,

1318
01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:19.380
I've got my squad leaders NSI and we've got an IDAC and we're going to go here

1319
01:22:19.381 --> 01:22:23.460
and,
uh,
think it was a few locks.
Um,
you know,
got their input.
Listen,
listen,

1320
01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:26.310
listen.
You always listened.
You know,
being the commander doesn't mean you know,

1321
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:29.670
all the answers.
It,
it means you don't have to make a decision,
you know,
and,

1322
01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:33.610
and how to,
how to follow through.
Um,
and,
uh,

1323
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:35.940
so I figured it out.
Can I listen to them?

1324
01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:37.750
I figured out a place where we would go.
Uh,

1325
01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:41.700
I had a really terrific squad leader who was actually acting platoon commander

1326
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.730
that afternoon.
Um,
and set a series on calls,
bid over.

1327
01:22:46.731 --> 01:22:50.250
You know,
cause I'm thinking the basic school taught you went out that night,

1328
01:22:50.251 --> 01:22:55.200
walked in,
you know,
walked into a situation,
used all the,
you know,

1329
01:22:55.590 --> 01:23:00.060
the supporting arms,
did our,
did our thing,
and that was put to rest,

1330
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:04.320
which was actually a good thing.
And then the other thing,

1331
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:09.250
which I think is so important,
you know,
when you say,
know your people,
know,

1332
01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.890
you know,
what's the leadership.
Leadership is knowledge.
Know your people,

1333
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.000
know your job,

1334
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:17.620
know their job and know the next job because you never know when something's

1335
01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:21.850
going to happen and you're going to have that next job.
And it's character.

1336
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:25.540
And part of part of character is consistency and humility before your people,

1337
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.550
you know,
and as you mentioned from what the excerpt about my dad,
moral courage,

1338
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:31.570
there's different kinds of courage.

1339
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.180
Moral courage is sometimes you've got to take the hits,

1340
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:38.620
you got to lay out what you believe is right and you got to stay with it.
Um,

1341
01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:43.540
and you know,
vision,
in other words,
what even taking over a rifle platoon,

1342
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:46.590
you know,
they,
they knew fairly quickly.

1343
01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:51.670
I knew what I was expecting even though I hadn't done it yet.

1344
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.720
Uh,
but knowledge of people and listening to people.

1345
01:23:55.721 --> 01:23:58.460
I would go in and one of the first,
you know,

1346
01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.730
month or so that I was a platoon commander,

1347
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:03.130
I would take three hours to set my lines in every night,

1348
01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:07.180
sit down every fighting hole,
talk to every one of my marines.

1349
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.620
And you find out as,
you know,

1350
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:13.650
you find out really interesting things about maybe simple things like somebody

1351
01:24:14.141 --> 01:24:17.020
hadn't gotten paid or somebody got married and had a Q a Lot,

1352
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:20.200
must not going to his wife and nobody's taken kip.
Just simple things,
you know.

1353
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.480
Um,
and then,
uh,
you know,
then the bonds move from there.

1354
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:32.210
<v 0>Uh,
you,
you just,
just to reiterate the conditions,
cause I,</v>

1355
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:33.710
I pulled out this,

1356
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.880
this section in here where you talk about the conditions and just to reiterate

1357
01:24:37.881 --> 01:24:41.210
what you're talking about,
going back to the book here in,
in the rifle companies,

1358
01:24:41.211 --> 01:24:45.320
we spent endless months patrolling ridge lines and villages and mountains far

1359
01:24:45.321 --> 01:24:46.640
away from tense barbed wire.

1360
01:24:46.641 --> 01:24:50.840
Hot food or electricity luxuries were limited to what we could fit inside one's

1361
01:24:50.841 --> 01:24:55.700
pack,
which after a few humps usually boiled down to letter writing,

1362
01:24:55.701 --> 01:24:59.450
material towel,
soap,
toothbrush,
Poncho liner,

1363
01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:03.200
and a small transistor radio due to casualties and disease.

1364
01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.730
During this period in the war,

1365
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:09.790
relatively few marines would actually survive a full 13 month tour as members of

1366
01:25:10.251 --> 01:25:13.010
rifle companies in the Bush of the basin,

1367
01:25:13.730 --> 01:25:18.680
we move through the boiling heat carrying 60 pounds of weapons in gear causing a

1368
01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:23.660
typical marine to drop 20% of his body weight while in the bush.

1369
01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:25.693
When we stopped,

1370
01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.930
we dug chest deep fighting holes and slit trenches for toilets.

1371
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:35.420
We slept on the ground under makeshift Poncho hooches and when it rained we

1372
01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:39.530
usually took down our hooches because wet poncho shown under illumination flares

1373
01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:41.090
making great targets.

1374
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:46.270
Sleep itself was fitful never more than an hour or two at a stretch for months

1375
01:25:46.581 --> 01:25:50.800
at a time as we mixed daytime patrolling with nighttime ambushes,

1376
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.190
listening posts,
foxhole duty and radio watches,
ringworm,

1377
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:56.270
hookworm,

1378
01:25:56.390 --> 01:26:00.500
malaria dysentery were common as was trench foot,

1379
01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.370
which in Vietnam was called immersion foot.
When the monsoons came,

1380
01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:10.260
re respites for was rotating back to the mud filled regimental combat base at

1381
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:16.391
and Hawaii for four or five days where rocket and mortar attacks were frequent

1382
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.790
and our troops man defensive bunkers at night,
that was your break time.

1383
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:30.640
<v 2>And Wa
they called it little d and Ben food there,</v>

1384
01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:33.920
you know,
because yeah,
they had a son that's actually welcomed the little deal.

1385
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:34.980
Then food and you know,

1386
01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.230
at least they kept their sense of humor to vertically all the first,
you know,

1387
01:26:38.290 --> 01:26:41.440
how people,
gallows humor,

1388
01:26:41.441 --> 01:26:44.800
here's what gets you through that kind of stuff.
Um,
and,

1389
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:48.950
and to sort of set the tone of the,
um,
uh,
on the,
on the,

1390
01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:50.240
on the tactical side,

1391
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:56.240
do you need to remember in terms of what was happening to the country at this

1392
01:26:56.241 --> 01:27:00.860
time?
This was a award that hadn't been going on and it had its controversies,

1393
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.870
but hundreds of people were dying every week,
still every week.
Um,

1394
01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:09.440
I brought this,
and I know we're not on TV,
but I brought this,

1395
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:12.140
there's like a circle once the audio,
you know,
you're,

1396
01:27:12.141 --> 01:27:15.620
you're welcome to keep us and make copies of it if you would send it back to me.

1397
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.270
But this was the cover of life magazine.
June 27th night,
June 27th,
1969.

1398
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:25.520
Average week in this,
during this period,
this was the period of hamburger hill,

1399
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:29.660
et cetera.
The,
uh,
242 Americans died that week.
Two of,

1400
01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:33.330
of our marines are in,
in that.
Um,
but,
uh,

1401
01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.560
in a post,
a post [inaudible] 69 period,

1402
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:42.640
which was April,
May,
um,

1403
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:47.510
we were losing more than 400 Americans dead a week.
Uh,
you know,

1404
01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:50.970
even though the warhead for the Americans in casual,

1405
01:27:50.971 --> 01:27:54.910
he's had peaked in 1968.
The,

1406
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:58.610
the three worst years for combat for the Americans,

1407
01:27:58.611 --> 01:28:03.430
Vietnam were 67,
68 and 69.
They're like the top of the bell curve.

1408
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.230
Um,
we had an in in 69,

1409
01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:11.260
I think we lost twice as many Americans killed as have been killed in Iraq and

1410
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:15.920
Afghanistan and the entire war.
Uh,
and you know,

1411
01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:20.240
the American people supported this and I've always believed in what we were

1412
01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:22.760
attempting to do,
however,
are screwed up it got.

1413
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:26.960
But if you're out here in the,
uh,
in the [inaudible] basin,

1414
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.313
um,

1415
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:34.510
the one thing that a good rifle platoon or company commander or a battalion

1416
01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:42.200
commander learned was how to adapt,
how to adapt.

1417
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:46.730
You couldn't rarely,
you could rarely plan,
uh,

1418
01:28:46.731 --> 01:28:50.180
operations.
Um,
you know,
sort of like,

1419
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:51.920
like Mike Tyson said about being in a fight.

1420
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:55.050
Everything is great until the first time you get hit,
you know,
uh,

1421
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.870
on any given patrol,
uh,
uh,
or,

1422
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:04.230
or day in San Juan Basin,
particular in Arizona Valley,
you could hit,

1423
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:09.510
you know,
some idiot with not idiot.
So maybe some smart,

1424
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.620
smart individual or small group of people with a couple of grenades.

1425
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:17.850
Or You could hit a main force Viet Cong unit,

1426
01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:19.500
which was heavily north Vietnamese,

1427
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:24.540
or you could hit a large for large force,
a north Vietnamese.

1428
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:27.360
We fought in in May of 1968 and [inaudible] nine,

1429
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:31.980
we fought with the 90th regimen in the Arizona Valley and went on for eight days

1430
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:33.330
and,
and,
and eight nights.

1431
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:36.900
We had a north Vietnamese division and base area one 12,

1432
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:40.500
right off from where we were,
the,
the mountain started,
uh,

1433
01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:44.940
up into Laos where the coachman and trail and that sort of thing.
Uh,

1434
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.830
we had,
uh,
uh,

1435
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.480
a very fine of Viet Cong Regiment,

1436
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:54.720
which was,
you know,
rather rare that an independent regiment,

1437
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:57.570
the first VC regimen,
uh,
we had to Qa,

1438
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:01.680
third main force force battalion that we're operating out of the Arizona Valley.

1439
01:30:01.681 --> 01:30:03.600
And then you had a lot of cats and dogs.

1440
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:09.110
And the other thing was this area basically been written off by my American war

1441
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:15.600
planners in terms of the,
the,
uh,
politicization,
you know,

1442
01:30:15.601 --> 01:30:19.050
they're bringing into the south Vietnamese government at that time.

1443
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.500
They categorized villages until categorized villages,
um,

1444
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:29.270
a through e,
uh,
in terms of loyalty to the South Vietnamese government.

1445
01:30:29.271 --> 01:30:33.180
A was totally loyal.
He was totally the other way.

1446
01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.300
And then they had category five,
which was politically hopeless,
just for credit.

1447
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.460
And,
uh,
by 1958,
you know,
the,
the,

1448
01:30:40.461 --> 01:30:44.670
the country was divided in 1954.
And knowing that people came south,

1449
01:30:44.671 --> 01:30:48.750
including my wife's entire family,
not very many,
what north,

1450
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.050
basically Kadri went north and they trained.

1451
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.870
And starting in 1958,

1452
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.760
they started moving back into central Vietnam.
The Haute humans idea was to,

1453
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:05.400
whoever was doing his planning was,
was to cut off central Vietnam first.
Anom uh,

1454
01:31:05.401 --> 01:31:10.401
and so you had these assassination squads move into,

1455
01:31:10.561 --> 01:31:15.360
into this area.
Uh,
and by 1961,

1456
01:31:15.361 --> 01:31:18.870
they were killing 11 government officials,
uh,
day.
Uh,

1457
01:31:18.871 --> 01:31:22.420
and that was by John Kennedy's,
uh,

1458
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:26.970
account when he decided to start increasing our,
our troops there.

1459
01:31:26.971 --> 01:31:30.810
So the villages had had their fights,
uh,

1460
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:34.990
beginning 58 heavily 58 to 62,
that time period.
And,
uh,

1461
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:36.540
those who are staying with,

1462
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:41.570
with the communist basically had kicked out the people who weren't a lot of move

1463
01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:45.570
to Danang and some of them later to Saigon.
So out where we were.

1464
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.520
I say this because operationally the populated villages that we,

1465
01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.990
uh,
that we operated in,
you know,
they had big family bunkers.

1466
01:31:54.991 --> 01:31:58.380
They were very,
uh,
you know,

1467
01:31:58.381 --> 01:32:02.920
there was stoic when we went through there,
people were up in the mountains.
Uh,

1468
01:32:02.921 --> 01:32:03.431
we had,

1469
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:08.431
we had a no illusions that they were going to be moving to our,

1470
01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.110
our side at least during the,
you know,

1471
01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:13.210
I never thought the world was going to end the way that it did,

1472
01:32:13.211 --> 01:32:15.160
but at least during the period that we were there,

1473
01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:23.940
<v 0>I,
we were chatting about this a little bit before,</v>

1474
01:32:23.941 --> 01:32:26.970
but I wanted to call out this won't one point from the book.
Um,

1475
01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:31.040
almost every marine who has ever fallen close combat can relay a stories of

1476
01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:33.240
short round stray rounds,
misdirected shots,

1477
01:32:33.241 --> 01:32:37.530
accidental discharges and other chaos resulting from friendly fire mortars.

1478
01:32:37.531 --> 01:32:40.890
Artillery in airstrikes can easily wander from their intended targets,

1479
01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:45.360
sometimes due to map error and other at,
at other times because of human error.

1480
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:50.370
Historically friendly fire incidents during mobile close combat operations make

1481
01:32:50.371 --> 01:32:52.800
up about 10% of casualties.

1482
01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:57.330
Intramural fire fights can break out among of friendly units that misidentify

1483
01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.830
their fellow infantry men,

1484
01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:03.240
particularly while moving through enemy terrain at night.

1485
01:33:03.630 --> 01:33:07.560
And you got one incident that you call up the ch 46 helicopter approach to the

1486
01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:08.220
perimeter,

1487
01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:13.220
ready to drop our day's load to Huey gunships circle overhead flying for cover

1488
01:33:13.730 --> 01:33:16.320
behind highly vulnerable resupply helicopter,

1489
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.740
which would soon be hovering above the battlefield and slowly descending into

1490
01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:22.860
the small dirt clearing we had scraped out to make a landing zone.

1491
01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:24.720
At the center of our perimeter.

1492
01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:27.870
The strobe light flashed showing the pilot where to land,

1493
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:30.960
but circling in the weed beds,

1494
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:36.120
one of the gunships mistook the strobe light for the tracer bullets of an enemy

1495
01:33:36.121 --> 01:33:36.954
machine gun.

1496
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:42.060
The Huey immediately powered toward us in a low attack line that came in just

1497
01:33:42.061 --> 01:33:46.290
above our heads.
Strafing are weary,
beleaguered preliminar perimeter.

1498
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:50.100
It's machine guns spitting out hundreds of seven,
six two millimeter bullets.

1499
01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.080
I had just climbed a small sand dune to urinate at an empty spot away from the

1500
01:33:55.081 --> 01:33:59.700
perimeter.
Poncho hooches and radios of my platoon command post,

1501
01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:03.930
but he was machine guns sprayed back and forth inside our lines,

1502
01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:06.510
kicking up a trail of dust spots just below my feet.

1503
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:11.430
As I stood in the open after one pass,
the Huey was finally waved away back into,

1504
01:34:11.431 --> 01:34:15.930
it's circling defensive laps around our perimeter exposed as we were.

1505
01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:20.460
It seemed a miracle that only one marine radio operator near the strobe light in

1506
01:34:20.461 --> 01:34:24.870
our company command post was hit taking a bullet in the stomach.

1507
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.640
Well I,
it's

1508
01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.490
<v 2>one among among many and when you're,
when you're fighting so,</v>

1509
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:37.150
so close,
uh,
you know,

1510
01:34:37.151 --> 01:34:42.151
and actually that that incident occurred not too long after an arc light strike.

1511
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:46.990
We were doing the BDA on an arc light.
Um,
it was one of the great ironies.

1512
01:34:46.991 --> 01:34:48.850
If I might,
may digress just a little bit,

1513
01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:53.851
cause I think it's important to point out that in our operational concepts,

1514
01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.560
we never used a B 52 is north of then we never until 1972,

1515
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:09.230
the Christmas bombing,
uh,
of,
of Hanoi.
Um,
and when I go back,

1516
01:35:09.231 --> 01:35:13.310
I've been back to Vietnam 28 at the last 29 years.
I speak Vietnamese.
I,
you know,

1517
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:18.200
I,
uh,
we,
we still have our disagreements,
but,
uh,
you know,

1518
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:22.690
I go back there and when I first started going back to the Vietnam,
uh,

1519
01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:27.620
in the early nineties,
everybody wanted to talk about that eight days.
Everybody,

1520
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:28.140
you know,

1521
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:31.370
when they did this and they were living under the illusion that they were

1522
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:34.430
withstanding American air power when we had these light aircraft,

1523
01:35:34.431 --> 01:35:37.820
like John Mccain's aircraft coming in and,
you know,
making the runs when,

1524
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:41.480
if somebody had made a different decision.
I mean,
a war is a war.

1525
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:43.490
If somebody made a different decision,
things might've,

1526
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.630
might've happened differently.

1527
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:49.810
But we did use arc lights on the area that we supposedly we're,

1528
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:54.770
we're trying to salvage,
you know,
go Noi island.
Um,
you know,

1529
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:58.670
we lit that place up.
We were,
uh,
our,
uh,

1530
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.170
our company was,
I think three clicks away.
When,
when that,

1531
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:06.200
when that arc light landed and I was holding onto the ground,

1532
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:09.230
move into the right and to the left,
you know,
um,
how many,

1533
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:11.160
how many pounds of bombs would get dropped her and run.

1534
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:13.970
I've got some statistics in there,

1535
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:18.770
but just thousands and thousands of pounds of,
of uh,

1536
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.220
you know,
three,
three 50 be 50 twos would go over.
And actually I think in there,

1537
01:36:23.221 --> 01:36:27.950
I put the number,
I uh,
but um,
you know,
so,

1538
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.030
but,
uh,
to the,
uh,

1539
01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.370
the friendly fire incidents and how close it was,
um,

1540
01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.650
you know,
we,
the way that we would mark,
um,

1541
01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.810
our areas when we're,
when you're unclos hair in that environment,
uh,

1542
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.330
you know,
this isn't about the helicopter hitting our,
our guy that was a,

1543
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:52.730
you know,
mistaking the strobe for a machine gun round.
But in general,

1544
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.450
you always run your air strikes parallel to your lines because you don't want

1545
01:36:56.451 --> 01:37:00.800
them to drop short,
you know,
and drop on you.
So they have to make a run,
you know,

1546
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.370
in May.
And we put air panels out.
Usually sometimes we pop a smoke,

1547
01:37:04.371 --> 01:37:08.500
but it's better with their air panels during the day.
Um,
and,
uh,

1548
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.560
so they knew they'd make a run before they drop.
And,
uh,
so they,
you know,

1549
01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:17.300
they'd say,
okay,
yeah,
no,
you're too close.
No,
you're not,
or whatever.

1550
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:20.480
And,
uh,
we had one in,
uh,

1551
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:26.050
during this period where we were fighting the 90th regiment out there in Arizona

1552
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:30.960
Valley and May,
we were running and our strike,
uh,

1553
01:37:30.961 --> 01:37:33.620
against an NBA unit and a tree line,
but 400 meters away.

1554
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:38.090
And we had at force coming in,
you know,
an air force,
a fire.
It's not a bomber.

1555
01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:43.340
I mean,
we use them for bombers,
but,
uh,
so the f four pilots,
they're coming in at,

1556
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:45.350
I don't know,
450 knots,
whatever it is,

1557
01:37:45.351 --> 01:37:47.750
and they're there looking out the side of their window to see,

1558
01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.340
to see what's on the ground.
So we were running the,
uh,
the air force.

1559
01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.320
I had,
my platoon actually was,
uh,

1560
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.490
we had rear security and the perimeter while they were doing this.
And,
um,

1561
01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.880
they made their run.

1562
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:04.840
And then they came on the second run and the the F four drop dos.
And uh,

1563
01:38:04.841 --> 01:38:09.750
it actually,
it bounced right outside our perimeter.

1564
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:12.620
And then,
you know,
what the hell,
I hear it,

1565
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:15.540
I hear it going right over the top of us.
So I turned around and I start,

1566
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:18.320
you know,
I want to go into the company CP and ask him what the hell is going on.

1567
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:22.500
So I'm walking through the scramble of Bushes and they always marines running,

1568
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.780
running the other way.
And this thing had bounced and we call it a snake.

1569
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:31.710
And Nape,
you know,
the,
the snake was the,
the way,
uh,
uh,

1570
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:35.130
like I kind of a propeller would break out of the tail to arm it when you,

1571
01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:38.550
when you're adopted.
And luckily the,

1572
01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:43.830
the tail had broken off of this bond when it hit.
And,
uh,
so,
but you know,

1573
01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:46.350
I turned around and these guys,
you know,

1574
01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:50.920
I see this thing flying through the air.
I thought it was a body,
you know,

1575
01:38:50.921 --> 01:38:53.850
it was this green thing flying through the air and going down to word the,

1576
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.760
or the CP.
And I'm going in and all these guys are running the other way.
And,

1577
01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.520
and that bomb had,

1578
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:04.580
had landed on the pack of our 80 ones fo artillery radio operator.

1579
01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:07.380
I mean pack those PAC board,
you know,
uh,

1580
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:11.700
dead center if that thing had gone off curtains,
you know.
Uh,

1581
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:15.230
and the other thing is night moves.
You know,
we're,

1582
01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:20.040
one of the things you learn is in,
in,
in,
uh,
when you,

1583
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:21.630
when you operate like the Fifth Marines did,

1584
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:25.980
is always be responsible for the person behind you,

1585
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:31.500
not the person in front of you.
Uh,
if you lose the person in front of you,
stop.

1586
01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.160
Don't try to catch up with them because there,

1587
01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:38.430
there were a number of friendly fire incidents where someone would get lost,

1588
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:43.440
uh,
try to catch up and up to the,
on the flank of,
of the,

1589
01:39:43.441 --> 01:39:46.110
the main unit and you'd have an intramural firefight.

1590
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.800
Luckily we didn't have that happen in my company,
but it happened,
uh,
in the,

1591
01:39:49.801 --> 01:39:52.920
in the fifth marines.
So you stop if you can't find the,

1592
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.070
see the guy in front of you,
stop.
And then if then,

1593
01:39:56.071 --> 01:39:59.490
if you can't see the person behind you,
then you retrace the exact,

1594
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:03.830
a route that you've been on to go pick them up.
Um,
so,

1595
01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:08.070
you know,
there were lessons that were learned and put into place.
Yeah.
We,
we,

1596
01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.780
we always talk about the fact that my life was my buddy's platoon commander,

1597
01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.980
uh,
with me.
He wrote books with me.
But,
um,

1598
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:20.040
he was saying,
you know,
if you had asked him before he went to Ramadi,

1599
01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:24.990
if we would have blue on blue,
you know,
fratricide situations,
he'd been like,
oh,

1600
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:28.650
there's no possible way.
And me,
same thing,
you know,
like it seemed like,

1601
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.800
especially in the seal teams,
it was like,
oh,
that's never,
that will,

1602
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:35.610
that will never happen.
It'll never happen.
And sure enough,
I mean,
there,

1603
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.900
in that book,
in our,
in our first book,
we happen to write about three different,

1604
01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.600
I mean,
there's 12 chapters in three of them,
concern,
friendly,

1605
01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:45.840
fire because you had to be more concerned about,
well,

1606
01:40:45.841 --> 01:40:46.820
not more concerned about you,

1607
01:40:46.821 --> 01:40:51.390
but you had to be at least as concerned about deconfliction and you know,

1608
01:40:51.391 --> 01:40:54.310
we would hang out.
We would hang,
you know,
giant aircraft

1609
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:56.590
<v 0>panels and once,
once my guys would take a building for a sniper,</v>

1610
01:40:56.591 --> 01:41:00.290
Overwatch position,
oftentimes if there was any question about where they were,

1611
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:02.470
they'd hang giant air panels right out the window,
right.

1612
01:41:02.471 --> 01:41:04.390
As soon as they started shooting.
And the enemy knew every word.

1613
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:07.720
We wanted to make sure that the friendlies knew where we were just as bad.

1614
01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:10.240
So yeah,
the,
the,
the um,

1615
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:13.030
the friendly fire problems that happened.

1616
01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:17.330
But when I came back and I started running training,
I would induce those and,

1617
01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.740
and,
and they happen to 100% of the platoons that I put through training.

1618
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:23.320
100% of them had had blue on blues,
you know,

1619
01:41:23.321 --> 01:41:28.321
with paint ball or with the laser tag system that we used because it's,

1620
01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:31.270
it's one of those things,
no one thinks it can happen to them,

1621
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:36.570
<v 2>you know.
The other,
the other part of that,
to be really frank here,
um,</v>

1622
01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:39.830
in the,
the,

1623
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:44.210
the areas where we were operating,
um,

1624
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:49.720
you know,
you,
you done,
we'd send night acts out every night,
you know,
you,
you,

1625
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.480
we can move.
We moved every three,
four days,
new perimeter.
Um,

1626
01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.210
you'd send out listening posts as an listening posts and ambushes,
um,

1627
01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:02.610
after dark.
And you know,
you've got marines out there.

1628
01:42:02.611 --> 01:42:06.120
They don't really know where they are,
you know,
I mean,
they don't have a map.

1629
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:09.540
You know,
he had two or three people in,
has a map.
Um,

1630
01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:14.790
and sometimes they are out where they're supposed to be,
where they are,

1631
01:42:14.791 --> 01:42:18.960
where they think they are.
Uh,
and sometimes,
you know,

1632
01:42:18.961 --> 01:42:23.880
if you get somebody who's getting a little flaky,
you know,
he'll say,
well,

1633
01:42:23.881 --> 01:42:24.950
we don't have to go out there and we'll,
let's,

1634
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:26.700
let's just go sit in this bomb crater here.

1635
01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:30.540
And they had an incident before I got to the company,
uh,
where,
uh,

1636
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:31.960
there was,
uh,

1637
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.490
a fire team that was sitting in a bomb crater about 50 meters out outside the

1638
01:42:35.491 --> 01:42:35.940
lines,

1639
01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:40.450
and a guy stood up at like two in the morning and take a leak and then Renin on

1640
01:42:40.451 --> 01:42:42.930
the line shot him.
And,
uh,
you know,

1641
01:42:42.931 --> 01:42:45.600
the guy who shot him ended up being a chaplain's assistant.
I mean,

1642
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:48.050
you live with that the rest of your life.
Uh,

1643
01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.370
and by the time I got to be company commander,
I,

1644
01:42:51.450 --> 01:42:55.230
I put something into place which was very effective.

1645
01:42:55.950 --> 01:43:00.950
And that is first thing I would do is I would send out my night acts when it was

1646
01:43:03.211 --> 01:43:08.130
still light and I would send them,
what I call it,
a day pause,
uh,

1647
01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.980
the listening post out to an outpost further away,
uh,

1648
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:15.000
the ambush to a site.

1649
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:18.600
I would have them walk by the site where they're,
you know,

1650
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:22.800
quietly check it out and then go to a,
to a pause,

1651
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:26.520
like a hundred meters away or whatever.
So,
and then when it got dark,

1652
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:30.700
they both were moving into known terrain,
um,
you know,

1653
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:35.640
the LP coming back toward the perimeter.
So they had a sense of security there,

1654
01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:39.930
the ambush,
having researched the,
you know,
the ambush and moving back into it.

1655
01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.140
And then I would mortar of their day pause.

1656
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:46.500
And the first time I did that,

1657
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:51.430
I had an ambulance out about click and a half away and they call and you got to

1658
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.360
be advised,
you're dropping mortars on us.
I said,

1659
01:43:53.361 --> 01:43:55.190
you are not where you're supposed to be doing.
What,

1660
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:58.240
what are you going to do if you,
if you hit something,
you know,
what do you know?

1661
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:01.100
Where are we going to do?
We're going to really drop rounds on you.
You know,

1662
01:44:01.170 --> 01:44:05.500
so god,
everything real straight,
your wedding down,

1663
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:09.700
drop borders on your people.
Make sure,
well,
if you're,

1664
01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.180
if I'm hitting you with a mortar,

1665
01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:13.910
you're not where you're supposed to be and it's going to get a lot worse if you

1666
01:44:13.911 --> 01:44:14.744
get hit out there.

1667
01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:20.080
<v 0>Well,
that's that,
that'll solve that problem.
Uh,
you,
you talk about,</v>

1668
01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:22.720
you know,
I walked in,
this is back of the book.

1669
01:44:22.721 --> 01:44:26.410
I walked every square kilometers writ of those ridges and rice fields.

1670
01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:29.320
I fought many of those villages.
I was wounded there.

1671
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:34.590
And here is where I and my fellow combat veterans stand on one side of a great

1672
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:39.040
impassable,
divide with the rest of the world on the other.

1673
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1674
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:42.833
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1675
01:44:42.930 --> 01:44:47.930
because every one of us knows that if our luck had run out or if someone among

1676
01:44:48.421 --> 01:44:51.210
us had made one inadvertent mistake,

1677
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.790
<v 2>we could have died there.
No question.
You can be.</v>

1678
01:44:55.791 --> 01:44:59.610
That's one thing about,
you know,
I've heard you talk about edis before,
you know,

1679
01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:01.290
I would say

1680
01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.300
25 to 30% of our casualties were iads.
Most of them were gunshot,

1681
01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:11.490
lot of shrapnel wounds.
Uh,
but with an IED,

1682
01:45:11.491 --> 01:45:15.750
there's nothing more demoralizing or booby trap is we call it the,
uh,

1683
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:20.670
and the particular,
you're moving at night,
the casualties are large.

1684
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:25.260
Uh,
and uh,
there's nowhere to put your anger,

1685
01:45:25.770 --> 01:45:30.480
you know it.
And if you're on that,
on the outside of that,

1686
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:34.380
you go,
Whoa,
you know,
that easily could have been me.

1687
01:45:34.410 --> 01:45:36.900
You can to be 100% right and still be dead.

1688
01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:39.660
We had one device on a night move.

1689
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:43.740
Every member of my platoon stepped over it on a,

1690
01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.670
on a narrow trail.
I was walking fourth,
fourth parade,

1691
01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.290
fourth marine in them in a column.

1692
01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:54.740
And the last I t we had a brand new guy.
I put them on tail end,
Charlie.

1693
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:56.680
It was a company move,
Raechel leading battalion,

1694
01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.690
but it was a company move and it was a,

1695
01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.600
some branch on the trail or something and called boom.
And,
uh,
you know,

1696
01:46:03.601 --> 01:46:07.890
whether a 19 casualties and a ambush after that.

1697
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:09.520
So you have,

1698
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.120
for those of you that aren't in the military when you're moving at night,

1699
01:46:12.121 --> 01:46:13.440
especially pre night vision,

1700
01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:16.350
then the only way you can do it is you have to be closer to the person in front

1701
01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:17.820
of you.
Cause you gotta be able to see them.

1702
01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.660
And so what that doesn't and you'll be within or within beating up in sometimes

1703
01:46:21.661 --> 01:46:24.360
when it's really dark,
you will be able to touch the person in front of you.

1704
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:28.470
So therefore,
if someone hits a booby trap or an Iud or you get ambushed,

1705
01:46:28.710 --> 01:46:33.120
the casualties are increased dramatically because you're just all together.

1706
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:39.380
<v 3>To add one thing about Ramadi on that is a,
I think when we got there,</v>

1707
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:44.030
they had 140 known IED is on the board any given time.
And uh,

1708
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:47.210
there were a couple different incidents on one.

1709
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:50.160
One particular that sticks in my mind was when we were putting in the 17th

1710
01:46:50.161 --> 01:46:54.350
street security station,
a friend of mine,
his platoon was out,
uh,

1711
01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:56.430
providing external security with gun trucks.

1712
01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:02.060
And I guess he saw his truck sat on an IED all night and they're right when they

1713
01:47:04.201 --> 01:47:07.170
were about to move it went off and took the front of the truck with it.

1714
01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:11.820
Luckily nobody was killed.
But it's uh,
it's not that you can shoot back at,

1715
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:13.050
you can't really prepare for it.

1716
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:17.290
<v 5>Yeah.
Sometimes you got to get lucky.
We had the similar thing where we,</v>

1717
01:47:17.410 --> 01:47:20.910
we will go into a combat outpost in a convoy of just,
you know,

1718
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:23.950
our seals hadn't do a convoy or heading to a combat outpost.

1719
01:47:24.490 --> 01:47:27.730
And my point man or lead driver,
someone said,
hey,

1720
01:47:27.731 --> 01:47:31.090
I think there's something ahead of us in the road,
stops the vehicle.

1721
01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:34.540
I'm actually watched him.
He gets out looking underneath the vehicle,

1722
01:47:34.541 --> 01:47:37.840
the flashlight to look and see.
I'm thinking to myself,
hmm,

1723
01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:41.980
this doesn't seem good.
Co didn't identify anything.
We roll through.

1724
01:47:41.981 --> 01:47:45.260
We get to the combat outpost.
And then a couple hours later,
uh,

1725
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:48.850
the dagger clearance team came through and found a triple stack,
you know,

1726
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:52.690
120 millimeter mortars that would've killed everyone in that vehicle for sure.

1727
01:47:52.691 --> 01:47:57.160
And if not a few others.
So,
uh,
sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

1728
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.650
And for those of you out there,
if you think you're on an ID,

1729
01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:04.210
maybe not the flashlight approach,
absolutely.
Quietly walk away.

1730
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:08.800
Yeah,
I had,
I do that.
It was my,
my first deployment to Iraq.

1731
01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.250
I'm standing there and my EOD guys,
we're doing a target at night.

1732
01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:14.160
My Eod guys find a,
uh,

1733
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:19.330
a booby trap and it was in a plan or box outside perfect spot where we're at.

1734
01:48:19.810 --> 01:48:23.270
Assault team would stack up and there was a little plant and it was filled with

1735
01:48:23.271 --> 01:48:26.740
a two or three 60 millimeter mortars that were rigged from the house.

1736
01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:32.080
And so my EOD guy found it was just,
you plug it into the wall and it goes off.

1737
01:48:32.170 --> 01:48:33.480
So there was,
and there was actually a little,

1738
01:48:33.670 --> 01:48:36.880
a little hole cut in the curtain so the guy could actually sit there and watch.

1739
01:48:36.881 --> 01:48:40.950
And when we rolled up,
boom.
And so he found the wire,
he saw it,

1740
01:48:40.951 --> 01:48:43.150
went out the window,
fault it out there,
finds the booby trap.

1741
01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:46.360
And I'm standing there watching him,
uh,
you know,

1742
01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:50.500
disarm this booby trap and he looks over his shoulder and he says,

1743
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:55.690
you might not want to stand here.
And I was like,
that's a good point.

1744
01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.220
I'll be a somewhere else.

1745
01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:04.560
<v 2>Well,
you know,
they,
uh,
in,
in this area,
in this area of Vietnam,</v>

1746
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:05.963
um,

1747
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:11.180
they could become accustomed to a lot of our operational decisions.

1748
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:14.460
You know,
we liked the high ground.

1749
01:49:14.461 --> 01:49:18.300
We like to get a spot where you can see some of these rice patties were like a

1750
01:49:18.301 --> 01:49:19.680
mile wide,
you know,

1751
01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.720
and if you want a place where you can have visuals and also provide,

1752
01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.350
you know,
potential supporting weaponry for people crossing and Patty,
et Cetera,

1753
01:49:29.351 --> 01:49:33.940
et cetera.
And so,
you know,
they,
they picked these out,
you know,
and,
uh,
um,

1754
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:38.260
we had one hill,
he'll 11 in Arizona valley where,
uh,

1755
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.530
uh,
you,
you know,
we'd send it when we'd be getting any strain features.
The thing,

1756
01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:46.980
you do,
what you'd send a platoon to sweep it.
You know,
when you first get up,

1757
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:51.490
sweep it,
secure it,
not just for booby traps,

1758
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:54.190
but you know,
for putting your,
your,
uh,

1759
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.840
your other units in the platoon,
swept it with second platoon.

1760
01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.550
They found a mine,
uh,
Luna Mine.
Uh,

1761
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:07.610
I left,
I was going to put my lines in and I,
I,
uh,

1762
01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.550
didn't want to bring my platoon up on that hill,

1763
01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:14.390
but with the having found the mine.
So I,
uh,
uh,

1764
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:19.330
left the rest of my platoon on the bottom of OpenAir panel and my Garvey's head,

1765
01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:23.530
uh,
uh,
my radio operator,
he said,
do not move.
I want to see where you are.

1766
01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:24.940
I brought my squad leaders,

1767
01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:29.440
we were clearing lanes down into where we were going to put our marines.

1768
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.120
And I heard this,
Kaboom.

1769
01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:35.080
And I look up behind me and someone had moved these people up to the top of the

1770
01:50:35.081 --> 01:50:35.590
hill.

1771
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:38.890
I turned around to see a guy flying through the air with a big artillery round.

1772
01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:44.510
Um,
and I saw him a Garvey.
I'm running with his arm hanging by,

1773
01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.700
by a shred.
He was standing behind him.
So we had casualties on top of that hill.

1774
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:53.410
Pretty,
pretty messy after a lot of other things we'd been through.
Um,

1775
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:58.660
and then the next morning,
our,

1776
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:03.790
uh,
81 CFO when we set up our perimeter getting mortared that afternoon,

1777
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.430
uh,
and,
uh,
he,

1778
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:10.780
he rolled over the next morning in his elbow,

1779
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:14.680
went down and he reached up and it was like a piece,

1780
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:19.660
a little piece of c ration cardboard.
Uh,
he peeled it covered with mud,

1781
01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.040
like,
you know,
like plastic surgery.
So nothing lifted it up.

1782
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:25.600
And there was a one seven,

1783
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:29.920
five artillery round with a pressure release detonator on it that he had slept

1784
01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:33.700
all night.
Uh,
if he had just rolled over with a bit,

1785
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:38.320
I think they found 15 would be traps on that,
on that one hill eventually.
Uh,

1786
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:42.870
<v 0>so
what a nightmare.
Um,</v>

1787
01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:48.370
and I guess what would a good job on him on?
I'll get a sound night's sleep now.

1788
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:54.010
I think he's probably woke up in the middle of night on that one a few times.

1789
01:51:54.011 --> 01:51:58.240
Thinking about how lucky,
lucky,
um,
here,

1790
01:51:58.430 --> 01:52:02.590
here's your tart and you talk a little bit about the overall kind of the
overall,

1791
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:08.470
I guess the overall occurrences that were going on were beyond what's just

1792
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:10.390
sitting right in front of you.
So here we go.

1793
01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:14.140
But something else was going on at stem from the reality that on any given day,

1794
01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:17.710
three different wars were being fought in the basin.

1795
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:22.030
The first war involved conventional combat against North Vietnamese army

1796
01:52:22.031 --> 01:52:24.640
regulars and main force Viet Cong soldiers.

1797
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:29.940
The second war was the daily challenge of an insurgency dominated by a longterm

1798
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:34.840
war of attrition aimed at driving American public opinion and troop morale

1799
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:39.880
against our own involvement in Vietnam at the beginning of what became known as

1800
01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:43.630
the American war communist leader.
Ho Ci Minh famously predicted,

1801
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:48.530
for every one of you we kill,
you will kill 10 of us.

1802
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:52.670
But in the end it is,
you will,
who will grow tired.

1803
01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:59.500
The third war focused was a focused and precise form of domestic terrorism.

1804
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:01.910
At this point in our history,

1805
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000
America's top leadership had yet to fully grasp the power and impact of a type

1806
01:53:07.191 --> 01:53:11.330
of terrorism that went well beyond the traditional notions of military

1807
01:53:11.331 --> 01:53:12.164
insurgency.

1808
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:16.130
Nor did the south Vietnamese government ever find a way to completely counter
it.

1809
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:18.050
It was,
uh,
sorry,
uh,

1810
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:23.051
largely invisible war of terror and subduction was taking place daily among the

1811
01:53:23.061 --> 01:53:24.110
rural populace,

1812
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:28.610
designed to discredit the south Vietnamese government and to drive a murderous

1813
01:53:28.611 --> 01:53:33.410
wedge between the people and the government.
And you go on to talk about,
uh,

1814
01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:35.660
Bernard Fall and his book,
you know,

1815
01:53:35.661 --> 01:53:39.530
he's a French author who wrote a bunch of books,
uh,
spent time there,

1816
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:44.090
wrote a book called Helen,
a very small place,
and he warned the Dick Van,

1817
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:48.290
am I saying that right?
They Been Dick Vaughn,
Dick Vaughn,

1818
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.590
um,
or moral intervention cadres.
The,

1819
01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:54.710
these were groups.

1820
01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:59.740
And what they were doing was the violent act for psychological rather than

1821
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:04.250
military reasons,
which is the source of the success.

1822
01:54:04.251 --> 01:54:09.251
And the Viet Minh and the Dick Vaughn will simply go on murdering village

1823
01:54:09.771 --> 01:54:14.600
chiefs,
youth leaders,
teachers,
and anti-malarial teams.

1824
01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.410
Thus isolating the Saigon government from the countryside,

1825
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:22.010
and you describe one of these situations.

1826
01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.200
There was no warning from around that unseen.
Bend the air.

1827
01:54:27.201 --> 01:54:30.530
Suddenly belched interrupted quick explosions piercing our ears and

1828
01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:34.310
reverberating like an unseen blast of wind.
My adrenaline surged.

1829
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:38.960
I counted three quick bursts of rifle fire,
and then a wimp of three grenades.

1830
01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:43.250
The entire platoon became animated tents picking up the pace to a jog.

1831
01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:46.100
As we strode toward the noise within a few heartbeats,

1832
01:54:46.101 --> 01:54:50.480
a young Vietnamese wild eyed and gasping for breath collided on the trail with

1833
01:54:50.481 --> 01:54:52.970
the point man of the platoon.
Instinctively,

1834
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:55.640
the marine tackle the young man and held them on the ground.

1835
01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:00.680
We did not know it yet,
but there had been two others.
After its attack,

1836
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:03.650
the assassination squad at split apart,

1837
01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:06.980
we would not capture the other two more regrettably,

1838
01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.870
we would not be able to kill them.

1839
01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.950
The district chiefs meeting had not lasted very long.

1840
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:15.800
We were the first marines to reach the hooch.

1841
01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:19.340
I quickly deployed my platoon in defensive positions around it.

1842
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:21.200
In case there was a second attack.

1843
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:24.170
Then I stepped inside the shadowed blood soaked room.

1844
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:28.190
My Platoon Corman and my radio operator came with me.
Within minutes,

1845
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:30.350
our company's chief Korman stepped inside,

1846
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:33.350
having jogged down from the command post on Henderson Hill.

1847
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:37.600
Their unit one medical bags would soon be empty of battle dressing and turn

1848
01:55:37.601 --> 01:55:38.690
acquit tourniquets.

1849
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:43.800
Together we began the ugly business of triage separating the dead from the near

1850
01:55:43.801 --> 01:55:48.801
dead and the near dead from those who might be medically saved inside the hooch.

1851
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:54.200
My hands armed arms trousers and boots at quickly become covered with blood.

1852
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.370
We pulled the debt outside,

1853
01:55:56.371 --> 01:56:00.780
lining them up in the field as if they were already under markers in a cemetery.

1854
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:05.310
Then covered them up so that the feasting flies might find some other place to

1855
01:56:05.311 --> 01:56:08.490
linger.
We had a problem with flies on the battlefield.

1856
01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.150
They buzzed everywhere into our food and onto our open sores.

1857
01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:13.770
On an earlier morning,

1858
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:17.010
I had counted more than a dozen floating inside my canteen cup.

1859
01:56:17.011 --> 01:56:21.360
As I heated a mix of water and see ration hot chocolate.
Foolishly,

1860
01:56:21.361 --> 01:56:24.060
I had bitten into them thinking they were chunks of chocolate.

1861
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:28.050
We carried out the wounded on the dirt floor of the coach.

1862
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:31.860
We had found them wriggling and turning like worms among each other as they had

1863
01:56:31.861 --> 01:56:35.880
sought to escape the ankle.
Deep Syrup of blood and innards.

1864
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:38.340
I noticed the district chiefs,

1865
01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.020
young deputy deputy who stood out from the others due to his fancy clothes,

1866
01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:46.380
blown backward into a family alter by the blast.

1867
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.010
He was frozen in depth with one arm raised in the air as if you were trying to

1868
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:53.730
catch their grenade that had killed him.
That hand was gone.

1869
01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.350
Nothing but the top of a forearm remained it's white tendon sticking out

1870
01:56:58.351 --> 01:57:00.810
randomly like on spliced electrical wires.

1871
01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:05.130
I had approached an old woman who was leaning back against a mud wall with a

1872
01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:06.390
stunned look on her face.

1873
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.650
Her jaw had dropped and her eyes stared unbelievably at nothing.

1874
01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.260
I thought she was merely in shock.

1875
01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:17.070
I pulled her arm and immediately recognize the lack of muscular response of the

1876
01:57:17.071 --> 01:57:17.904
dead.

1877
01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:22.590
I took a closer look and saw that she had taken a square nickel sized piece of

1878
01:57:22.591 --> 01:57:25.560
shrapnel.
In the middle for forehead just above rise.

1879
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:27.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1880
01:57:27.190 --> 01:57:31.840
<v 0>And so on.
As I waited in the mock,
it did not get any better.</v>

1881
01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:35.770
This was the war we were losing perfectly.

1882
01:57:35.771 --> 01:57:39.490
Summarizing Bernard falls observation on this morning,

1883
01:57:39.491 --> 01:57:42.610
the Vietcong were not asking for anyone support.

1884
01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:46.920
They were asserting their control
for all of the bombs.

1885
01:57:46.921 --> 01:57:50.280
We dropped many of them so randomly that they killed people,

1886
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:53.730
that they killed the very people we were trying to help.
And for all the,

1887
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:56.910
for all of us enemy soldiers,
we killed our leaders,

1888
01:57:56.911 --> 01:58:01.911
did not understand the cold focused violence perpetrated by the other side.

1889
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:07.680
They had deliberately killed a room full of their own people,

1890
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:13.550
a violent act for psychological rather than military reasons as a warning to

1891
01:58:14.131 --> 01:58:19.131
everyone in the basin that it was a crime punishable by death to even attend a

1892
01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:24.030
political meeting hosted by the other side.

1893
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:30.850
True.
Let me,
let me,
uh,
let me see if I can,

1894
01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.690
I can go back to the three points that,

1895
01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:36.340
that you wrote about and just elaborate a little bit.

1896
01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:41.980
There were three wars in any given.
I

1897
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.690
<v 2>talked a little bit about it earlier on the street,</v>

1898
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:50.650
a conventional side,
unit against unit.
There's,
there's no question.
We,

1899
01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:55.290
we defeated those forces.
Um,
finally,
and you know,

1900
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:59.140
people during the war,
we're talking about the body count,
the body count,

1901
01:58:59.141 --> 01:59:03.850
the inflated body count,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,
in 1995,

1902
01:59:03.851 --> 01:59:06.760
Hanoi admitted they lost 1.4 million soldiers dead,

1903
01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:11.200
1.4 million soldiers dead.
Uh,
we lost 58,000.

1904
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:15.310
The South Vietnamese W I w I really want to say something about,

1905
01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:18.310
because I think they are,
have been disrespected by history.

1906
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:21.170
They lost about 250,000 debt.
Um,

1907
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:26.770
and so we did our job.
That was our main job.

1908
01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:30.310
The second war.
You're talking about the guerrilla war.
I think we did well,

1909
01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:34.960
but we could have done better.
One of the things that Bernard Fall,
uh,

1910
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:39.160
talked about was how our,
uh,
you know,

1911
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:42.790
are supporting arms are we used,
we used,
um,

1912
01:59:42.970 --> 01:59:46.240
we heavily use artillery mortars and these sort of things.

1913
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:49.670
And in the villages it seemed kind of random.
Uh,

1914
01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:54.030
and the communists were very focused,
you know,
not,

1915
01:59:54.090 --> 01:59:56.800
not on the battlefield,
but how they use stuff outside the battlefield.

1916
01:59:56.801 --> 02:00:00.470
They're very focused on who they were,
who they were after a,

1917
02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:03.640
in addition to like showing that they could,
they could meet up with us.

1918
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:06.970
But even on,
even on that war,
I mean,
we adapted and I,

1919
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:10.870
and that area that I operated in,
um,
you know,

1920
02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:13.210
by the time I'd been there four or five months,

1921
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:18.070
I understood the tempo of that place.
I understood where they were.
They were,

1922
02:00:18.071 --> 02:00:22.180
were,
they had been,
I could anticipate them.
Uh,
and we did some,

1923
02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.560
I think some really great things.

1924
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:27.520
By the time I got to be a company commander out there in terms of knocking,

1925
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:30.760
knocking them off balance,
keeping the morale of our troops up,
you know,

1926
02:00:30.761 --> 02:00:32.620
showing them that we,
we really,

1927
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:35.680
we could go where they were and we could figure out what they were going to do.

1928
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:40.780
Um,
the third was the key.
And I will say,

1929
02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.260
I want to say a couple of things about that.
First,
you know,
the,
the,

1930
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:46.840
the South Vietnamese,

1931
02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:50.560
the motivation of the South Vietnamese I think has been misunderstood.

1932
02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:53.530
And I didn't understand this one.
I was in Vietnam.

1933
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:56.020
I understood this a lot better when I got back from Vietnam.

1934
02:00:56.021 --> 02:01:00.640
I started working with the Vietnamese community here after 1975 helping them

1935
02:01:00.641 --> 02:01:05.440
understand the political system that they were moving into.
You know,
they came,

1936
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:09.160
they came here,
they were very,
they were organized into community groups.
They,

1937
02:01:09.190 --> 02:01:12.220
they knew that,
you know,
they

1938
02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:18.250
were going to put the future into their kids.
You know,

1939
02:01:18.251 --> 02:01:23.080
from day one it was get a job,
you know,
uh,
but meeting with them,
get a job,

1940
02:01:23.081 --> 02:01:27.090
get your kids in school,
the next generation is going to succeed.
Um,

1941
02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:32.250
but also they were able to explain in a way that I never got out there where I

1942
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:37.610
was about what it was they were trying to do and how,
you know,
you,

1943
02:01:37.630 --> 02:01:42.110
if you could do the communist,
uh,
approach to this was very stolen us.

1944
02:01:42.150 --> 02:01:45.170
How's your man?
Was,
he may,
he may have been a nationalist,

1945
02:01:45.171 --> 02:01:49.730
but he studied the common term in,
in Moscow for like seven years.

1946
02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:50.690
Uh,

1947
02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:55.210
he knew the tactics that we're going to be used to eliminate the opposition of

1948
02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:59.430
Vietnamese opposition and to also put the markers down.
Um,

1949
02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.930
the,
the South Vietnamese,
uh,

1950
02:02:03.110 --> 02:02:05.780
never found a way to totally respond to this.

1951
02:02:05.781 --> 02:02:09.140
And they were constantly getting their leaders.
They had a lot of corruption.

1952
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:12.550
The culture as a mandarin culture.
There's a lot of corruption in the,
in the,

1953
02:02:12.551 --> 02:02:15.730
in the cold culture writ large when you get a,
you know,

1954
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:20.550
people in positions of power.
Three big temptation and demand root system.
Um,

1955
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:25.000
but they were saying,
um,

1956
02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:30.610
despite what I mentioned earlier about the assassination programs that were not

1957
02:02:30.741 --> 02:02:32.330
fully understood and in our country,

1958
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.720
they were saying the people who were opposed to the war were saying the south

1959
02:02:35.721 --> 02:02:38.330
Vietnamese were so corrupt,
they won't go out there.
You know,

1960
02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:42.650
we have a district chief and Dunay,
he lives in his villa.
He has a great life.

1961
02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.570
He won't go out to the annual basis.
Um,
and so our company commander,

1962
02:02:47.571 --> 02:02:49.660
who part of his first store,
he had done as a,
you know,

1963
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.480
pacification officer working with them,
said,
we're going to get them out here,

1964
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.640
we're going to get them out here,
we're going to protect him.

1965
02:02:56.770 --> 02:03:01.400
And they found out about that and as,
as I wrote in the book,
I mean,
they,

1966
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:06.550
they killed 17 of their own people in one little room and the,

1967
02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.690
the district chief and his aide,
you know,

1968
02:03:12.710 --> 02:03:14.480
just to send the signal,

1969
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:19.430
that signal was well understood,
you know,

1970
02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:22.190
by the people in,
in these areas.

1971
02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.630
And what we were doing was not as well understood even by ourselves.
One of the,

1972
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:32.000
you know,
the most interesting moments for me was when I had a,

1973
02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:34.970
uh,
I was toward the end of my tour,

1974
02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:40.660
I had a marine who was getting court martialed and tonight for hitting an Nco,

1975
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:46.010
uh,
you would not in my company anymore.
Uh,
but he said,

1976
02:03:46.011 --> 02:03:47.240
I'm getting a court martial.
I,
you know,

1977
02:03:47.241 --> 02:03:51.020
I called on his land light on the regimental three shop,
you know,

1978
02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.210
cause I'm getting court martialed and I don't,
uh,

1979
02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.580
you don't have a lawyer I can talk to,

1980
02:03:55.590 --> 02:03:56.750
can you come in and help me out to an hour?

1981
02:03:56.751 --> 02:03:58.800
And I got permission to go into Danang.
Like,

1982
02:03:58.810 --> 02:04:02.780
so I went to the three math headquarters.
They had this great dining hall,

1983
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:07.790
you know,
and that you had to try to get to.
So I went over to the three math,

1984
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.920
had dinner,
and I went into a bar and there's this woman,

1985
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.040
it's Vietnamese woman who was working behind the bar and she had a black diamond

1986
02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:22.100
sewn into her Alizai.
Um,
and uh,

1987
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:27.350
so she was,
you know,
she saw me and all droopy,
you know,
mustache.

1988
02:04:27.351 --> 02:04:31.130
My boots are blind.
Uh,
definitely my hair's a little longer.

1989
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.580
I definitely don't belong in three math headquarters.
She said,
you are,
uh,

1990
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:39.000
you're from out there.
I said,
yeah,
it's just,
where are you?

1991
02:04:39.001 --> 02:04:43.470
And I signed it and won.
She says,
I'm from dialogue,
which is the,

1992
02:04:43.471 --> 02:04:48.120
was the major town at the corner,
eastern corner of the Arizona Bank.
And,
uh,

1993
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:53.310
she said,
you're doing so much good.
You know,
I went,
really?

1994
02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:57.060
And she said,
she said,
you know why I wear this?

1995
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:59.040
She said they killed my entire family.

1996
02:04:59.490 --> 02:05:02.640
She said in dialogue or her father was a police officer.

1997
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:07.170
They came in at night,
they killed everybody.
She was shot,

1998
02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.960
but you know,
everybody but her was killed.

1999
02:05:09.961 --> 02:05:13.740
Her husband was an arb and he was just,
had just been killed.
And she said,

2000
02:05:14.090 --> 02:05:18.210
you know,
you,
we,
you know,
we can go places now.

2001
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:22.260
We couldn't go three years ago.
You know,
you are,
you are winning.

2002
02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:26.320
And you know,
it's the first time anybody had ever,
ever said that to me,
you know,

2003
02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:28.170
and another comment needs to be made.

2004
02:05:28.171 --> 02:05:32.370
And that is that the South Vietnamese leadership,
uh,
the military leadership,

2005
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:37.470
my age,
there were a lot of really fine leaders in there.

2006
02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:41.080
And even,
even David Hackworth,
you know,
who said,
uh,
you know,

2007
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:45.600
the north Vietnamese slash going to be flying over Saigon by 1975 also said

2008
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:48.510
emphatically to me when I was interviewing him.

2009
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:53.740
If you'd gotten these people into position,
they would have,
they would have,

2010
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:55.680
I'm not gonna say they would have one,
but they would've survived.

2011
02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:58.170
South Vietnam would have survived like South Korea.

2012
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:02.760
West Germany was about 40 eventual better solution.
So they have been,

2013
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:07.080
I think,
uh,
you know,
libeled in,
in history,

2014
02:06:07.081 --> 02:06:09.900
in terms of the competence of,
of a lot of their,

2015
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:14.760
they're really good leaders and people and soldiers and marines.
And that,

2016
02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:18.930
that's,
and that's from your perspective where you doing joint patrols with them?

2017
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:22.830
Well,
here's the interesting thing.
Um,
one of the reasons that,

2018
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:28.230
uh,
the,
uh,
the combat temple went up in early 69,

2019
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:30.900
uh,
was that Nixon had been elected president.

2020
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:35.970
The communists were very smart at keying in their military operations to our

2021
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.850
politics.
64 golf,

2022
02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:43.860
a tonka at 68 knocked a president out at 68,
72.

2023
02:06:43.861 --> 02:06:47.070
The Easter offensive,
which you're criminal redrew,
was that his name was,

2024
02:06:47.071 --> 02:06:49.200
was talking about so eloquently in one of your shows.

2025
02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:53.640
And they wanted Nixon.

2026
02:06:53.641 --> 02:06:58.620
Nixon was going to meet president too,
on,
in Guam in June of,

2027
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:02.850
of,
uh,
1969.
And they wanted the Americans to say they're getting out of there.

2028
02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:06.030
I don't know that I can't,
I couldn't sit there when I was over there going,
yeah,

2029
02:07:06.031 --> 02:07:10.650
this is what's happening.
But so late April,
all of May,

2030
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:13.980
Hamburger Hill and 90th regimen,
every,
you know,

2031
02:07:13.981 --> 02:07:17.260
the place lit up for her and 50 people dying.
Um,

2032
02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:21.180
but Nixon announced Vietnamization it's been mocked,

2033
02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:25.200
it should not have been mocked.
Um,
in the Arizona Valley.

2034
02:07:25.230 --> 02:07:28.290
We hadn't seen South Vietnamese out in Arizona Valley.

2035
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:29.920
And then I was out there as a company,
commanded,

2036
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:34.230
brought a ranger unit out and it Kinda got waxed and we actually moved down to

2037
02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.270
their PR,
you know,
to their,

2038
02:07:36.271 --> 02:07:39.890
their perimeter and they were jumping on helicopters to get out.
Um,

2039
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:44.650
and then they send a unit,
um,
all the 51st Arvin regimen out there.

2040
02:07:44.651 --> 02:07:48.850
And these guys were good.
I mean,
I would,
I would have operated with them any day.

2041
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.000
Um,
and I've got,
you know,
many,

2042
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:57.030
many friends who were Arbonne in Vietnam who will talk to you about what

2043
02:07:57.701 --> 02:08:02.320
happened when the Watergate Congress took over,
you know,
in the Nixon resigned.

2044
02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.550
And then,
you know,

2045
02:08:03.551 --> 02:08:07.960
the s antiwar Congress came in and one of the first substantive votes they took

2046
02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:13.740
was to cut off all supplemental appropriations to the South Vietnamese army.

2047
02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:18.370
There was,
that was,
there was no reason for that.

2048
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:22.420
Well are our forces weren't even on the ground over there.

2049
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.960
And at the same time the north Vietnamese refurbished and they attacked them

2050
02:08:28.331 --> 02:08:30.370
when they were repositioning.
They had to reposition.

2051
02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:35.380
I have a really great friend,
you know,
um,
who,
uh,

2052
02:08:35.650 --> 02:08:38.700
when I was listening to your show that we're talking about the American,
uh,

2053
02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:42.910
who had spent nine years as a prisoner of war,
uh,

2054
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:47.230
[inaudible],
uh,
who's here now,
uh,

2055
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:51.910
spent 12 years on a battlefield,
was a regimental commander at age 28,

2056
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:55.960
recipient of their,
uh,
metal of honor in 13 and a half years,

2057
02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:58.900
locked up five years on a conex box.
Um,

2058
02:08:59.410 --> 02:09:04.360
he was down to two artillery rounds per tube per day when he was trying to

2059
02:09:04.361 --> 02:09:08.440
reposition his forces when this thing hit.
So,
um,

2060
02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:12.820
it was a very complicated war.
I'm not trying to like,
you know,

2061
02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:16.630
Re uh,
you know,
reimagine what was happening.

2062
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:19.150
But I had always thought that the,

2063
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:23.190
the end result would probably be kind of like what you see in Iraq,

2064
02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:27.130
just sort of a slow down and sort things out rather than what happened.

2065
02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:28.463
<v 0>Right.</v>

2066
02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2067
02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:41.420
<v 0>Going back to the book while my mother slept so fitfully and so fifthly,</v>

2068
02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:45.300
dreamed I was hit by two enemy grenades while clearing a series of well

2069
02:09:45.301 --> 02:09:46.650
camouflaged bunkers.

2070
02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:51.270
Bunkers were built inside of bamboo thicket at the edge of a murky stream bed.

2071
02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.570
The first grenade peppered me lightly on the face and shoulders.

2072
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.910
The second detonated behind me just after I shot the man who threw it in a

2073
02:09:59.911 --> 02:10:02.340
second soldier who was inside the same bunker.

2074
02:10:03.450 --> 02:10:06.720
I was hitting the head back,
arm and leg,

2075
02:10:07.410 --> 02:10:12.120
the grenades concussion lifted me into the air and threw me down a hill into the

2076
02:10:12.121 --> 02:10:12.954
stream.

2077
02:10:13.710 --> 02:10:17.850
I still carry shrapnel at the base of my skull and in one kidney from the blast.

2078
02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.400
But the square quarter sized piece that scored the inside of my left knee joint

2079
02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:27.150
and lodged against the bone of my lower leg would eventually change the

2080
02:10:27.151 --> 02:10:28.320
direction of my life.

2081
02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:34.520
Having for months repeatedly seen far worse among of my marines.

2082
02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.810
How did not pay a great deal of attention to my wounds?
Medivaced into Al Holla,

2083
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:44.840
Eh,
I was treated for several days at the battalion aid station.

2084
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:48.050
Some of the shrapnel in the back in my head,

2085
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:51.680
back and arm was removed and some was left to work its way out.

2086
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:53.600
Naturally as my skin healed over time,

2087
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:57.020
the scars pushing shrapnel out onto the surface.

2088
02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:59.570
I returned to the Bush as soon as possible,

2089
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.840
but the leg wound went deep into the joint and had not completely healed in the

2090
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:08.450
mock of the rice paddies and the filth of the basin villas.

2091
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.290
It soon became infected.
I did not know it at the time,

2092
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:16.220
but the infection was moving into the bone causing permanent septic damage.

2093
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:23.410
And then you go to,
uh,
in August,

2094
02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:27.170
your company executive officer,
he let you know that there's a bill.

2095
02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:31.720
It opened up for Force Service Regiment on Okinawa.

2096
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:33.250
And for those people that don't know what it is,

2097
02:11:33.251 --> 02:11:37.690
this is like a plush billet and here you go.
If I accepted the assignment for me,

2098
02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:43.060
the Vietnam war would be over within weeks and an assignment on the quaint and

2099
02:11:43.061 --> 02:11:47.020
gorgeous island of Okinawa would give me several months to decompress from

2100
02:11:47.021 --> 02:11:49.240
battlefield combat before I returned home.

2101
02:11:50.190 --> 02:11:50.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2102
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:54.200
<v 0>Life's gambles are sometimes settled in mere moments,</v>

2103
02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.850
weighed against years of previous thought and decades on the other side where

2104
02:11:58.851 --> 02:12:02.690
one might reflect on the wisdom involved in a sudden decision.

2105
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:08.950
I listened to the executive officer and fought inside myself pressing the radio

2106
02:12:08.961 --> 02:12:12.800
handset against my face as I leaned against an old grave in the middle of a

2107
02:12:12.801 --> 02:12:16.490
desolate village.
Those few seconds became,

2108
02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.820
as they liked to say in the marine corps,
a teachable moment.

2109
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:23.870
But I could not say yes.

2110
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:29.120
After all the years of preparation and months of hardship that I had endured

2111
02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:32.870
with one infantry battalion in this small but violent section of a seemingly

2112
02:12:32.871 --> 02:12:36.020
never ending more,
I could not simply walk away.

2113
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:42.410
Bonds formed on the battlefield are often is unbreakable as the strongest family

2114
02:12:42.411 --> 02:12:44.780
ties in a word.

2115
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:49.990
I felt obligated like my father service to country defined myself.

2116
02:12:50.150 --> 02:12:55.150
Respect more to the point I loved leading infantry marines.

2117
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2118
02:12:56.750 --> 02:13:00.230
<v 0>With a Gritty Alon,
they faced the greatest dangerous.</v>

2119
02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.130
They took the greatest risk.
They absorbed the highest casualties.

2120
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:06.800
They had the fewest creature comforts,

2121
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:12.920
but they also stood face to face and toe to toe with the enemy every day.

2122
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:18.380
And they answered in their honor to no one.

2123
02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:20.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2124
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:25.040
<v 0>Taking a deep breath.
I finally said No.</v>

2125
02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:29.420
Then stayed in the Bush in September.

2126
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:32.130
I was given command of dying

2127
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:35.220
<v 2>Delta.
No complaints.</v>

2128
02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:38.420
No,
it's,
um,

2129
02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:45.360
during that time,
um,

2130
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:51.430
I had served under four battalion commanders and three regimental commanders.

2131
02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:57.520
Um,
and as you know,
I mean it was,

2132
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:02.760
I'd say majority of the people who,
who go through this experience,
no.

2133
02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:04.463
Uh,
there are,

2134
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:08.970
there are a few bonds in your life tighter than the people,

2135
02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.133
um,

2136
02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:14.790
that you have served with under extraordinary circumstances.

2137
02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:17.040
I once wrote in one article,

2138
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.480
I don't say I would trust my life to these people cause I already have.

2139
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.060
Uh,
and I knew,
I knew what I was doing.
You know,

2140
02:14:26.250 --> 02:14:30.810
I knew the terrain.
I felt like I belonged there.
There was a,

2141
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:35.930
there's a scene in fields of fire where snake was a squad leader.
Uh,
the good,

2142
02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:39.460
you're ready to go on an operation.
And he goes and sits on a bunker,
uh,

2143
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:42.120
looking out across the patties at the,

2144
02:14:42.210 --> 02:14:47.170
at the fog pouring down the mountains.
And so,

2145
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:52.710
you know,
yeah.
As this,
this is where I belong,
you know.
And,

2146
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:56.760
um,
my third regimental commander who,
uh,

2147
02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:00.930
was a real piece of work and with Noble Beck,
uh,
pulled me in.

2148
02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:06.120
He,
he found out I had two purple hearts as an officer in the bush and which was

2149
02:15:06.121 --> 02:15:10.460
against the division order.
And as he,
as he said,
um,

2150
02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.140
when I left Vietnam,

2151
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.950
he said this guy came in with tears as big as horse turds in his eyes.

2152
02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:23.160
And you know,
the,
the,
the greatest job I've ever had.

2153
02:15:23.161 --> 02:15:24.900
It's been a rifle company commander,

2154
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:29.901
just enough independence to really be innovative but still totally connected

2155
02:15:30.001 --> 02:15:34.800
with your people.
And I've been very privileged,
um,

2156
02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:38.400
in,
in,
in my life to be able to maintain a contact,

2157
02:15:38.401 --> 02:15:41.340
not only with the people that I have,
many of the people that I served with,

2158
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:45.090
but also with the operating military.
Uh,

2159
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:50.790
and I,
I learned when I,
uh,
when I was in law school,
I,

2160
02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:53.270
you know,
that's where I finally ended up,
um,

2161
02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.300
cause I to figure out I need to screw my brain on and figure out the rest of my

2162
02:15:57.301 --> 02:15:58.330
life.
Um,

2163
02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:02.700
I found out that I could make money by writing.

2164
02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:04.890
It was like the pure formula here.
You know,

2165
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:08.370
I could actually get people to pay me to indulge my curiosities.

2166
02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:13.110
And so I was able,
I was able,
among other things too,

2167
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:15.840
you know,
to be with the military,

2168
02:16:16.110 --> 02:16:18.900
our military and a lot of different places.

2169
02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:22.930
I was in Beirut in 1983,
uh,

2170
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:25.460
when I covered it for PBS.
Um,

2171
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:29.950
and actually I left right before the building blew up.
I stop every year,

2172
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:34.360
October 23rd.
And think about that.
That was a good battalion,
first battalion,

2173
02:16:34.361 --> 02:16:36.580
eighth marines,
you know,
you've been around this long enough,

2174
02:16:36.581 --> 02:16:39.250
you can smell a good,
good unit and you can tell a bad unit.

2175
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:42.370
And they were a good unit.
They were well led.
Um,

2176
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:48.970
I,
uh,
was able to be in Afghanistan,
you know,
as a,
as an embed over there,

2177
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:53.860
uh,
spent,
been able to spend time working on veteran's issues,

2178
02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:58.360
spent five years in the Pentagon.
Uh,
so,
uh,
you can,

2179
02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:02.710
you can take this sort of,
you know,

2180
02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:06.310
affiliation and Camaraderie and,

2181
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:10.960
and have it still helped in other things you do in your life.

2182
02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.790
<v 5>So that was,
that was it right when,
uh,</v>

2183
02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:17.810
when the colonel brought you in and he just said,
hey,
look,
I don't care.

2184
02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:19.920
You're going home.
You're,
you're out.
You're,

2185
02:17:19.921 --> 02:17:21.810
you're not going to stay here anymore.
And there was no,

2186
02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:24.110
I always get your butts about that one.

2187
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:28.960
<v 2>No,
there was not,
um,
you know,
as soon as he found out I had two purple hearts.</v>

2188
02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.890
Um,
and I,

2189
02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:37.180
I was on the regimental in the regimen or three shop for my last two months and

2190
02:17:37.181 --> 02:17:40.210
then came home and then started,
you know,
my,
uh,

2191
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:43.240
situation with the joint in my leg started

2192
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:47.030
<v 5>acting up after I got home.
And by the way,
you,</v>

2193
02:17:47.090 --> 02:17:48.860
you wrote this whole book and you spent,

2194
02:17:48.890 --> 02:17:52.640
I think it was a half or maybe a quarter or a paragraph or maybe three sentences

2195
02:17:52.641 --> 02:17:56.960
talking about you attacking enemy bunkers,
throwing grenades in,

2196
02:17:56.961 --> 02:18:01.520
getting wounded,
fighting on,
um,
if that's,
that's the,

2197
02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:06.380
that's that's what you received,
the navy cross four.
And,
um,

2198
02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:09.110
well I just wanted to point out that that's a,

2199
02:18:09.710 --> 02:18:13.280
that takes humble to a new level for you to write this book and give yourself a,

2200
02:18:13.281 --> 02:18:14.390
a sentence or two.

2201
02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:21.600
<v 2>When I,
when I decided to write fields of fire,
um,
I was,</v>

2202
02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:25.070
I was in law school.
Um,
there was,
uh,

2203
02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.030
it was a very important concept that stuck in my mind and it's still there.

2204
02:18:30.590 --> 02:18:35.590
And that is that the people who went over and interrupted their lives,

2205
02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:38.380
a lot of them just spent one,

2206
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:43.430
one tour in the Marine Corps and what home have never been fully appreciate.

2207
02:18:44.521 --> 02:18:49.410
I've never been fully understood,
you know,
and what they did,

2208
02:18:49.770 --> 02:18:53.610
getting that down,
you know,
that the environment in which they served.

2209
02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:57.390
And you know,
that there's a,
when we talk about courage,

2210
02:18:57.910 --> 02:19:02.400
there's physical courage,
which is maybe shooting somebody in a walker.

2211
02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.350
There's moral courage,

2212
02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:09.800
which is standing up for what you believe in and having the courage to say it to

2213
02:19:11.251 --> 02:19:14.430
those above you.
And sometimes you have to say it to those who are,

2214
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.180
who are below you,
you know,
no,
you got to do this.
That's all there is to it.

2215
02:19:18.690 --> 02:19:21.780
And then there's what I like to call daily courage,
you know,

2216
02:19:21.781 --> 02:19:25.740
and daily courage is taking a hand.
God dealt you and doing something with it.

2217
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:29.900
You know,
uh,
like Tom Martin,
who,
uh,

2218
02:19:29.930 --> 02:19:34.610
was one of my squad leaders,
it was a,
he's now passed away.
Um,

2219
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:37.240
he was an interesting,
uh,

2220
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:41.780
W W W was an intersting ear for me in the bush.
He had been in Vandy.

2221
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.010
Vanderbilt University was in favor of the war.
It wasn't a debate on the war.

2222
02:19:46.011 --> 02:19:48.470
And this guy who supposedly is going to Canada to turn around and said,

2223
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:52.150
if you think this is such a great war,
why don't you just go serve in it?

2224
02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:56.330
He enlisted.
It's even very,
very smart knowing guy could,
you know,

2225
02:19:57.050 --> 02:20:00.470
put things would get down.
You come and talk,
talk to me about different stuff.

2226
02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:05.240
Then he got shot and he used to keep out and everybody had the Zippo lighter,

2227
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:09.890
you know,
uh,
you know,
with your slogan on it and his,
his,

2228
02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:13.910
his,
uh,
slogan was,
life is not in drawing a good hand,

2229
02:20:13.911 --> 02:20:16.940
but learning to play a poor hand.
Well,
uh,

2230
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:22.370
and that takes daily courage,
you know,
and we had an,

2231
02:20:22.371 --> 02:20:27.260
our in our platoon,
uh,
had to triple amputees.

2232
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:32.630
One,
one died,
uh,
before they got him out of Vietnam.
Uh,

2233
02:20:32.631 --> 02:20:36.200
but Dale Wilson was,
the other one was a silver star recipient.

2234
02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:40.490
One of the most positive people I've ever met.
Uh,
if you,

2235
02:20:40.491 --> 02:20:44.330
if you met him,
you wouldn't,
you would know the hit had lost an arm,

2236
02:20:44.331 --> 02:20:46.400
but you wouldn't,
you know,
and he'd be leaning on a cane.

2237
02:20:46.401 --> 02:20:50.360
You wouldn't be able to tell he lost one leg up by the thigh or above the thigh

2238
02:20:50.361 --> 02:20:51.360
and the other one tumbling.
He

2239
02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.120
takes Dale Wilson 15 minutes to get out of bed.

2240
02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:01.670
That's daily courage and he never,
never complaints.
He'll,
you know,
he'll say,

2241
02:21:01.671 --> 02:21:05.150
well,
I was going to be an NFL.
What else?
What else should I be doing here?

2242
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:10.850
Magma Garby arm blown off my below the shoulder,

2243
02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:15.380
uh,
went out and got a tattoo,
says cut on dotted line.

2244
02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:18.740
When I ran for the Senate,
when I decide to run for the Senate,

2245
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:21.500
nine months to the day before the election,
it was zero money,

2246
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:25.130
zero campaign staff.
I just said,
I'm going to do this.

2247
02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:28.690
First guy called was Hma Garvey.
He was the night manager.

2248
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:31.790
Tootsies orchid lounge in Nashville,
Tennessee.
I said,
man,

2249
02:21:31.850 --> 02:21:36.320
I need somebody I can trust,
you know,
24 hours a day.
You gotta be my driver.

2250
02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:39.650
He says,
I got one arm,
I said,
I don't care.
You're my driver.
Uh,

2251
02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:43.910
he quit his job and moved into our basement for a year.
And,
uh,
you know,

2252
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:46.030
I couldn't,
I couldn't have done it without,
I mean,
great,

2253
02:21:46.031 --> 02:21:50.300
great friend of Sun gyms too,
by the way.
So that's,

2254
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:53.840
that's daily courage,
you know,
and that's,
you know,

2255
02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:58.670
that's really when you look at the ramifications of that place and having people

2256
02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:00.050
understand,
you know,
what,

2257
02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:04.690
how this was in many ways positive for our country to,
uh,

2258
02:22:04.810 --> 02:22:06.530
that's my goal.

2259
02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.720
<v 0>So you sir,
you're in law school and you know,
you've,</v>

2260
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:13.370
you've mentioned this a couple times so far,
but at some point you decide,
okay,

2261
02:22:13.570 --> 02:22:15.470
um,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna start writing.

2262
02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:18.680
Why did you decide to write a novel instead of write a book of your own

2263
02:22:18.681 --> 02:22:21.800
experiences?
And I mean,
I know,
and I'm going to get into it a little bit.
I mean,

2264
02:22:21.810 --> 02:22:26.220
clearly there's a major amount of crossover,
but is there a specific reason

2265
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.550
<v 2>why you said,
you know what,
I'm gonna write a novel instead of a,
uh,
a memoir.</v>

2266
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.640
Well,
there's two things.
I started writing my last year in the Marine Corps,

2267
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:36.750
it was put on the secretary of the navy.
Stefan was on those medical hold.
And I,

2268
02:22:36.810 --> 02:22:41.280
you know,
as,
as we discussed earlier,
as an avid reader,
I loved,

2269
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:46.200
I loved to write,
I was writing from my job.
I wrote three,
um,

2270
02:22:46.890 --> 02:22:50.670
uh,
magazine articles in that year.
One of them was very controversial.

2271
02:22:50.671 --> 02:22:53.670
It was about the,
uh,
roles and missions of the Marine Corps,

2272
02:22:53.850 --> 02:22:56.040
how they were on paper,
an amphibious force,

2273
02:22:56.041 --> 02:22:57.690
and they were doing all these other things and it,

2274
02:22:57.691 --> 02:22:59.460
did it make a difference in my bottom line?

2275
02:22:59.461 --> 02:23:01.630
Would you better believe it makes a difference?
Uh,

2276
02:23:01.631 --> 02:23:05.450
there's not one marine general on any of these j staffs anywhere except that,

2277
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:05.920
you know,
if,

2278
02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:09.360
if the navy gives him one in the Marine Corps wasn't even represented when they

2279
02:23:09.361 --> 02:23:10.740
decided that that was their mission.

2280
02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:14.730
It was the chief of naval operations and I was 25 years old and I got in big

2281
02:23:14.731 --> 02:23:15.061
trouble.

2282
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:17.280
You think I got in big trouble and some of these other things I've written,

2283
02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:18.121
you know,

2284
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:21.540
the chief of staff of the Marine Corps was calling me into talking to me and the

2285
02:23:21.541 --> 02:23:24.570
commandant ordered a counter article to be written,
uh,

2286
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:28.350
about what I had said because they,
they were being accused in the jcs of,

2287
02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:32.790
you know,
this,
you know,
wanting to start some sort of a campaign,
you know.
Um,

2288
02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:37.890
so I had learned the power of the written word and then I wrote my first year in

2289
02:23:37.891 --> 02:23:38.724
law school I,

2290
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:42.210
I sort of look in and I had started looking at Micronesia and what's going to

2291
02:23:42.211 --> 02:23:43.470
happen after the Vietnam War,

2292
02:23:43.471 --> 02:23:46.770
what should the United States basing system look like in the,
in the Pacific.

2293
02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:49.680
And I was reading a lot of World War II stuff and you know,

2294
02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:51.560
Ronald in the desert was,
you know,

2295
02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.810
fighting from what he called the interior position.
You know,

2296
02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:57.900
logistically shortening of logistic lines,

2297
02:23:57.901 --> 02:24:00.840
being able to hit the Brits when they were after him and hit the Americans when

2298
02:24:00.841 --> 02:24:04.800
they were after him.
And I said,
we need to develop an interior position in,

2299
02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:08.610
in Pacific Asia.
And that's Guam.
Tinian I got really kind of into this,

2300
02:24:08.611 --> 02:24:11.680
I wrote my first book actually about that and when I worked,
uh,

2301
02:24:11.970 --> 02:24:16.320
for the governor of Guam doing a study.
So then I'm saying,

2302
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:20.550
I'm listening to the stuff that people were saying about those who served.

2303
02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:23.490
I think I met three people in three years in Georgetown law school who had been

2304
02:24:23.491 --> 02:24:27.180
in combat in Vietnam,
1800 people,
student body,
same age group.

2305
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:28.530
Something was wrong.

2306
02:24:29.310 --> 02:24:34.310
And I actually was sitting in constitutional law class when they were debating

2307
02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:39.120
the war powers act.
And it got to be very vicious on,
uh,
you know,

2308
02:24:39.121 --> 02:24:41.610
the people who served there.
I want to stuff they'd never said to my face,

2309
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:43.950
they're saying to each other and this class and go,
Holy Shit.

2310
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:47.360
That's what they really believe.
And I started writing the last chapter,

2311
02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.930
fields of fire are sitting in constitutional law class.
And then as I wrote it,

2312
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:53.520
you know,
the first time I wrote this book,

2313
02:24:53.521 --> 02:24:57.470
seven times cover to cover and an engineering degree,
you know,
and,
and,
um,

2314
02:24:57.990 --> 02:25:00.810
you know,
I never went to a creative writing class.

2315
02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.430
I started reading the people I thought were the greats,
um,
in a different way,

2316
02:25:05.431 --> 02:25:08.370
not for enjoyment,
but for structure and these sorts of things.
Hemingway,

2317
02:25:08.371 --> 02:25:13.140
Steinbeck,
Faulkner,
uh,
Graham Greene,
uh,
the British,
the Irish poets,
et Cetera.

2318
02:25:13.650 --> 02:25:18.120
Um,
so the first time through it was sort of like,
just,
you know,

2319
02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:22.620
it was a very good catharsis.
And then I got to the point where I said,
no,

2320
02:25:22.621 --> 02:25:25.210
I've got a piece of literature here.
Uh,

2321
02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:30.390
every one of these characters is a little bit different and it is an escalating

2322
02:25:31.001 --> 02:25:32.800
moral drama,
uh,

2323
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:37.600
in terms of how they are reacting to operating in this particular area.

2324
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:42.280
Uh,
and so
the,
the power,

2325
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:45.670
the literary power of the novel was,

2326
02:25:45.671 --> 02:25:50.590
was more important than me telling.
Uh,
I was there kind of story,

2327
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:54.330
had a universality to it and a jeopardy,
uh,

2328
02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:58.490
who came in to help me on us.
Um,
who had woke,

2329
02:25:58.491 --> 02:26:02.620
discovered Leon Uris was editor and chief of Putin up at one time.
Uh,
uh,

2330
02:26:02.621 --> 02:26:05.630
just really encouraged me to stay with it.
And I,
you know,

2331
02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:10.620
I very lucky that I did because I had the book survived,
you know,

2332
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:13.410
12 rejections and everything else and us

2333
02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:16.810
<v 0>well out there.
No.
So,
uh,
and,
and honestly,</v>

2334
02:26:16.811 --> 02:26:20.920
I kind of answered that question for myself and I think when people read it,

2335
02:26:21.010 --> 02:26:23.410
they'll figure out why you did it.
Cause it does,

2336
02:26:23.411 --> 02:26:26.500
it has this power to it that you couldn't have done.

2337
02:26:27.010 --> 02:26:30.700
I'm just writing your own story.
Even though your own story is,

2338
02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:35.740
is very similar and has probably parts that are just even more impactful.

2339
02:26:35.741 --> 02:26:38.680
But the way that this ties together,
and this is,

2340
02:26:39.610 --> 02:26:44.610
this is like the iconic novel and I will say about Vietnam War,

2341
02:26:44.711 --> 02:26:49.711
but really like you could put this over just war and you've got these characters

2342
02:26:50.651 --> 02:26:52.500
in it.
You know,
you already talked about one of them.

2343
02:26:52.501 --> 02:26:56.110
You got snake who's like the street smart kind of bad ass marine.

2344
02:26:56.410 --> 02:27:00.820
You got Lieutenant Robert E.
Lee Hodges,
who's,

2345
02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:01.930
who's the lieutenant,

2346
02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:06.220
he got the senator who's this Harvard kid that thought he going to play the

2347
02:27:06.221 --> 02:27:10.680
French horn and the marine corps band and he ends up in the basin.
Uh,

2348
02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:16.150
uh,
you got cat man who's the,
the Mexican point man.
You got the Terp,

2349
02:27:16.470 --> 02:27:19.180
the interpreters,
we called him Dan.

2350
02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:22.300
You got cannonball flaky bag or rabbit,
uh,

2351
02:27:22.450 --> 02:27:26.080
Gilliland baby cakes,
sergeant Austins.

2352
02:27:26.081 --> 02:27:30.340
And in all of these characters in the end,
you know,
as I read this,
it was just,

2353
02:27:31.390 --> 02:27:33.580
you know,
I probably read this 10 years ago or something,

2354
02:27:33.581 --> 02:27:38.410
maybe 15 years ago and when I read it again,
I mean it's just infinitely,
I mean,

2355
02:27:38.411 --> 02:27:42.130
just because I'm older and I understand things more,
I guess my hope,

2356
02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.660
but just the way that each one of these characters and,

2357
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:50.800
and here's something that I realized I was,
I was reading this book.
First of all,

2358
02:27:50.801 --> 02:27:54.490
we know these characters,
like these characters,
they exist in real life.

2359
02:27:54.491 --> 02:27:57.370
They exist in combat.
They enlisted,
they exist in the seal teams.

2360
02:27:57.371 --> 02:27:59.140
They exist in the Marine Corps.
They exist in the army.

2361
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:01.870
I met all of these characters,
they're all out there and they're all out there.

2362
02:28:01.871 --> 02:28:05.060
I work with businesses now they're in those businesses as well.
They're in there.

2363
02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:07.840
These are human beings.
And,

2364
02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:12.940
and that's incredible.
And then you put them in this,
you know,

2365
02:28:12.941 --> 02:28:15.700
look at them.
I'm interested always in learning about human nature.

2366
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:16.470
But you put this in,

2367
02:28:16.470 --> 02:28:20.500
in this environment that is what you've talked about and this environment is to,

2368
02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:25.740
is gonna reveal human nature in incredible ways and you just capture so much of

2369
02:28:28.971 --> 02:28:32.430
it.
And
I mean,

2370
02:28:32.590 --> 02:28:35.660
I want to take a look at when,
when,
uh,

2371
02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:41.440
Hodges kind of arrives in Vietnam and he sits down with major auto.

2372
02:28:42.381 --> 02:28:46.280
So here we go.
This is the fields of fire.
Going back to the book,
Major Auto,

2373
02:28:46.281 --> 02:28:49.880
the battalion executive officer sat behind his field desk and examined Hodges

2374
02:28:49.881 --> 02:28:53.390
record book.
He was young for a major in his early thirties.

2375
02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.730
He seemed pleasant enough,
the Hodges,
who would expect it,

2376
02:28:55.740 --> 02:29:00.740
a hatchet faced revealing warrior after hearing of the majors background Ottawa

2377
02:29:01.961 --> 02:29:05.270
had been a company commander during his first tour and was highly decorated.

2378
02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.740
His right forearm was gashed with a six inch purple trough left by a bone

2379
02:29:09.741 --> 02:29:13.430
shattering machine gun bullet.
And yet he had the inquisitive,

2380
02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.870
sensitive demeanor of a brooding scholar.
He smiled casually to Hodges.

2381
02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:23.720
So do you think you're ready?
Hodges stood at a loose parade rest in the musty,

2382
02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:24.440
heated the tent.

2383
02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:27.860
He was scheduled to attend three more days of regimental indoctrination school,

2384
02:29:28.010 --> 02:29:32.510
but he had not found it helpful and he had learned to hate the dust.

2385
02:29:32.511 --> 02:29:36.890
Filled boredom of Anwar.
Yes sir.
I'm ready.

2386
02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:42.110
Thanks so good.
They need you out there.
Lost another lieutenant last night.

2387
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:46.940
The major watched him closely.
Yes sir.
I heard.
Yeah.

2388
02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:50.720
Good old dying Delta.
You'd like to call themselves deadly.

2389
02:29:50.721 --> 02:29:53.120
Delta auto chuckled.

2390
02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:55.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2391
02:29:55.060 --> 02:29:59.260
<v 0>He had a beat and tone in his voice as if he had seen the ritual so many times</v>

2392
02:29:59.261 --> 02:30:02.710
it had lost its meaning,
meaning deadly dying.

2393
02:30:02.711 --> 02:30:07.510
Delta Hodges watched him dripping with sweat and the dark heat outside of jeep

2394
02:30:07.511 --> 02:30:11.590
rumbled past leaving a wave of red dirt that seeped underneath the tent flap,

2395
02:30:11.650 --> 02:30:16.650
like a creeping frog in the distance and artillery battery and an artillery

2396
02:30:17.651 --> 02:30:20.470
battery fire to mission towards the Arizona territory.

2397
02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:24.880
The major swiped at a fly then lit a cigarette as an afterthought.

2398
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:29.530
He offered one to Hodges.
No,
thank you,
sir.
Major auto side.

2399
02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:34.570
You'll learn he dragged deeply on the cigarette,
frankly studying Hodges.

2400
02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.500
Yeah,
Diane Delta.
You're not ready,
lieutenant.

2401
02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:42.130
The only reason I'm telling you is I don't want you to panic when you get out

2402
02:30:42.131 --> 02:30:46.600
there and find out nothing in your entire Goddamn life will have prepared you

2403
02:30:46.601 --> 02:30:50.170
for the bush.
Not a damn thing.
Yes sir.

2404
02:30:50.890 --> 02:30:54.520
Do you know what I mean?
No Sir.
Jesus Christ,

2405
02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:58.840
the major dragged again on his cigarette.
Debbie Delta.
Yeah.

2406
02:30:59.710 --> 02:31:02.350
They really caught the shit last night.
I watched it.

2407
02:31:02.770 --> 02:31:06.700
It was almost embarrassing to admit he still felt uncomfortable about the irony

2408
02:31:06.701 --> 02:31:10.060
of sitting on a bunker and watching someone else's war.
Otto,
lean forward,

2409
02:31:10.061 --> 02:31:14.260
absently rubbing the purple Gash on his forearm.
Well.

2410
02:31:14.290 --> 02:31:17.110
What kind of person do you think goes through that Shit Day in and day out,

2411
02:31:17.111 --> 02:31:17.944
lieutenant,

2412
02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:23.340
because that's what it shit and that's the way you take it every stinking day.

2413
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.520
Some something piddly ass or something heavy.

2414
02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:30.960
This isn't world war two where we can pull you out to Australia and parade after

2415
02:31:30.961 --> 02:31:35.340
a month of fighting.
Nope,
and it isn't 1965 when we first came into Vietnam,

2416
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:37.680
we would send a company out on a two day operation,

2417
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.790
then bring the men back for hot chow and liberty.
Yeah,
that's right.

2418
02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:43.890
Liberty lieutenant in Denang.

2419
02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:49.230
Then we started week long operations than it was a month now.
Well,

2420
02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:53.760
we just leave them out there all the time.
It's more convenient.

2421
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:57.750
The major offered Hodges a small challenging smile.

2422
02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:01.170
They go wild lieutenant and there's nothing you can do about it.

2423
02:32:01.171 --> 02:32:03.270
You'll go wild too.
Wild as hell.

2424
02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:07.380
You spend a month in the bush and you're not a marine anymore.
Hell,

2425
02:32:07.381 --> 02:32:11.640
you're not even a goddamn person.
There's no tents,
no barbed wire,

2426
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:16.560
no hot food,
no jeeps are trucks,
no clean clothes,
nothing.
You're an animal.

2427
02:32:18.090 --> 02:32:20.700
It gets so that it's natural to squat.
When you take a shit,

2428
02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:25.470
you get ringworm and hookworm and gooky sores.

2429
02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:30.030
You roll around in your own filth.
You forget how bad you smell dead.

2430
02:32:30.031 --> 02:32:32.820
People guts in the God damn dirt,
miserable civilian.

2431
02:32:34.050 --> 02:32:38.190
It all gets sort of boring.
You cry when your friends are killed,

2432
02:32:38.191 --> 02:32:42.000
but a new friend comes on a helicopter a few days later and the dead friend

2433
02:32:42.001 --> 02:32:45.990
becomes enshrined a martyr to friendship.

2434
02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:51.030
You teach the new friend about him and you all remember him.
It's very romantic.

2435
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:55.980
It doesn't sound very romantic.
That's after a month or two.

2436
02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:01.740
But lieutenant,
when you do it for six or nine or even longer by Christ,

2437
02:33:01.741 --> 02:33:02.580
you'll never shake it.

2438
02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:07.470
The Bush gets in your blood and you hate anyone who hasn't fermented in his own

2439
02:33:07.471 --> 02:33:11.940
stench for months or students side a dirt hole all night waiting to kill a man

2440
02:33:11.941 --> 02:33:13.350
who's trying to kill him first.

2441
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:20.160
Major auto scrutinized Hodges.
Oh yeah,
I've done a lot of thinking about it.

2442
02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:25.080
That's something a grunt isn't supposed to do.
He chuckled again,

2443
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:29.280
a sort of dry bark,
but what else can a man do?
And on.
Whoah.

2444
02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:35.280
Oh,
and it becomes an oasis.
You like an Hola lieutenant.

2445
02:33:35.850 --> 02:33:39.540
I hate it.
You'll like it when you get back from the bush.
I guarantee.

2446
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:44.520
So what kind of person can take it for months on end?

2447
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:46.890
Hodges felt uneasy.

2448
02:33:47.010 --> 02:33:50.280
He'd expected the major to wave the flag and talk about he will Gima and then

2449
02:33:50.281 --> 02:33:53.940
send him a board.
The resupply helicopter with fire in his heart.

2450
02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:57.840
Someone who is very dedicated sir.

2451
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:04.080
Either that or someone who's very crazy.
Well there you are.

2452
02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:08.250
That's in a nutshell.
You just hit the nail on the God damn head.

2453
02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:12.310
It's been a long time

2454
02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:17.950
that uh,
I mean

2455
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:19.121
<v 2>it's,</v>

2456
02:34:19.121 --> 02:34:23.860
it's the icon is the iconic conversation between the new lieutenant and the

2457
02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:27.040
executive officer.
And you,
you just nailed it.

2458
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:30.700
I guess I'm looking at a route that when I was 28

2459
02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:37.720
no,
I look,
I,
I wanted there,
there are a couple of things here.

2460
02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:40.030
When I started,
I said,

2461
02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.120
I am not going to write this book unless the third guy down in the third fire

2462
02:34:47.111 --> 02:34:51.790
team says,
this is true.
This is real.
I mean,
you know,
true,
real,

2463
02:34:51.791 --> 02:34:54.280
however you want to put it.
This is real.
Um,

2464
02:34:55.210 --> 02:34:59.230
and that was my guidepost in terms of all of the,

2465
02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:02.020
the combat sequences and,
and,
and this,

2466
02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:05.570
this sort of thing is you don't want to go through this and have it be dear

2467
02:35:05.571 --> 02:35:10.300
author.
I love you signed author or the way I wish it had been.
Uh,

2468
02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:13.420
or,
you know,
the way I would like to present it.
I remember when the,

2469
02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:14.990
when the book came out,
there was a,

2470
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:20.680
a marine three star general who had been very helpful when I was trying to help

2471
02:35:20.681 --> 02:35:25.240
one on one of my former Marines who,
uh,
had had been out in this area.

2472
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:27.070
And I sent him a copy of the,

2473
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:32.080
the proofs and he summoned me working on the hill.

2474
02:35:32.410 --> 02:35:35.110
He summoned me to his quarters and eighth and I,
and he said,

2475
02:35:35.111 --> 02:35:38.800
this could be a primmer on marine corps tactics,
but these were not my marines.

2476
02:35:39.970 --> 02:35:42.100
He was a colonel.
William was over there.
And I said,
sir,

2477
02:35:42.970 --> 02:35:46.760
I don't know what to tell you because that's as honest as I can be.
Um,

2478
02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:50.500
and they were my marines and I don't have to try to make it,

2479
02:35:50.530 --> 02:35:55.180
he would Jima to,
to give respect to the,
to the people who were there.

2480
02:35:55.181 --> 02:35:59.200
But I'll tell you what,
I walked out of that,
uh,
meeting with him thinking,

2481
02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:02.670
Oh my God,
you know,
this is going to be really bad if,
you know,
the,
the,

2482
02:36:02.671 --> 02:36:05.080
the Marine Corps turns on me for writing a book about Marines.

2483
02:36:05.650 --> 02:36:10.390
And then there was another two star,
uh,
General Schultz,
uh,

2484
02:36:10.570 --> 02:36:13.010
who had been a battalion commander and been on Taylor common.

2485
02:36:13.011 --> 02:36:17.890
He was with Third Marine Division,
but he'd been on Taylor common down here.
He,

2486
02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:19.810
he read the book and he called me.

2487
02:36:19.811 --> 02:36:24.670
He read it on a c one 30 from Andrews to Pendleton.

2488
02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:27.460
He called me.
He said,
this is the book.
This is the book.
I said,

2489
02:36:27.461 --> 02:36:31.960
will you send me a letter sir?
And I said,

2490
02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:35.950
he sent me a letter.
And,
uh,
so when I had this little,
uh,

2491
02:36:36.610 --> 02:36:40.530
you know,
uh,
command visit to General Wilson who was a common dot when the,

2492
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:42.650
when the book came out and going,
boy,
I'm not,

2493
02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:46.200
I'm really nervous about the General Wilson was a hard ass,
you know,
and up.

2494
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:51.630
So I got in to see General Wilson am I give him a give him a copy of the book

2495
02:36:52.091 --> 02:36:54.160
and I said,
and this is what general Schultes thinks about it.

2496
02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:57.580
And over time,
you know,

2497
02:36:57.581 --> 02:37:02.170
it's been mandatory reading and the commandant's reading list for decades.

2498
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:05.080
And I can't tell you how many letters I've gotten from re particularly staffing

2499
02:37:05.081 --> 02:37:09.010
CEO's.
You know,
I'm here when I was in Beirut and you know,
as a,

2500
02:37:09.011 --> 02:37:11.620
as a journalist air at 83,
there was a,
there was one,

2501
02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:16.520
a gunnery sergeant who came and he told me,
I have read your book 11 times.

2502
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:20.930
It is a text on,
you know,
on leadership if you really read it.

2503
02:37:21.350 --> 02:37:25.700
And at the same time,
the,
the important thing also is if you're,

2504
02:37:25.701 --> 02:37:29.450
if you're going to write a novel that lasts,
you want that universality.

2505
02:37:29.451 --> 02:37:33.380
As you say.
This doesn't just,
Vietnam has just isn't my experience.
Um,

2506
02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:38.560
and so it really is a very carefully drawn moral drama.

2507
02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:42.030
Um,
and you know,

2508
02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:44.090
some of these passages we're going to have it heard him in years.

2509
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:47.150
And I still remember because I had written some of these 25 times,
you know,
the,

2510
02:37:47.151 --> 02:37:49.900
the,
the one you started off with,
I knew the words,
you know,

2511
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:54.500
I knew the words that we're going to come out of your mouth.
Uh,
so that is,

2512
02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:00.260
you know,
that was my intention with the book.
And,
um,
you know,

2513
02:38:00.261 --> 02:38:05.060
what can I say?
It's still out there and you know,
it's as honest as I can be.

2514
02:38:05.061 --> 02:38:07.670
And I know,
as you know,

2515
02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:12.770
there are a lot of rough spots in this book,
but I don't have to,

2516
02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:14.480
I don't have to put it any differently.

2517
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:17.270
The other one other thing I will say is the dialogue,

2518
02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:22.460
it maybe from having benefited from living in so many different places and what

2519
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:25.770
dialect is,
you know,

2520
02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:31.730
carefully accurate in like seven or eight different American dialects and the

2521
02:38:31.731 --> 02:38:32.810
way they say words in there.
Oh

2522
02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.610
<v 0>yeah,
for sure.
No,
you,
you nailed that.
It's very clear.
Um,</v>

2523
02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:39.740
that yet you know these people,

2524
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.290
you know that then that you were able to capture it.

2525
02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:47.500
You also did a great job obviously of capturing some of the just straight combat

2526
02:38:48.470 --> 02:38:51.800
and I'm going to go here.
Just one little situation.

2527
02:38:51.801 --> 02:38:53.990
Suddenly there were loud explosions across the river.

2528
02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:56.150
The northern compound literally erupted.

2529
02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:59.810
Recoilless rifles flashed and boomed again and again.

2530
02:38:59.811 --> 02:39:03.140
They're explosions raising clouds of dirt inside the compound machine,

2531
02:39:03.141 --> 02:39:05.210
guns and small arms hammered at the marines.

2532
02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:09.740
The two platoon perimeter fought back red and green tracers interlaced careening

2533
02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:12.530
into the black air,
making weaving patterns in the night.

2534
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:15.920
The artillery battery on the bridge compound reacted.

2535
02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.960
It turns its guns north and lob dozens of projectiles across the river seeking

2536
02:39:20.961 --> 02:39:23.510
to silence the attack.
New Bright flashes,

2537
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:26.420
Hayes's of dust grouped around the northern compound.

2538
02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:32.150
Then a moment of anticipatory lull.
Goodrich knew what was about to happen.

2539
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:34.910
He wished he could tell them in the bridge compound.

2540
02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:38.270
He wished he could dig a hole in the dirt and come back out in California.

2541
02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:42.680
Watch out.
He groaned inwardly too.
Afraid to cry.
Oh Shit.

2542
02:39:42.890 --> 02:39:45.290
Here it comes right now,

2543
02:39:45.890 --> 02:39:49.550
an avalanche and mortar rounds time from a dozen tubes to land together on the

2544
02:39:49.551 --> 02:39:53.030
southern compound.
Then just above the stranded team,

2545
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:56.960
the deep pops of heavy machine gun Goodrich.

2546
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:59.840
Listen to himself whimper.
He could not stifle it.

2547
02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:03.080
It seemed to him a scream that would give them all away,

2548
02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:07.670
but he finally realized it was no more than a scratchy whispering wine.

2549
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:10.910
The bridge compounds defenders were caught unaware having to feel like

2550
02:40:10.911 --> 02:40:12.650
spectators in the northern compounds.

2551
02:40:12.651 --> 02:40:16.830
Furious defense bodies went flat inside their bunker seeking cover from the

2552
02:40:16.831 --> 02:40:21.210
mortar barrage as they did.
Streams of sappers poured through the outer wire,

2553
02:40:21.270 --> 02:40:25.460
sliding pipes of Bangalore torpedoes to clear pathways through the Concertina.

2554
02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:28.440
For a moment,
they were unnoticed.

2555
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:31.110
The explosions they created blending in with the mortars.

2556
02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:35.400
They broke through both sides of the j shaped hill just at its hook tossing

2557
02:40:35.401 --> 02:40:38.130
Satchel charges of explosives into the nearest bunkers.

2558
02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:40.350
Half of the bunkers on the artillery side,

2559
02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:43.530
unmanned as their defenders had helped with the fire.

2560
02:40:43.531 --> 02:40:46.800
Missions on the north compound were quickly taken by the Nva.

2561
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:50.340
The rest of the perimeter swarmed.
We've creeping dashing,
set sappers.

2562
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:53.700
Two bunkers were lost just down from third platoons.
Last position,

2563
02:40:53.850 --> 02:40:55.320
the sappers man of the bunkers.

2564
02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:59.550
After killing the occupants with Satchel charges and provided a beachhead on the

2565
02:40:59.551 --> 02:41:03.720
lines,
a stream of shadows poured into the compound between the bunkers,

2566
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:06.630
the first cell of Nva that raced past the bunkers,

2567
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:09.480
burned an entrance with a washing flame thrower.

2568
02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:13.650
It ignited the corner of a nearby 10 and two bright red answers from a host of

2569
02:41:13.651 --> 02:41:17.580
rifles fired from nearby bunkers.
There was no second wash.

2570
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:22.670
It's trigger man and its mate lay dead beside low smolders from the torch lit

2571
02:41:22.681 --> 02:41:23.514
tent.

2572
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:27.720
Another sapper team quipped quietly into the center of the compound and

2573
02:41:27.721 --> 02:41:31.860
encountered two almost identical bunkers and it tasted demolish the chapel

2574
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:36.180
leaving the compound bleeding the command center bunker unscathed after the

2575
02:41:36.181 --> 02:41:38.940
chapel exploded in detonation that raised a blight,

2576
02:41:38.941 --> 02:41:41.610
bright flash and leveled the bunker in a smoking heap.

2577
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:44.010
Another fierce mortar barrage shook the hill.

2578
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:47.520
The North Vietnamese would attempt to take out more bunkers,

2579
02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:51.420
consolidate then retreat through the breaks in the they had made in the wire.

2580
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:56.010
Speedy's gun teamed,
cringed in the stream bed on speaking,

2581
02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:58.140
wincing as the gun caught loose again,

2582
02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:02.970
it's explosion seem to be so close that one could reach up a hand and lose it to

2583
02:42:02.971 --> 02:42:07.830
a bullet.
Each man knew that if you were made an unworthy on,

2584
02:42:07.831 --> 02:42:10.290
untoward move revealing himself in any way,

2585
02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:14.160
the whole team would not last five minutes.
No where to go.

2586
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:16.320
<v 2>Nowhere to hide.</v>

2587
02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:27.080
Yeah.
Well you know,
one of the,
uh,

2588
02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:30.930
have you ever had an aunt and Meyer entered Myers books?

2589
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:34.170
I have not once an eagle.
I have not.
Um,

2590
02:42:36.390 --> 02:42:39.810
when we,
when the,
actually I think I have read once an eagle.
It's a great,

2591
02:42:39.811 --> 02:42:44.220
great book.
You know,
when,
when,
uh,
when we sent the proofs around on,

2592
02:42:44.370 --> 02:42:49.020
on the fields,
the Prentice hall didn't quite know what to expect.

2593
02:42:49.530 --> 02:42:52.260
They,
you know,
the book had been rejected by 12 publishers.

2594
02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:56.520
Nobody wanted to see this side of it.
Uh,
and the,
the editor in chief apprentice,

2595
02:42:56.521 --> 02:43:01.200
all John Kirk had been on a naval aviator in the Korean War.

2596
02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:02.940
He was a Harvard graduate,

2597
02:43:02.970 --> 02:43:05.640
which I thought was kind of interesting cause when he asked me to come and talk

2598
02:43:05.641 --> 02:43:08.520
to him,
he asked me to meet him at the Harvard Club or you know,
good riches,

2599
02:43:08.521 --> 02:43:13.000
the Harvard Goofy,
you know,
but he said,
I think this can be the great novel,

2600
02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:15.420
you know,
he said,
the,
the,
the,

2601
02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:19.630
the great novels of different wards go against the grain of prevailing
orthodoxy.

2602
02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:23.590
Um,
and he made a deal with me.
He said,
you know,

2603
02:43:23.591 --> 02:43:26.380
I'll give you $5,000 had been working on this for four years.

2604
02:43:26.470 --> 02:43:29.290
They give you $5,000,
I'll print 5,000 copies.
Um,

2605
02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:32.980
but I will put your book on the cover of publishers weekly and I'll send you on

2606
02:43:32.981 --> 02:43:37.480
a major tour.
And I said,
you know,
done.
And he said,
oh,
actually the draft,

2607
02:43:37.481 --> 02:43:38.680
he had only had like a,

2608
02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:43.780
a five page epilogue when Goodrich.
And he said,

2609
02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:46.630
I actually like to see more of Goodrich coming back.
I said,

2610
02:43:46.631 --> 02:43:50.770
would you like the 28 page version,
the 35 page version number,
62 page version?

2611
02:43:52.430 --> 02:43:54.660
Totally look at that.
I gave him like a 30 page version,

2612
02:43:54.690 --> 02:43:59.350
but a typed page version back.
But then they started sending the book around,
um,

2613
02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:04.120
before publication date for advanced quotes and he got a torrent of them,

2614
02:44:04.690 --> 02:44:07.380
you know,
and the one,
one of the,
uh,

2615
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:11.380
the advanced quotes that I treasured the most was from admire.
Um,

2616
02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:14.680
he had been a,
he also was a Harvard guy,

2617
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:18.570
but he had been a marine in World War II,
uh,
had been on a,

2618
02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:23.590
either Guadalcanal or Iijima was wounded and wrote once an eagle,

2619
02:44:23.591 --> 02:44:26.110
which is a marvelous book.

2620
02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:32.230
I haven't read war and peace is like a thousand pages long,
but he,

2621
02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:37.120
uh,
he,
he took a one character,
well,

2622
02:44:37.121 --> 02:44:38.020
actually two characters,

2623
02:44:38.021 --> 02:44:42.760
but from before World War One all the way into Vietnam that we didn't call it

2624
02:44:42.761 --> 02:44:46.600
Vietnam in his book.
Um,
and you know,
one of them was a,
you know,

2625
02:44:46.930 --> 02:44:51.580
a Nebraska farm kid who was,
uh,
enlisted and you know,

2626
02:44:51.581 --> 02:44:55.030
and it got a battlefield commission,
World War One,
and the other was a,
you know,

2627
02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.790
west point guy who punched all the buttons.
Exactly right.

2628
02:44:57.910 --> 02:45:01.780
His name was Massengale.
Other one was Sam.
David.
Um,

2629
02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:06.110
but he wrote really good combat scenes and I,
I,

2630
02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:10.480
and I loved his book and he sent,
when he,
when he sent,

2631
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:15.340
he sent this long advanced quote in his book and I,
yeah,
I just have all of them.

2632
02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:16.480
I'm like,
wow,
you know,

2633
02:45:16.481 --> 02:45:21.481
he said here at last is that the real story of those who were in Vietnam,

2634
02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:27.670
you know,
devoid of Histrionics,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,
and um,

2635
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:32.500
you know,
of,
but that,
you know,
when,
when you read passages like that,

2636
02:45:32.501 --> 02:45:37.060
I think of,
uh,
you know,
people like him,
um,

2637
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:41.680
you know,
reacting to this gamble,
you know,
at,
at the time,

2638
02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:44.240
because there was nothing else like this at the till,

2639
02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:49.480
as was the first revisionist novel.
And I'll tell you,
when I went on my tour,
um,

2640
02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:51.310
I'd spent a year and a half on,

2641
02:45:51.311 --> 02:45:56.311
I was working on the house veteran's committee developing what I sort of,

2642
02:45:58.331 --> 02:46:03.250
uh,
a factual basis for discussion on the Vietnam War.
You know,

2643
02:46:03.251 --> 02:46:05.740
how long did people really serve?
How many were draftees,

2644
02:46:05.741 --> 02:46:08.260
how many were volunteers,
what,

2645
02:46:08.261 --> 02:46:13.040
what was the makeup of the casualties,
you know?
Uh,
and those who serve,
et Cetera,

2646
02:46:13.041 --> 02:46:15.800
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Just trying to lay the whole thing out year by year.

2647
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:19.850
So I went out and the shows that I did,
that's what I wanted to talk about.

2648
02:46:19.851 --> 02:46:23.810
You know,
I would talk about this other stuff.
Um,
but there were,
you know,

2649
02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.360
I had some real moments and also by the way,

2650
02:46:26.361 --> 02:46:30.410
had been representing his so called war criminal pro bono from my first year in

2651
02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:33.460
law school,
who I represented for six years.
Uh,

2652
02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:36.690
he committed suicide halfway through.
I clear his name.
I,
I finally,

2653
02:46:36.691 --> 02:46:41.180
after six years,
but that wasn't very popular,
uh,
out there.
But,
uh,

2654
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:42.343
I had,
uh,

2655
02:46:43.010 --> 02:46:47.630
I was on a radio show in Boston and I'm in the middle of the show.

2656
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:51.440
This guy stopped.
He said,
I can't,
I can't tell,
hold us back any longer.

2657
02:46:51.441 --> 02:46:56.060
Don't you consider yourself to be a murderer?
Uh,
and I went,
no.

2658
02:46:56.061 --> 02:46:59.800
And actually what I said and not be in the intro and,
uh,
the American rifleman,

2659
02:46:59.810 --> 02:47:01.070
the shot or whatever,
I said,
no,

2660
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:05.300
man is by nature of violent animal and society puts restrictions,

2661
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:08.540
you know,
like [inaudible] me.
Give you ABC here,
you know,

2662
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:12.230
society puts restrictions on how that violence is used.

2663
02:47:12.231 --> 02:47:17.120
And I don't consider myself to be a murder any more than,
you know,

2664
02:47:17.121 --> 02:47:21.080
a police officer.
Okay.
So,
and I had,
I was on a good morning,

2665
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:23.700
Boston and a woman to produce.
You're so nice to me,
et cetera.

2666
02:47:23.701 --> 02:47:27.000
And right before I go to the store,
she said,
we used to hate you guys.
I said,

2667
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:31.160
what?
She said,
no,
really.
I mean,
hate you.
Oh,
thank you for that.

2668
02:47:31.430 --> 02:47:36.260
Now going with the screaming wolf here,
you know,
um,
and it's interesting because,

2669
02:47:36.261 --> 02:47:39.790
uh,
I did a show in,
I think it was Cincinnati,
which was a TV show.

2670
02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:41.580
But speaking about the passage we just read,

2671
02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:44.920
right a little further in that passage,
there is a,
uh,

2672
02:47:45.050 --> 02:47:48.090
a sequence where there was a,
uh,

2673
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:51.810
an enemy soldier who was in the trapped in the wire and he's all,
you know,

2674
02:47:51.811 --> 02:47:54.080
like kind of blown away.
And he starts yelling to Hawaii.

2675
02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:57.860
I surrender if you all eight you hallway and somebody yelled,

2676
02:47:57.861 --> 02:48:01.790
shut up and shot him.
And it's a woman who was interviewing me.
She says,

2677
02:48:02.210 --> 02:48:04.820
how can you put that in a book?
You know,

2678
02:48:04.821 --> 02:48:09.200
somebody who was trying to surrender who was shot.
And uh,
I said,
well look,

2679
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:12.680
you know,
this is the reality of what was going on.
So she says,

2680
02:48:12.681 --> 02:48:16.040
I'm going to put that to a vote.
And she asked the viewers,

2681
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:19.730
how many of you agree with them?
94% of them agreed with me.
I think she,

2682
02:48:19.731 --> 02:48:23.510
I think maybe we're starting to get somewhere here,
you know,
not,
you know,

2683
02:48:23.511 --> 02:48:27.890
not the lionizing shooting wounded soldiers,

2684
02:48:27.891 --> 02:48:32.600
but you know,
I mean reality is reality.
It is indeed.
Once you touch him,

2685
02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:34.040
then it's different,
you know,

2686
02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:34.860
<v 0>uh,</v>

2687
02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:39.860
and speaking of reality being reality and it's is a to to kind of point out some

2688
02:48:40.411 --> 02:48:44.220
of the reality that's in this book.
I got one more thing I want to read from it.

2689
02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:52.080
How'd you like to stay in on Okinawa,
sir?
That's right.
The major smiled.

2690
02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:54.990
Jesus Lieutenant,
I thought you would have jumped over the desk by now.

2691
02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:56.940
I'm on the level.

2692
02:48:57.510 --> 02:49:02.130
We just had a bill it open up over at special services recreation officer,

2693
02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:04.590
a lieutenant rotated early on emergency leave.

2694
02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:08.430
He had less than 90 days on his tour,
so he'll reassigned from the states.

2695
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:10.500
I have the authority to fill the bill,

2696
02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:15.330
bill it from the transients who been in country already.
Your ideal combat time,

2697
02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.520
hospital time.
What'd you like it?
The major jived him greening.
Good duty.

2698
02:49:20.610 --> 02:49:25.320
Lots of free time.
Stick around Hodges.
We'll turn you into a hormone green.
Drunk.

2699
02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:32.340
A simple yes and the war would be over,
but so what?

2700
02:49:32.341 --> 02:49:37.200
Everything else and for the first time he confronted the truth.
Yes.
Major.

2701
02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:38.400
Thank you sir.

2702
02:49:38.490 --> 02:49:42.360
And the rest of his life would be anti climax.

2703
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:44.850
There was nothing on the other side.

2704
02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:49.470
What does a man do when his wars over wondered Hodges except keep fighting it

2705
02:49:50.190 --> 02:49:53.880
all expectancies than lived and if not fulfilled?

2706
02:49:54.030 --> 02:49:59.030
Well at least confronted the bald red hills with their sandbag bunkers.

2707
02:50:00.810 --> 02:50:05.490
The banter and frolic of dirt covered grunts.
That fearful intensity of contact.

2708
02:50:06.390 --> 02:50:11.280
It was too deep inside him and he had not yet done enough to be free of it.

2709
02:50:13.010 --> 02:50:16.910
He suddenly felt superior to the major,
uh,
creature apart,

2710
02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:21.230
capable of absorbing,
combats horror without asking for quarter.

2711
02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:23.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2712
02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:27.670
<v 0>Down South his men were on patrol or digging new perimeters or dying.</v>

2713
02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:31.090
And he was nothing if he did not share that misery.

2714
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:38.000
He stared deep into the majors face enjoying the one moment of nobility that is

2715
02:50:38.821 --> 02:50:43.340
months of terror had allowed
thanks major,

2716
02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.200
but I didn't call halfway around the world to referee basketball games,

2717
02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:55.400
the most powerful
and telling see,

2718
02:50:55.401 --> 02:50:57.120
or one of the most powerful until the scene seat,

2719
02:50:57.150 --> 02:51:01.040
tell me scenes in the novel is the way that I originally ended it,
which is,

2720
02:51:01.070 --> 02:51:02.230
which is with,

2721
02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.740
<v 2>uh,
Michiko taking her son</v>

2722
02:51:09.070 --> 02:51:11.140
to Camp Hansen

2723
02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:17.190
<v 0>and she's on the one hand,
she's trying to exp,
you know,
to,
to build,</v>

2724
02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:18.620
<v 2>uh,</v>

2725
02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:24.310
<v 0>some positive feelings and him about the father he never knew and the price that</v>

2726
02:51:24.311 --> 02:51:28.280
he was paying for being half American in,
in the Okinawan society.

2727
02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.120
<v 2>And,</v>

2728
02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:33.040
<v 0>and she says,
what's this?
He says,
you know,</v>

2729
02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:35.760
she takes him to Camp Hanson and you know,
cause he can,

2730
02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:39.410
she can see the marines air,
he could see the marines and air and he says it was,

2731
02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:40.253
was a good thing.

2732
02:51:40.330 --> 02:51:45.140
<v 2>The am I like them,
then I'll be a warrior,
you know?
And,</v>

2733
02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:49.950
and that's like,
whoa.
You know.
Um,
and then,
yeah,

2734
02:51:50.010 --> 02:51:54.570
<v 0>when I was in the Senate,
it's very ironic.
We actually had a situation</v>

2735
02:51:55.010 --> 02:51:59.080
<v 2>on,
on Okinawa,
which was an exact replay,</v>

2736
02:51:59.730 --> 02:52:04.240
um,
where I was able to help a family home marine,

2737
02:52:04.530 --> 02:52:05.363
um,

2738
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:09.080
<v 0>who were deployed to Iraq and,
uh,</v>

2739
02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:14.220
found out that his fiance was pregnant and they arranged

2740
02:52:18.490 --> 02:52:23.490
for them to be married on the phone and they had immigration issues and kid

2741
02:52:23.711 --> 02:52:26.410
issues and all this stuff.
And my counsel,

2742
02:52:26.470 --> 02:52:30.670
Trevor Mo was when it was handled,
when he was handling us,

2743
02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:35.690
I gave him a copy of fields of fire
cover.
Amazing course.

2744
02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:41.380
Speaking of sons,
I want to go here.
Back to,
uh,

2745
02:52:41.530 --> 02:52:45.460
I heard my country calling talking about as you were,

2746
02:52:46.390 --> 02:52:47.860
as you were heading off to Vietnam.

2747
02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:51.850
I would soon drive west heading for California where Barbara would rent a house

2748
02:52:51.851 --> 02:52:55.540
across the street from my granny and I would catch a flight to Vietnam.

2749
02:52:55.541 --> 02:52:59.320
My parents would clear their quarters at Andrews Air Force Base and that had

2750
02:52:59.321 --> 02:53:03.400
south to stay for awhile with my dad's longtime friend bud Caldwell as they

2751
02:53:03.401 --> 02:53:06.730
adjusted to the unknown's of retirement that awaited them in Florida.

2752
02:53:07.570 --> 02:53:09.100
Alpha had just begun.

2753
02:53:09.250 --> 02:53:14.250
Omega was not so happily done in less than 20 years.

2754
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:18.700
Our lives had traveled to full circle.
I was now the one who is leaving.

2755
02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:24.100
My Dad was the one being left behind.
There was nothing left to say.

2756
02:53:25.450 --> 02:53:26.283
It was time to go.

2757
02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:31.800
We rose from the years Warren couches and began to say our final deliberate,

2758
02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:33.730
understated goodbyes.

2759
02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:38.070
We slowly made our way toward the front door of the farmhouse.

2760
02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:43.650
The radio in the dining room began playing Danny boy song by Johnny Cash.

2761
02:53:44.910 --> 02:53:48.540
I'm not sure that anyone other than God himself could have arranged the sweet

2762
02:53:48.541 --> 02:53:52.470
sorrow of that moment.
Johnny Cash was my favorite singer.

2763
02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:54.390
Danny boy,

2764
02:53:54.570 --> 02:53:59.570
emblematic of our long held Scots Irish heritage of military service is perhaps

2765
02:53:59.971 --> 02:54:03.870
the greatest song ever written about the painful anguish of a father watching

2766
02:54:03.871 --> 02:54:06.960
helplessly as his son marches off to war.

2767
02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:10.440
Oh Danny boy,
the pipes,

2768
02:54:10.441 --> 02:54:14.550
the pipes are calling from Glen to Glen and down the mountain side,

2769
02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:18.210
the summer's gone and all the roses falling.

2770
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:24.070
Tis You two is you must go and I must bide become [inaudible] back when summer's

2771
02:54:26.101 --> 02:54:29.310
in the meadow or when the valley's hushed and white would snow.

2772
02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:35.400
Tis All be here in sunshine.
Orange Shadow.
Oh,

2773
02:54:35.401 --> 02:54:39.060
Danny boy.
Oh Danny boy,
I love you.
So

2774
02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:45.780
it was the first and only time I ever saw my father cry.

2775
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2776
02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:52.850
<v 0>And then</v>

2777
02:54:55.040 --> 02:55:00.040
30 odd years later you're sending your son into the Marine Corps.

2778
02:55:02.570 --> 02:55:04.700
The Iraq is escalating

2779
02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.421
<v 2>cause this is what,</v>

2780
02:55:05.421 --> 02:55:10.380
2003 I joined in early 2005 yeah,

2781
02:55:10.650 --> 02:55:14.390
it's full escalation mode at this point.
And

2782
02:55:16.170 --> 02:55:21.000
you're going through the same thing.
That's harder going through it.
I think,

2783
02:55:21.001 --> 02:55:24.000
um,
it's,

2784
02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:28.590
it's harder having a loved one gone done.
It is being gone emotionally.

2785
02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:32.310
I think.
Um,
yeah.
Uh,

2786
02:55:35.070 --> 02:55:35.700
<v 1>okay.</v>

2787
02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:36.870
<v 2>My Dad was gone a lot.</v>

2788
02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:39.733
<v 1>Um,</v>

2789
02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:46.630
<v 2>I never expected that he would react that way,
you know.
Um,
and then when,</v>

2790
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:51.040
you know,
when Jim was gone,
you know,
it was,
uh,
it was hard for a lot of reasons,

2791
02:55:53.350 --> 02:55:58.350
partly because I was out there campaigning part of the time and this was a very

2792
02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:01.030
private thing to me.
I'm a father,

2793
02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:06.310
I refuse to talk about it other than in,
in general terms.
Um,

2794
02:56:07.210 --> 02:56:08.043
but uh,

2795
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:12.501
he went,

2796
02:56:12.501 --> 02:56:16.640
he was able to call every now and then and send emails and that sort of thing.

2797
02:56:16.641 --> 02:56:20.630
And actually it made it a little harder,
you know,

2798
02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:25.610
cause you're getting a bit a piece here.
Yeah.
Um,
we had,
um,
just as a,

2799
02:56:25.611 --> 02:56:29.120
as an anecdote,
I've got to make like I think three phone calls from,

2800
02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:34.340
from Vietnam.
Um,
when you get back and,
and Wa,
uh,
you know,

2801
02:56:34.341 --> 02:56:36.970
on these Mars radio stations where you have three minutes,
you're standing there,

2802
02:56:36.971 --> 02:56:39.320
you got three minutes into it,
you got it.
You say something,

2803
02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:44.350
you go over and then they talk on the other end.
So I go,
hey mom,
hey mom,

2804
02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:48.980
I'm,
I'm here in Vietnam over and over where,
well,

2805
02:56:48.981 --> 02:56:51.430
I gotta go now.
But you know,

2806
02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:54.530
getting some of the bits and pieces of what's going on in,
in,
in,
you know,

2807
02:56:54.531 --> 02:56:57.890
a Jim was very,
very well read and smart about that region.

2808
02:56:57.890 --> 02:57:01.790
So he was seeing things,
even as a lance corporal did.
A lot of people weren't.

2809
02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:03.830
That was tough.
And then,
you know,

2810
02:57:04.370 --> 02:57:08.300
truly waking up every morning and not knowing if your kids alive,
you know,

2811
02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:12.080
I mean that's the unknown's bother you.

2812
02:57:12.930 --> 02:57:16.580
I wouldn't unknown's and a partial knowns bother you more than actually being

2813
02:57:16.581 --> 02:57:21.170
there I think.
But yeah,
it's very hard,
but it's also our family boy,

2814
02:57:21.830 --> 02:57:25.880
you know.
And uh,
so,
um,

2815
02:57:27.380 --> 02:57:30.800
when he came back it was out to tell you a funny story.

2816
02:57:31.490 --> 02:57:36.020
They got extended on the surge,
you know,
one six got extended on.
Good job.

2817
02:57:36.021 --> 02:57:38.540
We got to stay longer.
Yeah.
And I think there was a,

2818
02:57:38.541 --> 02:57:40.610
there was a lot of fist fights going on at that boy.

2819
02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:46.460
And Jim's never back down from one,
anybody,
but on.

2820
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:49.580
So I finally said to him,
uh,
an email.
All right,
when you get back,

2821
02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:53.840
anything you want,
he says,
um,
Yankees and red sox.

2822
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:57.050
Fenway park May 19th.
Yeah.
I,
we have a great,

2823
02:57:57.860 --> 02:58:01.500
great friend and I got a lot of great friends and from South Boston Marine Corps

2824
02:58:01.501 --> 02:58:02.040
community up

2825
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.290
<v 5>there and I,
Tommy Lyons who was,
uh,</v>

2826
02:58:05.780 --> 02:58:10.440
ran the veterans programs up there.
He got tickets.
And not only that,

2827
02:58:10.441 --> 02:58:15.120
but gentlemen,
one of his,
uh,
company mates who was from,
uh,

2828
02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:15.973
Boston,

2829
02:58:16.170 --> 02:58:21.170
they got off the plane at Logan and there was the state highway patrol waiting

2830
02:58:21.721 --> 02:58:24.930
forum that,
uh,
like a squad car,
whatever.
I don't know what it was,

2831
02:58:24.931 --> 02:58:29.790
but they had the sirens going and coming to come into Fenway and uh,
yeah,

2832
02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:33.030
I couldn't,
I couldn't have been any better.
A GM.

2833
02:58:33.031 --> 02:58:36.290
So how old were you when you were like thinking yourself?
All right.
Um,

2834
02:58:36.450 --> 02:58:37.890
I'm following in my dad's footsteps.

2835
02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:42.990
<v 3>Earliest I could think there was,
uh,
two things.</v>

2836
02:58:42.991 --> 02:58:46.650
I wanted to be a professional baseball player and a marine both at the same
time.

2837
02:58:47.010 --> 02:58:49.600
And when I was 13,
a good friend of mine,
uh,

2838
02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:53.160
we were warming up for a baseball game,
told me that could not happen.

2839
02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:57.000
And so it became kind of a binary choice.

2840
02:58:57.330 --> 02:58:59.340
But the Marine Corps is always at the front.
Uh,

2841
02:58:59.430 --> 02:59:03.330
my dad had a rope hanging in the back yard the entire time we were growing up.

2842
02:59:03.331 --> 02:59:06.450
I think it was one day he came home,
I don't know how old I was,
but I climbed it,

2843
02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:09.690
got back down and asked if I could be a marine.
And he's,

2844
02:59:09.691 --> 02:59:12.840
his reaction was that I needed to get some sort of organized athletics

2845
02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:14.250
immediately.

2846
02:59:14.250 --> 02:59:15.140
<v 5>Need to wait 10 years.</v>

2847
02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:22.190
When you were,
when you were born in Ramadi,
so you,

2848
02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:26.180
you had paid attention to what was going on in Ramadi and you guys knew you were

2849
02:59:26.181 --> 02:59:29.780
deploying there.
I missed three,
eight.
I had done an awesome job.
And they take,

2850
02:59:29.781 --> 02:59:34.370
I mean they've obviously taken a ton of casualties as had the whole one,

2851
02:59:34.371 --> 02:59:37.460
one AED in the two to eight before them and that,
and the,

2852
02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:40.760
the three eight actually overlap between the,
you know,
they were there.

2853
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:41.990
Let's just like the first of the five Oh six,

2854
02:59:41.991 --> 02:59:46.060
they were there between when the two,
two,
eight left,
the three eight stayed the,

2855
02:59:46.061 --> 02:59:49.730
the first of five or six states.
Some of the other battalion stayed I think.

2856
02:59:50.210 --> 02:59:55.210
But so you guys both knew how bad Ramadi was when you were heading there.

2857
02:59:56.670 --> 02:59:58.830
<v 3>Right.
And it's a,</v>

2858
02:59:59.270 --> 03:00:04.230
that was go back to when we were announced that we were going there.

2859
03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:07.020
You mentioned last night there was some rumor that we were going to go on a

2860
03:00:07.021 --> 03:00:09.660
booze cruise,
there was going to be a reward for our battalion,

2861
03:00:09.661 --> 03:00:13.350
haven't done some seriously good work and Volusia and in Afghanistan.

2862
03:00:14.100 --> 03:00:16.620
And there is a,
uh,
a fairly,

2863
03:00:17.370 --> 03:00:20.250
I don't want to say it was dejection because that would sound wrong,

2864
03:00:20.251 --> 03:00:25.251
but it was kind of a whoa moment because we had heard what was happening two,

2865
03:00:25.441 --> 03:00:25.711
three,

2866
03:00:25.711 --> 03:00:28.050
eight and they were in a serious fight and all the unions that had been there

2867
03:00:28.051 --> 03:00:29.430
before that had been serious fights.

2868
03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:35.180
And I tried to get as much information as I could about the place that I was

2869
03:00:36.781 --> 03:00:39.570
going to be going.
And there wasn't much written quite yet.

2870
03:00:39.571 --> 03:00:41.680
There was a little bit about too for uh,

2871
03:00:41.820 --> 03:00:46.270
one of the first units marine units in there that was in print.
Um,

2872
03:00:46.350 --> 03:00:51.240
but in terms of press reports,
they were,
they were an eyeopener.

2873
03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:54.690
I believe there was an embed with three eight where there were detailing an

2874
03:00:54.691 --> 03:00:59.560
average day patrolling.
And these guys hop in walls and talking about the,
uh,

2875
03:00:59.561 --> 03:01:03.040
the average time to contact from leaving wherever you were was about five

2876
03:01:03.041 --> 03:01:05.170
minutes.
And it was,

2877
03:01:05.530 --> 03:01:09.910
it was an eyeopener in and I was a boot at the time.
Um,
and one of the,

2878
03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:12.440
one of the things that I would do would be,
would be going on Oh,

2879
03:01:12.450 --> 03:01:13.660
grish or live leak.

2880
03:01:14.170 --> 03:01:17.750
And I wanted to find some way to rationalize,
you know,

2881
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:19.360
the TTPs of the enemy.

2882
03:01:20.050 --> 03:01:23.560
Could I s like could I see what they were setting up when they're videotaping

2883
03:01:23.561 --> 03:01:28.210
these complex attacks,
the IED strikes and there was really no way to do it.

2884
03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:33.010
Um,
you get a 32nd clip of a gun truck getting hit or a complex ambush.

2885
03:01:33.460 --> 03:01:38.350
And eventually one of my friends at the time,
a cliff Collins worth,
um,

2886
03:01:38.351 --> 03:01:40.270
he's passed,
um,
you know,

2887
03:01:41.050 --> 03:01:44.730
laid into me one night about doing that.
It's like,

2888
03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:46.720
it's like you're not going to learn a damn thing.

2889
03:01:47.170 --> 03:01:49.990
You're just gonna get wrapped up in a ball,
knock it off.

2890
03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:54.460
And I took his advice and just play video games.
But it was,
uh,

2891
03:01:55.180 --> 03:01:58.570
it was,
it was,
it was interesting trying to get mentally prepared for it.
Um,

2892
03:01:59.050 --> 03:02:00.190
and I remember before we deployed,

2893
03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:05.470
I was in a hotel room with him and one of the things that stood out as you've

2894
03:02:05.471 --> 03:02:07.960
all these things going on as you know,
where a particular,

2895
03:02:07.961 --> 03:02:12.430
what's your first deployment in know family is trying to be there for you.

2896
03:02:12.431 --> 03:02:16.420
There's a lot of emotions flowing around and he said,
you know,

2897
03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:21.370
if you survive,
and that woke me up in a big way.

2898
03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:24.370
I had never thought that was going to be even a question.

2899
03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:29.640
And it was something that was relayed to me by not only my own father,

2900
03:02:29.651 --> 03:02:34.651
but by someone who had been through his own very serious combat experience.

2901
03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:37.540
Um,
and,
uh,

2902
03:02:37.930 --> 03:02:41.980
as I try to kind of rehash all this in my head,
I was,

2903
03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:45.400
I was brought back to a book that you reviewed on Vietnam a couple of podcasts

2904
03:02:45.401 --> 03:02:49.720
ago where this a new lieutenant was talking about getting ready to leave.

2905
03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:51.010
Um,

2906
03:02:51.010 --> 03:02:55.870
and you know how he was eating his meal the night before.

2907
03:02:56.290 --> 03:02:56.980
Um,

2908
03:02:56.980 --> 03:03:01.980
and there was absolutely no desire to be,

2909
03:03:02.530 --> 03:03:05.560
to have the meal,
to be involved with it.
His mind was somewhere else.

2910
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:10.630
And the night before I deployed,
uh,
my cousins lived in Jacksonville.

2911
03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:12.730
Um,
my dad took us out to,

2912
03:03:12.731 --> 03:03:15.490
I believe it was sharp shooters and it's a burger joint,

2913
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:19.390
favorite thing in the world.
Cheeseburger.
Um,
every year on my birthday,

2914
03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:23.830
my mom would make a special meal and I'd always ask for a cheeseburger and I got

2915
03:03:23.831 --> 03:03:26.680
a bacon double cheeseburger and basically just stared at it.

2916
03:03:27.070 --> 03:03:30.730
And all I could think about was where I was going to be in 48 hours and how the

2917
03:03:30.731 --> 03:03:34.590
world around me there was just going to keep going on.
Um,

2918
03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:39.640
and it was a very interesting period.
Um,

2919
03:03:39.700 --> 03:03:44.700
although he did make me famous a couple of months later cause the next morning

2920
03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:47.560
we're getting ready to go out and once he got an a Dale Wilson was there,

2921
03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:48.491
a triple amputee.

2922
03:03:48.491 --> 03:03:52.630
He actually walked up to our barracks room all night before we deployed.
Um,

2923
03:03:52.980 --> 03:03:55.040
you know,
walked up to the second or third deck.
Uh,

2924
03:03:55.090 --> 03:03:58.730
nobody could tell he was triple amputee,
hung out in the barracks with my dad,
uh,

2925
03:03:59.070 --> 03:04:02.150
and us for a bit.
And then in the next,
the uh,

2926
03:04:02.930 --> 03:04:06.800
the next morning getting ready to go on the bus and somebody,

2927
03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:08.720
I guess it was a whiskey or moonshine

2928
03:04:10.350 --> 03:04:12.840
<v 5>you're on,
you're on,
you're on the radio.
Whiskey</v>

2929
03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:20.160
<v 3>did a going away shots in the parking lot and there was a nice picture of it.</v>

2930
03:04:20.770 --> 03:04:23.800
Cold months later interact.
My company first sergeant pulls me aside.

2931
03:04:23.980 --> 03:04:27.640
He's in New York Times article apparently about it.
Really?
Yeah.

2932
03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:30.450
<v 5>Research better than we can read that on that</v>

2933
03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.700
<v 3>mentioned it wasn't anything crazy,
but he's like,
Oh really?</v>

2934
03:04:33.701 --> 03:04:35.830
Web Drinking on the job.
It's like,
ah,

2935
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:41.310
<v 5>do we want to
talk to you by being able to communicate?</v>

2936
03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.070
When I was campaigning for the Senate,

2937
03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:47.760
and this was like a couple of weeks before the election,
um,

2938
03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:53.010
Jim called me and he said three guys in his unit were killed.
And so

2939
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:58.530
I'm in his car,
you know,
getting ready to go to a football game,

2940
03:04:58.531 --> 03:04:59.850
a big football game.

2941
03:04:59.851 --> 03:05:04.590
I'm down in the Norfolk area and I get that information,

2942
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:09.930
you know,
and I'm like,
what do you do?
Yeah,
you put it in a box,

2943
03:05:11.130 --> 03:05:12.390
you buried the box,

2944
03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:15.840
you go do your thing and then you can come back and pull the box out.

2945
03:05:15.900 --> 03:05:19.080
But you know,
getting that and that's it,
you know,
like two or three minutes.

2946
03:05:19.081 --> 03:05:21.810
And then walking out and having to do like two or three hours saying hello to

2947
03:05:21.811 --> 03:05:25.410
people and not mentioning anything and whatever.
That,
you know,

2948
03:05:25.530 --> 03:05:28.770
that was really hard when,
when he was gone and when I was going through that,

2949
03:05:29.640 --> 03:05:34.050
let me ask you this kind of a critical question as a dad,

2950
03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:35.520
I'm going to come at you right now.

2951
03:05:35.820 --> 03:05:38.790
So if my son was getting ready to go on deployment,

2952
03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:43.320
I don't know if I'd say if you survive,
I'm not sure I said that he's,

2953
03:05:43.820 --> 03:05:46.890
that's something,
I mean I can see why you'd say it to,
you know,

2954
03:05:46.891 --> 03:05:48.960
as I'm sitting here trying to think about why would I tell my son that?

2955
03:05:48.961 --> 03:05:51.960
The reason I would tell if I was to tell my son that it'd be because I would

2956
03:05:51.961 --> 03:05:56.940
want him to stay sharp and on point the entire time and not take it for granted

2957
03:05:57.150 --> 03:06:00.770
and realize what's at stake.
So that might be,
I know,

2958
03:06:00.850 --> 03:06:05.310
I don't really remember the context in which I would have said that,
but uh,

2959
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:06.743
you know,

2960
03:06:07.650 --> 03:06:11.210
<v 3>I mean that's,
that's exactly how I took it.
Yeah,
it's stripped away.</v>

2961
03:06:11.800 --> 03:06:16.580
There were like all aspects of the relationship except marine to marine.

2962
03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:22.060
And I've always been very cognizant of my dad's experience and reputation in the

2963
03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:27.320
Marine Corps.
And it was a very clear message that,
you know,

2964
03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:32.630
this is going to be different.
You're not special and you'd better pay attention.

2965
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:37.490
<v 5>So he might not remember saying it but it sounds like some good advice.</v>

2966
03:06:37.580 --> 03:06:38.750
I'll keep that one in my back.

2967
03:06:39.860 --> 03:06:43.790
There were a lot of words going back and forth when he was getting ready to ship

2968
03:06:43.791 --> 03:06:48.680
out.
And,
and from,
from your perspective,
having grown up like with such a,

2969
03:06:50.450 --> 03:06:54.500
with such a focus on leadership and your family and the tradition in your family

2970
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:59.590
and shown up as a lance corporal inside of a platoon and having more awareness

2971
03:07:01.650 --> 03:07:04.620
then the normal lance corporal would have.
Cause I'll tell you,

2972
03:07:04.621 --> 03:07:07.200
I mean if you're on picture of myself when I'm 19 years old,

2973
03:07:07.201 --> 03:07:09.900
if I was a lance corporal,
I would have been a normal lance corporal.

2974
03:07:09.901 --> 03:07:11.040
I would have been,
you know,

2975
03:07:11.041 --> 03:07:14.730
I wouldn't have had this sort of elevated look at things.

2976
03:07:14.731 --> 03:07:19.320
I mean even having read Your Dad's book over and over again,
and,
and just,

2977
03:07:19.321 --> 03:07:24.240
just that level of understanding.
Well,
how did that,
how did that,

2978
03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:28.110
how did that set in your platoon?
How did that set with you?
Were you ever,

2979
03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:31.050
were you ever looking at your boss thinking or looking at your platoon commander

2980
03:07:31.051 --> 03:07:34.140
thinking,
Eh,
did he listen to you?
Did he talk to you?
Did he know who you were?

2981
03:07:34.141 --> 03:07:36.120
Did He,
was there anything like that?

2982
03:07:36.510 --> 03:07:38.790
<v 3>They all knew?
Um,
I think the,</v>

2983
03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:43.140
the best or the most amount of time I kept that off the skyline was two to three

2984
03:07:43.141 --> 03:07:47.640
days,
no matter which unit I was at.
Bootcamp,
I got pulled out and paraded around.

2985
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:49.980
And it wasn't till I started asking questions,

2986
03:07:49.981 --> 03:07:53.220
this was before they actually kicked off the training or like,
Hey,
this is,

2987
03:07:53.250 --> 03:07:57.730
this is watch kid.
Um,
but,
uh,
I think it,

2988
03:07:57.750 --> 03:08:01.320
it put an extra,
extra demand,

2989
03:08:01.380 --> 03:08:04.670
particularly once I hit the fleet marine forces,
uh,

2990
03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:09.000
for humility because I could have,
you know,
all the informal,

2991
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:13.200
um,
training if you like in the world.
And it was world class.

2992
03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:14.400
But at the same time,

2993
03:08:14.401 --> 03:08:18.150
I'm walking into an environment where I have not been there and done with these

2994
03:08:18.151 --> 03:08:20.590
guys have done and I need to listen.
Um,

2995
03:08:20.910 --> 03:08:25.370
and when the opportunity presents itself,
you know,
then the APP,

2996
03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:29.520
the practical application of what I had learned growing up would be there.

2997
03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:33.420
But until you earn your stripes,
you're nothing.
Um,
and uh,

2998
03:08:33.550 --> 03:08:36.780
<v 5>I'll tell you to put an extra layer on him.
No,
no question about it,</v>

2999
03:08:36.781 --> 03:08:38.830
particularly on the answers.
You know,

3000
03:08:40.980 --> 03:08:42.000
Jim has really,

3001
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:47.400
really been smart and thoughtful about that part of the world.
So he had,
uh,

3002
03:08:48.690 --> 03:08:50.050
you know,
he had a lens on,

3003
03:08:50.051 --> 03:08:55.051
on what was going on that a lot of people at his level didn't have it.

3004
03:08:55.460 --> 03:08:57.270
Did you?
Okay,
here's a,
here's a,

3005
03:08:57.330 --> 03:09:00.480
here's another question that I'll throw at you and we were talking about it a

3006
03:09:00.481 --> 03:09:02.670
little bit yesterday,
but,
um,

3007
03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:07.020
you know what I covered chesty puller and loophole or on this podcast number
one,

3008
03:09:07.021 --> 03:09:11.010
21,
number 21,
22,
if you haven't listened to them,
go listen to me.

3009
03:09:11.011 --> 03:09:13.260
If you don't know that story,
you should know what everyone should know it.

3010
03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:14.730
But you know,

3011
03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:18.870
Lou Lou polar got severely wounded as chesty puller son.

3012
03:09:19.850 --> 03:09:22.350
You know that,
that's another thing that would just,

3013
03:09:22.690 --> 03:09:27.130
I can't imagine though,
because you were friends with Lou polar.
Yes,

3014
03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:29.940
it was.
And you know,

3015
03:09:29.941 --> 03:09:34.260
you told me a story yesterday about you and him arguing about the draft

3016
03:09:35.520 --> 03:09:36.353
<v 1>and</v>

3017
03:09:37.420 --> 03:09:38.890
<v 5>his,
his thoughts about that.</v>

3018
03:09:39.970 --> 03:09:44.860
And I can't imagine that at some level you're thinking yourself,

3019
03:09:44.861 --> 03:09:48.640
well,
I know how I feel.
I know I'm patriotic.
I believe in service,

3020
03:09:51.390 --> 03:09:52.320
but this is my boy.

3021
03:09:56.350 --> 03:10:00.810
<v 2>That's a hard choice.
Everyone has to make.
Um,</v>

3022
03:10:01.530 --> 03:10:05.050
you know,
Lou Lou pulled her,
by the way,
I don't think we had a lot of debate,

3023
03:10:05.051 --> 03:10:07.140
but it never really got into an argument with him.
I,

3024
03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:10.780
I want to say that clearly because he was such a decent,

3025
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:15.280
basically gentle guy,
you know,
but we certainly,

3026
03:10:16.040 --> 03:10:20.250
we certainly had our disagreements about policy and service and,
uh,

3027
03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:24.830
and wards in general.
I think by,
by the time he and I were hanging out,
uh,

3028
03:10:24.980 --> 03:10:29.320
he was a really,
really funny guy.
Um,
my,

3029
03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:34.000
you know,
for me,
Jim going into the military,

3030
03:10:34.270 --> 03:10:38.320
it's a part of a family tradition.
Um,
you accept the risk.

3031
03:10:38.980 --> 03:10:39.813
There's a,

3032
03:10:40.540 --> 03:10:45.540
an article I wrote for Parade magazine years ago about a father still tending

3033
03:10:46.211 --> 03:10:49.060
the grave of his son in Arlington.
I used to walk by it all the time.

3034
03:10:49.061 --> 03:10:52.960
It is one of the most beautiful stories about father and son and duty and

3035
03:10:52.961 --> 03:10:57.010
whatever.
The father was wounded in World War II and his son,
uh,

3036
03:10:57.370 --> 03:10:59.590
was one to three times and killed in Vietnam,

3037
03:10:59.591 --> 03:11:02.800
went back from Okinawa and was killed.
And um,
you know,

3038
03:11:02.801 --> 03:11:04.120
it's called the price of duty.

3039
03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:07.000
And actually mentioned Jim was really young when I wrote that piece.

3040
03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:11.080
But I mentioned,
you know,
he had already said he wanted to be a marine,
you know,

3041
03:11:11.081 --> 03:11:16.081
so you don't want to take away from someone what they believe that they,

3042
03:11:17.530 --> 03:11:20.860
they should do personally and for the country.
So I totally respect it.

3043
03:11:20.861 --> 03:11:24.890
And he just got to put your hands inside the bobsled,
you know,

3044
03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:32.770
<v 5>uh,
and you also,
uh,
I,
I know we're,
we're,</v>

3045
03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:34.430
we've been at it for a while,
but the,

3046
03:11:34.431 --> 03:11:38.110
the one other thing I wanted to ask you about is I talk about Hackworth a lot

3047
03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:42.040
and I know you interviewed him and spent,
you spent like a week with him.

3048
03:11:42.041 --> 03:11:45.210
Australia.
No,
actually,
yeah,

3049
03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:49.300
I was thinking I would get the Gig to go to Australia,
but we met in Hawaii,

3050
03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.200
which is not a bad,
not an accident.

3051
03:11:51.540 --> 03:11:56.400
<v 2>Second place though,
I spent about a week with him,
um,
when he was,</v>

3052
03:11:57.420 --> 03:12:00.150
you know,
I guess people who listened to you know,
know his backstory,

3053
03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:05.180
but when he was deciding to come home from Australia a after his exile for a

3054
03:12:07.021 --> 03:12:11.880
number of reasons,
uh,
in his book had not yet come out and,

3055
03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:17.130
um,
prayed magazine could not review books.
But I went and did a feature,

3056
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:20.700
a long feature,
one of their longest pieces they'd done on,
on him and,

3057
03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:25.580
and you know,
read about and be beforehand,
talk to people,
knew him and then,
uh,

3058
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:29.340
got to know him pretty well.
Kept up with him for years actually.
And he was a,

3059
03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:34.550
he was the kind of soldier that if you are going into a bad place,

3060
03:12:35.790 --> 03:12:40.400
you want to be with,
you know,
he was the real deal and end.

3061
03:12:40.401 --> 03:12:43.950
He had a hard time at the end for a number of reasons that I pointed out in,
in,

3062
03:12:43.951 --> 03:12:48.600
in the article.
Um,
I phrased it in a certain way and my article,

3063
03:12:48.750 --> 03:12:52.440
you know,
um,
uh,
I think it was a quote,
um,

3064
03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:55.710
<v 5>one of the people that serve with him that,
you know,
he,</v>

3065
03:12:55.711 --> 03:12:58.910
the army disappointed him and he just decided to declare war on that.

3066
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:04.220
But he was a soldier.
And um,
yeah,
I,

3067
03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:08.910
I thought a lot of of him,
that part of his life.
Well,

3068
03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:12.110
it's some of the stuff you told me and I read that article and Jim,
thanks for,

3069
03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:14.000
for that to me.
And I had actually read it before,

3070
03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:17.900
but I hadn't made the connection.
You know,
I didn't look at the author's name.

3071
03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:21.620
I apologize.
I just folded up,
read the article.
I didn't make that connection,

3072
03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:24.860
but I should have,
um,
you know,

3073
03:13:24.890 --> 03:13:27.780
obviously thanks to both of you for coming on and,
and,

3074
03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:32.210
and thanks for your service.
And we'll put the links to buy these books.

3075
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:37.550
And there's a new version coming out of fields of fire.
There was an anniversary,

3076
03:13:37.551 --> 03:13:42.551
a 40th anniversary edition that they've put out already in the kindle form.

3077
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:47.410
And that will be out by December in,
uh,
in the paperback.

3078
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:50.420
It's no different other than nerves.
I was short essay in the front that I wrote,

3079
03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:53.300
you know,
dance to cover up a little bit.

3080
03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.440
Glad to know it's still in print in a while.
Yeah.
And it's,
it's,

3081
03:13:57.470 --> 03:14:00.670
it's in print and there's,
there's lots of,
um,

3082
03:14:01.130 --> 03:14:06.130
I'll just say there's lots of books and movies and series and TV shows that,

3083
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:09.800
I don't know how to say this,
but they can,
they can,
they reflect,

3084
03:14:09.801 --> 03:14:13.100
certainly reflect some of the characters and some of the goings on inside the

3085
03:14:13.101 --> 03:14:17.630
book.
So I'd love to,
I'd love to see fields become a,
probably a TV series.

3086
03:14:17.850 --> 03:14:22.280
I wrote a proposal a year ago on it and we,
you know,
Hollywood's funny,
you know,

3087
03:14:22.281 --> 03:14:24.680
it's a,
when I was working out there a lot,

3088
03:14:24.681 --> 03:14:28.970
I think they were registering 40 close to 40,000 screenplays a year of the

3089
03:14:28.971 --> 03:14:31.630
writer's guild and we were making 260 movies.
So you know,

3090
03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:36.060
you get to that final cut off,
it's a pretty competitive,
but uh,

3091
03:14:36.780 --> 03:14:39.230
would like to see that.
It's been a pleasure being with you.

3092
03:14:40.310 --> 03:14:43.190
It's been a great conversation.
Thanks for,
thanks for coming on.

3093
03:14:43.210 --> 03:14:47.750
And I would maybe propose this and I know it's a long trip,

3094
03:14:47.751 --> 03:14:50.420
so maybe next time I'll do the trip.
But we've done this once before.

3095
03:14:50.421 --> 03:14:54.110
We did it with a novel Musashi,
which is told people where you're going to do it.

3096
03:14:54.530 --> 03:14:58.460
And then once everyone had the chance to read it,
we came back,

3097
03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:00.800
I came back on and I had a friend of mine,
Tim Ferriss,

3098
03:15:00.801 --> 03:15:05.801
who was an Asian studies major at Princeton and had lived in Japan and studied

3099
03:15:06.591 --> 03:15:11.320
judo and we went through the book and kind of Parse it apart.
But,
uh,

3100
03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:15.930
if you'd ever like to do that,
let me know and thank you.
Come back on and,
um,

3101
03:15:16.190 --> 03:15:21.010
we'll go through it and pull,
you know,
I,
I didn't,
you know,

3102
03:15:21.540 --> 03:15:22.670
I like talking about leadership.

3103
03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:25.610
The leadership lessons inside fields of fire are phenomenal.

3104
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:29.210
Just the pattern recognition of knowing what kind of people you're dealing with.

3105
03:15:29.420 --> 03:15:31.460
And you can learn a lot of that just from the book.

3106
03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:34.940
But I'd love to hear about how you got to some of those characters.

3107
03:15:34.941 --> 03:15:38.720
One of my one real obvious character is Austin,
uh,
Sergeant Austin,

3108
03:15:38.721 --> 03:15:41.550
who's like the,
by the book marine.
That's,
hey,
it's my way or the highway and,

3109
03:15:41.820 --> 03:15:46.610
and just the way,
you know,
just the way that Hodges kinda handles them.
And,

3110
03:15:46.740 --> 03:15:47.900
and there's a certain,

3111
03:15:47.901 --> 03:15:51.370
there's a conversation they're having and you can see Hodges is pushing,

3112
03:15:51.371 --> 03:15:54.800
not pushing back up against them a little bit.
And then he decides,
no,
you don't.

3113
03:15:54.801 --> 03:15:56.160
I'm not gonna Pat push back any further,

3114
03:15:56.190 --> 03:15:58.860
cause I'm going to create a relationship with this guy and we'll get them along

3115
03:15:58.861 --> 03:16:02.140
the way.
But those little subtleties that you put in this book are,

3116
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:06.980
are phenomenal leadership lessons.
One small point on that,

3117
03:16:06.981 --> 03:16:10.620
cause I probably should have mentioned it earlier in terms of one of the

3118
03:16:10.621 --> 03:16:15.450
motivations and writing and is there,
there was so much out there,

3119
03:16:16.050 --> 03:16:21.050
demeaning things that happened in Vietnam without a comprehensive understanding,

3120
03:16:21.931 --> 03:16:24.900
not only of Vietnam,
but of warfare in general,
that

3121
03:16:26.430 --> 03:16:28.730
I felt like it was important to,

3122
03:16:28.820 --> 03:16:33.600
to create characters that could give context to how some of these things happen.

3123
03:16:34.050 --> 03:16:38.340
You know?
Um,
that's what Sergeant Austin,

3124
03:16:38.341 --> 03:16:42.960
how do you know the,
the,
the numbers,
um,
you know,

3125
03:16:42.961 --> 03:16:45.300
when I was in,
in,
in law school and writing us about,

3126
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:47.920
everybody was getting fragged,
you know,

3127
03:16:47.970 --> 03:16:52.890
and I remember I had a really good friend who was a World War II veteran who was

3128
03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:57.780
needling me one day saying,
tell me about fragging.
I said,
screw you.

3129
03:16:57.780 --> 03:17:00.990
I was raised on stories of a bad lieutenant in World War II,

3130
03:17:01.020 --> 03:17:04.470
having 10 seconds once the ramp dropped on the landing craft for somebody who

3131
03:17:04.471 --> 03:17:07.380
was going to get him out of the way.
And he said,
well,
I shot a lieutenant.

3132
03:17:08.970 --> 03:17:13.300
I don't know if he was true or not,
but you know,
there,

3133
03:17:13.570 --> 03:17:16.390
there are leadership lessons in it,

3134
03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:20.310
in the book and are also in Austin is one of them.
I mean,
how do you,

3135
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:21.840
how do you create positive environments?

3136
03:17:21.841 --> 03:17:24.600
If you look at where these people had been at the time that he was coming in and

3137
03:17:24.601 --> 03:17:28.560
doing the,
you know,
the pre Vietnam junk on the bunk,
uh,

3138
03:17:28.580 --> 03:17:32.250
which was probably essential to developing an attitude of discipline when you

3139
03:17:32.251 --> 03:17:35.760
didn't have this stuff.
But,
um,
you know,
somebody,

3140
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:38.460
you got 1.3,

3141
03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:42.000
3.7 million people over the 500,000 people in Vietnam at the time.

3142
03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.450
A lot of them from pretty rough backgrounds and,
uh,
you know,
there,

3143
03:17:45.451 --> 03:17:47.350
there are ways to motivate them,
you know,
in,

3144
03:17:47.351 --> 03:17:51.900
in the ways when things go the other way.
There's ways to get yourself fragged

3145
03:17:54.380 --> 03:17:58.950
well,
that doesn't happen often,
but it was not,
it,
it,
it did happen,

3146
03:17:59.430 --> 03:18:03.720
you know,
uh,
at times and it's probably always happened.

3147
03:18:03.810 --> 03:18:05.850
It has and in some form or another.

3148
03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:10.290
That's why it's important to be a good leadership,
be a good leader,

3149
03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:13.590
especially when the people that you're leading have weapons.

3150
03:18:15.480 --> 03:18:19.980
So,
uh,
well again,
and that's one of the many multitude of,

3151
03:18:20.010 --> 03:18:22.370
of lessons that are in the book.
And again,

3152
03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:25.440
we'll put them on the website so everyone can get them and you can educate

3153
03:18:25.441 --> 03:18:29.820
yourself.
Uh,
Jim,
you got any,
any final thoughts?
Anything else to say?

3154
03:18:30.390 --> 03:18:31.890
Thanks for having us.
She's incredible.

3155
03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:35.670
Just listening to you to talk back and forth.
It's amazing.
Well,

3156
03:18:35.671 --> 03:18:40.330
it's been a real pleasure.
Well thanks for coming on.
Obviously it's,

3157
03:18:40.331 --> 03:18:45.331
it's an honor to have you on and I think anyone that's going to listen to this

3158
03:18:45.421 --> 03:18:48.040
or anyone that does listen to this and you're going to hear from a lot of people

3159
03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:52.210
<v 4>that do listen to this,
um,
they keep their,
their minds open,</v>

3160
03:18:52.300 --> 03:18:55.420
keep their hearts humble.
As you both have talked about today,

3161
03:18:56.700 --> 03:19:00.040
do you guys have set an incredible example for people to follow?

3162
03:19:00.310 --> 03:19:01.780
And thanks for coming on.

3163
03:19:02.080 --> 03:19:06.850
It's been an honor to talk to you and we appreciate most of all your service to

3164
03:19:06.851 --> 03:19:09.410
the country and yours gangs.

3165
03:19:11.470 --> 03:19:16.470
And at this time our guests have departed the studio.

3166
03:19:17.380 --> 03:19:17.801
Awesome.

3167
03:19:17.801 --> 03:19:22.780
To have them on an honor to sit and talk with such men and,

3168
03:19:23.170 --> 03:19:24.400
and it's,

3169
03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:29.500
it's just an honor to be able to do that again.
Incredible story.

3170
03:19:29.501 --> 03:19:34.501
Incredible books and get them the books will be on the website on Jocko,

3171
03:19:35.471 --> 03:19:38.230
podcast.com under books,

3172
03:19:38.740 --> 03:19:43.430
books from episode from episodes is what the technical name is.
Cool.
Yeah.

3173
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:48.190
Um,
I think everyone can learn from those books

3174
03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:53.470
if you read them.
Speaking of learning,

3175
03:19:53.740 --> 03:19:57.370
speaking of teaching and whatnot,
Echo Charles,

3176
03:19:58.390 --> 03:20:02.920
maybe you could teach us how to,
you know,
get after it a little bit harder.

3177
03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:04.530
Sure.
First of all,

3178
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:09.790
we'll shift gears to do you do to obviously seems obvious.

3179
03:20:10.740 --> 03:20:13.720
Seems obvious.
Yeah.
And I,

3180
03:20:14.060 --> 03:20:15.760
I think you're in the same boat where

3181
03:20:17.530 --> 03:20:22.530
you default to Jujitsu as like a solution or a way to look at things even

3182
03:20:23.501 --> 03:20:28.000
earlier today we're talking about true.
It is.
Yeah.
It is.
It is a default way to,

3183
03:20:28.180 --> 03:20:29.200
well,
I've talked about it before.

3184
03:20:29.201 --> 03:20:32.990
The fact that it's a thread that ties a lot of things together.
Yeah.

3185
03:20:33.020 --> 03:20:36.250
That's comparable to a lot of things.
It's a struggle.
Life is a struggle.

3186
03:20:37.210 --> 03:20:39.910
Businesses a struggle.
Combat is a struggle.

3187
03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:43.720
All these things are a struggle and you have to learn to deal with them and they

3188
03:20:43.721 --> 03:20:47.290
all have threads in them that are the same.
So yes,

3189
03:20:47.291 --> 03:20:50.260
I do refer to Jujitsu from time to time.
If you don't like that,

3190
03:20:50.830 --> 03:20:54.940
go start your own podcast and don't talk about Jujitsu.
Dang Bro.
Wait,

3191
03:20:54.941 --> 03:20:57.970
are you saying to me if I don't like that,
but when you think you're talking to,

3192
03:20:58.010 --> 03:21:02.200
okay,
I'm just making sure I remember.

3193
03:21:02.350 --> 03:21:07.350
Actually I'm remembering it right now that you referred to to as the solution to

3194
03:21:08.621 --> 03:21:10.690
something humility.
That's what it is.

3195
03:21:11.530 --> 03:21:14.980
Well that if you want to work on humility used you do through that is the
answer.

3196
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:17.020
That'll help you anyway.
While you do that,

3197
03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:22.210
you're going to need a geek because we're going to do both Gi and Nogi.

3198
03:21:22.270 --> 03:21:24.850
So when you get your Geek,
no question,

3199
03:21:24.851 --> 03:21:29.800
go to origin main.com to get your geek.
That's where you get 100% yeah,

3200
03:21:30.310 --> 03:21:34.300
no doubt,
no doubt.
And you can get rash guards there for going to train.
No,

3201
03:21:34.301 --> 03:21:37.540
you don't have to use a g in Jujitsu.
You can.

3202
03:21:37.630 --> 03:21:41.440
I recommend that you do and if you're wondering if you do do should do to GI or

3203
03:21:41.441 --> 03:21:46.400
no Gi do both.
Yeah.
That's just,
that's just the way to go.
They're both,

3204
03:21:46.430 --> 03:21:49.370
we'll help each other and they're both useful and,

3205
03:21:49.371 --> 03:21:52.790
but you can get rash guards if you're going to do Jujitsu with rash guard,

3206
03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:56.390
which is good thing to do because it doesn't get all caught up in your

3207
03:21:56.391 --> 03:22:00.410
opponent's toes.
Yes.
There's not too many things in life.

3208
03:22:00.411 --> 03:22:02.720
When you're worried about your opponent's toes.

3209
03:22:02.721 --> 03:22:06.360
In Jujitsu you are a little bit worried about your opponent's toes and you're on

3210
03:22:06.370 --> 03:22:07.280
us by the way.
Yeah,

3211
03:22:07.490 --> 03:22:12.490
and you can use the rash guards for other activities such as surfing,

3212
03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:17.990
cycling,
you don't cycle.
I know.
I hear good things.

3213
03:22:18.350 --> 03:22:23.330
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well I guess you can wear them for a cycling as well and,

3214
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:26.330
and spats,
don't forget about spats spats,

3215
03:22:26.331 --> 03:22:28.890
which is essentially compression pants were caution.

3216
03:22:29.060 --> 03:22:32.030
They're essentially a rash guard for your legs,
for your low,

3217
03:22:32.031 --> 03:22:35.420
your other 50% of your buddy.
Oh,
as Dean Lester would say,
let's check.

3218
03:22:36.260 --> 03:22:38.150
Plus there you got tee shirts,

3219
03:22:38.151 --> 03:22:40.370
they got close and we're making more clothes at origin.

3220
03:22:40.520 --> 03:22:45.200
We are making more clothes at origin.
Yeah,
yeah.
Standby.

3221
03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:49.190
Yup.
I called Pete the other day and you didn't get yours yet.
No.

3222
03:22:49.220 --> 03:22:53.840
You jeans and that was really the topic.
Critical about that one.

3223
03:22:54.530 --> 03:22:56.640
So yeah,
we're going to make an all close.

3224
03:22:56.641 --> 03:23:00.380
Keep just keep paying attention to that and we'll get them out.
Um,
supplements.

3225
03:23:00.500 --> 03:23:02.870
We've got some good supplements,

3226
03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:07.940
things that will help you in all aspects of getting after it.

3227
03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:11.090
For instance,
help your joints with joint warfare.

3228
03:23:11.240 --> 03:23:12.950
Help your joints with Krill oil.

3229
03:23:13.370 --> 03:23:18.370
Help your cognitive and physical capacity.

3230
03:23:19.660 --> 03:23:23.810
Yes,
with discipline.
And there's actually so discipline,

3231
03:23:23.811 --> 03:23:26.960
we just made a new form of discipline.
So there's the discipline powder drink.

3232
03:23:26.990 --> 03:23:29.210
Cool.
Here's the problem with the discipline powder drink.

3233
03:23:29.240 --> 03:23:32.720
I'm getting ready to go into a meeting and I'm going to be in there for two

3234
03:23:32.721 --> 03:23:37.580
hours and I want to get like a little bit of a cognitive bump.

3235
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:42.380
You know what I'm saying?
A little bit of a and a little,
a little bump.

3236
03:23:42.860 --> 03:23:46.460
And I don't maybe want to drink,

3237
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:51.940
uh,
uh,
a thousand or drink 500 milliliters of water or whatever,

3238
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:55.280
a bottle of water and only drink a bottle of water because I'm then,
you know,

3239
03:23:55.310 --> 03:23:59.150
biologically what's going to occur in 45 minutes.
If I pounded a bunch of water,

3240
03:23:59.540 --> 03:24:02.260
I'm gonna have to quit,
stop and use the head.
Yeah.
Quit.

3241
03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:04.880
But I'm gonna have to stop for a moment can use,
which I don't like.

3242
03:24:05.450 --> 03:24:09.260
So made a want,
you know,
some pills,
uh,

3243
03:24:09.290 --> 03:24:14.030
a capsule actually a capsule.
So boom,
it's got the,

3244
03:24:14.330 --> 03:24:15.710
it's got a little caffeine and to get it,

3245
03:24:15.711 --> 03:24:19.400
it's got some nootropics in it gets you a little bit of a,
does it get,

3246
03:24:19.401 --> 03:24:23.660
does it have more caffeine than the regular?
No.
Okay.

3247
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:28.610
Well on the go,
yeah.
It's discipline on the go.
Yeah.
Discipline on the go.
Okay,

3248
03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:32.780
interesting.
Yeah,
I have mine took some good,
oh,
you got yours.
Oh yeah.

3249
03:24:33.020 --> 03:24:37.640
Oh I don't,
I mean obviously I don't go now obviously,
but I don't go into many.

3250
03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:41.690
Ap took someone if he took something and he said like a text to me and Pete and

3251
03:24:41.691 --> 03:24:43.400
Brian,
he was like,
oh,
oh,

3252
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:50.350
okay.
So that I don't feel fired up one a,

3253
03:24:50.850 --> 03:24:53.760
well JP feels fired up anyway,
so I'll just like enhance,

3254
03:24:53.780 --> 03:24:57.570
you can tell GP going on stage,
everything's clicking for him.
You know,

3255
03:24:57.571 --> 03:25:01.440
he's fired up 100%.
Um,

3256
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:05.610
Bob mock the mock train.
Yep.
Big Time.
Stay on it.

3257
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:10.560
It's kind of hard to get the problem with the milk train is you just add ends up

3258
03:25:10.561 --> 03:25:13.770
just being sort of kind of a dessert.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah.

3259
03:25:14.010 --> 03:25:16.480
And it's interesting because you know the,

3260
03:25:16.481 --> 03:25:19.680
the idea that protein powder is,

3261
03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:22.490
it's either it tastes good or it's good quality.
That's it.

3262
03:25:23.540 --> 03:25:28.170
That's a dichotomy that used to exist,
exist.
The,
the,

3263
03:25:28.450 --> 03:25:33.120
the gap in that dichotomy could not be crossed,
could not be brought together.

3264
03:25:33.270 --> 03:25:36.420
It has been brought together.
Been both,
again,
I was talking to my friend Terry,

3265
03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:41.010
Aka big sexy last night.
He's got them all trained.
No,

3266
03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:41.903
that's the thing.

3267
03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:45.210
I might as well have just made a commercial for it because you know how you

3268
03:25:45.211 --> 03:25:46.210
start talking about it,

3269
03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:49.110
then you start taking it and you get yourself kind of fired up about it.

3270
03:25:49.220 --> 03:25:53.160
You know,
that's what I was doing anyway.
He was like,
hey man,
I got it.
It's good.

3271
03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:57.450
It gets on the train.
Hopefully a mint chocolate chip.

3272
03:25:57.510 --> 03:26:00.150
My personal favorite peanut butter chocolate,

3273
03:26:01.230 --> 03:26:04.830
Dave Burke's personal favorite.
Good deal too.
Vanilla gorilla.

3274
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:07.440
Technically named,

3275
03:26:07.530 --> 03:26:11.670
not directly for Leif Babin and when certainly associated with wave back.

3276
03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:16.080
And he said the other day that he mixed it up and he was like,
Whoa,
the,

3277
03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:20.430
he's at gay,
I've Nyla and he was pumped on the vanilla gorilla.

3278
03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:25.380
And then there's the darkness.
Yup.
Which is just pure chocolate.
Yes.

3279
03:26:25.430 --> 03:26:27.120
And your chocolate in my household,

3280
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:30.750
the darkness is ascending to Oh really?

3281
03:26:30.751 --> 03:26:33.750
Mint chip chocolate levels.

3282
03:26:34.590 --> 03:26:38.810
Cause it has like a case.
Who's who's,
Oh,
it's right here.
Yeah.

3283
03:26:39.410 --> 03:26:42.810
Yup.
Interesting.
I still add peanut butter in it by the way.
I should,

3284
03:26:42.840 --> 03:26:47.430
I should mention that.
That I could understand.
Yeah.
But,
um,
also,

3285
03:26:47.820 --> 03:26:51.450
you know,
we,
we also just came out with warrior kid milk.

3286
03:26:52.020 --> 03:26:53.640
We've got strawberry and chocolate right now.

3287
03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:56.010
They have a little bit less protein.

3288
03:26:57.300 --> 03:26:59.250
I mean cause if your kids eight years old,

3289
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:04.050
he who should hopefully get and put a protein from natural food sources.

3290
03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:06.710
The problem is sometimes they don't get enough and got,

3291
03:27:06.820 --> 03:27:09.390
got some protein in there.
We've got vitamins in there,

3292
03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:13.320
got some probiotics in there.
Cause we know Timmy,

3293
03:27:13.770 --> 03:27:15.300
when he hears about the probiotics,

3294
03:27:15.301 --> 03:27:19.860
he gets fired up and this is the amazing thing.
They are delicious.

3295
03:27:20.430 --> 03:27:24.540
They are just freaking delicious.
And so in my house,

3296
03:27:24.900 --> 03:27:28.470
the strawberry kids milk is just getting crazy.

3297
03:27:28.500 --> 03:27:30.900
I as soon as I tasted the strawberry kids milk,

3298
03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:36.080
I sent Brian a text and said make adult warrior kid mark immediately now.

3299
03:27:38.190 --> 03:27:42.340
So he's got that comment.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Adult strawberry

3300
03:27:42.910 --> 03:27:44.950
<v 6>and I called it strawberry quick the other day.</v>

3301
03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:50.200
Your brain will cause it tastes that good.
It's,
it's,

3302
03:27:50.230 --> 03:27:55.090
it literally tastes like strawberry quick.
Yeah.
The chocolates damn good too.

3303
03:27:55.470 --> 03:27:57.760
Yeah.
But anyways,
that's the warrior kid.

3304
03:27:57.761 --> 03:28:01.150
This is the only drink because the only thing that you got with your kids that

3305
03:28:01.151 --> 03:28:03.400
you want your kids to have it as bad as they want to have it.

3306
03:28:03.550 --> 03:28:06.680
There's no other thing in the world.
It's like that.
Yeah.
This is it.

3307
03:28:07.990 --> 03:28:11.440
Maybe the warrior kid books.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's possible.

3308
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:15.760
I was drinking mountain dew the other day.
Hell,
straight up.
What is up with you?

3309
03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:20.020
They just have it.
Bear with me.
Why are you doing problems?

3310
03:28:20.021 --> 03:28:22.540
Have nonetheless I was,

3311
03:28:22.750 --> 03:28:25.510
and I came to kind of this realization fired.

3312
03:28:27.810 --> 03:28:31.630
I'm telling you.
Okay,
so quiet.
So bear with me.
You know,

3313
03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:34.210
I'm not pounding mountain news every day.
I'm not saying that,

3314
03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:38.260
but as I drink,
this is a sleep.

3315
03:28:38.980 --> 03:28:40.180
As I drink this mountain.

3316
03:28:40.181 --> 03:28:45.070
Do you know how you kind of like reflect on things and so I'm like,

3317
03:28:45.071 --> 03:28:47.020
okay,
what am I drinking?
He's good.
I like my,

3318
03:28:47.021 --> 03:28:49.860
I've always liked mountain dew since literally the first time I tasted when I

3319
03:28:49.870 --> 03:28:53.440
was a kid.
And so I'm like drinking it and I'm like,
you know what,

3320
03:28:53.441 --> 03:28:58.030
I'm drinking right now.
It's,
it's liquid candy is what I'm drinking.

3321
03:28:58.031 --> 03:29:01.610
Literally like,
you know,
you don't like a jolly rancher or one of these,
you know,

3322
03:29:01.840 --> 03:29:05.260
that kind of candy.
They make lollipops and stuff,
that kind of candy.

3323
03:29:06.010 --> 03:29:10.360
Consider this exact flavor,
this exact flavor,
not more sweet,
not less sweet.

3324
03:29:10.361 --> 03:29:15.010
This exact mountain dew flavor as a lollipop or jolly rancher.
It would fit.

3325
03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:18.850
It would be like,
yeah,
and I'm just drinking the liquid form of it.
Literally.

3326
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:20.500
That's what I'm thinking is you finish the camp.

3327
03:29:21.280 --> 03:29:25.540
Well it was one of those small cans.
Did you finish it?
Yeah,
I was eating Sushi.

3328
03:29:25.541 --> 03:29:29.830
You know how it is like it's the whole deal nonetheless.
That's what it is.

3329
03:29:29.860 --> 03:29:32.590
But there's no reason for this anymore because now we have milk.
Yeah.

3330
03:29:32.650 --> 03:29:37.360
And you can kind of consider the difference,
right.
Where the,
you know,
your kid,

3331
03:29:37.660 --> 03:29:41.360
if they're like how I was and you see the mountain dew as a kid,
you're like,

3332
03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:44.280
I don't want that.
But the parents are like,
no,
we don't drink.

3333
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:48.990
Why don't you drink Jocko white tea instead?
Bring a can with you.
Well it's,

3334
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:52.060
you know,
I have a bunch of game.
It's a long story,
you know.

3335
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:54.580
Then we're working very hard on the whole situation,

3336
03:29:54.610 --> 03:29:57.280
but nonetheless it happened and you know we're going to move on,

3337
03:29:57.880 --> 03:30:00.460
but if you're a kid,
you want them mountain dew.

3338
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:05.440
I noticed now it's a mountain dew is right up there with cotton.
An important,

3339
03:30:07.150 --> 03:30:10.720
that's how you say it.
Satisfied a key nonetheless.

3340
03:30:11.410 --> 03:30:14.890
If this will you compare the scenarios kid wants them out to do.
It's like,
yeah,

3341
03:30:14.891 --> 03:30:17.200
of course you want them on the tastes good,
but the it's like,
no,

3342
03:30:17.201 --> 03:30:20.260
we don't drink mountain dew.
That's crap.
That's liquid candy.

3343
03:30:20.261 --> 03:30:22.600
Wouldn't you know that?
We're not doing that.
It's not healthy for us.

3344
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:26.820
But the kid wants to milk boom parent.
Yes.
Every,

3345
03:30:27.310 --> 03:30:30.820
every time parents per say,
Hey,
do you want some more milk?
Yeah.
Yes,

3346
03:30:31.060 --> 03:30:35.020
I do actually check.
Cool.
Good.
So that's,

3347
03:30:35.070 --> 03:30:40.040
that's origin main.com for all that stuff.
A lot of good stuff on there.
Also,

3348
03:30:40.041 --> 03:30:44.210
we have a store as a store called Jocko store.

3349
03:30:45.260 --> 03:30:48.230
Anyway there you can get also get rash guards,

3350
03:30:48.770 --> 03:30:51.620
some cool shirts if you want to represent discipline equals freedom.

3351
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:56.420
Few designs on that one.
There's some designs on there on that store in general.

3352
03:30:56.480 --> 03:31:00.400
So yeah,
men check them out.
If you want to get something,
get something.

3353
03:31:00.470 --> 03:31:01.303
Truckers hats.

3354
03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:05.400
My wife said something about Jocko store and then my youngest daughter said,

3355
03:31:05.460 --> 03:31:09.770
you have a store?
And I said,
yeah.
And she says,

3356
03:31:09.800 --> 03:31:13.580
where is it
on the Internet,
man?

3357
03:31:14.480 --> 03:31:19.040
Virtual Jocko store.
It's called Jocko store.
Tell them,
let your friend know.

3358
03:31:19.220 --> 03:31:22.400
But yeah,
some good stuff.
Some hoodies on there as well.
Hats,
as Jacqui said,

3359
03:31:22.401 --> 03:31:26.660
trucker and flex fit.
But yeah,
go on there and you know,
if you want something,

3360
03:31:26.661 --> 03:31:27.590
if you'd like something,

3361
03:31:27.591 --> 03:31:32.390
get something good way to stay on the path and represent at the same time.
Boom.

3362
03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:37.320
Do you rep when you're,
does it help you stay on the path?
I think so,
yes.
There's,

3363
03:31:37.400 --> 03:31:42.210
there's quite a few people that feel when they put on the uniform,
right.

3364
03:31:42.910 --> 03:31:43.743
June the game.

3365
03:31:43.890 --> 03:31:48.890
You know what's a classic art typical part of the hero's journey is they're

3366
03:31:49.820 --> 03:31:53.120
getting their gear on Sudi.
No,
no.
They're suiting up.

3367
03:31:53.810 --> 03:31:57.410
That's part of the deal.
And watch a movie.
What do they show that?

3368
03:31:57.530 --> 03:32:01.350
Whether it's a soldier getting his boots on lock and load his weapon.
You know,

3369
03:32:01.351 --> 03:32:04.190
when the movies,
when they open up like the war chest.
Well yeah,

3370
03:32:04.680 --> 03:32:07.490
cause I can like in Mike in the dragons to opens up the war chest,

3371
03:32:07.491 --> 03:32:09.950
right in commando,

3372
03:32:10.010 --> 03:32:14.210
commando gearing up gets onto the shore.
The final battle scene,
right.

3373
03:32:14.211 --> 03:32:17.180
You get on the shore.
Oh yeah.
It was like a whole montage boots,

3374
03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:21.350
a bulletproof vest.
Uh,
you know,
I dunno if it was bulletproof.
I Dunno.

3375
03:32:21.470 --> 03:32:25.640
It doesn't matter.
He's zipping it up.
I think that vest is more just,
you know,

3376
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:29.210
just dope.
Just
grenades on it.

3377
03:32:29.290 --> 03:32:33.020
Just Hollywood a hundred percent.
They paint the face with the thing.
Well,

3378
03:32:33.021 --> 03:32:33.201
you know,

3379
03:32:33.201 --> 03:32:36.230
the charcoal that they paint their face with all it's cotton candy paint.
Yeah.

3380
03:32:36.650 --> 03:32:41.480
Yeah.
Breath.
I'm telling you it's suiting up because of that.
Um,

3381
03:32:42.770 --> 03:32:43.810
yeah,
you can,

3382
03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:47.930
you can get suited up and then you feel like you're getting in the zone for

3383
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:51.440
whatever it is you're about to go do because you got that shirt that says

3384
03:32:53.060 --> 03:32:55.730
whatever.
Well,
big time.
Yeah.
When you get a new rash guard,

3385
03:32:55.731 --> 03:32:59.060
you're that much more compelled to go train.
If you,

3386
03:32:59.130 --> 03:33:01.970
this is a thing that starts when you're like six years old and you get a new

3387
03:33:01.971 --> 03:33:06.380
pair of shoes and it just lasts your whole life.
Oh yeah.
Well yeah.

3388
03:33:06.381 --> 03:33:09.200
Actually the shoes.
That's a good example because remember when you're a kid,

3389
03:33:09.290 --> 03:33:12.140
I dunno,
you might be different,
but I think most of us when we're a kid,

3390
03:33:12.141 --> 03:33:14.720
you know when you got the new shoes,
you want to go to school.

3391
03:33:15.350 --> 03:33:19.100
I want to see your thinking functionality,
which I did by the way.

3392
03:33:19.160 --> 03:33:22.790
But you get the new shoes that knew chuck Taylors.
Mm.

3393
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:26.480
The half red half green ones.
Do you read those ones?
Anyway,
we had those.

3394
03:33:26.840 --> 03:33:30.050
And so you buy them or you get on whatever from parents and you're like,

3395
03:33:30.051 --> 03:33:32.800
can't we just wear these to school?
Oh.

3396
03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:35.600
And like everyone's going to see all this stuff.

3397
03:33:35.601 --> 03:33:40.020
So compared to if you don't have new shoes,
do you really want to go to school?

3398
03:33:40.200 --> 03:33:42.740
Sure.
Maybe,
maybe not.
But with the chuck Taylor,

3399
03:33:42.770 --> 03:33:46.470
the new shoes you will want to go.
That's how,
same thing with the gym.

3400
03:33:46.770 --> 03:33:47.640
The same thing with anywhere.

3401
03:33:47.650 --> 03:33:52.470
If you've got some new clothing to represent with big time check do you were
dry.

3402
03:33:52.680 --> 03:33:56.760
Dry Fit is,
I think it's what it's called.
You wear a dry fit,
right?
W in what?

3403
03:33:56.850 --> 03:34:00.400
Like a shirt way.
It's called dry fit for like working out.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

3404
03:34:00.510 --> 03:34:03.720
It's like we don't have any of that.
We need to,

3405
03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:05.600
and I know that's what I was doing.
I just thought of that right now.

3406
03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:08.580
Just thought of that.
Here's the thing,
I knew that before because you,

3407
03:34:08.581 --> 03:34:10.170
I think you and some people

3408
03:34:11.020 --> 03:34:12.490
<v 4>I'm working on,
we're working on it.</v>

3409
03:34:12.670 --> 03:34:16.510
We're working on it at origin that we can make dry fit.

3410
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:21.790
Not a compression like loose fit,
right?
Yeah.
Who's fit loose?
Fit,

3411
03:34:21.791 --> 03:34:23.170
quick.
Dry.
That's what we're making.

3412
03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:27.510
<v 6>Yeah.
I gave you a pretty dope red one at the muster and I was like,</v>

3413
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:31.590
I don't wear a dry fit at all.
I put it on and I was like,
Dang.
I,
I,
I like it.

3414
03:34:31.650 --> 03:34:35.370
It's good.
It's boom.
It's kind of on my radar now.
Yeah.
Well,

3415
03:34:35.371 --> 03:34:38.670
I think you measure most shirts by their sleeves size.

3416
03:34:39.090 --> 03:34:41.460
It's that must add some small sleeves and you were stoked.

3417
03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:46.620
That's classified anyway.
Also stay on the path,
keep stay on the path,

3418
03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.280
keep yourself on the path by subscribing to this podcast.

3419
03:34:50.281 --> 03:34:54.210
I know it seems obvious,
but sometimes when people are new they're like,
oh yeah,

3420
03:34:54.211 --> 03:34:57.240
cool podcasts in fact or a year in that trial period.

3421
03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:00.710
Cause there there are certain podcasts that I'll be like,
hey,
I hear good things,

3422
03:35:00.711 --> 03:35:01.560
I'm gonna go listen to it.

3423
03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:05.790
And I only listened to it like at the gym or something like this or on under

3424
03:35:05.791 --> 03:35:08.340
certain circumstances and I'll forget,
you know,

3425
03:35:08.341 --> 03:35:10.170
like I won't listen to it at other times.

3426
03:35:10.380 --> 03:35:12.200
So we'll come back to the gym or something like that and go,

3427
03:35:12.210 --> 03:35:13.470
Oh let me find that podcast.

3428
03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:16.320
And you got to kind of do the search or whatever you just subscribed.

3429
03:35:16.470 --> 03:35:20.370
So I can see that scenario being the case.
You see what I'm saying?
For people,

3430
03:35:20.371 --> 03:35:22.980
cause you know,
how will we say?
Of course they gonna subscribe seems obvious.

3431
03:35:22.981 --> 03:35:25.290
It's obvious enough to tell people subscribe.

3432
03:35:25.291 --> 03:35:27.570
They're either going to subscribe if they like it or not,

3433
03:35:27.571 --> 03:35:30.180
but sometimes you do forget there are circumstances what I'm saying.

3434
03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:32.280
So here's a reminder.
Subscribe.

3435
03:35:32.590 --> 03:35:36.490
<v 4>You're subscribing to this podcast also subscribed to the warrior kid podcast.</v>

3436
03:35:36.491 --> 03:35:39.160
We have some more warrior kid podcast episodes coming.

3437
03:35:39.220 --> 03:35:40.810
I apologize that they're taking long.

3438
03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:44.050
It is my fault for not being more squared away,

3439
03:35:44.140 --> 03:35:46.450
prioritizing better and working harder,

3440
03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:50.920
but I have some almost ready for the release.

3441
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:54.430
Cool.
Uh,
also while you're looking at warrior kid stuff,

3442
03:35:54.431 --> 03:35:59.000
you can check out Irish oaks ranch.com and get some,
some war.

3443
03:35:59.001 --> 03:36:04.001
Your kids soap from American made soap from a 13 year old kid that is raising

3444
03:36:06.071 --> 03:36:11.050
goats,
getting the milk from the goats and turning it into soap.

3445
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:15.310
Good soap to buy on a farm here in California.

3446
03:36:15.311 --> 03:36:19.450
A lot of people don't know that California is massive agriculture and farming,

3447
03:36:19.810 --> 03:36:24.760
so you can support that with a little warrior kid soap.

3448
03:36:25.460 --> 03:36:27.310
All snow.
Forget about the youtube while you're subscribing.

3449
03:36:27.340 --> 03:36:32.340
You can subscribe to the Youtube Channel Jocko podcast where you can watch these

3450
03:36:32.951 --> 03:36:35.020
podcasts on there.
If you want to see us.

3451
03:36:35.170 --> 03:36:38.140
If you want to see Jim Webb and James Webb,

3452
03:36:38.380 --> 03:36:41.320
you want to see what their reactions are and see what they look like.

3453
03:36:41.321 --> 03:36:44.170
You can subscribe or you can go to youtube and check it out.

3454
03:36:44.230 --> 03:36:48.490
You can also see echoes enhanced videos,
which he is quite proud of.

3455
03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:54.010
I'm proud that you use the word legit and Willie are legit.

3456
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:58.110
I will give you a credit when credit is due and they,

3457
03:36:58.180 --> 03:37:02.410
they enhance the message functionally.
Sure.

3458
03:37:02.980 --> 03:37:06.430
Like being able to read the words.
That's functional usage,

3459
03:37:06.431 --> 03:37:08.080
so it's not just,

3460
03:37:08.410 --> 03:37:11.890
it's not just affects for the sake of effects,

3461
03:37:11.891 --> 03:37:15.660
which I probably wouldn't call legit.
You know,
you do throw some of that stuff.

3462
03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:19.660
It,
some walls are exploding.
Rehab might be a little bit beyond,

3463
03:37:19.661 --> 03:37:21.760
but sometimes he goes a little too far.
Let 'em know.

3464
03:37:22.300 --> 03:37:25.060
Let 'em know if his videos are a little bit much ship.
He learns.

3465
03:37:25.180 --> 03:37:28.840
It's like the guy that learns something and they learned the cow bell.

3466
03:37:28.850 --> 03:37:31.300
They get a new cow bell for the drum set and they put it in through the whole

3467
03:37:31.301 --> 03:37:34.960
album.
It was just cow bell.
What's the cowbell?
It's like a,
it's a cow bell.

3468
03:37:35.310 --> 03:37:39.880
I mean and but people use it in music occasionally.
It should be used sparingly.

3469
03:37:40.380 --> 03:37:44.530
Actual codes.
The cowbell thing or like more like a bone.

3470
03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:46.490
I can't really do the noise.
Sure.

3471
03:37:46.690 --> 03:37:51.010
But they're there because in dresser she drums actually all instruments really?

3472
03:37:51.011 --> 03:37:54.940
They have like names for,
you know like high hat?
Yeah.

3473
03:37:54.941 --> 03:37:57.820
There's the name of the drug.
I know,
but see what I'm saying though,

3474
03:37:57.821 --> 03:37:58.800
that's like a name for a job.

3475
03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:02.260
Like if you'd never seen a drum or never heard of a joint sentences,
high hat,

3476
03:38:02.290 --> 03:38:04.330
they'd be like,
I know what high means and I know what hat means.

3477
03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:06.970
High had is the name for you see what I'm saying?

3478
03:38:07.060 --> 03:38:10.840
I thought that was the same deal for cow bell.
No,
no,
no.
It's actual,
they make,

3479
03:38:11.740 --> 03:38:16.720
I mean I don't know what the cow bells look like in 1850 but this has definitely

3480
03:38:16.721 --> 03:38:21.070
been cleaned up and modified so that it's a cow bell.
Laura thing,

3481
03:38:21.071 --> 03:38:22.300
but it's for your,
you don't,

3482
03:38:22.540 --> 03:38:27.110
you don't go to the farm store to buy a cow bell for your drum set.
Okay.

3483
03:38:27.220 --> 03:38:31.330
Go to the music store and he say,
I need a cow bell.
I understand.
And they say,

3484
03:38:31.331 --> 03:38:34.510
and then you start using it in every song and you think everyone wants to just

3485
03:38:34.511 --> 03:38:36.650
hear that cow bell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause he's like,
yeah.

3486
03:38:36.660 --> 03:38:39.580
And there's a whole skit on Saturday night live about the cow bell.
Okay.

3487
03:38:39.581 --> 03:38:44.170
I was just going to have one of the patches that guys had NTU bruiser that

3488
03:38:44.171 --> 03:38:45.550
eventually got banned.

3489
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:49.480
One of the patches was more cowbell based on the Saturday night live skit.

3490
03:38:49.780 --> 03:38:50.800
Gotcha.
Okay.

3491
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:55.950
And I always did actually wonder about that more cowbell that now you know,

3492
03:38:56.920 --> 03:38:59.500
you never know what you're gonna learn.
Also psychological warfare,

3493
03:38:59.650 --> 03:39:03.700
that's an album with tracks where you can stay on the path and we're making

3494
03:39:03.701 --> 03:39:07.530
another one in,
just coming out soon.
And that's it on that.
Good.

3495
03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:11.020
Also if you want to vary up your workout,
get more workout gear,

3496
03:39:12.650 --> 03:39:17.650
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko also they got some good immunity stuff

3497
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:19.840
that I actually took.
It reminded me cause I,

3498
03:39:19.960 --> 03:39:23.620
I just took some felt the cold coming on.
Shroom tech commune.
It's a good one.

3499
03:39:24.140 --> 03:39:27.340
You liked that one very much like one.
Never let me know before he traveled.

3500
03:39:27.341 --> 03:39:30.910
Take that.
Nonetheless,
a lot of cool stuff on there and information.

3501
03:39:31.330 --> 03:39:35.720
That's another one that like you can get caught up in a bad way but it's a good

3502
03:39:35.721 --> 03:39:38.870
resource when you want to vary up your workouts and do some new workouts,

3503
03:39:38.940 --> 03:39:42.080
kettlebells,
even that,
that club workout,

3504
03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:45.530
which I would highly recommend looking into what to do.

3505
03:39:45.770 --> 03:39:48.050
Don't just speak to that thing up and start getting nuts.

3506
03:39:49.130 --> 03:39:52.760
Might get you my champion on you also got Jocko white tea,

3507
03:39:53.390 --> 03:39:56.630
which tastes delicious and it's good for you.

3508
03:39:57.890 --> 03:40:01.600
I say again,
tastes delicious and good for you.
That seems to be the theme.
Yeah.

3509
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:05.060
If we're going to put something in our body,
we want it to taste good.
Yes,

3510
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:07.400
and we want it to be good for us.

3511
03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:10.070
Jocko white tea and there's no doubt that it's good for you because there's,

3512
03:40:10.100 --> 03:40:11.390
it's the only product,

3513
03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:15.860
the only product that I've ever heard of where an 8,000 pound dead lift is

3514
03:40:15.861 --> 03:40:19.400
guaranteed.
100% never failed me too.
It's so good.

3515
03:40:19.401 --> 03:40:22.650
You some of that get your dead lift up.
Also,
we've got some books.
Uh,

3516
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:25.730
first of all the books we read today and,
and James Webb's,

3517
03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:29.500
James Webb has 10 books that he's written.
Uh,

3518
03:40:29.540 --> 03:40:34.460
the two that we covered today will both be on the website,

3519
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:38.780
fields of fire.
And then I heard my country calling.

3520
03:40:38.781 --> 03:40:39.770
These are the two books I rented a,

3521
03:40:39.810 --> 03:40:41.990
he also mentioned a book called the Nightingale Song,

3522
03:40:41.991 --> 03:40:46.490
which is a great book and we'll put that one on as well.
Did you hear me?
No.

3523
03:40:46.700 --> 03:40:50.300
Nightingale's song night.
Gale Song.
Yep.
Great Book.

3524
03:40:50.420 --> 03:40:55.420
It's about the class that the naval academy guys that graduated with Jim Webb

3525
03:40:56.151 --> 03:41:01.040
and what they did,
they all had a huge impact on the navy and on the country.

3526
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:04.220
And it's,
well the,
this particular group that he talks about,

3527
03:41:04.221 --> 03:41:07.790
so we'll put that book on there as well cause it's a great book and perhaps I'll

3528
03:41:07.791 --> 03:41:10.430
cover it at some point.
Obviously for booked.

3529
03:41:10.431 --> 03:41:14.930
We also have way of the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
If you know kids,

3530
03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:19.830
get them these books and you know,
get them on the right path of the,

3531
03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:25.130
of going in the right direction of doing the right things.
It's just going to be,

3532
03:41:25.230 --> 03:41:27.130
it's going to help kids out there.

3533
03:41:27.131 --> 03:41:29.900
The feedback that I've gotten from around the world and yes,

3534
03:41:29.901 --> 03:41:33.950
I've gotten feedback from around the world by around the world.
I mean Australia,

3535
03:41:33.951 --> 03:41:34.784
New Zealand,

3536
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:39.410
I've gotten a whole package of letters from a classroom in New Zealand who have

3537
03:41:39.411 --> 03:41:42.410
kids that are on the path.
So if you read a book,

3538
03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:45.890
imagine you read a book and you're seven years old,
nine years old,

3539
03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:49.070
and you decided that the book was good enough that you were going to try and

3540
03:41:49.071 --> 03:41:52.220
find the author who lives on the other side of the world and write him a note

3541
03:41:52.221 --> 03:41:53.930
and say thanks,
because I'm on the path now.

3542
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:58.580
That's the book right there where the warrior king and Mark's mission also

3543
03:41:58.581 --> 03:42:01.880
discipline equals freedom field manual.
This,
you know what?

3544
03:42:01.881 --> 03:42:06.470
This is Christmas time.
You get to Christmas,
this book is a gift.

3545
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:11.390
It's a gift for people that you know that you want to help.
If you have an enemy,

3546
03:42:11.450 --> 03:42:14.510
don't give it to him because then your enemy's going to get on the path.

3547
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:16.370
Probably come back and whatever,

3548
03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:21.880
18 months and there'll be jacked and there'll be focused and they'll crush you

3549
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:26.660
or,
or,
yes,
you're right.
Or they could if they,

3550
03:42:26.661 --> 03:42:29.870
well I guess if they're,
it depends on their level of,

3551
03:42:30.020 --> 03:42:34.320
of malevolence their soul because if they have a little bit of good in there,

3552
03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:35.071
you know if they're going to do,

3553
03:42:35.071 --> 03:42:38.540
they're going to read that little part about laughter wins and they're going to

3554
03:42:38.541 --> 03:42:41.070
see that the light is going to overcome the darkness and maybe they'll come back

3555
03:42:41.071 --> 03:42:44.310
to you in 18 months and like,
hey,
I got you something.
Boom.

3556
03:42:45.270 --> 03:42:47.880
Now we're not enemies anymore.
We're moving in the right direction.
By the way,

3557
03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:52.050
do you want to train by the way,
do you want to Jackson steal by the way,

3558
03:42:52.051 --> 03:42:54.180
do you want to go out and eat some steak cause I'm down.

3559
03:42:55.120 --> 03:42:58.380
So that might actually be the movie there.
That could be the move.
Nicely done.

3560
03:42:58.381 --> 03:43:03.090
I like the way you think that audio book is not on audible.

3561
03:43:04.020 --> 03:43:08.730
It is on iTunes,
Amazon music,
Google play,
other MP3 platforms.

3562
03:43:09.090 --> 03:43:13.020
Extreme ownership.
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.

3563
03:43:13.620 --> 03:43:14.500
That's I'm

3564
03:43:16.350 --> 03:43:20.610
taking the principles that we used in combat and then applying them to business

3565
03:43:20.611 --> 03:43:24.540
and life and then we followed that up with another book called the dichotomy of

3566
03:43:24.541 --> 03:43:28.860
leadership,
another New York Times bestseller,
which is super cool and all that,

3567
03:43:28.890 --> 03:43:30.780
but whatever.
Let's face it.

3568
03:43:30.840 --> 03:43:35.840
What we wanted to do was write a book that actually expanded and made people

3569
03:43:35.911 --> 03:43:36.744
better leaders.

3570
03:43:36.810 --> 03:43:39.960
Feedback we're getting on that one is that's what it's helping people do.

3571
03:43:39.961 --> 03:43:42.960
The little,
the little nuances of extreme ownership that are,

3572
03:43:43.050 --> 03:43:46.560
that are harder to handle and harder to master.

3573
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:48.480
This book will help you do it.

3574
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:51.810
That the dichotomy of leadership available everywhere.

3575
03:43:52.770 --> 03:43:55.860
Appreciate everyone getting that.
Of course now we have Mikey and the dragons.

3576
03:43:56.490 --> 03:43:57.480
It is coming out

3577
03:43:59.850 --> 03:44:04.830
November 15th I'm trying to get as many printers as I can right now because you

3578
03:44:04.831 --> 03:44:08.100
all ordered a lot of them,
so thank you.

3579
03:44:08.460 --> 03:44:13.460
And it's about a little kid who's scared of everything and he finds a book,

3580
03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:18.960
and in the book the king is dead in this village and this kingdom,

3581
03:44:19.380 --> 03:44:22.950
and there's a prince that's going to have to stand up and fight.

3582
03:44:24.510 --> 03:44:27.150
So that's what he,
that's what he does to the prince has to stand up and fight.

3583
03:44:27.151 --> 03:44:29.400
But he's scared because he's only seven.
So

3584
03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:34.640
that's that little little excerpt from it did a little expert excerpt.

3585
03:44:35.260 --> 03:44:36.860
I'd do a little extra.
The king.

3586
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:41.870
I had always been so strong and brave and protected the kingdom from the Dragon

3587
03:44:41.940 --> 03:44:42.120
Cave.

3588
03:44:42.120 --> 03:44:47.070
The Dragon Cave was just over the hill and filled with scary creatures that were

3589
03:44:47.071 --> 03:44:51.300
ready to kill horrible dragons of every single type who thought.

3590
03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:53.610
People in the kingdom were especially ripe,

3591
03:44:54.030 --> 03:44:58.020
that people thought the dragons had breath of fire and that the dragon stood 20

3592
03:44:58.021 --> 03:44:59.880
feet tall or higher.
They fought.

3593
03:44:59.881 --> 03:45:04.881
The dragons had soared stopping scales and powerful long razor sharp tails.

3594
03:45:06.390 --> 03:45:09.300
But the brave king never let the beast around.

3595
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:12.540
He stood up and fought and held his ground.

3596
03:45:13.020 --> 03:45:17.490
And as long as the king had been the king,
none of the dragons could do a thing.

3597
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:17.911
Yes.

3598
03:45:17.911 --> 03:45:22.911
The king always kept the dragons at bay by going out bravely into the fray.

3599
03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:26.250
It seemed without fear that king would go fight.

3600
03:45:26.340 --> 03:45:28.500
He'd beat the dragons and come home at night.

3601
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:31.780
But now that the king had died and was gone,

3602
03:45:32.050 --> 03:45:36.780
there was only one person to fight and carry on.
But that person wasn't big,

3603
03:45:36.781 --> 03:45:40.180
are mightier strong.
In fact,
he hadn't been alive that long.

3604
03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:45.460
Now the person who had dragons to chase was just a little boy with a smiling

3605
03:45:45.461 --> 03:45:46.330
face.
Yes.

3606
03:45:46.331 --> 03:45:51.331
The person that now must stand up and be bold was just the little prince who was

3607
03:45:51.371 --> 03:45:54.820
only seven years old.
So.
So there you go.

3608
03:45:55.930 --> 03:45:58.330
Of course the villagers are worried if this little kid is going to be able to do

3609
03:45:58.331 --> 03:46:01.870
it and well get the book.

3610
03:46:01.871 --> 03:46:06.100
You find out what happens when he goes up to face the dragons.
And by the way,

3611
03:46:06.101 --> 03:46:09.820
you guys put this book to number 17 on Amazon of all books.

3612
03:46:09.821 --> 03:46:10.990
Prerelease that's crazy.

3613
03:46:10.991 --> 03:46:15.991
So you guys called me out and I'm printing as fast as I can and the good news is

3614
03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.570
I'm printing more of these first additions,

3615
03:46:20.571 --> 03:46:22.330
so the first additions is going to continue.

3616
03:46:22.331 --> 03:46:26.410
I'm going to print as many as I can and get it out and get it to everyone,

3617
03:46:26.411 --> 03:46:27.820
hopefully by Christmas.

3618
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:32.200
Appreciate it for the support against,

3619
03:46:32.980 --> 03:46:36.040
against the big boys.
Yeah.
Speaking of big boys,

3620
03:46:36.041 --> 03:46:39.730
and you remember how you used to talk trash about the publishing company
charter?

3621
03:46:39.740 --> 03:46:44.590
Be All conservative and look at,
you know,
yeah.
I,
I was uh,

3622
03:46:45.070 --> 03:46:47.920
I was conservative and I was too conservative.

3623
03:46:48.430 --> 03:46:52.300
I didn't realize how much people were going to get after it.

3624
03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:56.920
And I got texts from my buddies that are saying,
I just ordered 10 copies.

3625
03:46:57.010 --> 03:46:58.990
I just ordered 14 copies.

3626
03:46:59.050 --> 03:47:03.130
I just ordered 19 copies for every kid in my extended family.

3627
03:47:03.700 --> 03:47:07.550
And I'm like,
that's awesome.
I will get them printed as fast as I needed to.

3628
03:47:07.570 --> 03:47:10.270
I pulled out all stops and I'm making it an advocate.
You know what?

3629
03:47:10.271 --> 03:47:11.051
It's my fault.
I should have.

3630
03:47:11.051 --> 03:47:15.030
I should have ordered more of those exact things that you said about yourself

3631
03:47:15.031 --> 03:47:17.790
were the exact same things you were saying about the publishing company.
Yeah.

3632
03:47:18.030 --> 03:47:21.670
Yeah.
I didn't know how people were going to get after it.

3633
03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:25.210
You just said that about the publisher.
They don't understand.

3634
03:47:25.360 --> 03:47:28.870
Maybe I if apparently I didn't understand.
I should have taken my own advice now.

3635
03:47:28.871 --> 03:47:30.830
We do.
Now we know.
There you go.

The books are being printed as fast as I can print them.

3637
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:38.020
What I like about you so apologize for that.
It's my fault.

3638
03:47:38.021 --> 03:47:43.010
I should have taken my own advice and well now I'm getting after it this.

And in the book fields of fire,

3678
03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:41.210
one of the main characters,
Hodges,
in part of the book,

3679
03:50:41.211 --> 03:50:46.211
he quotes an old hymn and old hymn that he's thinking about in his head.

3680
03:50:46.460 --> 03:50:47.720
And that old hymn says,

3681
03:50:47.930 --> 03:50:52.930
time like an ever rolling stream bears all its sons away.

3682
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:55.161
They fly,

3683
03:50:55.161 --> 03:50:59.510
forgotten as a dream dies at the opening day.

3684
03:51:01.060 --> 03:51:04.300
So there you go.
A little reminder.

3685
03:51:05.230 --> 03:51:05.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3686
03:51:05.660 --> 03:51:09.800
<v 0>A little reminder to all of us that time is fleeting.</v>

3687
03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:11.310
<v 1>Okay?</v>

3688
03:51:11.310 --> 03:51:16.230
<v 0>Time is short and we only get so much,
so don't wait around.</v>

3689
03:51:17.350 --> 03:51:17.670
<v 1>Okay?</v>

3690
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:22.170
<v 0>Don't put it off.
Instead,
get up</v>

3691
03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:27.220
and yes,
get after it.

3692
03:51:28.970 --> 03:51:30.060

this is echo and Jocko out.
