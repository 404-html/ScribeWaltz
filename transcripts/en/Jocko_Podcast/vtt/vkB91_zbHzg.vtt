00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.220
This is Jocko podcast number 24 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.450
Jocko Willink

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.850
and our guests tonight is Jody Mitak.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.570
Jodi is a former Canadian army soldier and sniper who served in Afghanistan.

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.950
He now serves as an elected member of the Ottawa to city council.

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.040
You got second place in a show called the amazing race.

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.160
He authored the best selling book about his experiences.

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.430
He's a husband and a dad,

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.130
and beyond all that,

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.490
Jody is a real hero or an absolute inspiration to anybody that knows his story,

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
which is what we'll be talking about tonight.
Welcome to the show,
Jodi.

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.580
Thank you Jocko.
Did I miss anything?
Jocko.
Mega Fan.

13
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.260
Thanks man.
I appreciate that.

14
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.940
Also with us is Echo Charles.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.880
Now before we dig into your book.
Yeah,

16
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.090
I wanted to start off with an excerpt of a poem

17
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.820
by Richard Kipling and it's called the young British soldier,

18
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.740
and I think this is a little bit appropriate since Candida's a form or part of

19
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.190
the Commonwealth of England and now part of the Commonwealth.

20
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.700
And while Kipling was never actually a soldier,

21
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.080
he did attend the United Service College in England,

22
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:44.400
which kind of prepared young men for the army,
although he never joined.

23
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.160
But he did spend many years abroad and the British colonies.

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.250
And he also lost his only son,

25
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.520
John in world war one at the battle of Loos in September of 1915

26
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.060
whether it was just about a hundred thousand casualties in a matter of days.

27
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.460
And John Kipling was last seen lurching through the mud,

28
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.250
blindly crying out in agony

29
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.410
after his face had been ripped apart by an exploding shell.

30
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.570
And this poem that I'm about to read a part of it is not about world war one,

31
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.860
it's about the British wars that took place from the 1830s till the early 19

32
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.480
hundreds in a part of the world called Afghanistan.

33
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.343
<v 1>Hm.</v>

34
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 0>And here was this a latter part of that poem</v>

35
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.140
when first under fire
and your wishful to duck,

36
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.440
don't look nor take heed at the man that has struck be you're living at trust.

37
00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:03.730
To Your luck in March to your front,

38
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:08.410
like a soldier front,
front,
front,

39
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.700
like a soldier.
If your officer's dead in the sergeants,

40
00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:17.210
look white.
Remember it's a ruined to run from a fight.

41
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.130
So take open order,

42
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520
lie down and sit tight and wait for supports like a soldier.

43
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.400
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Like a soldier

44
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.990
when you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's planes and the women come out to

45
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.510
cut up what remains?

46
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.620
Just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your God like a

47
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.960
soldier.
Go,
go,

48
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.720
go like a soldier.

49
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.130
I think that poems sets a tone

50
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.280
for what kind of a place Afghanistan can be.

51
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.490
Yeah,
it's been a while.
So to hear that.
Yeah,

52
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.960
that last line's not,
not a joke either.
No,
it isn't.

53
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020
Um,
and we're to get there on your book here in a minute.

54
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.680
Your book is called unflinching.

55
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.820
This is the book right here.

56
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.460
And I kind of made that connection with the unflinching part.

57
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:49.090
You've been a sniper.
You obviously can't be flinching when you're taking a shot.

58
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.990
Right?
And this whole thing kicks off the first chapter,

59
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.860
which the name of the first chapter is awesome because this is something that I

60
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:01.810
believe is something that a lot of people have.
I know,
I damn sure did.

61
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.620
The first chapter is called the soldier in the child

62
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.840
and I think that describes a lot of people that join the military.
Yeah.

63
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.830
It's the thing that's in there.
It's,
they're born with it.
You were born with it.

64
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.920
I know.
I was born with it.
Yeah.
It's all I ever wanted to do.

65
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.050
It's all I want to do.
Believe me.
Now your mom,

66
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.170
how did she feel about all that?
She resisted,
uh,

67
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.600
like any eighties mom,
right?
You're,
how old are you again?

68
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.270
44 so you're a little older than I am,
but

69
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.070
<v 2>my mom,
being a foster kid,
read all the books and all the books at the time said,</v>

70
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:40.291
boy,

71
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.510
you should play with barbies and girls who play with Tonka trucks and treat them

72
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.300
gender neutral and blah,
blah,
blah.
But guess what?

73
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:49.700
If you put boys in a room and girls in a room with toys,

74
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:52.220
the boys play a Tonka trucks and the girls play with the barbies.
I just,

75
00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:53.054
the way it is.

76
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.860
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
matter of fact,
my son,
I had two,</v>

77
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.190
two daughters that were young and our house and I didn't want them.

78
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.010
I'm not going to have them have all these barbies.

79
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.000
I don't even know where they came from,

80
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.010
but they showed up at my house and he goes,
what?

81
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:07.100
My son was born and I was all worried,
oh,
he's going to be playing with barbies.

82
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.260
That kid will hit kid didn't care about barbies.

83
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.830
He didn't care about anything that had wheels on it.
Yeah.

84
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.630
<v 2>It's just,
and it's boys and girls are different.
They're just different.
And,
and,</v>

85
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:19.220
uh,
you know what,
I know lots of women that are great soldiers.

86
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.020
I'm not saying that they don't have it,
but mom wanted,
you know,

87
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:27.700
a no guns,
uh,
GI Joes,
but no,
you know,

88
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.770
couldn't keep the weapons.
Um,
and,
you know,
and I,

89
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.610
and I love her for it because who knows who I would have been if she had,

90
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.580
maybe if she had fostered it,
it would have,
it would have fizzled out.

91
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.180
I don't know.
Um,
but yeah,

92
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.810
all I want to do with soldier since I was,
since I was little

93
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.200
<v 0>boy.
So your mom had that attitude and then along came a uncle Jim.
Yup.
Yup.</v>

94
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.840
Uncle Jim.
Tell,
tell us a little bit about uncle Joe.

95
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.990
<v 2>I mean,
I just saw him the last weekend actually.</v>

96
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.100
He lives in Victoria where we're Mr Echo was born.
And um,

97
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.740
he,
when when you're a child,
right,

98
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:05.190
there's nothing more impressionable than a three year old,
really.
Right.

99
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.220
When I was three,
he would back then,
uh,
if you were in uniform,

100
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.890
you could ride the train for free and get the bus for free.

101
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.920
And so he would ride the train in uniform when he had his,
uh,

102
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.950
leave and he'd show up at the house and he'd bring me teddy bears.

103
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.580
And I was like,
this is obviously the coolest dude ever.
And whatever he does,

104
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.110
I want to do it.
And he would tell stories about what he did,
you know,
and he was,

105
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.670
he was an infantry soldier,
same regiment that I joined.
And,
uh,

106
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.730
and that was the seed.
I assume no one really knows.
This is just family lore,

107
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.570
right.
Where,
because mom didn't like it.
Dad was a blue collar auto worker.
Um,

108
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.920
his dad was in the army,

109
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.240
but it was like conscripted into the Serbian border guard when the,
when the,

110
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.690
when the German army showed up,
he basically threw his hands up,
was like,
Yep,

111
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.930
I'm cool.
Don't shoot.
Um,
you know,

112
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.120
mom's dad apparently was in the army,

113
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:59.290
but no one knows because he died when she was 10.
Um,

114
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.500
no one's really sure what he did.
You know,
apparently he was in Korea,

115
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:08.330
but there's no record of it.
So anyway,
it's just,
it was there.

116
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.210
And Jim,
I think was the catalyst that's,

117
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.690
that sparked it sparked it it when I was just a young,
yeah,

118
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.770
<v 0>little impressionable boy that happens now when you got to be a teenager,</v>

119
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.030
you know,
you kind of sounded in the book,
you sound like,
yes.

120
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.900
You sound like a teenager.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
and I mean just to go here.

121
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.610
In your book you say I was a loner who didn't fit in.

122
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.080
I still dreamt of being in the army probably because I wanted to belong to

123
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:40.400
something.
Yeah,
and it was definitely clear.
I didn't belong in school.

124
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.800
I hated school.
I hate especially cause when you get to high school,

125
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.180
<v 2>I don't know how you guys five,
I've heard you talk a little bit about it.</v>

126
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.220
It sounded like you had the same issues.

127
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.620
Like definitely couldn't connect with any year teachers.

128
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:57.270
The only teacher I remember I had this teacher,
I forget his name,

129
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:01.740
but he was Scottish originally and he was my history teacher.

130
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.670
Like the only subject I cared about was history really.

131
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.490
And he would tell stories about everything else he ever did in life before he

132
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.620
was a teacher.
And I was like,
okay,

133
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.920
this guy actually has some shit that I need to hear because he's been around the

134
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:21.270
world and he's done everything.
The rest of them.
I joined,

135
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.210
I became a teacher at a college and this is how you type.
And I'd be like,

136
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.220
why am I even here?
What am I doing here doing math?
I,
I,
you know,

137
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.120
snipers,
you know,

138
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:34.800
we eat ballistic church for breakfast and math was useless to me in high school.

139
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.570
And uh,
yeah,
I just,

140
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.660
the last thing I wanted to be was in school and I've actually cause this,

141
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.010
this was the the nineties,
right?

142
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.540
So that was still when you could quit school to join the army.
And I was like,
Oh,

143
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.890
I'm just going to quit school and join the army.

144
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.680
And my parents like basically had to beg me to stay.

145
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:51.330
They let me join the reserves,

146
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.310
which in Canada is called the militia and it's like once a week and a weekend a

147
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.720
month now.
Like you can do that,
but don't quit school.
Finished school.
Alright.

148
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.980
But it was like completely against my will,
but they find the got you.

149
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.400
They finally let you join.
You joined them on their show.
Right.
And then,
but,

150
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.140
but you weren't,
still weren't active duty.
Well,
the militia in Canada,

151
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:14.790
you can be called up to active duty,

152
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.800
but it's not like we chatted a little bit about this on the way here where you

153
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:22.410
guys have a different system here cause yours is much bigger.

154
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.410
But also like the militia and Canada was the military before World War Two

155
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:33.210
basically.
So regiments were local,
uh,
was a part time thing.
You know,

156
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:36.150
it was Kinda like,
it was the,
what does that,
what do they call it,

157
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.400
the citizen soldier and a,

158
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.720
the regular army was just there to kind of give them an enemy force and,

159
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.530
and take care of the,
the,
the machine guns and the howitzers the doesn't there.

160
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:47.610
So that we had at the time,

161
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.110
and it wasn't til after World War Two that it flipped because it was,
you know,

162
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.250
the Cold War started and all that jazz.
So,
you know,
um,

163
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.570
at any time the regular army now into the 90s could say,
you know what,

164
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.140
we need 10 reserve soldiers to,
to fill in a platoon here.

165
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.760
And if you could volunteer.
And I remember when I showed up to my,

166
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.880
my reserve unit,

167
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.260
the resurgence sewing private stripes onto their uniform because they were

168
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:18.160
called up to the regular army.
But you're not as sergeant,

169
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.200
you're like,
you're qualified because to keep guys in the reserves,

170
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.140
they promote them faster.
But when you go work with the regs,

171
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.860
like they're not going to call you a sergeant you've been in as long as Corporal

172
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.660
Smith.
Ah,
private stripes bitch.
So,
uh,
but,
but guys,
guys,

173
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.150
guys would fight each other to get those slots though.

174
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.650
Cause there was nothing better,

175
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:41.340
more honorable than to deploy with a reg force regimen.
Absolutely.
And Go,

176
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.590
you know,
peacekeeping.
But you know,

177
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:46.950
there's still a few gun fights here and there.
I thought this was cool.

178
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.810
And the book,
you talked about this here,

179
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.390
you're basically starting bootcamp and you say you just get your haircut.
Yeah.

180
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.220
Get your head shaved

181
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.690
<v 0>for the first time.
Once the Barbara was done,
I studied myself in his mirror.</v>

182
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.850
I barely recognize the young man staring back at me.
The eyes were the same,

183
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.950
but everything else was different.

184
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.740
I wasn't Jody Mitak lay about loner highschool,
good for nothing.

185
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.850
Another floundering adolescent with no ambition and no life plan.

186
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.630
That kid was lying under a pile of hair on the floor.

187
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.730
Looking back at me was Jody Mitic soldier in training?

188
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.610
Goosebumps.
So legit.
Yeah.
Well,

189
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.720
<v 2>so I had at the time,
lethal weapon two was my favorite movie ever.</v>

190
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.030
So I had like tempted straight Mel Gibson hair.
Oh Dude,
it was glorious.

191
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.860
Oh,
you should've seen it.
A Max.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Food,

192
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.080
walking around smoking cigarettes and pretending.
Yeah.
Anyway,

193
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.700
just being ridiculous.
But
you know,

194
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.480
it happened to me again recently because I had grown my beard out and I had a

195
00:12:56.481 --> 00:13:00.590
bit of,
I had some long hair and I did,
I did it.

196
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:04.910
I shaved the beard down to nothing and I went to the barber who usually does his

197
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:07.850
best to give me a little bit of length but still make me look professional.

198
00:13:07.851 --> 00:13:10.940
And I said,
I want you to give me a number one all around.

199
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.850
That's what I'm talking about.
And this was just,

200
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.730
this was just like a month ago and you know,
he,
she did all that and you know,

201
00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:19.940
your skin feels cold cause now the air is on it.

202
00:13:19.941 --> 00:13:22.910
And I looked in the mirror and it was almost the same feeling.
I went,
oh,

203
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.420
oh there he is.
I was like,
there's that soldier.

204
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.350
And I remember the feeling because it was,
the guy's name was Marco.

205
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.210
He was this Italian guy who cut my hair and he couldn't believe it because he

206
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:38.180
had fostered this ridiculous mullet for the last two years.

207
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.260
And now I said shave it off.
Cause I showed him a picture of a marine.

208
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.180
I said I want to look like this guy.

209
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.120
<v 0>And when he shaved it and then</v>

210
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.070
<v 2>it was like,
I was at the starting line of,</v>

211
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.640
of like the biggest race I'd ever gonna to run in my life.
And,

212
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.790
and all I could think about was getting to the end and being successful.

213
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.623
It's full.

214
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.420
<v 0>And it changed my life,
man.
It changed my life.
Yeah.
You know what,
one thing that,</v>

215
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.410
cause when I was a kid,
I was into,
this is going a little bit tangential,

216
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:12.430
but I was into the hardcore scene on the east coast hardcore music.

217
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:17.110
That's what I grew up with.
And it was like,
yeah,
shaved heads getting after it.

218
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.790
But one of my best friend at the time,
he's like,
listen,
you know,

219
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.770
we're part of this where there's nowhere to hide.

220
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:26.530
You can't hide behind your bangs.
It's all right there.

221
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.180
You gotta face yourself nice.
And it also strips away,

222
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.010
you know,
any kind of,
I mean,
hair is basically,
uh,
uh,
what's that word?

223
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.800
It's basically for show,
I mean this is where hair is.

224
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:43.180
It has no purpose other than I look good.
So let's just go ahead and remove that.

225
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.340
I don't care what I look like,
I'm here to win.

226
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.070
So yeah,
I guess that might explain my haircut.
It's so

227
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.640
<v 2>I'm glad you picked that.
Sent that,
that paragraph.</v>

228
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:57.650
Because when I did this a month ago,

229
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.920
it was when I started my training for a bodybuilding show.

230
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:05.810
I decided to do and I think I just like,
I was having trouble getting into it,

231
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.050
you know,
uh,
I know how to do everything.
I know how to eat well.

232
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:10.550
I know how to work out and when we're going outside,

233
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.540
I was like 16 but I just wasn't,
it wasn't clicking,
you know?

234
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.140
And I went to the barber and I did that and it was like the switch went off,

235
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:21.020
boom.
And there it was,
it was like,
oh,
I'm back at that starting line.

236
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.220
I'm going to be 40 in January,
so I want a six pack before I'm 40 I don't know.

237
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.720
Since I got blown up,
I haven't had one that's been 10 years.

238
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.560
Right on.

239
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.960
<v 0>All right,
so now we get to this next section.</v>

240
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:38.530
Now you're kind of learning about what the army's like and here's some stuff

241
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:41.920
that you said about it.
There was a system for everything in the army,

242
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.120
a way to stand and a way to sit,
a way to dress in a way to sleep.

243
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.130
There's also a way to a system for how to properly eat at the mess hall.

244
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.920
Our routine was an endless monotonous cycle.
We woke up,
made our cots,

245
00:15:56.921 --> 00:16:01.170
folded our sleeping bags and the exact way we'd been taught once the tent wasn't

246
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.180
shape,
it was on to barrack spar barrack boxes.

247
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.650
We had to lay them out as instructed with everything in its proper place,

248
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.150
whether it made sense or not.
We had to stand beside our kit at cots.

249
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.180
Everyone perfectly still as the officer did inspection at the time.

250
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.330
I thought that so much of this discipline was overkill.

251
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.500
Why did we have to stand at attention when the officer was on the other side of

252
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:28.810
the tent looking at some other dude's cotton kit?

253
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.170
Why did our Barix boxes have to be identical?

254
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.650
It took me a couple of years to figure out that the skills they were drilling

255
00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:38.680
into us are actually really important for a combat leader.

256
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.580
If you can't still stand still long enough for morning inspection,

257
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.930
how can your commanders trusts you to hold your posts during a mortar barrage?

258
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.210
How will lead or no,

259
00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:52.060
he can count on you to be a useful soldier if you can't even follow through on

260
00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:54.640
an order meant to keep you and your comrades safe,

261
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.440
even if you don't know what at the time.

262
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.250
All these drills were training me to put self discipline above my instinct to

263
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:07.921
flinch or flee when everything in me told me to break my posture,

264
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.330
to stand down.
I learned to obey a different order.
Instead,

265
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.340
it was basic training,

266
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.780
but I was assimilating some important skills that would later make me a better

267
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:20.614
sniper.

268
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.460
Now I talk about discipline all the time.
Yeah,

269
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and that's obviously why I honed in on this because you kind of captured the

270
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.560
kinds of things that they're teaching you,
discipline,

271
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.150
they're teaching you disciplined eight.

272
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.810
If you don't make that connection for all you young troopers out there that are

273
00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:44.160
getting ready to join the military,
there's a purpose.
There's a reason behind it.

274
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

275
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.770
<v 2>A definite purpose</v>

276
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:57.740
and you know that's part of my book is the book that I wrote with leaf.

277
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.650
You know one of the chapters is called discipline equals freedom.
Yeah.

278
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.630
There's another chapter in there,
it happens to be called cover and move.
Yeah.

279
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.190
And you know,
we relate it to everything we do.
To me there's no other tactic.

280
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.670
And again I had to call this out in your book and by the way,

281
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.890
I'm reading your book right now.
Yeah.

282
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.990
And I was trying to figure out how to do this.
Yeah.
Like should I say,
okay,

283
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:23.290
can you read this section?
And then I thought to myself,

284
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.190
<v 3>okay,</v>

285
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.690
<v 2>it's going to be different for you to hear it coming from someone else to hear</v>

286
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:30.524
the words.

287
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.200
And when I looked up at you after reading that first section I was like,

288
00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:37.580
he just enjoyed that I did.
Yeah,
because you're hearing it,
you can't,

289
00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:40.880
you can never hear it when you hear yourself read it your each like I dunno,

290
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.600
I have my own reaction cause they're my words.

291
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.100
But especially from someone like,
like you,

292
00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:54.050
someone who shared relatively common experiences and you know,

293
00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:57.740
I was a sniper team leader.
You were a,
you were a task force leader.

294
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.080
And for us to have a similar reaction to the same types of things is,

295
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:09.250
it's very interesting for me to see as well to see for someone like Jocko read

296
00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:14.270
the same thing that I went through and go,
yes,
exactly because you got it.

297
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.340
It took me a couple of years to realize,
like I said,
why,
why am I standing here?

298
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.430
This is a stupid,
is this cause just go out,
let's just go with and train.

299
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.630
When you are training bitch,

300
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.280
you're learning how to do what you're told and you're learning how to back.

301
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.410
Cause if you take off from your barracks box,

302
00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:33.270
well guess who's going to pay for it?
The guy next to you and you know,

303
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.860
beyond doing what you're told,
even in that paragraph you pointed out,

304
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.130
look the the,
the inspectors look in the other direction.

305
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.430
You could easily break your posture.
Yeah.
You know he's not going to see you.

306
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:47.210
He's never going to catch you.
But guess what?
You held the line.
Yeah.

307
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.940
You held the line and that's what you're learning is that no matter what,

308
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:52.760
no matter if people are looking at or not,
you're going to do your job.

309
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.620
That's your duty.
It's your job,
it's the job,
right?
It's the job and people,

310
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.120
what's the,

311
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.120
what makes a good soldier at someone who who understands their job is to be that

312
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:06.380
soldier and I know,
okay,

313
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.860
I know what I'm saying and you know what I'm saying.

314
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.240
But you got to go through that to really understand it and me and you can give

315
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:16.640
advice all day to people like new new guys.

316
00:20:16.641 --> 00:20:18.680
We get when you tweeted out I was coming,

317
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.030
oh I'm getting ready to go on selection.
I'm getting ready to go to,

318
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.890
I want to be a sniper.
I'm joining the infantry.
What do I do?
What do I do?

319
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.600
I can give you advice all day.
Jocko can give you advice all day,
but man,

320
00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:32.690
there's some things you just got to learn on your own and that's that standing

321
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:35.450
there with your boots polished at full at,
you know,

322
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:40.451
standing at the chow wondering why you had to iron your shirt again is going to

323
00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:43.700
help you later on.
When you're under enemy machine,

324
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:48.040
gun fire and mortars are coming down.
Trust me,
that Shit's going to help

325
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.690
<v 0>you,
but you're going to learn that on your own.
Now back to cover and move.</v>

326
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.920
Uh,
here you go.
Talking about covered move in our pairs,

327
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.800
one guy would move forward while the other guy would shoot to provide cover.

328
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.680
The mover would yell moving and jump up and move forward.

329
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:05.470
About three steps saying in his head up,

330
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:10.530
he sees me down while his partner covered him at down the mover would take

331
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.990
cover,
going to ground,
taking up a firing position and yelling,

332
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:17.980
covering once in position.
Then his partner would move forward the same way.

333
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.220
The idea was to always have a foot on the ground,

334
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.260
which means one soldier is covering while the other is moving.
Boom.

335
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.790
And you just had to break that out on your own team at work now in the civilian

336
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.080
sector,

337
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.450
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
we had lunch and uh,</v>

338
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.470
the best thing I got out of reading your book,

339
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.230
my transition was a weird one.
Okay.
Politics is not business,

340
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.670
but there are some business aspects in that I'm now dealing with people that

341
00:21:47.671 --> 00:21:49.890
aren't,
you know,
I've,

342
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:53.490
I'm used to working in small teams with people that are professionals at what we

343
00:21:53.491 --> 00:21:56.220
do.
You know,
snipers.
And even though I was 10 years ago,

344
00:21:56.221 --> 00:22:00.630
that's basically my last real working environment.
That's what you know,
is,

345
00:22:00.631 --> 00:22:04.950
that's what I know.
So if even if I'm the boss and you're my sniper and I go,

346
00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:09.090
Echo,
I need you to take up this position.
I can go away,
come back,

347
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.350
that position's taken.

348
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.390
But when you're dealing with civilian staff who have never operated in that kind

349
00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:19.500
of,
are we say operated,
they've never worked in that kind of environment.

350
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.470
If I tell him to do something and walk away,

351
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.760
you better come back and check because they're not used to that kind of freedom.

352
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.490
Cause it's disciplined.
But it's you're giving them,

353
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.830
I'm giving you the freedom to do the job I gave you.

354
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.060
You don't need me to double check that you took up the proper sniper position

355
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.610
and then also the fire and the cover and move the foot on the ground.

356
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.430
I realized after reading your book and went,

357
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.740
so Jocko just basically was like,
listen dummy bay.
That's how I felt.

358
00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:51.300
I felt like a dummy.
I'm like,

359
00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:53.850
of course I should have implemented this in the office.

360
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.780
My people were operating in silos cause I had my,
my,

361
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.690
cause I'm the sports commissioner for the city.
So I had a sports,

362
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.880
one of my assistants was on sports,

363
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:07.030
one of my assistants was on the policy and one of my assistants was on um,

364
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.310
con constituency work and that's where you deal with the,
the,

365
00:23:10.311 --> 00:23:14.400
the voters who call it.
But none of them were talking to each other.

366
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.150
And I was only talking to them sporadically.
So I said,
okay guys,

367
00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:21.660
from starting today,
I didn't tell them why though.
I wasn't like,

368
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.200
I wasn't going to say,
Hey,
this Guy Jocko gave me an idea.
I said,
hey guys,

369
00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:29.340
I got an idea
from now on cc,
you're going to see,

370
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:33.390
see him and he,
you're going to see,
see him back whenever you send an email.

371
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.740
And then I'm going to CCU and you're going to see,
see me within that week,

372
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.641
our productivity,

373
00:23:38.641 --> 00:23:43.240
you like 100% improvement because now instead of everyone,

374
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:45.860
it was just aware of what the others were and it,

375
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.250
and there are things that I already know,

376
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:54.110
but now I got to learn to apply them in my civilian life because I'm not working

377
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.970
with highly trained snipers anymore.

378
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.190
I'm working with people that are good at their jobs,

379
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:03.190
but not necessarily the way that I expected them to be.
And it,

380
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.940
you know,
there's,
there's so much,

381
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:09.340
we were talking about it right before we pressed record about why is your,

382
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.070
the last podcast was the art of war.
And,

383
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.710
and to us it's kind of like a Duh,
you know,
Joe Rogan says all the time,

384
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:17.840
it's a Duh,
that's a Duh thing.

385
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.480
But there's so much you can take from that book and up.

386
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.150
There's a reason why fortune 500 CEOs keep it in their desk because you can

387
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:30.380
apply a lot of what Sun Tzu said 3000 years ago to right now.

388
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.440
And just your daily life to your interactions with your kids,

389
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:38.690
interactions with your,
your boss or your subordinates or your supplier or your,

390
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:41.900
you know,
your,
your colleagues.
It's all right there.
It's just,

391
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.760
you got to translate it,
you know,
uh,
it's not difficult ground.
It's,

392
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.380
you know,
it's a position you have to take on a,
on an issue.
So,

393
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.720
yeah,
like I,
it's a trip to me this whole life,
this whole thing.

394
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.440
<v 0>It's uh,
it's human nature that,</v>

395
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:04.670
that thread of human nature runs through from 2,500 years ago.

396
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:08.420
It's on Su through war,
through life,
through business,

397
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.830
through the relationships that you now have with your kids.
Yeah.

398
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.280
It's everywhere.
Kids

399
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.720
now you,
since you were a militia,

400
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.870
you actually went back to school after you went to bootcamp.

401
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.610
So you get back to school.
And this is very typical.
Before militia training,

402
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.080
I'd been so bored at school and found everything tedious and pointless.

403
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.340
But after eight weeks of soldier training,
school seemed like a breeze.

404
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.630
I started arriving on time and paying attention to the lessons in the military.

405
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:44.660
You can direct your career according to your aptitudes and interests,

406
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.710
so I decided to do the same at school.
Instead of taking classes I hated,

407
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.780
I picked ones I knew I would enjoy.

408
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.140
My grades improved because I was doing more of what I wanted to do.

409
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.000
For the first time.

410
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.890
I had discipline and self direction and instead of all that energy being

411
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:04.610
repressed or coming out in the wrong way,
I had focus.

412
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.780
I went from being a loner and keeping to myself to becoming more outgoing and

413
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:09.890
popular at school.

414
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.500
That discipline goes a long way.
It really goes a long at,
see,

415
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:22.180
I went to college after I'd been in the seal teams for eight years,

416
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:27.460
no,
sorry,
10 years.
So when I went to college I was like,
oh,
bring it,

417
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.570
bring it on.

418
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.490
I've got to study every little thing you say and I'm going to know it better

419
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:32.324
than that,

420
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.760
<v 2>but I found I was a better student.
Oh.
After going through bootcamp.</v>

421
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.960
Doubt about it.
Uh,
and basic training.

422
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.200
It just like learning became easier.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

423
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.150
Even if I didn't want to know what they were talking about.
Yeah.

424
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:51.220
That's something that the army imposes on you is they'll teach you something and

425
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.840
for the first time you,
cause in civilian world when you're a kid,
they go,

426
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:56.790
you've got to learn this and you don't study.
And next thing you know,

427
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:57.541
you don't really know it.

428
00:26:57.541 --> 00:27:00.330
And then you take the test and you fail and you're like,
oh,
I'm not smart items.

429
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.260
I'm an idiot.
And the army like,
no,
you will learn this then and then,

430
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:07.440
and then you learn it and you say,
oh,
okay.
That's how I learned.

431
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:10.580
I actually have to apply myself and study and now I'm going to get an A.
Yeah.

432
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.390
Which is awesome.
So then now you still weren't active in the military,

433
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:18.520
you went to get your factory work on.
Yeah.

434
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.400
Well I was,
I was as active as I had to be.
Uh,
cause it's,
you know,

435
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:26.850
it's part time.
Right,
right.
And then,
you know,
there was a girl,

436
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.250
just beautiful Russian girlfriend.
And,
um,
you know,

437
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:37.150
dad got me a great paying job,
but I'll let you,
I'll let you say it.
Yeah,

438
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.690
no,
it's good.
And then find,
you were like,
okay,
I'm ready to you.

439
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.950
You worked in that factory situation for so long.
Then you said,
I'm going to go,

440
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.030
well it's about a year and I was making money that like,

441
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.010
it was like 25 bucks an hour.
Dang.
I was 19.
Was it 1986 I think.

442
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.800
And uh,
I hate it.
I'm sorry dad,
if you're,
if you hear this,

443
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.430
cause he got me the job,
but it was his parent company because he was in union,

444
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.730
he was in the,
we had the Canadian auto workers down here.

445
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.050
It's the United auto workers.
And uh,

446
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.400
just it just,
it just,

447
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.580
it was soul crushing for me,

448
00:28:17.581 --> 00:28:19.770
for me and nothing against guys that can do it.

449
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.900
There are guys that have worked there 30 years.

450
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.040
They put the same rivet in over and over and over again for eight hours a day.

451
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.940
And they're masters at it and they love it and they punch their card and they go

452
00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:33.600
home and they do their thing wasn't for Jodi.
Uh,
no.

453
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.230
So you get back now you go full active duty.
Yes.

454
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.390
You become a soldier by profession.

455
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.100
So I do what we call a transfer to the regular force and the,

456
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.780
and then on top of that,
usually you're supposed to go through training again,

457
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.030
depending on your level of experience because I was only both three years,

458
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.750
so I should have gone through what,
what back,

459
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:02.550
what's called battle school and that's,

460
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.930
that's the regular armies battle school to become an infantry soldier.

461
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.640
For whatever reason,
the decision was made that I wouldn't.
Okay.

462
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:12.960
So you don't go back in and,

463
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:17.610
but you're our back active duty and now you'd think that Jodie was all super

464
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:20.850
squared away now,
but you are or you,
well it was a,

465
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:24.890
it was a rough transition Jocko and uh,
yeah,
that,

466
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.850
that came after
your active duty,
right?
Well,

467
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:33.690
yeah,
I'm a full time private.
I was a corporal in the reserves.
Right.

468
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:36.720
Busted back down to private show up.

469
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.760
There's a lot of politics going on,
uh,

470
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:45.050
right now and at time because the regular army is being told that has to take

471
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:49.570
reserves.
Whereas before it was like,
if you need them,
you can take them.

472
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:51.640
Now it's even if you don't need them,

473
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.470
you're going to take 30% so you have a battalion of infantry guys,

474
00:29:56.471 --> 00:30:00.720
let's say one RCR at full strength is usually a,

475
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.480
at this time it was about 700
cut,

476
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:08.770
30% off of active duty are good to go guys.

477
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.160
And now they're put aside and 30% reserve show up to take their spot.

478
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.980
Ouch.
Yeah,
so that,

479
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:20.290
and this was mandated by our headquarters.

480
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.450
And so the politics within the unit was,
can I,
we're allowed to swear on this,

481
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:29.920
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
the reg force guys were all like,
fuck you and the horse,

482
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:31.170
she came in on and,

483
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.200
and that horse is mom and anybody else associated with that horse.

484
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.440
I show up.
They thought because I was at,

485
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.560
they thought I was a reserve because the RCR has a reserve battalion.
So they,

486
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.270
they thought I was a reserve RCR.
Right.

487
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.850
And then when they found out I was a direct entry,

488
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:53.020
which means I go directly from the reserves into the reg force without going

489
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:56.350
through the RCR battle school.
Huh.

490
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.250
So they just gave you that cap badge w well,
yeah,

491
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:04.690
but I did basic training in the reserves two,
three years ago.

492
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.030
Oh Yo,
you did.
Huh?
And I got,
man,
it was rough.
It was rough.

493
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:15.060
But it,
and it got rougher cause you got in trouble.
Yeah.

494
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.890
Yeah.
So I don't know why,
by the way,
just so you know,

495
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:19.700
you wrote this in the book that's been published.

496
00:31:19.701 --> 00:31:22.340
So acting like this didn't happen.
Now is a little bit through it.

497
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.730
You got arrested.
I did get arrested.

498
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.600
I don't trust anyone who hasn't at least been handcuffed.
That's a good point,

499
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.120
right.
I made a mistake.

500
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.660
So we were now,
well,

501
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.580
the preamble to this was that I did eventually get sent to the RCR battle school

502
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:44.410
and that's where I did get arrested.
Another one of the trainees and I,

503
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.790
uh,
well the,
the whole platoon went out.
Of course,
being young men,

504
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:53.710
we somehow found ourselves at a,
a gentleman's nightclub.
And,

505
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:58.270
uh,
we were enjoying our evening and one of the guys who decided he wanted to get

506
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:01.480
some cocaine and I was,
how old was I?
20.

507
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.880
I had never even seen the stuff except for in Miami Vice.
Um,
and I'm like,

508
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:08.950
what's the point?
We're already here.
We're having fun.

509
00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:13.480
I'm already got a few drinks,
got some girls,
uh,
sitting with us.
Why,
why leave?

510
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.900
And he was adamant.
So I guess in his civilian life,

511
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.670
this was something he got got into.

512
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.170
And in my mind I was just like,
okay,

513
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:28.171
so he's gonna like leave on his own and go somewhere where you like in Miami

514
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:32.170
vice,
it's always like the worst part of town,
right?
Guess what?

515
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.210
It was the worst part of town.
So I'm like,
okay,
I'm going to go with you.
Uh,

516
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.200
I don't,
I don't need any,
but,

517
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:42.410
but I'll be there in case they try to Mug ya or jump you turns out he was buying

518
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:46.160
it from an undercover cop cars,
you know,
like,

519
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.350
who else are you gonna buy an off?
Right.
And then when,
after they bused us.

520
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.890
So we're like walking back to the club.
I'm like,
okay,
finally,
right.

521
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.250
I can get back and start hanging with the girls again.

522
00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.260
Started getting my drink on.
We get tackled by guys bigger than you and I,
uh,
and,

523
00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:05.870
and like,
they're,
so they're the under the NARC guys and they're like,

524
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:08.570
what do you do?
And you create,
they look at her id that you guys are in the,

525
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.850
in the army and you're going to smoke crack.
And I'm like,
what?

526
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.710
I look at the guy,
I'm like,
what's he talking about?
He's like,
well,
I might have,

527
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.890
they might not have had any coke,
so I might've bought.
And I'm like,
oh my gosh.

528
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:26.730
I'm just like,
but now that's the reality of my life.
Right.

529
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.270
And I can't,
there's no going back.
There's no changing it.
And it was,

530
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.950
it was at the time I described it as the worst year of my life,

531
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.030
but maybe it was the best,
the,

532
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.440
the subsequent year because it taught me a lot about myself.

533
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.260
<v 0>Yeah.
And that's the main reason why I kind of wanted to tell that.
Yeah.</v>

534
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.910
Wanted you to talk about that because number one,
like you said,

535
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.770
it's a mistake that you made that,
you know,
I've had that feeling too before,

536
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:57.920
where you're,
you're just like,
okay,
this is my reality now.
There's no,

537
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:00.730
you can't go backwards.
You're cuffed.
Yeah.

538
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.630
And yet you had,
you transitioned from it and in the book,

539
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.340
here's how you kind of talk about that transition,

540
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:11.060
because they're going to send you back to me for it.
What's it mean for me?

541
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:12.120
Fred was the battle school,

542
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:15.260
so they're going to send you to the battle school for another crack at it.

543
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.280
Your third crack at it.
My second crack at battle school,

544
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:24.140
but my third infantry course station.
Yeah.
So here's what you did.

545
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:26.480
And by the way,
you are teeter tottering this whole time.

546
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:27.580
They don't know if they're gonna kick you out.

547
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.810
They might let you in because just so everybody knows,

548
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.420
the cops even took your side and we'll,
you know,
they said,
hey,

549
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.330
this guy didn't have anything to do with it,
but it didn't matter.
The military

550
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.410
<v 2>guilty by association.
Yeah.
So the,
the,
the lunch,</v>

551
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.700
the police department was like,
Jodie,
you clearly had nothing to do with it.

552
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:44.860
But yeah,

553
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.400
<v 0>guilty by association.
Right.
And so they go back and forth,</v>

554
00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:50.920
find that you get orders.
Okay,
we're going to let you stay in.

555
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.770
And now you say this,
I had two choices.

556
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.520
I could be pissed off forever and feel hard done by,

557
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.170
or I could go back to Medford with a new attitude and make the best of it.

558
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.910
I could keep my head high and get off the bus with the shiniest boots,

559
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.850
the best pressed uniform,
the best laid out kit,

560
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.690
and the best attitude and be in the best shape of anybody there.

561
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.270
<v 4>Okay?</v>

562
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.100
<v 0>And that's what you did.
So what I did,</v>

563
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.270
so anybody that's out there that's listening to this podcast that hit a little

564
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.940
bump in the road,
that's what you do.

565
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.530
You show up with the best attitude,
the best shape

566
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.000
with your head held high and you get after it.
Extreme ownership.

567
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.950
You've got to own it.
Yeah,

568
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.850
<v 2>no hiding from it.
There's no explaining way out of it.
There's No side,</v>

569
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.230
no sideways maneuver you're going to make.

570
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:46.370
<v 0>You're that guy.
I was that guy.
Oh there's that guy.</v>

571
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:52.330
Yeah.
So now fast forwarding a little bit,
uh,

572
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:56.810
you deploy now,
you're now you're legit part of the regiment.
Yup.
Finally,

573
00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:02.090
and you deployed to Kosovo,
which at the time was a real world mission.

574
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.880
I'm sure you were fired up.
I know I would've been fired.
I didn't go to Kosovo,

575
00:36:04.881 --> 00:36:08.300
but I would've been fired up to go to Kosovo because it was the only game in

576
00:36:08.301 --> 00:36:08.730
town.

577
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:13.140
<v 2>I still remember when our,
see when our commanding officer said we got,</v>

578
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:18.141
we gathered up in the parade hall and he said one our is going to Kosovo.

579
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.320
And I still remember I was saying,
you know,
we're,

580
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.470
you know how at ease he got your hand behind your back.
Right.

581
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.990
<v 0>My hand went into a fifth and I had to stop myself from doing,
I fist bump us.</v>

582
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:32.310
You are going to become James Bond,
Chuck Norris and Rambo all.
Yeah.

583
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.720
Oh,
it's going to be glorious.

584
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.700
So you go to coast Samoan and you know what?
We're kind of joking about it,

585
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:41.590
but it was a legit mission at the time.
There was,

586
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.070
there was stuff that was happening there.
I like this little section here.

587
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:45.760
You got,

588
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.270
you're talking about the Russians cause you're stationed near some Russian folks

589
00:36:49.271 --> 00:36:53.410
and you said this,
we like to think we're tough as as Canadians,

590
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.840
but it turned out this Russian unit where we're Russian airborne,

591
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.760
who'd come from the fighting and Chechnya and we've gone into some pretty,

592
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.430
you did.
I just talked about checking and we talk about GSD in here.

593
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.950
These guys took things to a whole new level.
They were hardcore soldiers.

594
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.250
We would complain when our showers weren't giving us warm water.

595
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.450
Then we'd look over to the Russian camp and see soldiers outside in minus 25

596
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:21.040
degrees washing themselves with snow or out in tee shirts,

597
00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:22.180
cutting firewood.

598
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.400
These guys were sleeping in world war two Eric tense while we were sweating

599
00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:31.900
inside our heated barracks and every morning they'd be outside in the ball

600
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:33.670
freezing cold running,

601
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.090
doing chin ups and bench pressing big truck tires.

602
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.410
These guys were legit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

603
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.620
<v 2>We didn't know there is some,</v>

604
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.850
there was some stuff going on at the Pristina airport at that time.

605
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:49.170
That's why they were there.
Do you remember,

606
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.850
do you remember this situation at all?
Briefly.
So NATO did it's bombing thing,

607
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:58.200
right?
Bomb the Serbians out of Kosovo basically.
And then it was like,
okay,

608
00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:03.201
so when NATO stabilization forest k for the Kosovo stabilize or whatever it was,

609
00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.430
um,
was going to move in and you know,
everyone was going to get a sector British,

610
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:12.300
Russian or British,
Canadian French,
blah,
blah blah.
Right.

611
00:38:12.301 --> 00:38:15.360
As we're like loading up on our vehicles,

612
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:20.390
that brigade or I don't know how many big ways of Russians just basically showed

613
00:38:20.401 --> 00:38:23.460
up in the middle of the night at the Pristina airport,

614
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.380
which was also a military airport.

615
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.570
And they set up a perimeter around this like mountain bunker in there,

616
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.390
which just recently I read an article about it and they were like,
yeah,
the,

617
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.760
hey guys,
it's been however it's been 20 years.
Uh,
this is what was in there.

618
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.740
Oh Shit.
It was full of stuff that shouldn't have been there.
So that's,

619
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.630
that's why everybody was like,
what are they doing here?

620
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:46.000
Why do they only want to be there?
Cause they were like,
yeah,

621
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.850
we're here to help guys.
Uh,
we're just going to be right here in this area.

622
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.450
Don't ever come in here or will or we'll kill ya but we'll be right here.

623
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:54.700
We're just here to help.
No big deal.
We want to,

624
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:56.560
we want to be part of the part of the exercise.

625
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.720
But they were there to guard this.

626
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.390
There's like bunker and there is like a lot of,
there was like,

627
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.300
I guess there was some nuclear biological weapons in there and,

628
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:09.250
and some migs that should never have been in that part of Europe apparently.

629
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.260
And in the middle of the night you'd hear planes taking off and nobody knew what

630
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.094
they were.

631
00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.620
<v 0>Uh,
but you know,</v>

632
00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.180
nothing really of substantial events happened in Kosovo.

633
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.510
You get home from that and this is when you get the opportunity to go to sniper

634
00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:30.690
training,
which is outstanding.
And,

635
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:35.330
and I thought you did a great job here of pointing out what a sniper is.

636
00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:39.230
Cause people have little ideas in their heads about what a sniper is and here's

637
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:44.120
Jody's version of what a sniper is.
A true snipers.

638
00:39:44.121 --> 00:39:48.530
Someone who's willing to do pretty much anything to accomplish the mission.

639
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.260
The sniper has a particular mindset and shooting is actually one of the easier

640
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:59.090
parts of the role.
I've seen men at the rifle range who are amazing marksman,

641
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.650
but who would be terrible snipers because they don't have the patients.

642
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.410
They lack the ability to deny their own needs and to put the mission first.

643
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.320
A true sniper will make himself uncomfortable just to make the shot.

644
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.990
That is something so true.
The guys think that the,

645
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.070
that what a sniper is someone that shoots really well.
Yeah.
Yeah.

646
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:29.080
<v 2>That's,
that's the least.
That's the easiest thing I can teach you.
Right.</v>

647
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.820
If I need you to be a sniper,
that's the easiest thing I can get you to do.

648
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.110
You know that movie shooter with our Buddy Mark Walberg there?

649
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.220
I have not seen it.

650
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.500
It's based on a book about a Vietnam era as neighbors,
but anyway,
he,

651
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.530
he takes this like guy who just teams up with them for the movie and he makes

652
00:40:49.021 --> 00:40:51.170
him the shooter.
Like the DI teachers.

653
00:40:51.171 --> 00:40:55.910
We had a shoot because that's the easy part.
All that other stuff I I talk about.

654
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.030
Yeah,
that's the part I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.
In a sniper,

655
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.530
you could shoot all day.

656
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:05.640
I could put you on the range and you could shoot bulls eyes from 900 meters all

657
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:09.330
day as long as you got your Gatorade,
as long as you get your 10 minute break,

658
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.390
as long as they'll let you get up and go pee pee.
But what have,

659
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:15.510
I don't let you do any of that stuff.
Then what?
Oh,

660
00:41:15.511 --> 00:41:19.190
is it sunny out on let's too bad.
Yeah,
it's sunny out man.

661
00:41:19.191 --> 00:41:21.600
It was it or is it going to rain?
Yup.
Don't get up.

662
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.900
<v 0>Your target might come up,
but what if there's ants crawling?</v>

663
00:41:24.901 --> 00:41:26.290
You're inviting your eyes.

664
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.740
<v 2>The eyes is problematic.
I would admit.
I would,</v>

665
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.070
I would allow you to just scratch the answer to your eyes.
But,

666
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.280
but your target might come up while you're scratching.
Yeah,

667
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.010
I wouldn't get up if I was you.
The all the sniper courses.
Definitely.

668
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:42.740
You talk about in the book you talk about stalking and that's something that no

669
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:43.370
one,

670
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.060
I haven't seen that movie but no one really understands the difficulty in the

671
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.630
challenging and the self discipline.
It's an exercise in self,

672
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.390
self discipline to crawl,
you know,

673
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.030
one meter every 10 minutes.

674
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.900
It's hard to get to a position where you can see your target and take the shot

675
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.920
because you have to.
Yeah.
Because you have to have the patients too.

676
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.050
And the mindset to like,
I don't know if it made it into the book,

677
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.770
I can't,
I know you should know your own book,
but um,

678
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.680
I remember I was as leopard crawling with a guy and we were on,

679
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:18.950
it wasn't even a sniper thing,
it was just like a feel a like a,

680
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.480
like a field craft thing.

681
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.650
So we were learning how to just stop just as soldiers and we were,

682
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:28.250
we were side by side,
but he was literally on an elevation,

683
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:30.410
maybe four inches higher than me.

684
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.000
And I remember I was looking at him and I was like,
that's not a good spot to be.

685
00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.390
Freeze.
Boom Walker came over,
got him.
I was,

686
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:43.550
I was in direct line of sight but I was just that four inches lower.

687
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:46.160
You got to like have the patients to look at the ground and go,

688
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:50.870
I'm going to go this way even though it's out of your way because you can't be

689
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:54.050
within sight of,
of the spotters are of the enemy.

690
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.600
And that guy went on to become our tier.
He joined our tier one unit.

691
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.500
He's a,
he's a JTF guy.
But I remember at that time it's so,

692
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:06.880
it's not like he was a dummy or anything and,
and I,
and we're right.

693
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.200
I learned a valuable lesson.
I learned a lesson.
But,

694
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.020
but that's the mindset I'm looking for from day one,

695
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:14.390
from a guy that I'm going to put through sniper school.
Cause we don't,

696
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.670
we don't have a lot of numbers in Canada.
You know,

697
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:20.630
like I was telling you at any given time there might be 150,

698
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.870
maybe 180 snipers active at any time.

699
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.040
And in the forces and that might,
and that,
you know,
if you add in our tier one,

700
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:32.210
tier two guys,
or maybe there's 200,
so I don't have time to,

701
00:43:32.211 --> 00:43:36.620
to go looking for the best guys.
You know,
you have to come,

702
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.980
you basically got to come to come to us.
And uh,

703
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.840
and so I'm looking for the patients.

704
00:43:41.841 --> 00:43:45.620
I'm looking for the guy who's going to take that extra five minutes and look at

705
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:49.790
the ground.
He's,
who's not going to,
when I tell him,
okay,
you can go,
go,

706
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.880
start stocking.
Who's going to sit there for another five,
10 minutes,

707
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:57.050
lose that time,
but study the root on his map,
you know,

708
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.920
cause it's easy to start run and then you go,
Oh man,
oh shit,

709
00:44:00.921 --> 00:44:01.770
I should know where I'm going.

710
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.690
And no time spent on the map as time saved on the ground.

711
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.670
Right.
And you,
so you're looking for that guy and there's this just,
it's,
it's uh,

712
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.870
it's probably the same with seals.
You just,
you don't,
it's hard to describe,

713
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.370
but you know it when you see it.

714
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.600
So you get done with sniper school,

715
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.440
you spend some more time and then September 11th happens,

716
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.830
came on,
and the opportunity comes up

717
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.110
<v 0>for you to go on deployment.
Now,
you'd already been through sniper school,</v>

718
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:38.820
you were a sniper,
but the opportunity,

719
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.450
there's no opportunity for a sniper deploy.
What they need is a driver.
Right?

720
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.970
Which drivers slash.
Security.
Yeah.
Which is,

721
00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:51.270
which is,
I mean,
it's definitely a dangerous job.

722
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.950
It's definitely a monotonous job.
It's not,

723
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.060
it's not a glorious job by any stretch,
but,

724
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.170
and also what's rough about being a drivers,

725
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.070
you have a lot less control over your own fate.
I mean,

726
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:05.190
you're basically in a defensive situation when you're driving in a convoy,

727
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:07.080
you're in a defensive situation.
That's all there is to it.

728
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.250
So here you're a target,
you're a target,
you've been trained to be the hunter,

729
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.000
and now you get an offer to go on deployment to be the hunted.

730
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.200
Basic has a driver.
And of course,
because you're

731
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.120
a warrior,
you say,
Oh,
you need a driver.
You don't need a sniper,

732
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.830
but I'm going to go to Afghanistan.
All right,
bring it on.
Yeah,
that was it.

733
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:31.800
It was stay home or be a driver.

734
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.230
Pretty easy choice for [inaudible].
Pretty simple.
So now you were,

735
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:42.410
what were these little jeeps who driving Altis it's true.

736
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.200
What do you guys got that's comparable?
Nothing.
Um,

737
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.500
does it just like a little Land Rover type vehicle?

738
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.530
<v 2>Yeah.
But it's like,
not even like it's,
it's a,</v>

739
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:56.590
it's almost a class of its own is armored.
No,
no,
it's like a little,

740
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.190
um,
Dune buggy looking thing.

741
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.480
It had like a four cylinder engine built originally by Volkswagen.

742
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.400
Um,
we,

743
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.540
they were roughly the same look as it original willys jeep.

744
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.380
But that's where the similarities end.

745
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.100
And you get to Afghanistan and your,
your driveway or where are you?

746
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.160
Where were you?
Cool.
That was cool.
And so you're driving people around the city?

747
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.660
Yeah.
From base to wherever they got to go from the airport to our main base,

748
00:46:25.661 --> 00:46:26.890
which was,
um,

749
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.700
<v 0>what was the name of that camp again?</v>

750
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.710
<v 2>Sorry,
I forget the main camp we had in Afghanistan,</v>

751
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:38.190
but it was between the king and Queen's Palace.
Got It.
And uh,

752
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.390
yeah,
they'd go there or because it was,
um,

753
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.630
officers and liaison officer's mostly that we worked with.
Right.

754
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.080
So it'd be like go liaison with the Turkish guys,
go liaison with the Germans,

755
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:53.300
go liaison with this Afghan warlord dinner somewhere.
You'd sit around,
wait,
yeah,

756
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.090
yeah,
yeah.
Basically.
And we'd be as body guards when he was there and stuff.

757
00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.440
<v 0>Like we said,
there's a threat.</v>

758
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.880
You obviously you were prepared for anything of course,

759
00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.560
but you,
you know,
there wasn't a super high threat.
Right.

760
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.920
However,
there's always a threat,

761
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.980
and I'm going to the book here.

762
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.980
The oldest jeeps were not designed to withstand and attack.

763
00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.810
This fact became a starkly apparent when three,

764
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.060
three RCR guys were driving to illness and hit a mine to them.

765
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:36.330
Sergeant Robert Short and Corporal Rob Bearden finger died immediately and the

766
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:40.390
driver,
Tj Sterling,

767
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.420
a friend of mine survived though he was injured after the incident,

768
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:49.720
Tj was brought to the hospital at Camp Warehouse and meet another one of the

769
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:51.430
guys from the regimen went to see him.

770
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.540
This was the first time I'd seen one of our guys hit by a land mine.

771
00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.670
In fact,
it was the first time I'd seen a casualty at all.

772
00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:02.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

773
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.460
<v 0>Dj was pretty banged up.</v>

774
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.610
A couple of his teeth were broken and he may have had a broken draw.

775
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.680
He had lacerations all over.

776
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.030
There's always a particular odor in the hospitals around people who have

777
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:14.680
suffered traumatic injuries.

778
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.790
I remember smelling that odor like blood or maybe just what I thought blood

779
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:22.750
smelled like.
Tj was on a stretcher with big wheels.

780
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.720
We'd use this kind of stretcher before in training.

781
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

782
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.520
<v 0>To me it was a kind of prop.</v>

783
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.640
This thing we used for simulations.

784
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:33.620
<v 1>Okay,</v>

785
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.520
<v 0>but this was not a simulation.
This was the real thing.</v>

786
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.250
Tj was still in shock.

787
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.180
It had taken a few hours for him to be extracted from the scene of the
explosion.

788
00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.720
Shorty and beer and finger are gone.
He said,
yeah man.

789
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.850
We replied.
We heard I need a smoke,
man.
I need a smoke.
Tj said,

790
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.970
<v 1>okay.</v>

791
00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.620
<v 0>But doctors and nurses wouldn't allow it,</v>

792
00:48:58.621 --> 00:49:00.180
but as soon as they were out of the vicinity,

793
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.310
we lit a cigarette for Tj and gave him a couple of drags.
Ah,

794
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.750
that's way better.
Thanks.

795
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.850
We stayed and chatted with TJ about some inconsequential things,

796
00:49:11.851 --> 00:49:15.270
trying to keep a fellow royal in a good state of mind.

797
00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:17.430
For me personally,

798
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:22.440
I was learning from what was happening facing the reality that when things go

799
00:49:22.441 --> 00:49:23.130
wrong,

800
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.630
you have to get that smell in your nostrils and look those sites right in the

801
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:32.120
eye.
Sadly,
a few years later,

802
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:34.760
TJ ended up taking his own life.

803
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.590
I was a pallbearer at his funeral and as I carried his coffin,

804
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:45.430
I wondered if he carried guilt for being the lone survivor in that incident.

805
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.013
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

806
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:57.700
<v 0>so really to me that's like you're welcomed to war.
Yeah,</v>

807
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.043
and

808
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:10.380
when you talked about getting that smell in your nostrils and look in those

809
00:50:10.381 --> 00:50:11.700
sites right in the eyes,

810
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:16.370
that's I think an important thing for people to remember.
Yeah.
You don't,

811
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.970
when things are bad,
some people want to deny that it's happening.

812
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:24.660
They want to hold their nose and shield their eyes from it.

813
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.160
Wrong answer.
Breathe

814
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.210
<v 2>it in.
Yeah,
and our Gig,
especially breathe it in.</v>

815
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:34.783
You have to,

816
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.650
that you have in our line of work,

817
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.270
that's the norm.

818
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.000
<v 0>And I'll tell you,
I have been working with,</v>

819
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:50.540
worked with a bunch of different companies and bunch of different industries.

820
00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.760
They run into these situations too.

821
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.820
You know where their company's going to fail or they're,

822
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:59.520
if there's a problem there,
there's things go wrong and no,

823
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:03.270
you don't want lives are not at stake.
And I say this all the time,

824
00:51:03.271 --> 00:51:05.510
but livelihoods are,
and if you're the CEO of a company,

825
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.780
you're going to have to now lay off 500 people,
a thousand people,
three people,

826
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.660
and now that person is not going be able to afford their mortgage or pay for

827
00:51:12.661 --> 00:51:16.320
their kids or get food on the table.
That is serious business.

828
00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.060
You're ruining someone's life.

829
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.280
If you want to shield your eyes at that moment had,

830
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:27.100
you'd want to hold your nose so you don't have to smell it.
You're wrong.
Yeah.

831
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:29.543
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.660
<v 0>And obviously this to here for Tj.</v>

833
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.733
<v 3>Okay.</v>

834
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.810
<v 0>This is,
you know,
we're talking about the psychological wounds.
Yep.</v>

835
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:43.740
<v 2>People get,
yeah.
Which for him were worse than his physical wounds.
He,</v>

836
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.120
I remember one time after I got hit,
um,
because he,
he,

837
00:51:48.121 --> 00:51:53.121
he actually came back with us in an o six on the tour I was wounded on and he

838
00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:56.280
stayed in the talk the whole time.
But,
um,

839
00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.580
I remember we were back and I,
you know,

840
00:51:59.581 --> 00:52:02.460
I was hit and we were at his house and we're having a little bit of a party and

841
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:07.710
he,
he was crying because he couldn't believe that he,
cause he got,

842
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.670
he was wounded and he got a monthly stipend for,
for his injuries.

843
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:16.470
And he was still at,
but he was still active duty and stuff.
And,
and,
and I,

844
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.191
when I wounded,

845
00:52:17.191 --> 00:52:21.270
we had a new veterans system come in where I just got like a lump sum payment

846
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.010
and he was crying about how cow is it that he can get this money,

847
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.080
but I only get this money.
And Jody,

848
00:52:28.081 --> 00:52:31.530
what happened to you is so much worse than what happened to me.
And I was,

849
00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:35.430
why are you worried about I'm,
I'm okay man,
I'm alive.
We're here,

850
00:52:35.431 --> 00:52:36.420
we're having some drinks.

851
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

852
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:42.580
<v 2>But he was so tore up inside about what happened to me versus what happened to</v>

853
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:47.230
him over what happened to shorty and baron finger.
And,
uh,
he,

854
00:52:47.231 --> 00:52:49.540
he just carried that and I've,
and,

855
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.850
and you hear about that survivor's guilt thing.

856
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

857
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.880
<v 2>And you don't realize how real it is till you see it.</v>

858
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.140
And even after I got wounded,
when I came home,

859
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.140
I felt like shit because my boys are still back there.

860
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.080
And then when they went back in 2010 because our unit rotated back into theater,

861
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.600
it killed me.
I was dying inside.
That's my,
those are my guys,

862
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.050
you know,
they're over there without me and I'm letting them down because I was,

863
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.870
I told him I was going back with them.
I said,
don't worry guys,
I'll get better.

864
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:25.070
I'll go back.
And I had to like really come to grips with that.

865
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:30.010
And you know,
Tj could,
you know,
we,

866
00:53:30.011 --> 00:53:34.980
we lose too many guys that's to that stuff.
But I've,
oh,
I don't know.

867
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:39.690
I never had those thoughts.
I never thought of of ending my own life ever.
But,
um,

868
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:44.990
I've known enough guys that have done it that clearly it becomes an option to

869
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:50.230
some people and I'm,
I'm at the point with it.
Cause it,
it just happened,

870
00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.450
uh,
maybe a month ago with a,

871
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.120
with a guy I worked within the Green Berets and,
uh,

872
00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:58.640
<v 1>okay.</v>

873
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.350
<v 2>I just don't think we can save them all.</v>

874
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.100
I don't know if we're going a year ago.
I mean,

875
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.630
I think I texted you when it happened.
Right.
And tweeted at you did,

876
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.280
he texted me and,
and that one really,
my wife,
Atlanta,

877
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:15.460
she's never seen me cry.
And I cried that night for Johnny and,

878
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.900
and it was because we,
we thought we had him,

879
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:22.710
he was living at one of the guy's house that was on the team that we w we worked

880
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:27.090
with,
you know,
uh,
he had a girlfriend and like things were looking good.

881
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:30.330
And,
uh,
you know,
I've,
I've,

882
00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:33.120
I've had to come to the conclusion in my own mind that

883
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.750
we're not getting,
we're not going to save them all.

884
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.840
And this is a side effect of the Gig of the life.

885
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:44.580
We chose that some of our comrades are going to go that direction.
And if you,

886
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.250
if I was to dwell on it the way Tj did,

887
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:51.880
then I would become like Tj and I can't afford to do that.
You know,

888
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.960
use the word dwell.
And that's a,

889
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:59.010
that's a word that I use as well.
I use the word dwell and I,
and I,

890
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:03.770
and I always say
that you got to face these things.
Yeah,

891
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.160
you got to understand these things.
You got to actually embrace these things.

892
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:12.000
You got to bring them in,
but you can't dwell on them.
That's right.

893
00:55:12.001 --> 00:55:15.090
And I think that's the key is to,

894
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.820
is honestly to do what you,
what you said is to breathe it in,
to look it in the,

895
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:25.720
I deal with it,
but don't dwell on it.
Move on.

896
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.390
Stay there.
That's right.
Move on.

897
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.490
Accept it as a consequence of the actions you've chosen and move on to the next

898
00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:33.300
step.

899
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:38.300
Otherwise you'll be that guy talking about that high school football pass that

900
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.860
you,
that you caught and it,

901
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:44.580
I know it's an analogy that fits here because we talked about this in your car.

902
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.600
There's some guys,
I was a sniper,
I was a navy seal,
I was a paratrooper,

903
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:53.620
I was a machine gunner,
whatever it is.
I was a Jiu Jitsu black belt,
you know,

904
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.460
whatever it is,
and that's where they're stuck.

905
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.820
That's where their dwelling there in purgatory,

906
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:05.450
in that whatever ring of Hell you want to call it stuck in that moment and

907
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:08.390
you've got to move on.
You can't dwell because that's where you're getting,

908
00:56:08.391 --> 00:56:12.600
you're going to die when you dwell
it real simply.

909
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:17.070
What you gotta do is you got to just take a step,

910
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.980
got to take that step forward.
You gotta,
you gotta look,

911
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:22.590
you gotta look at it in the eyes,

912
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.860
<v 0>then you got to walk away and you got to walk forward.</v>

913
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:31.060
Then move forward and make something,
make go in another direction.

914
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.680
Go forward.
Don't go backwards.
Go forward.
Yeah,

915
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.260
and it,
and the other part is,

916
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:42.520
except that maybe you can't change things.
Well,

917
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.700
you can't change what's happened in the past.
Yeah.
You cannot do that.

918
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:50.030
It happened.
It happened.
And um,

919
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.710
you're not going to change it.
So what are you going to do?

920
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:57.280
Are you going to let it drag you down?
Are you going to dwell on it forever?

921
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.960
Don't,
don't do that,
man.
I know.
I know.
It gets a hold of you.

922
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.300
I know it's a tough one.
It can,

923
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:07.390
but deal with it.

924
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:13.530
Except that you can't change it except that you're here for a reason to do

925
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:17.710
something.
You have the opportunity that maybe your buddies didn't get,

926
00:57:17.711 --> 00:57:18.810
they didn't get.
Nevermind.

927
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.670
Maybe you have an opportunity that your buddies did not get.

928
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:28.150
You think they would want to have you kill yourself.
No.

929
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:33.040
They'd want you to live and that's what you need to do.
Yeah.

930
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.810
Honor them.
Yeah.

931
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.460
By living an awesome life every day.

932
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.100
Make the change be the difference.
You know,

933
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:45.730
you can't change the world,
but you could change.

934
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.530
You could change somebody else's day.

935
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.880
You can be the positive influence in your little tiny sphere.
You're my,

936
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.890
my influence in the world.
Yours echoes.
It's not the world.

937
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.620
But it makes someone else happy.
Yeah,
you can.

938
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:03.700
You can be the difference between a good day and a bad day for someone.
You know,

939
00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:04.061
when I,

940
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:07.240
when I decided that I was going to try and become an officer in the seal teams,

941
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.590
part of that part of my decision,
what's cause I,
I'm like,

942
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:14.290
I was going to be an admiral or or whatever.
It's going to be like just,

943
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:15.700
and I said,
you know what?

944
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.480
Because I had a prior enlisted officer that was just made our lives awesome

945
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:23.110
because he was such a great guy and I said to myself,
you know what,

946
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.790
I might not change the world but I'm going to have a Kool seal platoon one day

947
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:28.750
and those guys are going to,

948
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.750
those guys are going to be fired up and we're going to kick ass.

949
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.890
Just my little world.
Just that little thing.
And no matter where you are,

950
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.850
you got that little world.
Maybe like you said,
maybe it's one other person,

951
00:58:39.851 --> 00:58:41.170
maybe it's just yourself,

952
00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.210
but you make that little part of your world a little bit better.
Yeah.
You,
you,

953
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.710
you wake up in the morning.

954
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:52.900
I firmly believe you decide how that day is going to go.
Absolutely.

955
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:56.920
Whether,
you know,
I missed,
I missed my flight to come down.

956
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.390
I should have been here yesterday.
I missed my flight.
I own that.

957
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.630
I had a bad morning and I was,
I think I was even on the phone with you.

958
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.780
And I said,
yeah,
extreme ownership,
my fault.

959
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.460
And you and you giggled at me and you said,
Yup.
Uh,
own it,
whatever.

960
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.980
And then I,
uh,
my,
my,
my,
my,
one assistant called me and I

961
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.810
<v 2>said,
you know what?
I'm done being pissed off.
You know,
cause I can't,</v>

962
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.290
I'm not going to let this one thing ruined the rest of my day and the rest of my

963
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:31.850
weekend.
How's that helping you move forward?

964
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.200
How is that helping the rest of your day?

965
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:35.780
How has that helped you get here right now?
It doesn't help anything.

966
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.740
That doesn't mean,
that doesn't mean be a robot either though.
No.

967
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.980
Do you deal with it?
Process it.
Don't,
don't get me wrong.

968
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.850
I was really mad yesterday morning.
Uh,

969
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.400
and it takes a lie waiting for you down here.
I had all kinds of goods.

970
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.140
I'm like,
I'm all the things to be laid for it.
Yeah,
that's right.

971
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:56.690
A guy like you want a guy like Jocko to think you're a shit.

972
00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.540
You know you're plugging,
can't make a timing,
but

973
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.120
you know,
everything's gonna be okay.
I'm here,

974
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.500
we're still doing the podcast.
It's beautiful weather.
I got to see my kids.

975
01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:13.540
I got to pick them up from school because I didn't think I was gonna.
I got to,

976
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.790
you know,
I got to see some friends walk the dogs that day and I,
and I,
I,

977
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.060
but I made that decision myself though.
I was sitting on my,

978
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:24.830
on the edge of the bed.
I didn't have my prosthetic legs on yet.
And I said,
okay,

979
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.750
you,
you,
you're pissed off now you're done.

980
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.740
And I got up and I carried on with the day because okay,

981
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.350
it's easy to say.
It's easy for us to say,

982
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.230
take that step.
Don't dwell,
move on.

983
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:45.730
But I firmly believe if you decide you can change your circumstance,

984
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.460
that's a decision you have to make in your own mind.

985
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.360
I firmly believe it and it might not feel like it today,

986
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.040
but try again tomorrow and then try again the next day.
And you know what,

987
01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:02.150
call me before you,
before you make any decisions,
just,

988
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:05.870
just please just call me first call.
Or if you're,
if you have jockos number,

989
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.704
call him.

990
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:12.320
Because the world is definitely better with you here than without you.

991
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:17.030
No doubt about it.
And I hate to keep hammering this nail,
but,

992
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.920
but it's just a theme that I'm tired.
I'm tired of hearing a buddy of mine,

993
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:27.090
another sniper had a heart attack.
Um,
not long after that.

994
01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:29.420
That guy killed himself is great dude.

995
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:34.421
He's a legend in the Canadian sniper world and he was diabetic and he smoked a

996
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.260
thousand cigarettes a day and drank a million beers a week and they said the

997
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:43.490
heart attack was so fast.
He probably was because they found them in bed.

998
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.360
He was crawling into bed and probably and was dead before he's had even hit the

999
01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:49.580
pillow.
That's how massive a heart attack it was.

1000
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.440
When I heard it was a heart attack,
I was actually happy because I,

1001
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.850
because when I heard it,
I went,
oh,
I just went.
I just went shooting with him.

1002
01:01:57.851 --> 01:02:00.500
He was in a great mood.
They're like,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It was a heart attack.

1003
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:05.000
And I went,
oh,
thank God that's,
that's,
that's the point I'm at with this,

1004
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.860
with that subject.
So anyway,
let's move on man.

1005
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:11.000
Let's talk about puppy dogs and rainbows.
Okay.
We're not there yet.
No,
not yet.

1006
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.210
I always a good reference.
You know,
Miss my flight.
Good.

1007
01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.560
I can bring my kids to school and all these good things came out of it.

1008
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.853
That's right.

1009
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.020
<v 0>So I would like to go rainbows,
but we're not there yet.
All right,
brother hit me.</v>

1010
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.420
So now you're,

1011
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:31.890
you're coming back from Afghanistan and you know,

1012
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:35.130
you've got your girlfriend and whatnot.
And

1013
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.733
here we go.

1014
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:42.810
My first tour in Afghanistan ended a few weeks later and I headed back home.

1015
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:48.630
I was still haunted by all the things I had witnessed and kaboodle.

1016
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:50.760
Images played over and over in my head,

1017
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:52.740
whether it was small children begging for money,

1018
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.350
a mother holding a dead baby in the streets,

1019
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:58.770
or my buddy TJ bloodied up from a roadside bombing.

1020
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.870
My girlfriend expected me to return as the same guy who had left six months

1021
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:07.710
earlier when I was a different man.
Now a different Jody,

1022
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:14.040
everything around me look different too.
Maybe things had changed much,

1023
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.920
but I felt like I was on an alien planet.

1024
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.570
My girlfriend had redecorated the house moving stuff with the furniture around

1025
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:24.180
and repainting the bedroom and I found it upset me.

1026
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.640
Life had gone on without me and that fact was hard to take.

1027
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.750
People around me kept saying,
what's wrong with you,
Jody?
You've changed.

1028
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.060
And that would make me even more upset.
Not because they were wrong,

1029
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.000
but because I thought I was the kind of soldier who could just walk it off.

1030
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:46.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1031
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.700
<v 0>But few soldiers can.</v>

1032
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.980
It takes time after a tour of duty for a soldier to readjust to civilian life.

1033
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.480
And I wish I'd known that earlier.
I was expected to continue life just,

1034
01:03:57.481 --> 01:04:01.650
I lived it before my tour,
but I couldn't,
not right away.

1035
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:06.930
I couldn't step back into my normal routine as if I hadn't witnessed anything on

1036
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:07.764
mission.

1037
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:13.350
I couldn't just hop in the car and go to the grocery shopping like everything

1038
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.393
was fine.

1039
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:24.110
It's interesting that you kind of felt like you were weak sauce cause you were

1040
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:27.380
not the exact same before you went on deployment.

1041
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.070
<v 2>Yeah.
You feel like a pussy</v>

1042
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.900
even though you know you shouldn't feel like a pussy.
Right.

1043
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.970
You feel like a pussy.
It,
it,
it,
it's,

1044
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.740
it's the most frustrating at the time.

1045
01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:45.190
It was one of the most frustrating things because you want to be that guy for,

1046
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.270
for,
for your,
for your woman.
You of course,

1047
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:52.160
I'm still that awesome Alpha male that you fell in love with and can you can,

1048
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.000
you can whatever doesn't,
you know,

1049
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:58.110
doesn't blink at anything except that water bottle at the side of the road.

1050
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:02.070
Right.
There was that pallet garbage do it right there.
What do you mean?

1051
01:05:02.071 --> 01:05:05.800
I should just drive?
Oh right.
Yeah.
This is our street.
Sorry.
It's not a road in.

1052
01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:09.540
Cool.
Um,
and,
and uh,

1053
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.060
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1054
01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.893
<v 0>yeah,
I just</v>

1055
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.880
<v 2>w I,
like I said,
I wish I'd had advice that,</v>

1056
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.980
you know,
be prepared for the fact,
because when I went to Kosovo you like,

1057
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:25.570
cause I've had the people ask me,

1058
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:28.630
well you didn't have that reaction when you came back from Kosovo.
Well,

1059
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:32.980
I lived in the barracks.
All my shit was in storage.
I didn't have a girlfriend.

1060
01:05:32.981 --> 01:05:37.090
I had a girl that I was dating.
She picked me up,
uh,
when we got home.
But like,

1061
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:40.810
it's not like we were going to get engaged or anything.
And you know,

1062
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:43.890
I didn't have any real belongings.
You know,
I've,
I,
you know,
I,

1063
01:05:43.891 --> 01:05:47.680
I still lived at the unit.
This was a house I had bought a,
you know,

1064
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:49.240
my girlfriend had moved in,
you know,

1065
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:52.780
she was talking about kids and marriage and we had dog,
we had a dog.

1066
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:55.690
And I came home and I was like,

1067
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:59.530
what happened to my house and what is going on?
And like,

1068
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:06.130
you know what I told my dad when I went to Kosovo,
um,
you know,

1069
01:06:06.131 --> 01:06:07.810
in the book I talk about my dad,

1070
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.380
one of the three times I've seen him cry in my life was when I deployed to

1071
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:15.370
Kosovo for the first time.
And,
and I said,
hey man,
don't worry about it.

1072
01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.900
Six months.
Hey,
what's six months?
Right?
It's like six haircuts.
It's six,

1073
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.180
six mortgage payments.
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1074
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:27.760
And I come home and I couldn't even think that way myself.
And uh,

1075
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:28.650
you know,
and I know I'm,

1076
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:32.020
I don't know if you felt like that after your first deployment.
Um,

1077
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:35.530
but this one was different because I guess there I had a life to come home to

1078
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.030
besides,
besides the unit,

1079
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.630
<v 0>I've always been very compartmentalized in a way,
I think,
right?</v>

1080
01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.550
Sometimes probably to a detriment to

1081
01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:47.390
my family a little bit.

1082
01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:51.820
But I've always been very careful with like a work come home.
I'm not a,

1083
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.690
I'm not at work anymore,
so just stop thinking about that stuff.
And it's,
it's,

1084
01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.490
it's usually pretty positive.
But the problem is,
is that when you get to,

1085
01:07:01.491 --> 01:07:04.730
you realize you're compartmentalizing your family out of the picture,

1086
01:07:04.731 --> 01:07:07.170
kind of which I would have a tendency to do.
So.

1087
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.650
And I mean that's probably part of one of the things that,

1088
01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.520
<v 2>but even even when you were real young guy,
okay.</v>

1089
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:17.540
<v 0>Like,
like how long have you been married?</v>

1090
01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:22.100
I've been married for a long time and I'm always been like that.
Okay.

1091
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:25.640
I honestly,
it's wrong I think,

1092
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.020
but the seal teams was always the biggest priority in my life.
And you know,

1093
01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:34.700
people will be like,
oh,
family first.
That was not true for me.

1094
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:40.010
And luckily my wife understood that and she didn't hold it against me.

1095
01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.610
Right.
She knew that someday she knew the seal teams.

1096
01:07:43.611 --> 01:07:46.040
It wasn't gonna last forever.
And all you guys in the military,

1097
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:50.510
I'll tell you what,
the military does not last forever.
Well,

1098
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.130
<v 2>the big green machine rolls on.
Yeah,
exactly.
And,
and,</v>

1099
01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:57.980
and the people that are there when you're,
when you fall off,

1100
01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.770
those are the ones you got to worry about when you're still on.

1101
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.060
<v 0>Yup.</v>

1102
01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:06.740
And so that's why I think I just was able to compartmentalize what you know

1103
01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.000
away.
Right.

1104
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:13.060
And I would basically be almost a schizophrenia of this is the guy that works

1105
01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:19.160
and this is the guy that's at home,
he's dad or whatever.
And boom.

1106
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:24.080
I just had that really good split and I think it was beneficial to me.

1107
01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:30.050
<v 2>Probably it was probably is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice.</v>

1108
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:35.230
I guess I assumed I was that guy too,
because that's what I,
you know,

1109
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.790
I approached most things that way,

1110
01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:41.791
but maybe just having that little home of my own for that one tour and then

1111
01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:47.710
also,
you know,
losing a couple buddies for the first time.
Maybe.
I Dunno,

1112
01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.740
I dunno what the thing,
it's not like it,
it didn't wreck anything.

1113
01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:54.940
Like my career was fine.
Like it was just,
well,
I mean I lost a fiance out of it,

1114
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:55.803
but

1115
01:08:56.690 --> 01:09:01.410
<v 0>yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what happens next.
So she announced,</v>

1116
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.200
this is back to the book here.
She announced that she was leaving.

1117
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.290
I was shocked because I didn't want to break things off.

1118
01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:12.150
I just wanted to postpone the wedding.
But for her,
this was all too much.

1119
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:17.070
Our relationship was over while I was certain this was the right time to get

1120
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.560
well,
I wasn't certain this was the right time to get married.

1121
01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.110
I was certain about one thing.

1122
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:28.310
I wanted to go back to Afghanistan and this time as a sniper.

1123
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.100
And that's something that,
yeah,

1124
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.800
I mean that's something that it's hard to reconcile the feeling of just wanting

1125
01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:42.690
to go back.
I mean,
that's

1126
01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:47.750
<v 2>that one.
I want to go back right now.
Yeah,
of course.
People,
Hey,
what's it like?</v>

1127
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:51.200
You asked me what's it like to be in politics?
I go,
I'd rather be killing Isis,

1128
01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.650
uh,
frankly.
And I,
you know,
I'm not ashamed to say it.
I was good at it.
And,
and,

1129
01:09:56.651 --> 01:10:00.830
and I love the people that are out there doing it for us.

1130
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:06.230
You know,
even though I'm not one of them anymore.
You know what,
w w we,

1131
01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:10.340
we kind of skipped over,
but nine 11 happened during my sniper course.

1132
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.790
And sniper courses.
We don't just have a rotation.
I'm going on in Canada.

1133
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:17.870
We're very small military.
If you're on a sniper course,
holy shit like you,

1134
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:21.320
you've got,
you got there,
they run like one or two a year or something.

1135
01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.180
Maybe there's not even every year while there now I think it is,

1136
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:30.650
but back then mine was the first one in three years that had happened.

1137
01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:33.350
25 of us tried out,
three of us passed.

1138
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.120
So it's not like you get on it and it's okay,
just got to pass.
So,

1139
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:41.840
but nine 11 happened on like day five or six or something.

1140
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:47.630
And you know,
as the towers fell,
we watched it fall on TV.

1141
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:51.710
Like they interrupted a class,
we thought it was like a Cessna,
right?

1142
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:54.200
The guy comes up,
someone just flew a plane into the World Trade Center,

1143
01:10:54.201 --> 01:10:57.290
we're and we're in the middle of a,
you don't interrupt a class,
you know?
Right.

1144
01:10:57.291 --> 01:11:01.670
You don't interrupt a training session.
We're like okay man,
thanks.

1145
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:03.440
And the duty sergeant runs off,

1146
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:08.270
but we think a drunk guy in a Cessna and then he comes back and then so we go

1147
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:12.770
down to watch at the duty station and as it,
as the towers are falling.

1148
01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:15.840
I'm hearing like the starting bell,
right.

1149
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:20.100
I'm hearing like the horn at the start of the Superbowl and I'm like,
oh it's on,

1150
01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.310
cause I was considering retiring because of the lack of action.

1151
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.250
<v 0>So you did get your,</v>

1152
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:32.650
I hate to call it a dream,

1153
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.170
but you got your dream like I'm angry Afghanistan and this time,

1154
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:39.190
this time you're going as a sniper.
Yeah.
Which is awesome.

1155
01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:43.720
You're back in Afghanistan and there's some heavy fighting going on now.

1156
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:46.390
There's some legit fighting and and

1157
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.010
the Canadians are actually leading operations,

1158
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.040
which is the first time it quite some time I think since Korea.

1159
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.830
<v 2>Yeah.
Well this,
this what,</v>

1160
01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.890
what we will re this was the first time we'd let operations that were non

1161
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:06.090
peacekeeping ever since Korea.
Yeah,
you're right.

1162
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:11.310
And this,
but we,
when we walked into was the first offensive in NATO's history

1163
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.270
ever think about it.
Right.

1164
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:18.330
NATO has never been on the offensive except for in Afghanistan.

1165
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.210
Kind of weird but North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But anyway,

1166
01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.400
<v 0>this one was called operation but Dusa</v>

1167
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:30.280
this Canadian led op NATO operation was going to be different from anything we'd

1168
01:12:30.281 --> 01:12:32.890
done so far.
It was a bit of a wake up call.

1169
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:38.230
So was the fact that my Buddy Jeff Walsh had been killed in friendly fire in an

1170
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:39.940
accident that happened in August.

1171
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.690
Clearly we were entering a high risk situation.

1172
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.620
That didn't deter me in any way,
in any way.
If anything,

1173
01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.720
it made my resolve stronger.

1174
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.780
I trained for this and I was ready.

1175
01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:54.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.060
<v 0>It's a good feeling.
What,
uh,
what was the friendly fire?</v>

1177
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.080
<v 2>Was the aircraft or was it shooting?
No,
this one was unfortunately,
uh,</v>

1178
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.350
it was his buddy in the vehicle.
They were sitting next to each other and,

1179
01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.480
<v 1>okay.</v>

1180
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.313
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1181
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:15.380
I guess he got in with his rifle not paying attention to the muzzle and it went

1182
01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:20.730
off and shot Jeff through the face and killed him.

1183
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:25.770
That no one really knows exactly what happened,

1184
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:29.310
but that's basically pretty much what everyone figures happened.

1185
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.820
<v 0>Muzzle discipline.
Mm.
Never point your weapon.</v>

1186
01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:38.760
It's something you do not want to destroy.
Yeah.

1187
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.720
And keep your finger off the trigger.
Keep your weapon on safe.

1188
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:49.100
All right.
Now as you guys are getting ready to go into this operation,
but do so,

1189
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:50.270
uh,

1190
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:55.270
one of the orders that comes out is if anybody gets hurt during this mission,

1191
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:58.820
we're going to stop right away and take care of it and you're going to make sure

1192
01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:02.870
the casualties are dealt with and then reassess the situation before moving

1193
01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:03.704
forward.

1194
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.090
<v 2>That was during the,
uh,
the company commander's orders,
right?</v>

1195
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.040
And you were kind of thinking,
wait a second.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For those

1196
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.000
<v 0>of you that don't know,
which is I'm sure people that aren't in the military,</v>

1197
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.320
when you're going on in attack your,

1198
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:23.620
your ideas to maintain the momentum of the attack and you take casualties along

1199
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:28.420
the way while you're attacking,
you keep attacking.
Yeah,
don't stop.
You know,

1200
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:31.090
you're going to take casualties.
You're going to do,
people are going to get hit.

1201
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:33.430
Things are going to slow you down.
You don't slow down.

1202
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.400
You try and keep pushing forward.
You keep pushing forward.
Eve,

1203
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:42.220
I've said it on this podcast before.
Aggression will mitigate risk.

1204
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:46.060
So you get aggressive,
you move to the target,
you get the target secure,

1205
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:48.380
then you can deal with the guys that are down.
Yeah.

1206
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:52.840
Not that you're going to ignore them and you can't drop off a medic here and

1207
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:56.230
there to,
to handle a situation,
but you're not going to stop.
I mean,
literally,

1208
01:14:56.231 --> 01:15:00.250
you know,
stop.
No,
you can't stop the whole battle group.

1209
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.180
You can't split it.
You know,
the,

1210
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.970
I don't know if the order was delivered the way it was intended,

1211
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:09.010
but that's how it,
that's basically what,

1212
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.490
that's to paraphrase what was said and that's why,
you know,

1213
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:16.810
a couple of us were just kinda like,
yeah.
And what's really,
what's really,
uh,

1214
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.270
to your point of,
you're not sure if that's what was meant.

1215
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.530
What's really important is that the main thing you want to get across to your

1216
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:27.040
troopers when you're going onto a soul is you want to the main point to be get

1217
01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:31.330
aggressive.
That's the main point that you want to get across to them.
Not,
hey,

1218
01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:34.390
the main points you're going to take away from this is if we take casually stop.

1219
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.680
No,
we're going to get aggressive.
We're going to finish through the target.

1220
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:43.180
We're going to secure the target and nothing's gonna stop us from doing that.

1221
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:47.180
I don't care what happens.
That's what you want to have going into that.

1222
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.510
That's my,
that was always my impression.

1223
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.630
I've never been a company commander though.
But you've received plenty of orders.

1224
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.350
Yes sir.
All right.
Now

1225
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:05.500
we're starting to on the assault.
The assault is going down and here we go.

1226
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.430
Up Ahead.
The first vehicles we're closing in on the white schoolhouse,

1227
01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:14.350
the Zettel mired cleared away for the lead platoon comprising of four lat la ves

1228
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.680
and the g wagon to take position next to the school house.

1229
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:21.490
It was at this point that the Taliban decided to make their presence known by

1230
01:16:21.491 --> 01:16:25.780
firing an anti tank recoilless rifle round at the softest vehicle of this lead

1231
01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.310
platoon,
the g wagon,

1232
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:32.050
the round went right through the front windshield causing immediate casualties.

1233
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.050
Next,
our whole soul opened up all at once.

1234
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:37.480
Every cancer and every coaxial machine gun was firing.

1235
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:40.640
Taliban were coming out of the weeds all around us,
out of tunnels,
windows,

1236
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.840
mouse holes.
They had their head in the,

1237
01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:47.650
they had to held their powder to the last second and then it was game on.

1238
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:51.250
They had the defenders advantage and they used it.

1239
01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:55.540
The call went out on the radio that one of our vehicles was hit and we had

1240
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:58.450
casualties.
As this was happening,

1241
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:03.810
one of the [inaudible] that was stuck next to the school house went nose first

1242
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:05.830
into a ditch and was stuck.

1243
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:08.680
I was trying to listen to on the radio when suddenly the troops who were

1244
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:12.740
sticking out of the top patches of our lav yelled,
holy fuck,
they're right there.

1245
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:13.420
They let go,

1246
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.790
burst for their see sevens fallback grenade from a rifle mounted grenade

1247
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.230
launcher.
At that moment,

1248
01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.400
our artillery began raining down and air support started dropping bombs on the

1249
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.593
Taliban.

1250
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.630
I felt helpless during all this chaos because the plan for us as snipers was to

1251
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:33.110
get involved only once objective rugby had been achieved.

1252
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.830
At that point we would get up on the school's roof and provide cover for the

1253
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:41.540
bounce of the next objective.
But in this situation,
Barry cash.
So those are,

1254
01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:43.850
you're a sniper teammates bury cash.

1255
01:17:43.851 --> 01:17:48.440
And I were stuck inside the Lav right at the time when our shooting skills were

1256
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:52.940
needed up top needed most up top.
I was working the radio,

1257
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.420
doing my best to keep everyone in the vehicle informed of what was happening up

1258
01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.610
ahead.
Okay.

1259
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.330
We've got three wounded in action and one killed in action.

1260
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:06.170
I said relaying the message that there were three wounded soldiers and one who

1261
01:18:06.171 --> 01:18:08.090
was killed in the g wagon that had been hit.

1262
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:11.180
Every soldier had his zap number,

1263
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.930
which would be used as an identifier in case you were wounded or killed in the

1264
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:15.764
field.

1265
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:20.000
Standard operating procedure was that if someone died in combat,

1266
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:23.870
you never revealed their name during the battle.
At this point,

1267
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.580
we didn't know which soldier had been killed in that attack on the g wagon and

1268
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:32.600
no one seemed to know the zap number either.
Finally,

1269
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:37.160
the major got on the radio.
I need to know now who the fuck just got killed.

1270
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:40.670
The radio crackled and a voice came on.

1271
01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:44.800
It was Warren officer,
Rick Nolan,
Sir

1272
01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.660
Rick Nolan was the soldier.
I had had a brief argument with the day before.

1273
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:54.290
I've always felt bad that our last conversation was a little strained.

1274
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.600
Rick was a good man and a great soldier sitting in the front seat of that g

1275
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:02.660
wagon.
He had no chance of surviving a direct rocket hit.

1276
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:07.610
I looked at Barry and cash.
We were all stunned into silence.

1277
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:11.720
No matter how much do you prepare for that moment when a soldier,
you know,

1278
01:19:11.721 --> 01:19:12.860
becomes a casualty,

1279
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.570
there's nothing that compares to the actual feeling on top of that.

1280
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.920
It was jarring for all of us because we just didn't expect a soldier with his

1281
01:19:21.921 --> 01:19:26.090
level of experience and status to be the first one taken out on the mission.

1282
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.830
That section right there

1283
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.010
reminding me we were,
I had guys out.
Mm.
Um,

1284
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.080
they were clearing the sector of Ramadi and big gun fight broke out.

1285
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:53.690
And um,
I dunno,
three or 400 meters away,

1286
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:57.320
maybe 500 meters away,
whatever it was,

1287
01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:02.270
I can just hear gunfire,
mayhem,
radios.

1288
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:08.310
I got up to a rooftop and um,
um,
know,
hey,
what's up?

1289
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.440
And I hear the,
the element commander got on the radio and he said,
hey,

1290
01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.440
we're did he casualty evacuation?
We've got one killed in one mood

1291
01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.633
<v 1>and</v>

1292
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.310
<v 0>they were with,
I don't know,</v>

1293
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:27.030
probably 20 Iraqi soldiers and five or six seals,

1294
01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:33.220
but you don't know who it is,
right?
It's on waiting.
Right?

1295
01:20:33.221 --> 01:20:36.520
You don't want to say anything on the radio.
And I'm waiting and I,

1296
01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.540
and finally I just said,

1297
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.480
is it Iraqi or American?

1298
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.350
It was like the longest pause I've ever heard in my life.

1299
01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:52.330
And he comes back and he says both Iraqi and it was like,
they know folks,

1300
01:20:52.331 --> 01:20:55.840
the Iraqi,
but uh,
to the Iraqi soldiers.
But you know,

1301
01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.860
I was relieved,
very relieved at that point.

1302
01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:03.970
And you talk about that too and hear how somebody gets hurt or somebody gets

1303
01:21:03.971 --> 01:21:06.160
wounded or somebody gets killed and you,
you know,

1304
01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:11.161
it's one of your guys that you feel guilty when you hear the name and it's not

1305
01:21:12.161 --> 01:21:15.720
whatever one of your,
what are your bet better friends or whatever.
And that's uh,

1306
01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:20.420
one of those strange and freaking horrible things about war.
Yeah.

1307
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:25.370
You guys were

1308
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:27.400
<v 1>okay.</v>

1309
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.220
<v 0>I mean,
this was like a shit sandwich out of the gate.</v>

1310
01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:33.650
<v 2>Yeah,
you got gotta.</v>

1311
01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:38.651
Remember this is the first time Canada has been on the offensive since Korea and

1312
01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:42.260
does it matter how much you train?

1313
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.903
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1314
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:49.030
the first few minutes are going to be sloppy until you get your shit together.

1315
01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.840
Well,
I shouldn't have even said Shit Sandwich.
I should've said this is combat.

1316
01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.620
That's it.
Because I mean,
it's going,

1317
01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.710
you go into there or you're setting up your positions,

1318
01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:01.880
you're moving into position.

1319
01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.810
The enemy hadn't really revealed himself as you said in the book.

1320
01:22:05.811 --> 01:22:06.980
They held their powder.

1321
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:07.971
<v 2>Yeah.
Well we,</v>

1322
01:22:07.971 --> 01:22:12.971
we wondered if they were there at all because the day before we watched,

1323
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.660
as they all drove out of the area,

1324
01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:19.730
fighting aged guys just drove away in trucks,
trucks full.

1325
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.410
They left some guys behind.
They actually,
you know,

1326
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:28.130
the average Taliban guy,
you know,
you don't even have to duck,

1327
01:22:28.131 --> 01:22:30.380
have you shooting at,
you're really,
I mean you should duck,

1328
01:22:30.381 --> 01:22:32.810
but the point is he's probably not going to hit you,
but they,

1329
01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:36.200
whoever they left behind,
we're guys that knew what the would knew,

1330
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.340
what they were,
knew what they were doing.
And uh,
and I give them credit for that.

1331
01:22:40.341 --> 01:22:45.240
Like,
you know,
they're not soldiers as we consider it,
but they're,

1332
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:46.660
they're tough guys.
You know,

1333
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:51.370
<v 0>and you guys,
you sniper team,
you guys didn't even have your body on it.</v>

1334
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:57.210
<v 2>Yeah.
Well cause cause snake,
it's part of the,
you know,</v>

1335
01:22:57.211 --> 01:23:00.450
what's the three rules of special ops rate.
Always look cool.

1336
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.730
Always know where you are and if you don't know where you are,

1337
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.560
make sure you look cool.
Right?

1338
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:08.590
So wearing ball cabs and not having body armor makes you look cool.

1339
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.220
But also in our minds and we trained,

1340
01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:16.790
we have enough shit to,
to Hump,
you know,
why add body armor to it and,

1341
01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.330
and helmets,
you know,
we're going to be in a position we shouldn't,

1342
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.060
if we're being engaged,
we fucked up.

1343
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.760
But I tell Ya,
we,
I don't know if you're gonna read it,
but there's a,

1344
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:29.650
there's a few moment,
few minutes later I'm like,

1345
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:31.630
I really wish I had some body armor and helmet on right now.

1346
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:34.460
<v 0>I'm not going to read it,
but that's why I brought it up and I was actually,</v>

1347
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:38.060
I was actually not going to bring it up,
but then I circled to bring it up.

1348
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.511
You know why?

1349
01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:41.990
Because there's somebody out there that's in the field right now that's going on

1350
01:23:41.991 --> 01:23:44.330
some operation and they're thinking,
you know what,

1351
01:23:44.331 --> 01:23:47.570
I'd probably be better off if I didn't bring my body armor and I'm going to tell

1352
01:23:47.571 --> 01:23:51.170
you bring your body armor.
Yeah.
Bring your body armor.

1353
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.680
I did one the operation that for a bunch of reasons,

1354
01:23:57.710 --> 01:24:01.880
I decided that I didn't need body armor.
Right.

1355
01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:05.180
And of course ended up in a bad scenario.

1356
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:08.900
And the only thing I'm thinking as I have,
uh,

1357
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.900
as I have a gun pointed at my chest is,

1358
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.320
you're an idiot and you don't have body armor on.

1359
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:20.000
<v 2>We had,
um,
we had the strike plate in front of her chest rig,</v>

1360
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:25.090
but we found out after if we'd ever been struck in that plate,

1361
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:26.060
it,

1362
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.060
the spoil from the plate would have killed us because it's designed to be inside

1363
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:35.480
the body armor.
Right.
The,
the Kevlar because it had a kevlar wrap around it,

1364
01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:40.400
around the,
around the ceramic.
But turns out it's not that rap.

1365
01:24:40.401 --> 01:24:44.270
Is there more just for aesthetics or something?
I Dunno.
But anyway,
so it's like,

1366
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.991
oh no,
no,
no.

1367
01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:49.991
It has to be inside the issued vest in order for it to work a pocket in your,

1368
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:52.940
in your chest rig.
Yeah,
I know.
That's not the other crazy thing.

1369
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.850
<v 0>Again,
for guys that are overseas right now,</v>

1370
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:59.770
even if you think you're going to be far enough away from a firefight,

1371
01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:03.250
if you get hit with an IED,
you want your body armor on.
I mean that's all

1372
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:07.140
<v 2>do it 100%.
I always wear my body armor and a vehicle.
Yeah.</v>

1373
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.450
After this.
But um,

1374
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.400
but even the night I was hit,
I didn't have body armor on.
I Dunno.

1375
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:18.400
I was just a weird thing for me,
but,
but I,
you know,

1376
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:23.360
like the Romans and the Greeks,
the Romans,
they called it,
you know,

1377
01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:27.880
the first time you see combat,
you know,
seeing the elephant.
So,
you know,
we,

1378
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:34.060
so let's go back to Rick.
So Rick,
he's a warrant officer.
So do you guys,
uh,

1379
01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.740
maybe a petty officer and chief petty officer,
roughly.
He's like a company.

1380
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:42.520
He was the company quartermaster so he's not sergeant major,

1381
01:25:42.521 --> 01:25:44.590
but he's like the next NCO down.

1382
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.710
I'm going to guess he had about 18,
20 years.
He would,
he had been a recon guy,

1383
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:55.510
most of it,
you know,
I trained under him,
a mentor to under him.
You know,

1384
01:25:55.511 --> 01:25:58.900
it's like when you,
when you imagine casualties,

1385
01:25:58.901 --> 01:26:03.070
you're imagining private Smith and Corporal Jones and whoever.

1386
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:08.690
But our first guy killed is a guy trained his whole life for war and he's the

1387
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:13.040
first guy gone.
You know,
they,
there's no,
uh,

1388
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:17.600
there's no,
uh,
status.
There's no a seniority in combat.
No,

1389
01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.290
it doesn't care if you've trained every day for a hundred years or if you've

1390
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:26.150
trained one day for ever.
And that bullet is that if it's got your name on,

1391
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:26.920
it's got your name on it.

1392
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.110
<v 0>I was going to say good bullets.
Don't even have names on them.</v>

1393
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:34.150
They're going to hate you.
They're going to hit.
Yeah.
And that's why combat is.

1394
01:26:34.151 --> 01:26:36.930
So that's one of the things about combat that makes it so,

1395
01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.030
so damn awful is like you said,
you can train as hard as you can train,

1396
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.950
you can make no mistakes.

1397
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:50.460
You can be the perfect warrior on the perfect mission and you can still get

1398
01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:54.070
blown up.
You can still get shot and there's nothing you can do about it.
Yeah,

1399
01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:58.000
I mean,
I hate to say it.
There's nothing you can do about it.
You're getting in,

1400
01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:03.030
you're going to be trained and led with other people and that bullet can hit

1401
01:27:03.671 --> 01:27:04.320
you.
Yeah.

1402
01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.350
<v 2>And even if there are,
if they are dirt farmers with,
with 30 Year Old Aka,</v>

1403
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:12.590
if it's functioning,
it's a threat.
And you know,
I,

1404
01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:16.050
I've had chats with guys about why was,

1405
01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:20.790
why was that vehicle even on the objective when you had these perfectly good

1406
01:27:20.791 --> 01:27:25.200
armored vehicles.
Now these are up armored jeeps.
The,
these,
these,
the GYG it's,

1407
01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:27.100
they're there.
They're the German one,
right?
Yep.
Yep.

1408
01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.000
We'd only trained to this point.
Right.
And,
and,

1409
01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:37.260
and in training that vehicle went to the objective.
So why wouldn't it,

1410
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.323
you know,
until,

1411
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:42.870
until someone puts a recoilless rifle round through it and you go,

1412
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.970
might be best to leave that one behind and maybe just get another lab for the,

1413
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.780
for the company.
Quartermaster which after that they did.
But you know,

1414
01:27:51.781 --> 01:27:53.070
some lessons have been learned.

1415
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:57.900
<v 0>So the mayhem continues.</v>

1416
01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:02.740
You end up helping collect the casualties.
Yeah.

1417
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.120
And now you're sitting there,
you're at the,

1418
01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:09.000
what we would call a casualty collection point.
Do you use that term?

1419
01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:13.260
We'd call it,
they call it,
I don't know if you use that in here.
CCP.
So you,
okay.

1420
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:16.950
So you're at the CCP casualty collection point and here you go.

1421
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.190
One of the most important things in the field of battle is taken care of.

1422
01:28:20.191 --> 01:28:21.870
You're dead.
In fact,

1423
01:28:21.871 --> 01:28:25.860
the creed of the royals is never leave a royal behind on the field.

1424
01:28:25.861 --> 01:28:29.190
You want to get the bodies out of sight as quickly as possible.

1425
01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:32.970
It's demoralizing for a soldier to witness a dead comrade during battle,

1426
01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:35.340
especially when it's someone of Rick Stature.

1427
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.430
I went into the back of an LAV,

1428
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:43.110
grabbed a couple of body bags and got to work with some of our other guys.

1429
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.080
We picked up Rick and zipped him into a bag.

1430
01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:52.260
One of the other fallen officers was frank mellish for a second.

1431
01:28:52.261 --> 01:28:54.300
I had a bit of hope because he was on a stretcher,

1432
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:56.610
which meant he might have only been wounded,

1433
01:28:57.570 --> 01:29:01.950
but once I saw soldiers approach and check his dog tags,
I,
he was gone.

1434
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:05.910
<v 2>A casualty of the round that took out the Zettel Meyer.</v>

1435
01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:06.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1436
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:11.010
<v 2>The sad twist was that frank meloche and Rick Nolan had been friends for their</v>

1437
01:29:11.011 --> 01:29:14.520
whole careers and now they were lying on the ground together.

1438
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:15.773
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1439
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:19.800
<v 2>Next I helped put private William Kush Lee into a bag.</v>

1440
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:21.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1441
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.930
<v 2>I'll never forget looking directly in to is still open eyes and saying,</v>

1442
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.190
sorry bro.

1443
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:27.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1444
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.340
<v 2>As I zipped up his body bag</v>

1445
01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.870
now that's obviously enough to crush

1446
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:44.503
<v 3>some people</v>

1447
01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:48.650
<v 2>mentally and emotionally at that point,
but</v>

1448
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:52.100
soldiers

1449
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.720
don't have time.

1450
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:57.663
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:02.710
<v 2>Hey,
they have to do their jobs.
I mean,
what</v>

1452
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:07.360
as you went through that emotion

1453
01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:13.190
and then you turn around and you go,
okay,
what's next?
Yup.

1454
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:14.683
How's that work?

1455
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.073
<v 3>Did you do</v>

1456
01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.340
<v 2>if I had spent more than that one second scene,
sorry Bro,</v>

1457
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.820
what am I missing?
I was doing,

1458
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:33.070
I couldn't get my snipers into a position to be useful being snipers.

1459
01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:38.610
So we were being useful in other ways and once that problem was dealt with,

1460
01:30:38.831 --> 01:30:41.620
because you could,
you could see the guy like,
you know,

1461
01:30:41.621 --> 01:30:44.740
we were trying to reorganize ourselves here that we were in the reorg phase.

1462
01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:46.270
Right.
You know,

1463
01:30:46.271 --> 01:30:49.750
the guys are going the long way around of the vehicle because if they were lined

1464
01:30:49.751 --> 01:30:52.540
up next to the vehicle and so me and me and a couple of guys are like,
okay,

1465
01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:56.290
we got to fix this.
We fixed it.
And people you can,

1466
01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.510
if you felt you felt people relax.

1467
01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:01.990
And then my,

1468
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:06.640
my main concern was that's still our objective and we got to get to it.

1469
01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.210
So what's next?
And that's when I went looking for,

1470
01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:14.530
I'm not even sure who's in charge at this point because we had taken so much of

1471
01:31:14.531 --> 01:31:18.640
our leadership had been hurt.
The company sergeant major,
two of the warrants,

1472
01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:23.920
uh,
you know,
and we had,
when that Zettel Meyer got hit,
um,
you know,
it,
it,

1473
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:28.330
it wounded a bunch of guys and you know,
we had Afghans with us,

1474
01:31:28.331 --> 01:31:31.980
we had some Americans with us.
Um,
uh,

1475
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:35.440
what do you call the national guard?
I think there were National Guard,
uh,

1476
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.920
mentors for the Afghans are with us.
Yep.
And,
um,

1477
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.660
my biggest disappointment from that day,

1478
01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:45.610
and I know I'm going to catch some,

1479
01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:48.550
I might catch some shit from some guys that were there.

1480
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.750
<v 2>We didn't take our objective to this day.</v>

1482
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.433
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1483
01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:01.030
<v 2>2016,
you know,
this is 10 years later,
almost in September,</v>

1484
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:04.660
it'll be 10 years.
And to this day I'm like,
fuck,
we didn't take her.

1485
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.520
We didn't take or objective.

1486
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:14.240
<v 0>Yeah.
A part of that,
you know,
and,</v>

1487
01:32:14.241 --> 01:32:18.540
and,
and for one thing,
when I,
when I was reading that in,

1488
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:24.080
I mean obviously it's just emotional moment and I knew that you just had to

1489
01:32:24.081 --> 01:32:26.900
detach from the emotion.
I use that term all the time.
Yeah.

1490
01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:30.380
You got to just detach from it and you gotta be conscious of that.

1491
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:34.070
So like folks that are listening that are thinking,
how do you do that?

1492
01:32:34.071 --> 01:32:36.350
That's how you do it.
You cannot,
you got,

1493
01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:41.351
when you feel the emotions starting to override your logic and your ability to

1494
01:32:42.381 --> 01:32:44.750
do your duty,
that's what you have to do.
You have to go,
okay,

1495
01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:49.010
I've got to detach from those emotions and I've got to do my job now.
Yeah.

1496
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:52.540
<v 2>In that moment,
like I actually don't remember,</v>

1497
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:56.920
like I didn't really have any feelings.
You know,

1498
01:32:57.190 --> 01:33:00.910
I get more feeling now out of it.
Listening to you read it.
Yep.
Cause that

1499
01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:06.430
starting with,
especially when Tj got,
got hurt,
you know,

1500
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:11.530
that's our workspace.
Yep.
Like you know,
here we're in an office.

1501
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:16.030
You can see people typing doors,
opening,
closing.

1502
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:19.780
That's the normal sound and vibe of this workspace.

1503
01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:25.630
We had burning vehicles,
we had dead dead soldiers,
we had wounded soldiers.

1504
01:33:25.631 --> 01:33:28.810
We had about 15 wounded by this point.
Um,

1505
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.530
we had air support reining in,
we had artillery support,
reining in.

1506
01:33:32.531 --> 01:33:34.860
We had enemy mortars coming down.
And you know,

1507
01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.600
that's the norm.

1508
01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.020
The day don't like when you sign up to be a navy seal.

1509
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:43.330
They don't hide the fact that you might get in gunfights.

1510
01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.950
It's like the first thing you read,

1511
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:48.820
it's in big bold black letters you're going to,
you could get killed.

1512
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.230
It's not in the small print at the bottom of the contract,
you know,

1513
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.630
clause B of section four.
It's right there.

1514
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:59.140
That's what you signed up for.
So,

1515
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:00.680
<v 3>okay,</v>

1516
01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.830
<v 2>it's not abnormal for these things to be happening,</v>

1517
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:08.920
which you have to do is accept that they happened and carry on with the job.

1518
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:14.030
And in that moment,
I remember I said,
sorry Bro,
because I was,
it was almost,

1519
01:34:14.031 --> 01:34:17.810
I was on,
I was actually probably felt more like,
hey man,
sorry,

1520
01:34:17.811 --> 01:34:22.700
you're out of the game because it's going to get exciting from here.
You know,

1521
01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.740
I,
I was a fallen soldier in combat to me is,

1522
01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:33.970
especially at volunteer,
we weren't drafted.
Did anyone make you join the navy?
No.

1523
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.650
No.
I,
I fought with my parents to get into the army.
Yup.

1524
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:43.460
I,
I would've,
I would've fist I would've fought 10 of my best friends.

1525
01:34:43.461 --> 01:34:48.461
They get that job as that sniper team leader and there was nowhere else I wanted

1526
01:34:48.471 --> 01:34:53.060
to be.
And if soldier falling in combat doing the job,

1527
01:34:53.061 --> 01:34:56.060
he chose in a plus,
it's not of our choosing.

1528
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:58.280
Don't ever feel

1529
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:00.380
<v 0>sorry for me because I went to Afghanistan,
believe me,</v>

1530
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:03.530
I wanted to be there and for him to fall.

1531
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.693
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1532
01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:08.000
<v 0>I get in a lot of shit by some people,
but that's,</v>

1533
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:13.001
it's one of the greatest things a soldier can do is the fall for it with his

1534
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:16.540
friends doing the job that,

1535
01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:20.570
that he chose or she chose and uh,
it's,

1536
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:26.370
I,
I get in shit sometimes because I think like this,
well,
it's,

1537
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.880
I think the reason that is,

1538
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:32.910
is because it's so hard for people that don't know what that Brotherhood is

1539
01:35:33.971 --> 01:35:37.540
like.
They don't know what it's like to want to do that.

1540
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.630
They don't understand that that's,

1541
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:44.420
that's the soldier in the child.

1542
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:46.520
That's the way you've wanted to be your whole life.

1543
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:50.000
That's the way I wanted to be my whole life.
So to,
for these things to happen is,

1544
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.373
is

1545
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:57.480
it's like feeling bad for an MMA fighter cause they got punched in the face.

1546
01:35:57.570 --> 01:36:02.230
Yeah.
There you go.
Up for it.
You signed up for it.
It knows guys,
you know,
they,

1547
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:05.750
they're there to fight and the military you're there to fight.
Yeah.

1548
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:10.290
And a byproduct of fighting in this situation can be injury.

1549
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:15.090
It can be death.
And like you said,
it's what we all signed up for.

1550
01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:21.120
And you know,
going back to the situation here,

1551
01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.270
one of the things that you talked about,

1552
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:27.840
the fact that you guys didn't secure your objective and one of the reasons that

1553
01:36:27.841 --> 01:36:32.310
you didn't secure your objective the next day is because you had another

1554
01:36:32.311 --> 01:36:36.240
friendly fire incident.
Yeah.
And this is awful.
And,
and you know,

1555
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:41.290
the book that I wrote a with Lafe starts off with,
with,

1556
01:36:41.291 --> 01:36:42.900
with the front of the fire scenario happening.

1557
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.290
And I wish I could explain to civilians.

1558
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.320
It's really hard for people to understand how these things happen.

1559
01:36:49.321 --> 01:36:52.140
I mean we've already talked about it.
What,
two times in this book,

1560
01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:56.100
here's another one.
Uh,
[inaudible] come in,

1561
01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.760
you're your beer basically like half awake,
trying to get,

1562
01:36:59.761 --> 01:37:03.150
trying to get a little bit of sleep.
Yeah.
And all of a sudden,
you know,

1563
01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:04.980
you hear the gunfire,
you hear things happening.

1564
01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.300
All of a sudden you hear an eight,

1565
01:37:06.301 --> 01:37:10.650
10 bursts go and cash your,
your,

1566
01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:15.030
your teammate cash.
He's like,
you're not going to believe this.

1567
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:17.640
But I think he just strafed our own guys.

1568
01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:21.380
Strafed is when you fire machine gun canons,

1569
01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.760
weapon fires from an aircraft.

1570
01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.280
And sure enough,
30 soldiers,

1571
01:37:29.281 --> 01:37:33.690
more than 30 soldiers were injured.
Yeah.
And one was killed.
And by the way,

1572
01:37:33.691 --> 01:37:36.060
the one that was killed was private.
Mark Graham,

1573
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:40.410
who was a Olympic spreader for Canada in 1992 in Barcelona.

1574
01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.433
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:49.640
<v 0>I mean it's a nightmare.
It was a nightmare.
It was,</v>

1576
01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.860
it was such a,
I even got mad at cash at first cause I was like,

1577
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v 2>because I heard it and you know that Brat that it's actually a nice feeling</v>

1578
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:03.210
until that happens.

1579
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.450
And that one sounded weird cause like I was half a week and we,
and,

1580
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:11.970
and I,
you know,
they were doing strafing runs across,
cause we were on each,

1581
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:15.000
on each side of the Argan Dob River.
So,
you know,

1582
01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:19.500
there's a bit of distance and that one and like,
like that was real close.

1583
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.180
That's kind of weird.
And I'm trying to just,
you know,
we wake up and cash is,

1584
01:38:24.181 --> 01:38:27.990
yeah,
they hit the,
hit us.
I go,
what the,
what are you talking about?

1585
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:32.760
Why would he and I looked down from our sniper position to where the vehicles

1586
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:37.140
were and that's what exactly what had happened.
And on my mind,

1587
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:41.760
I know what an eight,
10 strike does.
I'm like,
oh my God,
he killed all my friends.

1588
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:43.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1589
01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:48.490
<v 2>And then through the dust.
And so right away I'm like,
okay,
well if I'm the enemy,</v>

1590
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:53.230
I know what I would do.
D you know,
sound the bugles boys were attacking,

1591
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:55.990
they didn't do that.
I,

1592
01:38:56.530 --> 01:39:00.430
my theory is they had already left for the after the gun fight the day before.

1593
01:39:00.431 --> 01:39:05.431
And so we re reorientate all our focus to the front to keep an eye on the enemy.

1594
01:39:06.251 --> 01:39:09.150
And I,
and I can't help but look down,
we had a,

1595
01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.200
a GTF a sniper team directly to our left and they left their a spotters in place

1596
01:39:17.021 --> 01:39:21.010
and the rest of them ran down with their medical kits and uh,

1597
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.520
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1598
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.700
<v 2>And when they were walking away,
eventually the,
the,
the team,
you know,</v>

1599
01:39:25.701 --> 01:39:30.140
four guys walk away with a body bag and I'm like,
oh,
okay,

1600
01:39:30.141 --> 01:39:34.860
that's it.
And then the,
you know,
the radio,
you know,
then,

1601
01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:39.620
then it's like,
yeah,
we're at 10,
10 wounded,
okay.
To 12.
Okay.
17 is 21.

1602
01:39:39.621 --> 01:39:43.640
And then I think we ended up at about 34,
35 or so,

1603
01:39:43.641 --> 01:39:47.660
and the entire leadership of the company is wiped out,
uh,

1604
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:52.130
with injury.
And,
uh,
and that's it.

1605
01:39:52.190 --> 01:39:54.360
That company is now combat ineffective.
Yeah.

1606
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.420
Which is the idea here that in the modern day you don't hear that very often.

1607
01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:02.960
Combat effective meaning that they can no longer perform their duties and you

1608
01:40:02.961 --> 01:40:05.390
just don't hear that.
They just didn't have enough bodies left.

1609
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.030
Like they just didn't have enough soldiers that were still functioning.

1610
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:11.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1611
01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:16.930
<v 2>And
you know,</v>

1612
01:40:16.931 --> 01:40:21.931
we went to Afghanistan in 2002 with a op was that Anaconda I believe we sent a

1613
01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.070
battalion of,
of Canadian soldiers with,
um,

1614
01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:31.630
and that's where the Canadian snipers set the new record beating Carlos half

1615
01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:34.330
Kochs that had stood since Vietnam.
And um,

1616
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:40.290
but part of that mission was we lost four guys to in American have 16 and then

1617
01:40:40.481 --> 01:40:43.660
this happened and people give,

1618
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:46.780
give a lot of shit to the American Air Force or,
or aircraft

1619
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:52.930
mistakes happen.
We almost got lit up by our own guys at the,

1620
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.300
of the assault.
You know,
we didn't talk about it,

1621
01:40:55.301 --> 01:40:57.640
but I had to radio in and weave and remind them,
hey guys,

1622
01:40:57.641 --> 01:41:01.180
we're coming in from your flank.
You've looked through thermal.

1623
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:05.890
I've looked through thermal to guys like us look anything like bad guys looking

1624
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.880
in through thermal.
I don't know how it happens.
Yeah.

1625
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:11.380
But guys get so amped up and they're so ready to kill something.

1626
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:14.320
You just don't want it to be you.
In Ramadi,

1627
01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:19.321
there was incidents where Humvees engaged other Humvees,

1628
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:23.950
right?
Because the enemy does it.
He looks like anything like a Humvee,

1629
01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:26.680
no more distinctive vehicle in the world.
In a home,
right?
Yeah.

1630
01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:29.830
Especially when you're in the military and,
but that's to your point,

1631
01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:35.010
that's the level of confusion and mayhem and chaos that happens.

1632
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:39.790
And just the mentality of guys when they're scared and all of a sudden they see

1633
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:43.870
muzzle flash and okay,
you know what?
Boom,
oh,
I see something over there.

1634
01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:47.980
Engage everything looks like an every shovel in someone's hand.

1635
01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:48.814
Looks like an eight k.

1636
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:54.640
So I don't lay any blame on the American pilot that did this.

1637
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.850
He was doing the job he was there to do and,
and,

1638
01:41:59.851 --> 01:42:04.851
and someone told them to do something and they key cued off the wrong puff of

1639
01:42:05.561 --> 01:42:09.910
smoke.
And that's what happened.
You know,
it was just a,
literally,

1640
01:42:09.911 --> 01:42:13.630
it was one of those,
it was one of those,

1641
01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:19.120
each little action led to it.
Right.
You know,
from mark lighting the,

1642
01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:21.490
the garbage fire to,

1643
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.870
to him coming over the mountain and the,
and the,
and the son is in his eyes.

1644
01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:29.180
Amen.
Shit happens.

1645
01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:32.830
A bunch of small mistakes that compound and not even mistakes.

1646
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:36.040
A bunch of situational actions.
Yeah.

1647
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:39.310
The compound in to a tragic situation.

1648
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:44.910
But when you consider what a strafing run from an eight 10 can do for us to only

1649
01:42:45.581 --> 01:42:50.080
have one killed is amazing,
is incredible.
And,

1650
01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.130
and only,
you know,
have those 30 something wounded.

1651
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:57.520
I might not have the right number,
but if I understand correctly,

1652
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:01.390
maybe a dozen of them had to retire due to their injuries.

1653
01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.750
Maybe crazy.
Yeah.

1654
01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.570
So you guys continue doing sniper operations.

1655
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:12.610
You guys continue.

1656
01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:14.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1657
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:17.010
<v 2>Going on missions,
you support NSF,
you support others,</v>

1658
01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.500
lots of really solid missions.

1659
01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.680
And now you're out on another operation.

1660
01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:27.810
You're patrolling through a village.

1661
01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:32.850
And again,
it's your,
your team that you've been with the whole time.

1662
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.710
You're following cache your boy cash.
Hmm.

1663
01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.510
And I'm going to go to the book here.
Once he was about 10 meters ahead,

1664
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:45.630
I turned and took my first step forward.

1665
01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:48.173
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1666
01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:52.820
<v 2>my right foot touch the ground at a orange fireball</v>

1667
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.710
<v 0>soared across my face.</v>

1668
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:58.730
I didn't hear a sound for a few seconds.

1669
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.930
I felt weightless as if I was suspended in fit in space.

1670
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.520
The next thing I knew,
I was on the ground.
My ears,

1671
01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:10.040
nose and mouth tasted like mud

1672
01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:15.800
and that's when the pain hit the pain so intense that it completely overwhelmed

1673
01:44:15.801 --> 01:44:20.540
my body and my silence.
I started punching the ground and screaming,

1674
01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.310
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1675
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:26.990
It was the only time in my life I've ever uttered anything religious.

1676
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:33.100
The blast was so powerful that he had knocked cash down and I saw him in the

1677
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:37.850
dirt up ahead of me for a few seconds.
I couldn't see barrier.
Gord,

1678
01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.660
they'd probably done what good snipers are supposed to do upon hearing the

1679
01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:44.930
explosion run for cover and prepare for an ambush.

1680
01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:48.860
A few seconds later,
once they realized what had happened,

1681
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.990
they came running back towards me.

1682
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:59.770
So there it is.
Did you know,
did you know it was an id?

1683
01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:04.330
Um,
not,

1684
01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:13.180
could been.
RPG can be somebody for those either.
Don't know.
You don't know.

1685
01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.340
Big booms are going off.

1686
01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:20.380
<v 2>I,
I didn't hear anything.
Right.
Like I said,
like the,
the,
you,</v>

1687
01:45:20.381 --> 01:45:23.750
you're not going to hear the one that gets you from,
in my case it was real,

1688
01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.790
but my hearing was fine.
There's no ringing.
There was no,
and I've read,

1689
01:45:28.791 --> 01:45:33.140
um,
colonel,
um,
help me out.

1690
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.440
He wrote on killing.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Anyway,

1691
01:45:36.441 --> 01:45:40.150
so I know your name.
I just,
I just forget it right now.
Uh,

1692
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:44.300
and he's talks about that and his other book on combat.
Yeah,
the little audible,

1693
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.110
the body will shut it off and the split second.
But anyway,

1694
01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:54.200
I knew I'd done something,
something bad had happened once.
I,

1695
01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:58.280
you know,
my weapon was gone.
You know,
my night vision is gone.
Right.

1696
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.790
And the pain was so bad.
And you know,

1697
01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:06.800
it technically was an IED though under the technical definition,
right?

1698
01:46:06.801 --> 01:46:10.960
Cause it was an anti personal landmine on top of a mortar bomb.

1699
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.390
Technically we you and I know that's an IED,

1700
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:19.940
but it's really to conventional munitions put together and it did exactly what

1701
01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:20.870
it was supposed to do.

1702
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:23.760
<v 1>You know?
Um,</v>

1703
01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:29.050
<v 0>it just,
uh,
it's one of those,</v>

1704
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.120
<v 2>it's one of those things of war where there's no rhyme or reason about who's</v>

1705
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:36.680
going to get what or when or where.

1706
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:39.890
Cause everyone else in your patrol just walked over it.
I was the last guy,

1707
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.690
<v 0>I remember the first time,
first time I was ever getting shot,</v>

1708
01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:49.230
I was in these and I'm going over a bridge in Baghdad.

1709
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:52.880
And again,
this is going back to what you were talking about liquid.

1710
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:55.680
You don't really know what's Kombat's like.
Yeah.

1711
01:46:55.950 --> 01:47:00.120
And I'm looking up ahead of me at the Humvee ahead of me and I see these,

1712
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:03.960
like someone's throwing cigarettes out the window and I go,

1713
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:09.150
who the hell is smoking?
We don't even have any like who's smoking?
Right.

1714
01:47:09.151 --> 01:47:12.360
And how are they smoking a thousand cigarettes and smoking so many cigarettes

1715
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:14.820
right now.
And then why are there smoke?
Who wait,

1716
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:18.180
why are these things spark and when they hit the the ground over there and why

1717
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:21.960
is there sparks Oh,
okay.
Newsflash,

1718
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:25.410
we're getting shot at or under effective fire.
Yeah.
And uh,

1719
01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.820
it's one of those things,

1720
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:33.230
but my point is that you don't always know what,
what's happening.
And you know,

1721
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:35.430
in the urban environment you didn't know where shots were coming for.

1722
01:47:35.431 --> 01:47:37.440
You get your like rounds,
we'll be going over head.

1723
01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:39.920
You could not tell where they were coming from.
Yeah.
You know,

1724
01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.030
if they're hitting something,
you can kind of get a general idea,

1725
01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:46.860
but you don't always know what's happening.
And all right,

1726
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:52.290
so now going back to the book here,
my mates were all around me.

1727
01:47:52.291 --> 01:47:53.124
Now

1728
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:59.690
the next hour was the longest of my life.
I was in absolute agony,

1729
01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:02.360
agony at trying hard to stay positive.

1730
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:07.510
I was also trying hard not to think about the possibility of bleeding out with

1731
01:48:08.811 --> 01:48:13.130
each passing minute.
I was growing weaker and weaker.
Every time I close my eyes,

1732
01:48:13.131 --> 01:48:17.030
it was harder to open them again.
I knew that if I lost consciousness,

1733
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:21.080
it was over bearing Gord.
We're standing over me.

1734
01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:25.220
Do you think I'm going to make it?
I ask Gord,

1735
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:30.650
of course you gotta make it never give up bro.
You know that

1736
01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.430
and you guys hadn't been to t triple c,
none of us.
Ah,

1737
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:44.750
so for those that you don't know,

1738
01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:48.410
there's something called t triple c tactical combat casualty care.

1739
01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.430
It's a very short course.
You had to like maybe a week,

1740
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:56.720
it's two days,
maybe three days because all the,

1741
01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.890
all they teach you is how to keep somebody alive when this stuff happens.

1742
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.250
That's what the goal is.
And it doesn't take a super amount of knowledge.

1743
01:49:04.251 --> 01:49:07.640
It takes some,
some concepts.
Number one,

1744
01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:11.930
stop the bleeding and,
but none of your guys had been to it,

1745
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:13.520
but they still saved your life.

1746
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:20.020
<v 2>I mean,
between Barry Gordon,
I
like we're all experienced,</v>

1747
01:49:20.021 --> 01:49:24.850
operate,
right?
And uh,
we still have enough first aid training.
You know,

1748
01:49:24.851 --> 01:49:27.740
the first thing they did is slapped the tourniquets on there.
You go at the,

1749
01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:31.570
at the arteries in my thighs and um,

1750
01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:36.580
and then they did their best from there and were snipers were not medics.

1751
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:41.470
And we don't bring as awesome as medics are there kind of in the way when you're

1752
01:49:41.471 --> 01:49:44.290
on a sneaky,
sneaky mission,
you know?
Yeah.
That was what we,

1753
01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:48.170
that's how we classified our missions.
If they were sneaky,
sneaky

1754
01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:51.730
<v 0>years,
really sneaky.
Sneaky.
If we're really sneaky,</v>

1755
01:49:51.731 --> 01:49:53.410
sneaky with someone's going to have a bad day.

1756
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:57.130
And this one was a middle sneaky and,
and,
and uh,

1757
01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.900
we were in a spot where there is no Lz.
You're not getting a vehicle in there.

1758
01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.510
Um,
you know,

1759
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:08.050
and the closest medic was a 12,

1760
01:50:08.051 --> 01:50:12.730
1500 meters away on foot at night through an Afghan village.

1761
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.640
Ours took them an hour.

1762
01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:20.140
The recky platoon just throwing this out there that they just gave,

1763
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:23.860
they just didn't even wait for orders.
They are just common.
I love those guys.

1764
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:26.710
That's why,
that's why I knew I had to say I love those guys.

1765
01:50:26.711 --> 01:50:30.190
Everyone at any one of them that listens.
I love those guys.

1766
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:36.190
100%.
I'd do anything for them.
So

1767
01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:41.200
they get you,
they do get you out.
Yep.
Day.

1768
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:46.570
They put the phone in your hand before you go into surgery.
Right.

1769
01:50:46.571 --> 01:50:47.680
So we're back in Canda,

1770
01:50:47.690 --> 01:50:52.420
her at the hospital and someone hands me a phone and uh,

1771
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:57.370
I forget how it even went.
Like I was on a lot of drugs by this point.

1772
01:50:58.090 --> 01:51:01.630
One thing I will get wounded is get,
do a lot of good drugs.
Um,

1773
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:05.800
here's what you told your dad.
Yeah,
they got me dad,
the Taliban,

1774
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:10.810
but I'm alive going into surgery.
I'm going to get through this.

1775
01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:11.733
Don't worry.

1776
01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:18.300
I kind of want to compliment you right now.
Hmm.

1777
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.520
Because you always hear of an up three Scully complimenting like all my buddies,

1778
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:28.430
anybody had no that got wounded.
They're like,
hey,
don't worry about it.

1779
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:30.800
I would be okay.
Yeah.
And

1780
01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.010
at the same time

1781
01:51:36.230 --> 01:51:39.980
you called your dad like dad wounded up,
go to the surgery.
Don't worry about,

1782
01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:45.850
you know,
uh,
that's,
that's all good.
Actually,
what's funny is Mikey Monsoor,

1783
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:50.890
who was one of my guys got killed in Ramadi and I mean,

1784
01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:56.140
they were in grueling sustained combat every single day.

1785
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.320
Firefights I mean,
he went Winchester on his,

1786
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:07.670
on his heavy machine gun so many times that I don't even know.

1787
01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:12.130
Like one time I,
I was,
went to visit him in their campus.

1788
01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:15.920
I was on the other side of town,
Winchester beans,
completely out of Ammo,
sorry,

1789
01:52:15.921 --> 01:52:18.620
Winchester be drought ammo.
So I went to see,

1790
01:52:18.621 --> 01:52:20.480
I went to his camp pretty early in deployment,

1791
01:52:20.481 --> 01:52:22.910
maybe three or four weeks in deployment.

1792
01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.910
And I went over to their camp to see how things were going.

1793
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:31.670
And someone's like,
oh,
go check out the video that Mike he made.
And I go,
okay,

1794
01:52:31.671 --> 01:52:36.380
cool.
And Mike,
he shows me this video and it's like a firefight happening.

1795
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:37.820
Yeah.
And he's filming,

1796
01:52:37.821 --> 01:52:41.060
he's putting to the stick in the camera up above the the wall.

1797
01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:43.070
And then he turns it back on himself and he,

1798
01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:46.310
and he says the name of the part town that they were fighting in,

1799
01:52:46.311 --> 01:52:50.900
what's called them a lob district.
It might be towards the camera at himself.

1800
01:52:50.901 --> 01:52:52.340
And he goes,
it's the moon.

1801
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.170
And so I'm looking at him laughing and then,
you know,

1802
01:52:57.171 --> 01:53:01.970
me being Mr professional and I go,
hey man,
and he's a new guy,
right.
And,
um,

1803
01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:04.130
you know,
Jocko,
you know,
I'm sorry,
go.
Hey Man,

1804
01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.430
what are you doing filming when there's a firefight going on.

1805
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:09.830
I know you need to get your gun up.
Like I don't want to see this again.

1806
01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:12.260
And he's like,
hey,
sorry sir.

1807
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.520
But I was Winchester and I go,
all right man.

1808
01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:19.950
That's all you got left be the history of be the document guy.

1809
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:25.330
And just like in my opinion to go Winchester for an for a seal if he's anything

1810
01:53:25.501 --> 01:53:29.670
like,
uh,
like our machine gunners.
Yeah.
That's pretty tough to do.
Oh yeah.

1811
01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:33.960
It's not like Mike,
he wasn't carrying a tone around.
Like I said,

1812
01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:37.520
my point of telling this story was that,
you know,

1813
01:53:37.521 --> 01:53:41.320
this was happening on a fairly regular basis.
Definitely firefighter.

1814
01:53:41.321 --> 01:53:43.000
He wasn't going Winchester all the time,
but he didn't know.

1815
01:53:43.001 --> 01:53:46.960
But I'm just saying like old times and he was in,

1816
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:51.740
you know,
almost daily firefighters.
Right.
I remember that.

1817
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.800
This is an actual number.
So the first 24 operations that,

1818
01:53:56.801 --> 01:54:01.470
that element went on in a row.
They got into a firefight in the city.
Yeah.

1819
01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:04.090
And then they had one where they didn't and then they went right back to it

1820
01:54:04.091 --> 01:54:08.350
again.
So they were getting a lot of firefights and in a lot of danger.
And,

1821
01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:12.250
um,
when we got home,
when I got home,
but I,

1822
01:54:12.251 --> 01:54:14.560
and I got to know his family a little bit,
you know,
his,

1823
01:54:14.770 --> 01:54:17.770
his family was saying that when he'd call,
they'd be like,

1824
01:54:17.771 --> 01:54:19.820
what are you doing over there?
And he'd say,
Oh,
we're,

1825
01:54:19.821 --> 01:54:24.070
we're just training some Iraqi soldiers.
Yeah.
We're just on base.
It just,

1826
01:54:24.071 --> 01:54:28.420
you know,
don't worry about anything.
It's just fine.
Typical combat soldiers,

1827
01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.420
right.
Stories to the family.
Typical bad ass.

1828
01:54:33.090 --> 01:54:37.620
So that reminds me if you,
uh,
don't worry about it yet,
but it just got blown up.

1829
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.130
Yeah.
Um,
then

1830
01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:46.200
here we go.
I woke up with a doctor looming over me,

1831
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.630
took a few moments for the anesthetics to wear off and for me to remember where

1832
01:54:51.631 --> 01:54:56.610
I was and what was going on.
Then it came back to me in a rush.

1833
01:54:56.730 --> 01:54:59.520
The mission,
the landmine,
the pain,
the surgery,

1834
01:55:01.050 --> 01:55:03.930
the surgeon standing by my bed,
put it to me bluntly.

1835
01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.600
I had to cut off both your feet.

1836
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:13.003
Boom.

1837
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:19.850
I believe earlier we were talking about irreversible situations.

1838
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.530
Yup.
And here you were,

1839
01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:27.550
was that real to you at that time

1840
01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.510
or were you basically,
hey,
I'm happy I'm alive.

1841
01:55:35.490 --> 01:55:40.000
I got to see your buddy that
got blown up.
Yeah.

1842
01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:44.160
And uh,
and actually you can get bonus.

1843
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:47.310
<v 2>Got Shot.
And um,
anyways,</v>

1844
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:51.940
one of my buddies was talking to him and he's like,
Bro,
man,
um,

1845
01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.360
I'm really sorry about,
you know,
he,
cause he lost his leg.
He was wrong,
man,

1846
01:55:55.361 --> 01:56:00.030
I'm really sorry about your leg,
you know,
and he goes,
fuck my leg.

1847
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:05.850
I'm happy to be alive.
And I gotta be honest,
I didn't think that,

1848
01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:10.170
yeah,
I'm soldiering has done on your feet.

1849
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:16.020
And I immediately went into defensive mode.
I,
um,

1850
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:18.960
half my brain said,

1851
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:23.430
you tell that fucking guy to go back and get that one of the feet

1852
01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:25.890
and put it back.

1853
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:30.990
And the other half is saying he's a pro.

1854
01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:35.940
He knows what he's doing.
If he took it,
cause we knew one was gone on the scene,

1855
01:56:35.941 --> 01:56:38.340
that was the one that didn't needed the device.

1856
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:40.570
The landmine did exactly what it's supposed to do.
It took,

1857
01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:44.640
blew my foot off the mortar bombs,
shredded my other foot.

1858
01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:47.310
And on the scene,

1859
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:51.480
I remember as I was getting put onto the stretcher and getting put onto the

1860
01:56:51.481 --> 01:56:52.051
ambulance,

1861
01:56:52.051 --> 01:56:56.970
that was finally able to get to us because they literally plowed a road to me

1862
01:56:56.971 --> 01:57:01.800
with a combat bulldozer and had the ambulance behind it.
Um,

1863
01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:05.400
the medic from Ricky platoon and said,
hey man,
your left foot,

1864
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:09.800
we got it back into place.
So it looks like it might be okay.
So,
uh,

1865
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.660
but your right foot's gone.
And I was like,
okay,
whatever.
And again,

1866
01:57:12.661 --> 01:57:17.370
at this point I'm like so out of it.
So when I woke up and he says,
yeah,
you know,

1867
01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:21.150
I had to take both feet.
Huh.
Hm.

1868
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:26.580
And,
and the,
in my mind I'm thinking like,
well,
how am I gonna,

1869
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:32.310
how am I going to do this job?
Okay.
And then,

1870
01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:34.910
so then I go into Def,
uh,
the,
you know,

1871
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:38.610
depending on who's manual you're reading or which doctor wrote it,

1872
01:57:38.611 --> 01:57:41.760
there's certain number of steps to a grieving.

1873
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:46.200
And they say losing a part of body part is like losing a family member or

1874
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:47.034
something.

1875
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:51.570
So now I'm dealing with two deaths in the family and the first step is always

1876
01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:56.070
denial and you know,
and I'm like,
oh,
it was 2007,

1877
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:58.650
you know how awesome,
you know,
guys are going to be jealous.

1878
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:02.100
I had my legs blown off.
I'm going to be like,
rob,
I'm going to be like astro boy,

1879
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:06.930
be flying around and shit,
I'll have like robocop legs or something.
It's cool.

1880
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:10.140
It's 2007.
Right?
Everything's digital.
Um,

1881
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:14.580
and I kind of,
whether it was the drugs and,

1882
01:58:14.581 --> 01:58:19.500
or the endorphins from going through all that,
and,
but for that first,

1883
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:25.710
until I was out of Kandahar,
that was my attitude,
you know,

1884
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.300
right up to the boys all came in to see me off.
Cause we went from,

1885
01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:33.000
so I think I spent another day in Kandahar.

1886
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:38.001
They flew me to bag room and then I flew to Kuwait and then from Kuwait on to

1887
01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:44.590
Germany.
Yeah.
But a Lanch to orchestra hall.
And so every,

1888
01:58:44.690 --> 01:58:49.050
every stop that we picked up wounded American servicemen.
And,
uh,
and,
uh,

1889
01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:54.070
I think there was one other Canadian,
but,
so I just,

1890
01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:58.150
you know,
that's how I felt.
Right.
And then,
and then once I was in Germany,

1891
01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.513
um,

1892
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.450
<v 1>okay.</v>

1893
01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:10.340
<v 2>I was just trying to deal with every day by day,
you know.
Um,
I just was,</v>

1894
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.931
you know,

1895
01:59:11.931 --> 01:59:15.860
they put me in a room with another guy who had been hit in an IED strike on a,

1896
01:59:15.861 --> 01:59:19.520
on a,
so a lav you,
you were saying Lav earlier.
So those are the Marine Corps.

1897
01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:23.120
The Marine Corps has an anachronism,
Lav.
So that's why I was calling it that.

1898
01:59:23.121 --> 01:59:27.730
But yeah,
it's,
so it's light armored vehicle.
And you guys in the army here,

1899
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:29.000
they're called strikers.
Yeah.

1900
01:59:29.150 --> 01:59:33.830
Except ours have turrets and I think yours has like remote 50 cals or something.

1901
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:37.820
They're all made in London,
Ontario,
Canada,
by the way.
Um,

1902
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:44.440
so yeah,
I was just trying to deal with each day as,
as it can't,
cause now I'm it,

1903
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:48.340
I've never,
there's no,
you can't,
there's no training for this.
Right.

1904
01:59:48.341 --> 01:59:50.050
And casualty simulation,

1905
01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:54.070
it stops once you're declared dead or evacuated.
Right.

1906
01:59:54.490 --> 01:59:56.860
So now I'm at a stage where I'm like,
okay,

1907
01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:59.750
I'm in a room with another Canadian dude,
um,

1908
02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:04.060
and an American Army hospital and uh,

1909
02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:06.790
I dunno what's next.

1910
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1911
02:00:09.890 --> 02:00:12.710
<v 2>And every time I'd look down there's no toes to wiggle.</v>

1912
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.730
<v 1>Yep.</v>

1913
02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:19.230
<v 2>It was just so I'm like,
okay,
well I'm just going to try and deal with this,</v>

1914
02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:21.720
just deal with it,
just deal with it,
just deal with it.

1915
02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:25.230
And I was in that mode at for for weeks.

1916
02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:27.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1917
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:29.320
<v 2>I W I,</v>

1918
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.600
I think I was waiting for a point where someone was going to give me my

1919
02:00:33.601 --> 02:00:36.390
diagnosis,
you know,
or my,

1920
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:41.490
the conclusion or like a prescription,
like,
okay,

1921
02:00:41.491 --> 02:00:42.750
here's what you're going to do now.

1922
02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.170
This is not just with your legs but with your life.
Yeah.

1923
02:00:46.410 --> 02:00:48.030
This is what's going to happen.
You're going to do this,

1924
02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:51.930
you're going to follow these steps and at the end you'll be deploying back to

1925
02:00:51.931 --> 02:00:55.950
Afghanistan,
which is how it was going in my mind,
you know,

1926
02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.750
I don't know what you're going to read next,

1927
02:00:57.751 --> 02:01:02.110
but I was convinced I'm going back out again.
Dan.
Huh?

1928
02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.170
That's it.
Like just,

1929
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.680
<v 1>okay.</v>

1930
02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.670
<v 2>That's it.
Whenever you know the navy or the army wants you to know something,</v>

1931
02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:13.810
they send you on course.
So you know I was on sniper course and then you go on,

1932
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:15.320
you're going to drive her chorus.

1933
02:01:15.321 --> 02:01:19.510
She go on tack tack to Combat Casualty Care Course t triple c.
So,

1934
02:01:19.511 --> 02:01:22.710
so as you're saying this,
that's actually the next portion.
Yeah,

1935
02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.580
I was going to look good.
Okay,
here you go.

1936
02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:27.190
Exactly what you were just about to get it from that point on,

1937
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.380
I made it my mission to learn to walk again.

1938
02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:31.750
I treated rehab like a military course.

1939
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:35.350
When the military wants a soldier to learn something,
they send them on a course.

1940
02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:39.650
So that's the approach I took with my rehab,
the mission mindset there.

1941
02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:47.250
But at the same time in now we start going into the fact that it was obvious

1942
02:01:47.861 --> 02:01:49.300
that the Miller Siri system,

1943
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:54.310
the military system just couldn't quite cope with my needs.
Sure.

1944
02:01:54.311 --> 02:01:57.370
I was offered help with all sorts of things from rehab to finding a home,

1945
02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:02.320
but no one truly understood the needs that are particular to a returning
soldier.

1946
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:04.660
And neither did I.

1947
02:02:05.790 --> 02:02:06.623
<v 3>No.</v>

1948
02:02:08.350 --> 02:02:12.130
<v 2>So you didn't even know.
I mean,
how do you know that?
But that's what I'm saying.</v>

1949
02:02:12.131 --> 02:02:15.640
How can,
you know?
There's no course description,
there's no course,

1950
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:16.900
there's no training,

1951
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:21.150
you know,

1952
02:02:21.150 --> 02:02:25.550
and our military medical system was like,

1953
02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.130
like the,
we have lots of medics,

1954
02:02:28.131 --> 02:02:33.110
we have doctors for things like sprained ankles and,
and,
and,
and,
and uh,

1955
02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:36.110
you know,
you hurt your back on a ruck march,
whatever,
whatever.

1956
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:41.240
Lots of guys and girls that do that.
No.
You know,
our physiotherapy,

1957
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:42.410
we've got physio therapists,

1958
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:46.010
but they've been dealing with tennis elbow and sprained ankles for 40 years.

1959
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:50.870
And it's no detriment to them.
It's not their fault.
It's,
um,

1960
02:02:51.170 --> 02:02:53.840
they've just,
that's the military that they were in.

1961
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:55.430
And you compare that in the book.

1962
02:02:55.431 --> 02:02:59.180
You talk about when you went to the center for intrepid in San Antonio and now

1963
02:02:59.181 --> 02:03:01.640
you had the American system,
which has been,

1964
02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:02.870
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1965
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:07.870
<v 2>unfortunately dealing with thousands and thousands and thousands of wounded</v>

1966
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:14.240
soldiers for at that point,
I guess for you guys,

1967
02:03:14.241 --> 02:03:18.170
about four or five years.
Okay.
Four or five years.
Well,
it was,
oh well,
oh seven.

1968
02:03:18.171 --> 02:03:21.730
Yeah,
I guess you guys started an old one right after that.
Yup.

1969
02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:22.970
I don't know whoever,

1970
02:03:22.971 --> 02:03:27.971
whenever the guys first went in after the towers dropped and so they had

1971
02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:30.710
experience and they have giant amount of money.

1972
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:34.490
I mean this is America and we do have a lot of money and they put a lot of money

1973
02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:36.280
into it.
And,

1974
02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.700
and at the same time you had some Canadian folks that were like,
oh,

1975
02:03:40.701 --> 02:03:44.270
we don't need that kind of stuff.
You don't need those kinds of things for rehab.

1976
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:47.930
Right,
right.
Well,
again,
I'm,
you know,
we have,

1977
02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.180
I'm trying to think of a correlation here,
but anyway,

1978
02:03:53.181 --> 02:03:56.240
we had these physiotherapists.
It's a trade in the military.

1979
02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:02.100
You're a military physiotherapist and your job is to rehab guys like me and I'm

1980
02:04:02.361 --> 02:04:03.950
telling you,
you can't do it.

1981
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:09.400
Or I'm telling you that you're failing and this is why.

1982
02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.580
So what your reaction is going to be?
Well,
I know how to do my job and I don't.

1983
02:04:13.581 --> 02:04:17.570
So I don't,
at the time I was furious.
In retrospect,

1984
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:22.900
they didn't know any better.
And that's why I started advocating so hard.
I,

1985
02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:27.050
I s I got,
cause I got home and I said this is what we got to do.

1986
02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:30.230
There's not that many guys like me coming home.
I mean yeah,

1987
02:04:30.231 --> 02:04:33.500
there's a lot more than there were last year because we're actually at war.

1988
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:37.950
The Center for the intrepid,
Walter Reed and I believe one here.

1989
02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:42.951
The naval medical is medical center about bow and there's Bethesda as well.

1990
02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:46.980
So,
uh,
well I've heard of three San Antonio,

1991
02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:49.290
Walter Reed and the one here.
Those are the biggies.

1992
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:53.610
Those are the ones where most of the traumatic injuries have been going from,

1993
02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:56.160
from the,
from,
from you guys.
So I said,

1994
02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.840
let's start sending a pair of physiotherapists down with like for every

1995
02:05:00.841 --> 02:05:04.380
physiotherapist we send down or for every two casualties we send down,

1996
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:09.800
let's send down one of our physiotherapist and six months that physiotherapist

1997
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:13.170
will get more experience dealing with more injuries at,

1998
02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.880
with more patients than they could ever hope for.
Onbase.

1999
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:19.440
Petawawa where two brigade is,

2000
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:23.460
cause we're talking the difference between a couple of dozen soldiers getting

2001
02:05:23.461 --> 02:05:23.940
hurt,

2002
02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:28.940
playing rugby or whatever or ruck marching versus actually uh yeah,

2003
02:05:29.581 --> 02:05:34.581
like a parade of guys get who are getting smashed in IED strikes and you know,

2004
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.620
whatever was happening.
You know,

2005
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:41.880
I was standing there and the guy who ran Antonio at the San Antonio at the time

2006
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:46.350
was,
he was in Greenbrae physiotherapists,

2007
02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:49.500
so I don't know if he was one and then the other or how it worked.

2008
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:52.290
But so he's the lead physical therapist.

2009
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:54.900
And I remember this marine walked in to the,

2010
02:05:54.901 --> 02:05:58.440
to the room and he had both legs gone above the knee.

2011
02:05:58.470 --> 02:06:02.350
So he's on the taller leg,
prosthetics and I,

2012
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.740
and he was blinded by it cause he had been burned or whatever.
And the,

2013
02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:11.660
and this guy,
he's in full uniform,
he likes screams the guy's name,

2014
02:06:11.661 --> 02:06:16.020
he's like Jones.
And he tackles him and they start wrestling.
And I'm like,

2015
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:20.400
yeah,
I want that.
Because the hospital I was in,

2016
02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:24.780
and again,
no offense to the hospital,
I got great medical care

2017
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:31.500
for the standard,
right to their capability,
their capabilities at that time.

2018
02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:33.780
And it's not like it was bad,

2019
02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:39.030
but it wasn't what would have been best for me.
Me being a soldier.

2020
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:39.870
So I'm like,

2021
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:43.980
cause I'm in the hospital where it's knee and hip replacements and amputations

2022
02:06:43.981 --> 02:06:47.760
from diabetes.
So it was a lot of older people.
Um,

2023
02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.000
I was probably one of the youngest people in the hospital at 30.

2024
02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.210
I was definitely in the best shape.
You know,

2025
02:06:54.211 --> 02:06:57.090
like I remember the first physiotherapy session,

2026
02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:02.250
she hands me a four pound beanbag weight with a strap on it.
And she says,

2027
02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:06.840
oh a strap that around your leg and you know,
try and do like,
you know,
maybe,

2028
02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.940
maybe 15 or 20 a leg raises if you think you can.
And I'm like,

2029
02:07:13.770 --> 02:07:18.120
where's the squat rack?
So I strapped,
I'm like four pounds,

2030
02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:21.570
is that enough?
And she's like,
Oh yeah,
we don't want to start too hard.

2031
02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:25.270
Nice sweet lady,
great person.
I loved her the best.
She can,

2032
02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:28.020
she knows she's doing what she knows.

2033
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:32.880
I strapped the thing to my stump and I started doing leg raises and she comes

2034
02:07:32.881 --> 02:07:36.100
back like 10 minutes later.
She's like,
so how many did you get done?
I'm like,

2035
02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:41.560
I don't know,
maybe 250.
Right?
She's like,
Oh,

2036
02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:45.910
oh.
And I'm like,
yeah,
like I'm,
I'm in,
I'm in shape.

2037
02:07:45.911 --> 02:07:49.030
It was just meat and bone smashed.
Like,
I don't have any other injuries here,

2038
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:51.670
but dare at San Antonio,

2039
02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:56.650
the lead therapist is tackling and wrestling with a blind legless marine.

2040
02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.600
And I'm like,
that's what I need.

2041
02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:04.150
I need to be around soldiers and people who know how I think and uh,

2042
02:08:04.151 --> 02:08:08.750
I can't help again and I'm not trying to criticize or,
or,

2043
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:11.500
or be overly,
um,

2044
02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.890
detrimental to the results of what came.

2045
02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:19.930
But imagine if I had had that treatment.
What,

2046
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:22.990
you know,
people would say,
oh,
Jody,
you did fine.
You did great.

2047
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:26.140
You're the poster boy.
Imagine if I had been in San Antonio,

2048
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:32.230
you know,
where could have eight faster,
you think not,
well,

2049
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:35.920
the level of expectation where I was was very,
very low.

2050
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:40.290
So they didn't like,
so if I had been at San Antonio,
they'd be like,
no,
no,

2051
02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.660
you will be walking by March.
You will do this and you,

2052
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:47.920
whereas where I was,
because that's how they do it.
That's like,

2053
02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:50.490
well we'll see where you're at.
You know,
and this and that and that.

2054
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:55.420
And there was no,
there's no one for me to mentor under or be,

2055
02:08:55.421 --> 02:08:58.480
you know,
like there's no one to be compared to or to be comparative.

2056
02:08:58.481 --> 02:08:59.320
Look at this guy over here.

2057
02:08:59.321 --> 02:09:03.220
He's grappling with another dude even though he's blind,
he's missing a leg.
Yeah.

2058
02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:07.870
And Are you ready to get it on?
Yeah.
You know,
another guy came in,

2059
02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:11.150
I think he was a marine too,
and he was wearing a,

2060
02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:14.710
it's just like a tee shirt and the same guy's like,
hey,

2061
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:17.080
where's your issue PT kit?

2062
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:20.680
The Marine Corps doesn't play around and well this was the green baret guy.

2063
02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.040
Right.
But he's,
but Roger,
cause they're all,
it's a mixed force,
right?

2064
02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:28.720
There's air force,
Navy,
marine,
whoever's there,
there was a,
there was a navy,

2065
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.490
I believe she was navy EOD.

2066
02:09:30.491 --> 02:09:34.600
You'd had her arms blown off and she was recently in that range.
15 movie.

2067
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:36.100
I think it's the same girl.

2068
02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:41.560
I've only met one girl who had both her arms blown off by,
by uh,
by an IED.

2069
02:09:41.561 --> 02:09:44.360
But so I imagine it's her.
But anyway,
um,

2070
02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:48.760
he expected you to be a soldier regardless of what happened to you.

2071
02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:53.560
You're going to maintain that persona son.
And I was like,
yeah,

2072
02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:56.320
cause I could feel myself slipping at this other place because there's no

2073
02:09:56.321 --> 02:10:00.880
expectations,
you know,
and you can only self mode.

2074
02:10:02.070 --> 02:10:06.160
And
having never had my legs blown off before,

2075
02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:11.850
I could only me self motivate to a point for so long and,

2076
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:18.130
and,
and be the guy beat with my own drill sergeant and be my own,
uh,

2077
02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.760
inspector.
And there,
there's a reason,
and I say this all the time,

2078
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:26.790
there's a reason why the best athletes in the world have coaches.

2079
02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:32.170
Yeah.
That's the fact.
It's because somebody has got to show you the way.
Yeah.

2080
02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.160
And you can.
And furthermore,
you can only push

2081
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:34.911
<v 0>yourself so hard.</v>

2082
02:10:34.911 --> 02:10:39.911
I know for a fact you can only push yourself to 107% a coach is going to get you

2083
02:10:42.111 --> 02:10:46.550
to 117% they can push you a little bit harder.
Now,
I have no mercy.

2084
02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:51.440
And so that's what you need.
That's what everybody,
yeah.
You know,
and so,

2085
02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:52.300
but

2086
02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:57.150
<v 2>again,
I try to give credit where credit's due and give,
you know,</v>

2087
02:10:57.330 --> 02:10:59.170
you know,
people were worried when I wrote the book,

2088
02:10:59.171 --> 02:11:01.840
there were people I heard that we're worried and I'm not,

2089
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:05.110
I don't want to shit on anyone and I don't want it to seem like I'm blaming

2090
02:11:05.111 --> 02:11:07.810
anyone for anything.
I put myself there.

2091
02:11:07.811 --> 02:11:10.900
I'm the one that wanted to be in that spot to step on that landmine.

2092
02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:16.680
My only expectation was that others would have put the preparation into their

2093
02:11:16.751 --> 02:11:18.190
mission as I put into mine.

2094
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:23.910
And I do feel that there were some at very high levels that maybe didn't take

2095
02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.760
things as seriously as they should have or realized the consequences of what was

2096
02:11:30.371 --> 02:11:35.350
coming and take best practices from places like Walter Reed,
San Antonio.

2097
02:11:35.351 --> 02:11:36.490
Because when I said,

2098
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.350
send me to San Antonio and send a Canadian physiotherapist with me and she,

2099
02:11:41.351 --> 02:11:44.260
he or she's going to learn in the three or six months,

2100
02:11:44.261 --> 02:11:49.180
I'm there more than she will in 20 years at any Canadian base.
It was,

2101
02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.700
oh,
well,
we appreciate that Mitak but you know,
we're,
we're,

2102
02:11:52.701 --> 02:11:56.230
we're working on a Canadian solution,
and I was like,
well,

2103
02:11:56.231 --> 02:12:00.520
that's going to be awesome once you figure out whatever the fuck that is.

2104
02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:03.040
What about me?
I'm talking about right this second.

2105
02:12:03.041 --> 02:12:07.230
We have a facility willing to take us to,

2106
02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:11.650
did they send pts down there?
No,
because here's,

2107
02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:15.730
here's the backroom stuff.
The politics.
Jodie,

2108
02:12:15.731 --> 02:12:19.150
what would the civilians thing if we were sending our soldiers to a different

2109
02:12:19.151 --> 02:12:23.740
country's medical centers
when we got hospitals right here.

2110
02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:26.650
Now again,

2111
02:12:26.770 --> 02:12:31.770
what we were getting at the hospital was not bad care.

2112
02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:35.170
You know what I'm saying?
You do.
You understand the distinction.

2113
02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.420
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.
It was,</v>

2114
02:12:37.630 --> 02:12:42.630
it was the best care to the capability and the knowledge and understanding that

2115
02:12:43.721 --> 02:12:48.220
they had not only of their job,
but of the people that they were working with.

2116
02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:50.250
Yeah.
In other words you got,

2117
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:54.100
if you got a 72 year old diabetic that has an amputation,

2118
02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.780
the four pound weight is good and that you can try and transfer that over to

2119
02:12:58.781 --> 02:13:03.010
Jody medic who just got off the battlefield three weeks ago.
Yeah,

2120
02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:07.650
he's a different animal.
Yeah.
Option two,

2121
02:13:07.690 --> 02:13:09.880
right to like what they,

2122
02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.850
<v 2>but they're trained and what they're really good at caring for.</v>

2123
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.140
You come in and this is like,

2124
02:13:14.141 --> 02:13:16.570
this isn't really typical that we all have to deal with.

2125
02:13:16.810 --> 02:13:21.520
Why are we going to change our whole system?
Well,
yeah,
exactly that,

2126
02:13:21.550 --> 02:13:23.290
but even things like,

2127
02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:26.530
I remember the first couple of nurses that came into my room,
they're like,

2128
02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:30.010
oh hey honey,
what happens to what the car accident?
Were you on a motorcycle?

2129
02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.440
You're on a mode really well,

2130
02:13:31.441 --> 02:13:34.350
losing your foot is very typical of a motorcycle accident,
but they didn't,

2131
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.190
and I'm like,
oh,
I,

2132
02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:41.970
I stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan.
We even have soldiers in Afghanistan.

2133
02:13:43.530 --> 02:13:45.760
And I was like,
ah.

2134
02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:49.790
<v 0>So hence,
hence this part of the book.
Ironically,</v>

2135
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:53.570
one of the biggest emotional problems I had to deal with was the anger.

2136
02:13:53.571 --> 02:13:57.110
I felt towards a medical system that did not seem to be able to respond

2137
02:13:57.111 --> 02:13:58.820
appropriately to my needs.

2138
02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.513
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2139
02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:06.630
<v 0>Now you ended up putting on weight cause you couldn't exercise and you do give a</v>

2140
02:14:06.701 --> 02:14:09.160
little shout out right here to the dairy queen.

2141
02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.580
<v 2>Dairy Queen is delicious when you're depressed.
Oh,
it's so good.</v>

2142
02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:17.770
It's so good.
Once it the lips,

2143
02:14:19.070 --> 02:14:22.720
it's a peanut butter cups and it's a swirly ice cream.

2144
02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:25.810
I might have to get one right after this.
Jocko,

2145
02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.120
you're gonna have to find a dairy queen

2146
02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:28.890
<v 0>up in here.
Uh,</v>

2147
02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:33.180
so in conjunction with the therapy sessions,

2148
02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.240
I also started taking an antidepressant to start to help control my moods.

2149
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:42.330
And then there was the other kind of pain,
the physical kind.

2150
02:14:43.110 --> 02:14:47.760
I was still using painkillers to dull the pain that was there each and every
day.

2151
02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:49.980
I needed that relief so badly,

2152
02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:55.130
but in the end that to caused me tremendous suffering and I turned into

2153
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:59.680
something I never thought I would be an addict.

2154
02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:11.380
We've definitely are seeing this happen with our wounded veterans.

2155
02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:14.870
And here you go.
In no time.

2156
02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:19.370
I was taking more of the drug that I was supposed to in order to relieve my

2157
02:15:19.371 --> 02:15:22.160
psychological and physical pain.

2158
02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:27.760
The addiction worsened and I started crushing the pills into a powder and

2159
02:15:27.761 --> 02:15:29.590
snorting it to get a better high.

2160
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:35.380
Those pills gave me relief from my stress and mental pain,

2161
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:39.670
if only for a little while.
But as soon as they wore off,

2162
02:15:40.450 --> 02:15:42.520
my demons would return.

2163
02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.170
I worried about my future

2164
02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.730
if I wasn't a soldier.
Who was I?

2165
02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:01.990
And you've already said that a bunch of times.
That feeling of,

2166
02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.200
I mean in it,

2167
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:08.710
everything you'd been in your life from when you were a kid,

2168
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:10.810
that was what was inside of you.

2169
02:16:10.811 --> 02:16:14.290
And then you were able to act on that and become that soldier,

2170
02:16:14.890 --> 02:16:18.910
serve in combat,
get after it on the battlefield.

2171
02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:23.330
<v 2>My whole adult life,
I became a man in the military.</v>

2172
02:16:23.630 --> 02:16:27.530
I joined as a 17 year old,
174 pounds,

2173
02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:32.440
six foot four skinny weakling.
And I grew into the,

2174
02:16:32.441 --> 02:16:35.050
into the man that you see.
And

2175
02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:40.280
<v 0>in that question,
you know,
when I was reading that,
when,
you know,</v>

2176
02:16:40.281 --> 02:16:43.580
I had a buddy that uh,
retired the other day,

2177
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:49.370
25 years
and I just said to him,
I said,

2178
02:16:49.371 --> 02:16:50.690
how was it cleaned out your locker,

2179
02:16:50.691 --> 02:16:52.040
because I don't know what it's like for you guys,

2180
02:16:52.041 --> 02:16:56.330
but in the seal teams you have a locker and that's your whole career is

2181
02:16:56.331 --> 02:16:59.920
physically represented and the walkers are big.
They're there,

2182
02:16:59.921 --> 02:17:04.450
they're walking lockers,
they're awesome.
Oh Wow.
Each guy has a walking locker,

2183
02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:07.130
has a big dry calm,
a dry and gauge calm cages.

2184
02:17:07.131 --> 02:17:11.720
Cause there's just made with a chain link based material.
Basically each guy has,

2185
02:17:11.721 --> 02:17:14.870
everybody has their own,
they're almost as big as this office.
Right,
right,
right.

2186
02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:15.531
And you got crews,

2187
02:17:15.531 --> 02:17:18.970
boxes in there and it's your whole career is physically representative.

2188
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:23.120
Everything you've ever been issued,
anything that you've picked up along the way,

2189
02:17:23.121 --> 02:17:27.170
trinkets,
just everything is in your drying gauge.
Right.
And when you retire,

2190
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:31.670
you go,
you clean out your cage,
it's empty,
you sweep out the floor,

2191
02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:36.490
you floated into your van,
you drive home and that's it.
It's over.
Yeah.

2192
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:39.570
And I,
so I said to my buddy the other,
I said,
you know,
how was it,
uh,

2193
02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:43.490
how was it cleaned out your drying cage?
Cause I that for me,

2194
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:46.400
I wasn't even worried about retiring and you think about resigned.
I'm like,
okay,

2195
02:17:46.401 --> 02:17:48.470
I got to go do this,
go do the ceremony.
I'm all good.

2196
02:17:48.471 --> 02:17:53.360
Come back cleaning out my cage.
And I'm like,
oh this is over.
And for me,

2197
02:17:53.361 --> 02:17:58.361
I spent 18 out of 20 years out here on the west coast and all within like a

2198
02:17:59.841 --> 02:18:01.940
stone's throw of the different buildings.

2199
02:18:01.941 --> 02:18:05.500
I mean all within these certain number of buildings.
Yeah.

2200
02:18:06.050 --> 02:18:10.350
Since I was a kid.
Yep.
And the question,

2201
02:18:10.351 --> 02:18:12.530
so when I was reading that you wrote this,

2202
02:18:12.590 --> 02:18:15.590
that's what I was thinking about a what my buddy was thinking,

2203
02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:20.510
if I'm not a soldier,
if I'm not a seal,
then what am I?

2204
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:27.000
That's a tough question to answer for it.
Audit guys,

2205
02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:33.380
<v 2>brutal.
And it comes back to what we were talking about before,
dwelling right</v>

2206
02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.793
eye.

2207
02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:41.840
It was really hard for me because I didn't choose to leave.

2208
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:48.810
Right.
I'd always imagined I'd be,
you wounded.
I don't know why.
Like,
you know,

2209
02:18:48.811 --> 02:18:53.430
visual visualization is very important in my opinion,
in our line of work.

2210
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:57.210
And so I'd always tried to,
you know,
envision,
uh,
being wounded.
Okay.

2211
02:18:57.211 --> 02:19:02.070
But it was like the cool scar across the cheek or like some shrapnel in the rib

2212
02:19:02.071 --> 02:19:05.400
cage.
I could show off at barbecues,
you know,
and talk about when I'm like 80,

2213
02:19:05.401 --> 02:19:09.300
I'd be like,
yeah,
I still got some Taliban metal in there.
But no,
you know,

2214
02:19:09.301 --> 02:19:11.340
like it's that or it's a body bag.

2215
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:15.170
You don't think about the in between even our system.
Right.

2216
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:19.950
Our medical system in Canada between lots of body bags,
lots of bandages,

2217
02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:24.240
but the,
in between part,
they kind of dropped the ball.

2218
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.750
<v 0>Yeah.
And years ago,
World War One,
probably World War II,</v>

2219
02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:32.540
you wouldn't have made it.
They wouldn't have to deal with,
you know,

2220
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:35.690
because you would have bled out.
They didn't know t triple C,

2221
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:37.760
they wouldn't have gotten the CAS evac.
I mean,
it would've been,

2222
02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:41.540
you would've died.
That's all there is to double.
Yeah.
Double amputation.
Yeah.

2223
02:19:41.610 --> 02:19:46.010
Forget about,
uh,
so they just didn't have that back then.

2224
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:46.691
Vietnam.

2225
02:19:46.691 --> 02:19:50.420
I've got a lot better in terms of the CAS evac situations to get helicopters in

2226
02:19:50.421 --> 02:19:52.270
there a lot faster.
That's why you need a lot more rude,
but yeah,

2227
02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.020
figuring out what you're going to do next and you held onto it,
you held onto it.

2228
02:19:59.021 --> 02:20:01.870
You tried to hang on to it because you decided,
you know what,

2229
02:20:01.871 --> 02:20:05.230
I'm going to still be a soldier.
Yeah.
You got done with,
he did a half marathon.

2230
02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:09.850
Yeah.
But after that half marathon,
you were just to beat up.

2231
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:13.210
Yeah.
From that.
Yeah.
And you decided

2232
02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:15.423
<v 3>that,</v>

2233
02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:20.030
<v 0>well,
here's what you put in the book.
I tell people that Jody,</v>

2234
02:20:20.031 --> 02:20:24.410
the soldier was wounded in January of 2007 but it took them about two years to

2235
02:20:24.411 --> 02:20:29.000
die,
to let the soldier in you.
Yeah.
Go,

2236
02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:32.713
<v 3>okay,</v>

2237
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.890
<v 0>and I'm going to continue.
Of course,
this wasn't an easy decision for me,</v>

2238
02:20:36.891 --> 02:20:39.890
and I was filled with rage and anger,
and again,

2239
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:45.370
I started using Oxycontin as a relief from the pain of loss.

2240
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:48.290
It became my problem yet again,

2241
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:53.120
but I diluted myself into believing I had it under my control.

2242
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:04.880
You talk about this thing where you're reading a reader's digest article.
Yeah.

2243
02:21:04.930 --> 02:21:07.560
And there's an oxycontin addict in there.
Yeah.

2244
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:12.130
And he's talking about how he's shooting it up.
And you said to yourself,

2245
02:21:12.131 --> 02:21:15.290
you weren't thinking,
oh,
that's,
that's horrible.
I can't believe you're like,
hm.

2246
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:20.560
<v 2>Well,
I didn't know you thought of that.
And that is what hits you.</v>

2247
02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.513
Yeah.

2248
02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.113
<v 3>And I think</v>

2249
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:28.580
<v 2>that is what hits you realizing that's when you realize you weren't control.</v>

2250
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:29.031
Right.
I mean,

2251
02:21:29.031 --> 02:21:33.980
that's gotta be that moment because it is the story where he was a doctor,

2252
02:21:33.981 --> 02:21:35.120
I believe,
right.

2253
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:39.260
Injecting himself in the bathroom when his young daughter walked in.

2254
02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.790
And I had now had a young daughter
and I could just,

2255
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:46.430
and now I'm like,
and I,
and in my mind it wasn't,
oh,

2256
02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:50.330
imagine if my daughter caught me going to eject.
I went,
oh,
I can inject.

2257
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:53.150
And I remember,

2258
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:56.750
and I even went through a second where I remembered how great it was to get the

2259
02:21:56.751 --> 02:22:01.430
intervenous drugs in the hospital.
And then the next second was,

2260
02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:05.090
oh,
this is not good.
This is not good.

2261
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:10.360
And then when I ended up buying,
um,
I ended up buying Percocet,

2262
02:22:10.361 --> 02:22:11.680
which is like Oxycontin,

2263
02:22:12.010 --> 02:22:16.570
but like from a guy that I knew through another guy and it was,

2264
02:22:16.571 --> 02:22:19.840
they were in Ziploc bags,
basically a drug deal.

2265
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:24.880
You remember that thing that got me arrested 20 years ago
and I,

2266
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:29.040
okay,
this is,
this is it.
This ends here.

2267
02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:32.170
<v 0>Well,
that's an awesome,
I mean,</v>

2268
02:22:32.171 --> 02:22:34.600
that's awesome credit to you on that because so many people,

2269
02:22:35.470 --> 02:22:39.460
unfortunately they don't take ownership of that.

2270
02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:42.010
They don't say to themselves,
you know what?

2271
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:46.570
I am addicted and this thing is controlling me.
And they always say things like,

2272
02:22:46.571 --> 02:22:50.050
just what you said,
ah,
I got this under control.
I can stop if I want to.

2273
02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:54.240
<v 2>Just don't want,
I need it.
I'm in pain there.
He'd go.</v>

2274
02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.620
I had to take it and I would ask the doctors,
I would say,
how do we get,

2275
02:22:58.650 --> 02:23:01.650
how do we get me off this?
And this was still,
you know,

2276
02:23:01.651 --> 02:23:06.651
oh seven Oh eight nine I think it was 2011 before I finished or got off them.

2277
02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:10.590
They still have in Canada anyway,

2278
02:23:10.591 --> 02:23:15.591
hadn't realized what Oxycontin was a capable of and and so the dog was at,

2279
02:23:17.211 --> 02:23:20.130
it's like three days of withdrawals.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

2280
02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:24.120
Those withdrawals were worse than being wounded.

2281
02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:28.500
Those three days.
Here's your quote.
Those

2282
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:30.980
<v 0>days were absolute horror.</v>

2283
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:37.090
Quitting oxycontin was harder and more painful than getting blown up in

2284
02:23:37.221 --> 02:23:39.200
Afghanistan.
Yeah,

2285
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:44.900
<v 2>because?
Because it was three days,</v>

2286
02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:50.090
whereas I was in the worst Jocko Echo,

2287
02:23:50.091 --> 02:23:54.530
I cannot tell you what the pain was like cause it was so bad and that was the

2288
02:23:54.531 --> 02:23:58.370
pain from going from withdrawals.
No,
the pain from getting blown out.
Okay,

2289
02:23:58.371 --> 02:24:00.470
so the pain from getting cannot describe it to you,

2290
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:05.710
but the withdrawals lasted three days of that kind of pain because your body and

2291
02:24:07.281 --> 02:24:10.400
your mind are trying to trick you or are you still in pain?
Man,

2292
02:24:10.401 --> 02:24:13.850
you still in pain.
You should take him,
you should take them.
But once,

2293
02:24:13.851 --> 02:24:15.440
you know what's funny though,
the three days,

2294
02:24:15.441 --> 02:24:20.441
it's almost like you hit a switch and suddenly the pain starts to dissipate.

2295
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:25.760
The hollow feeling in your chest starts to fill back in.

2296
02:24:27.970 --> 02:24:31.940
The ant stopped crawling on your skin because that's,

2297
02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:33.230
you're going through all of that.

2298
02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:37.700
I was grinding the stumps of my legs into the coach to give it some kind of

2299
02:24:37.701 --> 02:24:42.260
other sensation other than I described it as like,
it was like a dog.

2300
02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:45.470
You ever watch a dog chew on a bone when he's got it between his paws and he's

2301
02:24:45.471 --> 02:24:48.110
just going to town with his teeth.

2302
02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:51.890
That's what it felt like on the ends of my legs was like I had like an animal

2303
02:24:51.891 --> 02:24:53.480
just gnawing on my legs

2304
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:59.360
and then one day,
you know,
whatever,
the third or second,

2305
02:24:59.361 --> 02:25:02.240
two and a half for three days later I realized,
I'm like,
oh,

2306
02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:06.620
most of that's kind of pretty much gone.
It's crazy.

2307
02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:08.780
And uh,
I tell Ya,

2308
02:25:09.350 --> 02:25:13.940
there's Jody before he quit oxycotton and then there's Jody and Jody before he

2309
02:25:13.941 --> 02:25:16.970
quit was still trying his best and doing well.

2310
02:25:16.970 --> 02:25:20.600
And if you talk to anybody who was the guy,
a lot of people looked up to,

2311
02:25:20.601 --> 02:25:24.820
but you know,
things really started to turn around after I quit.
You know,

2312
02:25:24.821 --> 02:25:29.170
I really started to become capable of a lot in my,
in my mind,

2313
02:25:29.171 --> 02:25:34.090
I think there's a big difference.
But man,
that Shit,
just my buddy,

2314
02:25:34.091 --> 02:25:38.860
he is a,
he's a paratrooper and a,
he had to get some surgery on his knee,

2315
02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.980
you know,
paratroopers,
earlies banging up their knees and,

2316
02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:45.880
and the doctor gave him coding or of Tylenol three or something like that.

2317
02:25:45.881 --> 02:25:49.450
And he literally took it and threw it in the garbage.
He's like,

2318
02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:54.370
I saw what happened to Jody.
I just like,
I don't even,
I don't want anything.
And,

2319
02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:56.200
um,
that's my advice.

2320
02:25:56.230 --> 02:26:00.070
Kids out there do not take it.
If you don't,

2321
02:26:00.071 --> 02:26:05.020
if you can grit your teeth enough,
do not take that shit.
Stay clean,

2322
02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.260
do your best.
I wouldn't trust me around it.

2323
02:26:08.261 --> 02:26:12.070
Now if you had one,
I might take it.

2324
02:26:13.290 --> 02:26:17.790
I don't go good.
Let's just take some more of this Alpha brain.
Take the Alpha,

2325
02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:22.020
getting skin.
I'll get on it instead of,
instead of getting addicted again,
get

2326
02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.770
<v 0>off it by getting on it.</v>

2327
02:26:27.450 --> 02:26:31.720
Uh,
so now you get through it.

2328
02:26:31.721 --> 02:26:34.990
You're not addicted to oxycontin anymore.

2329
02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:39.340
And now it's what do I going to do with my life?
And here you go,

2330
02:26:39.341 --> 02:26:43.660
what did I actually want and what was possible and could I really put my

2331
02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:46.960
military past behind me and pursue something else that would make me feel

2332
02:26:46.961 --> 02:26:50.560
fulfilled?
But it was time to stop asking questions.

2333
02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:52.990
It was time to find some answers.

2334
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:58.023
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2335
02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:05.210
<v 0>and here you're kind of referring back and it's the last chapter.</v>

2336
02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:09.680
Um,
it's called on my own two feet.

2337
02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.310
I'm glad you still got a sense of humor after all this.

2338
02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:17.300
Can't make fun of yourself,
man.
Take life way too serious.

2339
02:27:17.390 --> 02:27:21.080
So a lot of professional athletes will tell you they miss two things when they

2340
02:27:21.081 --> 02:27:24.650
retire.
The competition on the field and the camaraderie with the team,

2341
02:27:24.651 --> 02:27:26.060
late teammates in the locker room,

2342
02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.750
it's the exact same thing for soldiers after we leave the armed forces.

2343
02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:32.360
When I see soldiers on parade,

2344
02:27:32.361 --> 02:27:36.620
I still get chills down my spine because I loved it so much.

2345
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:40.423
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2346
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:44.070
<v 0>just letting everybody know that that's completely normal for all you guys that</v>

2347
02:27:44.071 --> 02:27:48.360
got out for whatever reason.
Totally normal.
Jodie feels it.

2348
02:27:48.450 --> 02:27:50.760
I feel it.
We all feel that.

2349
02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:56.160
So then you went and did the amazing race in Canada.

2350
02:27:56.970 --> 02:28:01.020
<v 2>Yeah,
we had the,
you got second place with your brother's second place,</v>

2351
02:28:01.021 --> 02:28:04.950
and it was the first season because the American amazing race was the most

2352
02:28:04.951 --> 02:28:09.060
popular show in Canada.
So let's make a Canadian,

2353
02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:10.020
what's Mega Canadian one?

2354
02:28:10.021 --> 02:28:12.030
If Canadians love anything more than the American version,

2355
02:28:12.031 --> 02:28:13.000
it's the Canadian version.

2356
02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:17.620
<v 0>Then you ended up doing this city counselor thing.
Yeah.</v>

2357
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:20.673
<v 1>And</v>

2358
02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:27.690
<v 2>that's where you're at now.
That's where I'm at now.
You know when,</v>

2359
02:28:27.691 --> 02:28:31.830
one part that we haven't talked about,
and I'm going to do it a little bit of a,

2360
02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:37.120
I'm going to score a few Brownie points here at home.
So I,

2361
02:28:37.121 --> 02:28:40.340
I said they had to plow a road to me yeah.
To,
to rescue me.
Right.

2362
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:44.240
They literally plowed a road with a combat bulldozer.

2363
02:28:44.241 --> 02:28:48.620
And right behind it was what we call a buys,
an ambulance.

2364
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:49.730
And it's an eight wield,

2365
02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:54.230
almost built in the same factory as the Lav in Ontario,
Canada,

2366
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:58.940
London,
Ontario,
Canada by a unionized workers.
And,
uh,

2367
02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:00.840
and,

2368
02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.840
and the commander of that vehicle was master corporal Atlanta Gilmore of the

2369
02:29:06.141 --> 02:29:09.860
Canadian Forces Medical Corps,
who is now my wife,

2370
02:29:10.970 --> 02:29:14.780
retired sergeant Atlanta Gilmore of the Canadian Forces Medical Corp.

2371
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:19.310
Um,
and we have two beautiful daughters,

2372
02:29:19.970 --> 02:29:24.440
ala seven and Kiera four.
And,

2373
02:29:24.441 --> 02:29:25.274
uh,

2374
02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:27.330
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2375
02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:30.030
<v 2>we,
we,
we managed to connect.</v>

2376
02:29:31.330 --> 02:29:32.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2377
02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:33.400
<v 2>I was wounded in January.</v>

2378
02:29:33.401 --> 02:29:38.080
We connected in September or Octoberish of the saint of 2007.

2379
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:42.940
My girlfriend that I had had when I got wounded had left no fault of hers.

2380
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:46.320
I don't blame her one one bit,
you know,
um,

2381
02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:52.520
to get thrown into a situation where you have to care for a wounded soldier,

2382
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:56.830
the guy who before was like a rock,
you know,

2383
02:29:56.831 --> 02:30:00.460
and that's not what you signed up for.
Right.
And,
uh,

2384
02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:04.660
and Atlanta had recently broken up with it,
with,
with her partner as well.

2385
02:30:04.661 --> 02:30:06.760
And when we found each other though,

2386
02:30:06.761 --> 02:30:10.940
the fact that she was a hot Irish blonde was just really a bonus bonus.

2387
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.840
Gotta be honest.
And,
and,
uh,
she took one,
you know,

2388
02:30:15.850 --> 02:30:20.050
Jocko,
I call medics,
they're like our mommies.
What do you guys have?
Corman.

2389
02:30:20.051 --> 02:30:20.884
You call them?
Yeah.

2390
02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:26.370
Cause see combat guys were a little low that saying,
if you're going to be tough,

2391
02:30:26.371 --> 02:30:28.870
you are,
if you're going to be dumb,
you gotta be tough.
You gotta be stupid.

2392
02:30:28.871 --> 02:30:30.920
You gotta be telling you yes.
And that's,
and that's us.

2393
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:33.820
We need the corpsman or the medic to be like,
hey,
hey,
hey Jocko.

2394
02:30:33.850 --> 02:30:38.050
Why are you limping?
What?
Come here.
Come here,
dummy.
Come here.
No,
no,
no,

2395
02:30:38.051 --> 02:30:41.100
not in front of the other troops.
Mom,
stop it.
Stop it.
And,

2396
02:30:41.101 --> 02:30:44.770
and so that's their job.
So she saw me,
she took one look at me.
She's like,

2397
02:30:44.771 --> 02:30:48.360
you look terrible.
I was surviving on vectors,

2398
02:30:48.361 --> 02:30:53.200
cereal and drive through sandwiches because I was by myself.

2399
02:30:53.530 --> 02:30:55.960
All the boys were still deployed or on course.

2400
02:30:56.620 --> 02:31:00.550
And I was living in my own private,
a house on base.

2401
02:31:00.551 --> 02:31:04.690
So I had moved on to base.
I had this little puppy,
uh,
Charlie who wasn't,

2402
02:31:04.691 --> 02:31:08.170
he's not a service dog by any stretch,
but he's the only reason I got it,

2403
02:31:08.171 --> 02:31:11.350
a bed in the morning.
So I owe him.
He's still my buddy still at that.

2404
02:31:11.351 --> 02:31:15.070
He's at the house right now.
And,
um,
and she,

2405
02:31:15.071 --> 02:31:17.470
so she went into medic mode.
Really?
She went,

2406
02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:20.940
you know what should come by my house,
bring your dog,

2407
02:31:20.941 --> 02:31:25.020
you can play with my dog and let's just hang out.
And when we got,
when,

2408
02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:27.720
when we saw each other though,
it was comradery.

2409
02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:30.840
She was one of the last people to see me on the battlefield.

2410
02:31:30.841 --> 02:31:34.860
She carried my stretcher to the,
to the,
to the EVAC chopper.

2411
02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:41.660
And you know,
if you talked to her,
the fact that I was,
you know,
uh,

2412
02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:44.970
a bearded hot guy was just a bonus to her too.

2413
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:50.490
And you know,
eventually I let her kiss me guys.
Okay.

2414
02:31:51.690 --> 02:31:56.610
Passively,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Now she likes you.
She,
she's going to ask me,

2415
02:31:56.611 --> 02:31:59.820
did you tell Jocko the same joke you tell everyone else that Iq STIU

2416
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:06.830
but when we got pregnant a little quick alias birthday's September.

2417
02:32:09.090 --> 02:32:13.890
Do the math.
So,
but you know,

2418
02:32:14.250 --> 02:32:19.050
we realized,
we talked about it.
When we talk about the survivor's guilt,

2419
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:22.880
you don't,
you didn't survive,
you know,

2420
02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:24.630
your friends live for your friends.

2421
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:29.710
I didn't survive and she didn't like her vehicle hit land mines and she was in

2422
02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:31.230
ambushes and all,
you know,

2423
02:32:31.410 --> 02:32:35.850
near near death on a battlefield is a bullet going an inch from your head.

2424
02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:39.180
That's near death.
Yeah.
You laugh about it after.
But that's,

2425
02:32:39.570 --> 02:32:40.800
so she was in all that too.

2426
02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:46.280
And so she's pregnant and I should have died and who knows what could happen to

2427
02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:52.740
her and who are we to deny what's happening,
you know,
so I have to,

2428
02:32:52.741 --> 02:32:54.600
I had to throw that out there that,
you know,

2429
02:32:54.601 --> 02:32:59.601
I have three beautiful blondes in my life with blue eyed blonds that,

2430
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:03.000
you know,
uh,
keep me in check and cause I,

2431
02:33:05.060 --> 02:33:09.900
the,
the feelings I had in the book,
they're not all in the past.
You know,

2432
02:33:09.901 --> 02:33:14.310
I woke up yet yesterday when I missed the flight,
man,
it,

2433
02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:19.860
it was more that I was disappointing you.
Right.

2434
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:23.910
And hear me out.
Right.
Because I was just like,
I was like,

2435
02:33:25.410 --> 02:33:29.430
I'm the city councilor and a lot of guys look up to me and this and that and all

2436
02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:31.950
that.
You,
I've got these kids and you know,
Atlanta and the,

2437
02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:35.550
and I still can't make a fucking flight,
you know,

2438
02:33:35.551 --> 02:33:38.220
and I haven't even met the guy yet and I'm already disappointed them.

2439
02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:42.270
And that went through me and it's all because I stepped on that stupid landmine,

2440
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:45.120
but I wouldn't even be here if I had stepped on that landmine.

2441
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:47.010
I wouldn't have had these,

2442
02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:51.210
I wouldn't have these kids if I hadn't stepped on a landmine after my second

2443
02:33:51.211 --> 02:33:54.870
fiance walked out of the house and my,
you know,
like all eyes,
that's my joke.

2444
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:56.040
I like all good soldiers.

2445
02:33:56.041 --> 02:33:59.640
I have three x fiances and it doesn't ex-girlfriends sacrifice to the queen

2446
02:34:00.390 --> 02:34:03.840
because we still swear allegiance to the queen because it's real.

2447
02:34:03.841 --> 02:34:08.550
That's like you said,
the teams come first.
And uh,
I had said,
well,

2448
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.790
I'm going to retire at about 44 with 25 years in,

2449
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:14.730
so why don't I just start kids and all that then.

2450
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.880
And I'm sure my life would be fine if I hadn't stepped on the landmine,

2451
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:23.730
but would it be as fulfilling?
Would I be as,

2452
02:34:23.890 --> 02:34:26.260
as,
as deaf,
as broad or

2453
02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:28.990
would I be as complete?

2454
02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:34.510
I'm sure I'd be a kick ass spec ops sniper somewhere doing something,
but

2455
02:34:36.610 --> 02:34:37.690
I couldn't,
no matter,
like if,

2456
02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:42.790
if I had a wish to not step on the mine,

2457
02:34:42.791 --> 02:34:46.750
but I wouldn't get to keep the kids,
I'd step on that mind 10 times at a 10.

2458
02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:50.050
And,
um,
so I had to,
you know,

2459
02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:55.350
I had to throw it in there and give credit to Atlanta for what she did for me

2460
02:34:56.650 --> 02:35:00.400
and also my friends and family.
Right.
Just nobody does it.
No one's a rock,

2461
02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:02.373
<v 1>you know.</v>

2462
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:06.470
<v 0>So I,
I just had to say all that.
Yeah,
no.
And I actually,
uh,</v>

2463
02:35:06.650 --> 02:35:09.020
I have a question about your wife and okay.

2464
02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.180
That was going to give you an opportunity to steal some of your thunder.

2465
02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:14.810
Not at all.
Not at all.
Uh,
I'm glad you,
I'm glad you put that out there.

2466
02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:19.310
And also I didn't want to steal thunder from your book.
Right.

2467
02:35:19.311 --> 02:35:21.320
And that was one of the things that I was going to tell people.
I mean,

2468
02:35:21.321 --> 02:35:25.520
obviously I think people are just gonna buy this.
I mean obviously got,
there's,

2469
02:35:25.850 --> 02:35:29.990
this is the a big book which I've taken some excerpts out of.
Yeah,

2470
02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:34.370
and there's so much more in it,
but when you read it and you get the whole,

2471
02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:35.720
the whole package,

2472
02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:39.800
one of which is you explaining these relationships with your wife,

2473
02:35:39.801 --> 02:35:41.690
with your kids and how that happened,

2474
02:35:43.850 --> 02:35:48.320
which is just a,
I mean for all practical purposes,

2475
02:35:48.321 --> 02:35:51.950
let's just call it what it is.
That's a miracle.
Yeah.

2476
02:35:57.090 --> 02:35:58.410
Here's how it closes out.

2477
02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:05.540
People often ask me if I regret my time in Afghanistan because it costs me my

2478
02:36:05.541 --> 02:36:08.300
two feet and completely changed my life.

2479
02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:14.870
If you live your life with regrets,
then you never move forward.

2480
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:15.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2481
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:19.580
<v 0>Those six months in Afghanistan before the explosion where some of the best</v>

2482
02:36:19.581 --> 02:36:21.020
times of my life,

2483
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:26.060
I can honestly say as I look back on my life in the military,

2484
02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:31.270
I wouldn't have changed a thing if I hadn't stepped on that landmine.

2485
02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:33.410
I would never have connected with Alana.

2486
02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:37.170
I would never have had two beautiful daughters.

2487
02:36:37.650 --> 02:36:41.820
My mind and body were pushed to the limit after my accident.

2488
02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:46.800
And ironically I came out on the other side,
a better,
more complete person.

2489
02:36:48.210 --> 02:36:53.210
Maybe life would be easier now if I hadn't lost a part of both legs,

2490
02:36:54.930 --> 02:36:59.320
but it certainly wouldn't have been any more complete
when I want,

2491
02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:00.770
when I am in public today,

2492
02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:04.370
advocating for veteran's rights are simply going about my daily life.

2493
02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:08.840
People sometimes approach me to say thank you for your service.

2494
02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.440
Those five words mean more to me than anything else.

2495
02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:28.130
Now I'd like to say something,
Jodi,
from me,

2496
02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:37.060
and on behalf of every American Canadian,
Brit Australian,

2497
02:37:37.061 --> 02:37:38.950
and the rest of the free world,

2498
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.190
<v 1>thank you for your service</v>

2499
02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:48.300
and your inspiration,
okay.

2500
02:37:48.450 --> 02:37:49.650
<v 0>To all of us.</v>

2501
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2502
02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:56.310
<v 0>To overcome obstacles and to make a difference in the world.</v>

2503
02:38:02.130 --> 02:38:04.360
<v 1>Thank you.
Thank you man.</v>

2504
02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:10.400
<v 0>And you got a tear in my IRA now.
Don't do it.
You're on youtube.
No doubt.</v>

2505
02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:11.293
No doubt.

2506
02:38:13.290 --> 02:38:17.280
<v 1>Thank you.
[inaudible] thank you too for your service.</v>

2507
02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:22.290
Don't thank me
and I think that's going to be enough for tonight.

2508
02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:24.413
So

2509
02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:28.870
<v 0>if you haven't got this feeling yet,
you're listening to the podcast.</v>

2510
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2511
02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:34.750
<v 0>I know you're going to want to go out and get this book.
It's called unflinching,</v>

2512
02:38:34.751 --> 02:38:39.751
the making of a Canadian sniper by my man right here,

2513
02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:42.880
Jody medic.
It's,

2514
02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:49.480
it's what you want to read about.
That's right.
And you can get it anywhere.

2515
02:38:49.481 --> 02:38:51.190
Books are bought.
You can get it on Amazon.

2516
02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:56.320
I recommend for my American cousins use Amazon through a,
what is it,

2517
02:38:56.321 --> 02:38:59.650
the Jocko podcast or the Jocko store.
He wants to go through Jocko store.

2518
02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:02.410
I like your recommendations there.
Go to the Jocko store,

2519
02:39:02.530 --> 02:39:06.550
click on the Amazon link.
So Jocko gets a little piece of a,
of the pie.

2520
02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:11.140
The paperback is out so you save a few bucks and uh,

2521
02:39:11.170 --> 02:39:14.170
be an honor to,
uh,
to have you guys read my book.

2522
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:20.040
If you,
uh,
you're on social media.
The web,
I do the webs or web,

2523
02:39:20.790 --> 02:39:25.780
Jody Mitic and j.
O.
D.
Y,
M.
I t I see on Twitter,

2524
02:39:25.781 --> 02:39:30.460
Instagram,
snapchat and Facebook.
Snapchat.
I have no idea.

2525
02:39:30.461 --> 02:39:35.410
So chapter six,
evidently everybody uses it.
Jody Mitic.

2526
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:39.540
Yeah,
I'm on snap it people use it.
Okay.
Um,

2527
02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:44.890
well I'm convinced it was it not going to judge.
Okay.
Not going to judge.
Um,

2528
02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:49.360
yeah,
I don't hide Jody Mitic on Instagram,
Facebook,
Twitter,

2529
02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:53.920
and for all you 14 year olds out there,

2530
02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:58.540
you can get him on snapchat.
Hey,
the 14 year olds need to hear this.
That's true.

2531
02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:01.200
Actually.
You probably need to hear it.
She didn't know.
So snapchat is,

2532
02:40:01.210 --> 02:40:03.240
you can come in like a real friend.
Yeah,
yeah.

2533
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:06.580
I think it originated as that kind of where it's like,
Hey,
let me send you this.

2534
02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:09.370
Isn't this kind of cool undercover and it goes away.

2535
02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.160
He convinced it was a dick pic.
You're sending Dick.
Yeah.
16

2536
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.090
<v 2>and whatnot.
And then someone found a legit way to network or some,</v>

2537
02:40:18.370 --> 02:40:20.700
that's a real deal.
Now I will certainly,

2538
02:40:21.210 --> 02:40:24.600
the rock is on the snapchats.
Right on,
right on

2539
02:40:26.310 --> 02:40:28.640
an honor,
sir.
Um,
I,
um,

2540
02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:35.190
the chances of me being here tonight are,
are,
are very limited.

2541
02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:38.730
We have Twitter to thank literally one of my fans and one of your fans,

2542
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:43.830
basically head head locked us on Twitter and made us talk to each other.

2543
02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:48.750
And uh,
and I became a fan when you were on the rogue and show and podcasting,

2544
02:40:48.751 --> 02:40:50.370
you know,
we talked a little bit at lunch.

2545
02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:55.020
It really helped me when I was going through some rough times and you know,

2546
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:59.190
I want to thank you for letting me come down here to this beautiful city and do

2547
02:40:59.191 --> 02:41:00.870
this for me.
And um,
you know,

2548
02:41:00.871 --> 02:41:05.190
thank you for writing your book and being who you are and an echo.
Thanks for,

2549
02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:10.260
for helping him make this happen.
And you know,
I got a podcast,

2550
02:41:10.261 --> 02:41:14.550
I'm starting the Jody Mitic podcast and a,
there may or may not be an episode up,

2551
02:41:14.810 --> 02:41:19.170
uh,
and the next couple of days,
but if people want to look for me there as well,

2552
02:41:19.171 --> 02:41:23.820
I'd be honored to try and entertain them as closely as you do.
And,
uh,
and as,

2553
02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:27.520
as all the other podcasts I love do.
And you know,

2554
02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:29.720
I just do this to try and be me.
You know,

2555
02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:31.830
I don't know who the new Jody mitigators,
I call him.

2556
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:36.360
I'm calling myself Jodi 3.0 right now.
Uh,
and,

2557
02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.840
and uh,
and this life is a trip.
You know,

2558
02:41:39.841 --> 02:41:44.040
I call myself a student of the human condition and I'm always learning.

2559
02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.600
I'm always learning and I,
and I love to meet New People and um,
yeah,

2560
02:41:48.810 --> 02:41:52.680
that's all I want to say right now,
man.
I appreciate this a lot.
You have no idea.

2561
02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:54.740
<v 0>Well,
we appreciate everything that you've done.</v>

2562
02:41:54.741 --> 02:41:57.290
As I've already said to everybody else out there that's less than,

2563
02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:02.560
I think we're going to actually continue this on and we're going to go to a Q

2564
02:42:03.141 --> 02:42:08.141
and a on the next podcast and we'll just roll that out afterwards.

2565
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:15.950
But for right now and for this evening,
I think that's about all we've got.

2566
02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:18.350
So everyone that's out there that listen to this,

2567
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:23.510
that knows that a person can go to some depths,

2568
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:29.700
I could climb right back out of those depths,

2569
02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:34.890
get out there
and get after it.

2570
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.960
And until next time,

2571
02:42:38.310 --> 02:42:42.030
this is echo and Jody and Jocko

2572
02:42:43.690 --> 02:42:44.170
<v 3>out.</v>
