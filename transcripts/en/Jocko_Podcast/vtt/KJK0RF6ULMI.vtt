This is Jocko podcast number 45 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.550
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.
Okay.

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.433
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.770
<v 0>I often think,</v>

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.653
<v 1>okay</v>

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.840
<v 0>then if I were an Indian,</v>

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.740
I would greatly prefer to cast my lot among those of my people who adhere to the

8
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:33.621
free open plains rather than submit to the confined limits of a reservation

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660
there to be the recipient of the blessing gifts of civilization with it's vices

10
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.600
thrown in without stint or measure.

11
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.320
And that is a quote
from a book

12
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.890
called my life on the plains published in 1876 by a guy named general Custer who

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.480
wrote that book or it was published a few months before he died at the,

14
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.330
at the battle of little big horn.

15
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.980
But we're not going to look at that book today.

16
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.560
Even though that battle,

17
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.880
the battle of little big horn is something we'll definitely delve into.

18
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.780
There's a ton of lessons learned there.
You know,
a whole,
they'll all those,

19
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:37.781
all the American soldiers were killed in this one unit of general Custer's.

20
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.380
There was no survivors from it,
so he lost like 200 guys.
All of them,

21
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:44.810
himself included.
Andy was,

22
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
there was some survivors from some of the other companies that were along with

23
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.300
him.
Um,

24
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.950
there's guy named Major Reno and another guy named Kat and Ben Teen,

25
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.750
and they had people that survived in their company.

26
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.430
Actually a lot of their company survived,

27
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:03.431
but none of none a criminal coasters or general costs or colonel costers troops

28
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:10.460
survived.
And as I was thinking about doing that battle,

29
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.860
because there's so many good lessons to learn about a lot of lessons to learn

30
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.960
about arrogance and overconfidence and splitting forces,

31
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.480
they're just a really good bunch of good tactical lessons to learn from it.

32
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.250
And as I dove into it,

33
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.460
I ended up coming across another firsthand account from an Indian,

34
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.910
now I use the term Indian because instead of the term native American,

35
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.510
which is probably the the,
which is the correct nomenclature,

36
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.910
but in this book that,
that we're going to go over tonight,

37
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.660
it's from a native American who name his wooden leg.

38
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.330
And throughout the book he calls himself an Indian.

39
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:56.650
He calls all of his fellow native Americans Calls Molly Indians.

40
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:01.120
So you're going to hear me call them Indians,
uh,
throughout this evening.

41
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.590
Now
what,

42
00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:07.390
what I found though is as I wanted to learn more about the battle,

43
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.370
I started getting into the whole native American,
what,

44
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.860
what they went through,
what they were like and that culture.

45
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.240
And so this book did a great job of kind of exploring that.

46
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.740
And this the Cheyenne Warrior,

47
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.970
like I said,
named wooden leg,

48
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.350
and the name of the book is wooden leg,

49
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.660
a warrior who fought Custer.
But like I said,

50
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:39.880
that's actually a small portion of the book,

51
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.090
but it gives us some good insight as to

52
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.810
what life was like for these native Americans back on the plains in that

53
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:53.140
transitional period where they were going from being,

54
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.110
living open on the planes to getting moved onto reservations and some of the

55
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.750
fighting that they did and how they grew up.
Now,
where this came from,

56
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.020
there was the author of this book who was a guy that was a doctor and served a

57
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.223
few months as a,

58
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.410
as an agency physician for the northern Cheyenne [inaudible].

59
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.410
So that's the tribe that was allied with the Sioux Indians and,

60
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.380
and they were around and part of the annihilation of,

61
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.440
of costume and this doctor,

62
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.160
Doctor Marquee actually learned the language.

63
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.300
And so when he was up there living on the reservation,

64
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.300
he would constantly ask,
you know,
hey,
did anyone fight?

65
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.470
Koster was any around for these battles who you can just,

66
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.150
just not just cost are buddies,
you know,

67
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.240
specifically interested in that one since it was no,

68
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.380
I witnessed survivors from the American side.

69
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.730
He wanted to find out what happened.

70
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.740
And as he interviewed all these different Indians eventually got to this guy

71
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.330
wouldn't leg.
And I'll go to the book here.

72
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:58.450
It says wooden leg became the author's favorite narrator.

73
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.140
It seemed that his lifetime biography should surround his special battle story

74
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.630
so that readers might learn what kind of people were the hostile Indians of that

75
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.680
day.
So this is again,

76
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.600
marquis was a doctor living up on the reservation and working on people and

77
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.740
learn the language,

78
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.370
communicated with them in one of his favorite old time warriors that he talked

79
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:29.280
to his,
this guy by the name of wooden leg and,

80
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.010
and I'll start with how he ended up with that name,
wooden leg.

81
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.600
And I'm going to the book this Crow Cheyenne Indian man was a wonderful traveler

82
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:44.530
on foot.
Even as a boy,

83
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.580
he could out walk and wear down.
Most of the young men who journeyed with him.

84
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.980
His capabilities in this regard,

85
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:55.981
we're so noticeable that people said his legs must be made of wood since he

86
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.220
never tired.

87
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.570
Then they fixed upon the name wooden leg.

88
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.980
I was also a youthful wonder in the matter of walking by the time,

89
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.300
and this is a wooden leg himself talking.

90
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:15.290
So he was describing someone else who was actually a relative of his and he's

91
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.320
talking about himself.
By the time I was 15 years old,

92
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370
I could go all day following in the footsteps of my uncle wooden leg.

93
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.750
I was tall and gaunt and I grew taller and young.
Manhood,

94
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.260
friends begin jokingly to apply me the name of this endearing of during enduring

95
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.290
uncle who then had become a middle aged or elderly man.

96
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.120
I liked the name,

97
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.530
I liked the man who bore it and I liked the honor of comparison with him.

98
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.330
I told my father,
I wish to be known as a wooden leg.

99
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.950
It was a common custom to pass down names to junior relatives.

100
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.390
My father told me that when the time was right,

101
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.570
he would confer that new name upon me.

102
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.800
The time came when I was about 17 years old.

103
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v 3>Okay.</v>

104
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.270
<v 0>So that's where the origin,</v>

105
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.120
the origin of his name comes from and we are going to get to the part where he

106
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.890
actually takes the full name and that becomes his name wouldn't leg.
So,
uh,

107
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.620
it's uh,
after an eventful,
we'll say an eventful time period.
Yeah.

108
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.100
So here's some,
a little bit about being raised out there.
Again,
Cheyenne country.

109
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.900
When I was six years old,
I asked my father,
will you give me a horse?

110
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.980
Yes,
you may have any horse in mind that you want,

111
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.050
but you must catch him.

112
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.150
He gave me a raw hide lariat rope.
So there you go.
Yo,
you want a horse?
Cool.

113
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.950
Here's a rope.
Go catch one.

114
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.680
He and my mother and some other people laughed about it,

115
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.280
but I took the matter seriously with the Lariat looped in coiled.

116
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:58.330
I went out among the herd to search for horses belonging to my father,

117
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:00.670
so he goes out,
he finds a small pony

118
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.360
and eventually
he got it.
He gets it,
he captures it,

119
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.400
and when it quieted down,

120
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.230
I followed carefully along the line talking soothingly until it allowed me to

121
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.580
pat it's neck.
After awhile I got its mouth around the lower jaw,

122
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.270
the loop of the raw hide according to the old Indian way of making a bridle.

123
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.760
When it had calmed after this new advance,
I began to make strokes on its back.

124
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.790
Then I talked the long coil into my belt,

125
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:35.791
the same as I had seen men do and I climbed quickly upon the animal it Scheid

126
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.630
and I fell off,
but I still had my rope.
This uncoiling from my belt.

127
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:45.310
As the pony moved away,
I seized the tether and followed again.

128
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.600
It's guidance to the coveted mount,
more petting and soothing talk.

129
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.220
Another attempt at writing off again before making a third try.

130
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.600
I spent a time at the gentle taming procedures.

131
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.100
Nevertheless the Pony Scheid and then bucked after I'd mounted it,

132
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.410
but I grabbed its mane and stuck to my seat within a few minutes I had control.

133
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.310
I wrote to my father's lodge.
Yes,

134
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.070
that is your pony to keep.
He told me

135
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.980
bands of us boys went out at times on horseback to hunt wolves.

136
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.570
We had only bows and arrows.
We killed many wolves with arrows.

137
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.400
My father had given me a good bone.

138
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.440
A supply of air was when I was nine or 10 years old.
We were then in black hills,

139
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:36.360
countries,
country.
So I mean this is a,
I know we have,

140
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.050
we have people in America definitely that's still our hunting at a very young

141
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:45.000
age,
but it's pretty cool that you're six years old breaking horses and then out

142
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.880
hunting with bows and arrows.
By the way,

143
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.540
hunting wolves is awesome.
So back to the book,

144
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.910
my mother said to me,
we have no meat,
another boy.
And I set off to hunt.

145
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.810
We are about the same age,
15 years old.
We chat on a Tshirt,

146
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:04.290
leggings and moccasins,
all of Buckskin or other skin.

147
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.520
The leggings had no seat in them as was the Indian way of clothing.

148
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.260
The lower limbs.
We had no head coverings nor any mittens for our hands,

149
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.370
although we are accustomed to hardship.
This was a cold day for us.

150
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.630
We waited and wallowed through snow up to our knees and thighs,

151
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.640
so the again,

152
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.910
nowadays we got smart wool hats and Gore Tex jackets.

153
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.590
We just got it so easy and here you go.

154
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.910
You're in moccasins and you've got bare ass.

155
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.900
You got to bare ass.

156
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.190
You're just out with some leggings on just getting after it in knee deep snow,

157
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.760
just hardcore,
you know,
hardcore

158
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.490
goes a little while.
They continue this hunt and then back to the book,

159
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:52.110
a deer jumped out and started looking at us.

160
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.100
The first shot from my rifle brought it down.
We rushed it and cut it's throat.

161
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.120
We Hurley cut open the body and jammed her hands inside to get warm.

162
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.563
Yeah,

163
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.993
<v 3>yeah.</v>

164
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.050
<v 0>The Shoshone is the crows and the Pawnees were tribes we fought most during my</v>

165
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:15.010
time of growing up to manhood,

166
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:18.660
so this is another thing that they talked about a lot in this book is that the

167
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.690
the,
the native Americans were fighting each other all the time.

168
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.520
They were at war,

169
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.570
they were at war with each other and he talks about that a lot.

170
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.311
Back to the book,

171
00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:33.760
my own youthful warrior experiences where mostly in combat against the crows and

172
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:37.990
the show Shoney's one incident out of many in this kind of warfare,

173
00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:41.050
we'll show you how it was carried on.
Abandoned show,

174
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:43.780
Shoney's came at night and stole some of our horses.

175
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.470
We were camped on a divide between the upper part of the tongue river and the

176
00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:51.610
little big horn,
snow deep and winter weather.

177
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.500
I was 16 old.

178
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.680
I went with a party of Cheyanne's who took the trail of the thieves after

179
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.860
traveling all day and into the night.
We found a small campus show,
Shoney's.

180
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.670
Most of them alarmed by their dogs had fled when we made our attack upon them.

181
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.920
But repeated shots kept coming from a single certain lodge.

182
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.260
We concentrated our assault on this lodge to Cheyenne's were killed and another

183
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:21.850
one mortally wounded before we could suppress this destructive defence white

184
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:26.020
wolf,
11 years older than I was than I was,

185
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:29.800
and yet living as my neighbor on tongue river was the brave warrior who dealt

186
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:34.801
the final blow to that Shoshone white wolf crept along the ground into the lodge

187
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.100
he had in his right hand,
a six shooter.

188
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.240
It was totally dark in there and he fumbled about the interiors seeking whomever

189
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:47.320
he might find.
His gun bumped into somebody and he pulled the trigger.

190
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.510
Later developments really revealed this was the only occupant of the lodge.

191
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.430
The victim was an old man.

192
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.020
He was the only Shoshone we killed in that fight so far as we could learn,

193
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.270
but we won the battle and got back on her horses.

194
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.850
We caught up the body of the old Shoshone man.
We caught off his hands,
his feet,

195
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.240
his head.
We ripped open his breast and belly.

196
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.100
I stood there and looked at his heart and liver.
We tore down the lodge,

197
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.480
built a bonfire of its contents and pile the remnants of the dead body upon this

198
00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:21.314
bonfire.

199
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.810
We stayed there until nothing was left but ashes and Kohl's.

200
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.920
So these guys are getting after it.
They're definitely,

201
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.910
and what's really cool is like,
um,
I didn't want to break up,
but you know,

202
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:41.520
you've got an assault happening,
you've got an assault happening.

203
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:45.090
This is the same.
This could be a,
this could be a story about,
you know,

204
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:50.091
American soldiers going against a Taliban fighters in Afghanistan or insurgents

205
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:52.980
in Iraq were taken down a,

206
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.370
a small village and there's people and there's enemy in there and they're in a

207
00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.950
building and there's concentrated fire coming from there and you get a guy that

208
00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:02.160
low crawls up.
I mean this is,
this is just be,
this is just straight warfare.

209
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:02.990
I mean it's,

210
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.560
it's amazing how that story could translate until almost I need modern era with

211
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:12.120
when you have guns except the part where they cut off the hands in the he except

212
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:15.180
for the part where they cut off the hands,
cut off the feet,
cut off the head,

213
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:17.970
rip open the breast and the belly.
Yeah.

214
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.950
They've taken it to a different level right there and,
and you know,
I think it's,

215
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.560
did he put that in there?
I mean he's,
he's telling these stories in it.

216
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.980
It offers you an insight as to what their attitude was of what they were going

217
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:35.940
to do if you got captured by him or it's on

218
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.270
back to the book.
Little Wolf had been a big tribal chief,

219
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.310
the most influential one for about two years before that time and his earlier

220
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:51.030
manhood.
He was for a long time,
chosen over,

221
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.470
over again as the leading chief of the elk or your society.

222
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
If during any time any Cheyenne was looked upon as the bravest of man of all,

223
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.120
he was the man.

224
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.140
He was never afraid to speak the truth.

225
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.420
The people all believed in him.
He was a gentle and charitable man,

226
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:12.830
but if insulted to anger,

227
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.950
he was likely to hurt somebody in either disturbed or undisturbed mood.

228
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.680
Everybody knew he meant just what he said.

229
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

230
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.370
<v 0>He was my uncle by marriage,
one of his two wives being a sister of my father.</v>

231
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.300
He used to tell me many thrilling stories both at his lodge and my father's

232
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:32.134
lodge.

233
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.100
I recall one in particular when he had hand to hand combat with the Shoshone,

234
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.930
each had a sheath knife.
They grappled and wrestled and slashed one another.

235
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.430
Finally,
Little Wolf Pinion,
the arms of the Shoshone threw him to the ground,

236
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.710
plunged upon him and stabbed him to death.

237
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.670
He gave me a great deal of good advice both as to warfare and as to how to carry

238
00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:57.670
myself uprightly as a man among my own people.

239
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.600
My conduct all throughout my life has been influenced by his teachings more than

240
00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:09.691
by those of any other preceptor except my own father.

241
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.990
So that's a little,
little wolf was the bad ass.

242
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:19.910
Little Wolf was the big bad ass and I thought it was important to kind of talk

243
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:21.500
about its characteristics.

244
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.830
<v 0>He spoke the truth.
People believed him.</v>

246
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.990
He was gentle and charitable,
but if he was angered,
he was gonna hurt you.

247
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.280
So this is the guy that they choose as their leader.

248
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.890
Back to the book,
I think my body grew more rapidly than my mind did.

249
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.450
This is not uncommon for,
for for men and boys.
Yeah,
right.

250
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.930
Your body grows before your mind does.
Absolutely.
Back to the book.

251
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:55.100
By the time I was 18 years old,
I was the tallest men of the tribe.

252
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.830
I believe there were two who stood a little above me.

253
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.140
Both of these were killed in the great battle against the soldiers of Custer.

254
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.090
My friend,
the white man doctor measures me now at six feet,

255
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.630
two inches and weighs me at 235 pounds.

256
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.890
So we're talking about a big dude.
Wouldn't leg was no joke,

257
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.410
man.
I don't know.

258
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:23.090
Like I grew up in New England and when you go to how old houses in New England

259
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:27.380
that were built in the 17 hundreds I don't know if you know this,
but they're,

260
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.520
the ceilings are lower.
The doors are lower because people were shorter.

261
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.060
Like all people were shorter.
So can you imagine being,

262
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.160
you know where the average height is?
Probably five,

263
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:41.540
five and wooden leg is six two monster guy.
Yup.

264
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.580
So now they're,
they're east.
Talk a little bit about,
just again,

265
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:50.160
this continued on with his life,
living in black hills.

266
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.260
<v 0>Here we hunted the game and the enemy crows and she'll Shoney's.</v>

268
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.810
And here we lived in every way,

269
00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:02.560
the life of the plains Indians of those times.

270
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.560
It was not an idol existence.

271
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:10.240
We were busy much of the time fighting or enemies or gathering food and clothing

272
00:18:10.241 --> 00:18:11.680
and sheltering skins.

273
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.063
<v 1>Okay.</v>

274
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.600
<v 0>As we were camped on the lower tongue river when I was about nine years old,</v>

275
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:21.910
one morning a Harold started to cry out.
All of our horses are gone.
Their fold,

276
00:18:21.911 --> 00:18:23.510
a lively stir among the young men,

277
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:26.660
a party have them mounted on a few horses that had been overlooked by the

278
00:18:26.661 --> 00:18:29.750
Raiders and hurried away on the trail of thin snow.

279
00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:33.530
Help them in the late afternoon.
They caught up with the last heard,

280
00:18:33.531 --> 00:18:36.830
apparently abandoned,
but after a search of the vicinity,

281
00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:39.710
they discovered that somebody was in a canyon cave there.

282
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.270
One of the Cheyanne's crawled into the cave in an endeavor to verify the

283
00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:45.110
supposition.

284
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.330
The verification came in the form of an Arrow that hit him in the right eye.

285
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.150
He quickly backed out.
Everybody bring wood.
The Cheyenne leader ordered.

286
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.080
They built a fire at the caves opening with blankets.

287
00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:03.110
They fan the flames and the smoke into the hole.

288
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:08.710
The prisoners fanned outward and throw sticks at the fire heap to push it away,

289
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.210
bring more would the leader called the one sided contest went on until the two

290
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:18.920
crow Indian men burst out from the cave,
almost suffocated.
And in desperation,

291
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.600
the first one was beaten and stabbed to death by their surrounding Cheyanne's.

292
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.310
The second one got past them spraying upon one of their horses and dashed away.

293
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.750
The Cheyanne's pursued him.
He happened to mount a slow animal,

294
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.400
so it was not long before the chase developed into a beating by pony whips and

295
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:41.010
handles.
The Cro suddenly jerked his mount to a sand.

296
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.890
Still at the same moment.

297
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.360
He flashed out as sheath knife and made a vicious sideways stab.

298
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.440
The blade buried itself on the breast of a Cheyenne who fell dead.

299
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.280
The other Cheyanne's rushed upon the crow in a twinkling.

300
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.670
He had received many death blows from various weapons.

301
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.680
Somebody scalped him and they caught off his feet,
hands and head

302
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.760
again.
It's interesting.
Well,
what did they do?
They got a guy in a,
in a situation,

303
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.310
you know,
they've got him trapped in a cave.
How did it get him out of there?
Well,

304
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:17.280
what would we do nowadays?
Oh,
maybe we throw some tear gas in there.
Well,

305
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:19.440
what do they do?
Build a fire.
Smoke 'em out.

306
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.180
<v 0>A little bit more about the life of the Cheyanne's.</v>

308
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.450
Competitive sports used to interest us.
Horse races,

309
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.820
foot races,
wrestling matches,

310
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.560
target shooting with guns or arrows tossing the arrows by hand.
Swimming,
jumping,

311
00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:47.000
or other light contest were entered upon in the tribes.

312
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.340
Competition was usually between men representing the three warrior societies.

313
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.263
So inside,

314
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.270
so inside the tribe there was three separate warrior societies like D,

315
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.820
three different clubs.
Basically back to the book.

316
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:05.410
These were the elk warriors,
the crazy dog warriors,
and the Fox warriors.

317
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.100
If any Sioux tribe or big band camp jointly or big band jointly camp jointly

318
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:16.060
with us.
The matches were between representatives of the two tribes.

319
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.610
That's where made on every kind of contest.
The stakes were of guns,
ammunitions,

320
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:26.020
bows,
arrows,
blankets,
horses,
robes,
jewelry,

321
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.790
shirts,
leggings,
moccasins,
everything.
In the line of personal property,

322
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.610
the bedding always was on even terms.

323
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.260
Articles were piled upon a blanket matched articles in opposition to another.

324
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.220
The winners took all and shouted over the victory.

325
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.260
<v 3>Okay,</v>

326
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.040
<v 0>so these guys were heavily involved in competition because competition makes you</v>

327
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.870
better.
This reminds me of the seal teams.

328
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:51.700
Like everything in the seal teams is a competition.

329
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.250
I don't care what you're doing,
you get you.
Your buddy says,
hey,

330
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:56.860
you want it to go for just a mellow run on the beach?
And you're like,
yeah,
sure,

331
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:58.520
no problem.
[inaudible] you're an a,

332
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.810
you're throwing up from it at the end cause you're pushing each other so hard.

333
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.140
Every thing,
every time you get on the range,
it's a shooting contest.

334
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.890
Every time you go,
everything you do is you know,
you go for a skydive.
Oh,

335
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:11.110
how close did you get to the tea?
You know when you land.

336
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.710
So everything is a contest and that's how these guys are doing this.

337
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.770
What keeps them sharp?

338
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.903
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

339
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.050
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

340
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:24.050
A good wrestler and general strong man was little Hawk and so this,

341
00:22:24.631 --> 00:22:29.100
this one here,
that Little Hawk and a guy named Buffalo Hump and brave wolf,

342
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.173
they,
they

343
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.900
go round and they meet up with another tribe and they roll in and he says,

344
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.320
we need meat.
They announced you're drying.

345
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:43.740
Polls are too full and we think our wants can be supplied here.

346
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.480
Little Hawk wants to wrestle for it.
If anybody here can throw him,

347
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.550
we shall not take any food from this lodge.

348
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.310
Nobody wanted to accept this challenge.

349
00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:58.311
The young men took some meat and went on to another tepee there.

350
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.560
They made the same kind of announcement and proposition there.
Likewise,

351
00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:06.561
all the men present fear to grapple with Little Hawk and there are also the

352
00:23:06.691 --> 00:23:11.691
three joking robbers help themselves from the bountiful store at the next tp.

353
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.530
The transaction was more complex.
After some exchange of talk,

354
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.550
the spokesmen of the lodge said,
big thigh is here.

355
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.990
He says he will wrestle you now.
I'll tell you right now,

356
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.800
I don't want to wrestle big thigh,
right?

357
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.260
No big thighs sounds like he's got some game.

358
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.540
The conditions of the match were agreed upon,

359
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.640
but two men stripped to the breach cloths,

360
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.960
a group of onlookers assembled the group soon became a great crowd,

361
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.990
big Fi and little hawk appeared equally confident.

362
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.790
Both of them rushed into the grapple.
They tugged and shoved and tripped.

363
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.130
The advantage seemed to shift back and forth.

364
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.930
The throng of spectators whooped and danced.
There was some partisan cheering,

365
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.680
but most of it was merely the expression of delight as witnessing this tribal

366
00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:02.480
championship battle.
After several minutes of fierce and continuous struggling,

367
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.670
Little Hawk begin to weaken and wilt big five pinion,

368
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.780
the arms of his antagonist and bore him face downward to the ground.

369
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.830
God is back.

370
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.790
The victor sat a stride the back of the vanquished and sprinkled handfuls of

371
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:20.720
dirt upon him.

372
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.900
He also picked up a folded blanket nearing by nearby and use this as a soft club

373
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:29.750
and pretense at a beating into complete submission.

374
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.970
The defeated little hawk,
that's a legit Jujitsu match right there.

375
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.010
Got the,
got the back,
got the back mount,
got the submission.

376
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.470
Well he took it a little far with a rolled up blanket.
Yeah.
Yeah.

377
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:49.210
But it was still only a blanket.
He was being cool about it.
You didn't,
you know,

378
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.020
didn't cut his head,
hands and feet off and know that that's for sure.

379
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.870
So another thing that's interesting is just how they were organized and they,

380
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.430
and their leadership,
the way they were set up.
So here we go back to the book,

381
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.520
the Warrior Societies where the foundation of tribal government among the

382
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.363
Cheyanne's,

383
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.290
that is the number the members of the warrior societies elected the chiefs

384
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:12.050
who've governed the people every 10 years,

385
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:15.980
the whole tribe would get together for the special purpose of choosing 40 big

386
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:16.814
chiefs.

387
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.330
These 40 would then select for past chiefs or old men chiefs to serve as supreme

388
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:27.080
advisers to them.
And the tribe,

389
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.340
there were not any hereditary chiefs.
Among the Cheyanne's.

390
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.210
So that's a pretty cool system.
I liked that system.

391
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.550
I think I liked that system better than our system right now.

392
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.400
They ended up with a day they kind of elect 40 chiefs and then from those 40

393
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:48.050
chiefs,
those 40 chiefs take three more or four more to make the old men chief.

394
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.090
So at one point they decide that they're going to move camp,

395
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.650
which they do from time to time,

396
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.870
and they the the leaders in the morning,

397
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.280
they make an announcement and here it is all Cheyanne's open your ears and

398
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:06.800
listen.
Tomorrow morning we moved to tongue river.

399
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.800
Have your lodges down yourselves and Horses Ready.

400
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.310
The Fox warriors will lead us the next morning as we all prepared for the move.

401
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.030
The Fox warriors assembled out,

402
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:19.580
forward in the direction of the intended movement.

403
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.320
The old man heralded instructed them.

404
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.450
You are the leaders today.
Make all the people obey you,

405
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.210
make them stay in their proper places.

406
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:37.190
If any of them disobey our ordinary rules of travel,
you may pony whip them.

407
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.070
You may shoot their horses,
you may kill their dogs,

408
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.320
you may break their guns or their bows.

409
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.600
You may punish them in any way that seems to you best,

410
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.780
except you are not allowed to kill any Cheyenne.

411
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.110
That's one of the rules.
You're going to hear that throughout.

412
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:56.940
They're not allowed to kill each other no matter what,
and you know this is,

413
00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:59.930
I'm kind of an iron hand way of ruling.
Hey,

414
00:26:59.931 --> 00:27:02.040
if you get out of line on this road march,
we're going to do,

415
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.030
you're going to feel the pain so they're not going to get much resistance.

416
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.953
<v 1>Now,</v>

417
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.790
<v 0>speaking of weapons,
and you'd heard him talking about breaking bows,</v>

418
00:27:13.791 --> 00:27:17.330
and this is just kind of giving you some insight on what they use for weapons.

419
00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:22.070
The Arrow was the preferred weapon went on a tribal hunt in buffalo herd on a

420
00:27:22.071 --> 00:27:23.840
large party.
We're joined in pursuit.

421
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.060
Each rider shot Arrow after Arrow into whatever animal was convenient to him

422
00:27:29.061 --> 00:27:33.050
during the tunnel of the running chase.
When it ended,

423
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.800
he had one or two more arrows in various dead buffalo scattered over the area by

424
00:27:39.081 --> 00:27:40.040
the flight of the herd.

425
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.520
Every man kept his own arrows and always marked in some peculiar manner near

426
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.360
whereby they could be identified.

427
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.050
So when the field was reviewed after the termination of the killing,

428
00:27:51.051 --> 00:27:54.050
he could find out which buffalo he had killed or it helped to kill.

429
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.020
It could be learned in such instance,

430
00:27:57.021 --> 00:28:01.070
which Arrow was the fatal one and which were of little or no importance.

431
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.760
Thus the claims to the skin and meat could be settled.

432
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.740
In case of a disagreement,

433
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:10.790
the chiefs decided to question gun bullets could not be distinguished from one

434
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:11.091
another.

435
00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:14.900
So the guns were used only when one man was hunting alone or when a small party

436
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:16.610
of special friends haunted together.

437
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.560
The guns also had to have powder and lead and caps,

438
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.420
which we did not always have on hand.

439
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.490
We could make arrows or we often recovered them from the dead animals.

440
00:28:27.491 --> 00:28:30.830
So that's just imagine you go to these big herd of buffaloes,

441
00:28:30.831 --> 00:28:33.080
a bunch of a bunch of Indians go in there.

442
00:28:33.081 --> 00:28:34.390
They're shooting them with all these digits.

443
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.520
Shoot every animal you see giant shooting and then eventually you find out which

444
00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:40.280
ones are dead.
You check a that that Arrow's mine got him in the heart.

445
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.080
I get some meetings there.
That's cool.

446
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:48.081
It so other people like me and you and you know 40 other guys were shooting,

447
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.060
just shooting 10 arrows in there.
Eight different guys shot this one.

448
00:28:53.061 --> 00:28:56.660
We all get it and then they can,
they can tell all I want to hit the heart.

449
00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.810
So you're the main guy,
you know.
Dang.
You get the skin.
Yep.

450
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.320
Okay.
Other weapons spears were used by the Cheyanne's.

451
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.580
The long and slender points might be of metal or they might be of stone or bone.

452
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.690
Great care was taken in.
It's coloring in general design.

453
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.100
The sue had knife sticks for fighting.
These had long shafts,

454
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.770
the same as a spear,
but instead of the attach point,

455
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:25.310
at the end there were three blades at the shaft side.

456
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.120
So that's kind of a unique look and weapon.
Yeah,
I kinda sounds mad.

457
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:36.650
Maxish you know,
a long spear with three knives sticking on it.
Yeah.

458
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:40.940
Hawaiians can add that to the little differently.
Put the shark,
the shark.

459
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.180
So it's like,
uh,
yeah,
it's,
it's pretty dope actually.

460
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.920
Don't want to get hit with the sharp teeth and not

461
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.880
talking about a little bit of the dress.

462
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:53.881
The earrings of an Indian often indicated his tribal stock or Cheyenne ear had

463
00:29:54.111 --> 00:29:59.111
but one piercing only one ring and this ring was looped directly through or

464
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:01.120
close up to the ear.

465
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.440
The Sioux war necklaces regularly and single strands,

466
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.130
Eagle feathers stuck up from the back hair of many Isu.

467
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.540
The number of such feathers a worn by any one man was supposed to to note the

468
00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:18.950
number of enemies he had killed.
The Cheyanne's never adopted this custom.

469
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.900
All the best clothing was taken along with him when any warrior where to set out

470
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.850
in search for a conflict.
The articles were put into a special bag.

471
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.840
Ordinarily a beautifully braid beaded buckskin pouch,

472
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.370
but perhaps a rawhide one and this was slung at one side of this horse.

473
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.710
The bag also contained extra moccasins,
beaded moccasins,
war bonnets,

474
00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:51.120
paints a mirror,
special medicine projects or anything else of this nature.

475
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.970
If a battle seemed about to occur,

476
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:59.150
the warriors first important preperatory act was to jerk off all his ordinary

477
00:30:59.731 --> 00:31:00.564
clothing.

478
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.780
He then heard we got out his fine garments if you had time to do so,

479
00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:09.930
he re braided his hair,
painted his face,
and his own peculiar way.

480
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.520
Did everything needful to prepare himself for presenting his most splendid

481
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:17.730
personal appearance.
That is,

482
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.370
he got himself ready to die.

483
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.030
<v 0>The idea of full dress and preparation for battle comes not from a belief that</v>

485
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.830
it will add to the fighting ability.

486
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:30.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

487
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:35.170
<v 0>The preparation is for death in case that should be the result of the conflict</v>

488
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:42.050
war bonnets.
We're not worn by all warriors.
In fact,

489
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.730
there are only a few such distinguished men in each warrior society of our
tribe.

490
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.100
It was expected that one should be a student of the fighting art for several

491
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.400
years,

492
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.400
or else that he'd be an unusually app learner before he should put the crown of

493
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:59.930
eagle feathers.

494
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

495
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.100
<v 0>He then did so upon his own initiatives,</v>

496
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
or perhaps because of the Commanderie urgings of his seniors.

497
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.170
The act made a profession of fully acquired ability in warfare,

498
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.150
a claim of special accomplishment in using cunning and common sense and cool

499
00:32:20.151 --> 00:32:24.020
calculation coupled with the bravery attributed to all warriors.

500
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.500
So if you want to get that big bad ass head dress,

501
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.010
I thought was pretty interesting,
you give it to yourself,
you know?

502
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.370
Now people can tell you you should.
You deserve it,
but you,
you make the claim,

503
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.550
you say,
Yup,
I'm the man and it's interesting.
I'm going to read those again.

504
00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.990
It means you have

505
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.430
acquired ability in warfare in using cunning,

506
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.080
commonsense,

507
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.270
cool calculation coupled with bravery.
Very,

508
00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:56.310
very good definition of a warrior right
back to the book.

509
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:00.120
The wearer was supposed never to ask.

510
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:05.150
MERCI in battle if some immature young man pretended to such high standing

511
00:33:05.971 --> 00:33:09.360
before it seemed to his companions that he ought to do so.

512
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.470
He was twitted and shamed into a his proper time.

513
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:19.440
I first put on my war bonnet when I was 33 years old,

514
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.500
14 years after I had quit the roaming life after a man had been accepted as a

515
00:33:26.341 --> 00:33:27.360
war bonnet.
Man,

516
00:33:27.361 --> 00:33:32.361
he remained so throughout his lifetime war chiefs and tribal chiefs ordinarily

517
00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:38.160
were warbonnet men,
but this was not a requirement for these positions.

518
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.200
Pure modesty might keep the bravest and most capable fighter from making the

519
00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:45.420
claim.
Also,

520
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.130
admittedly word the wearer of the war bonnet might not be chosen for or might

521
00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:52.200
refuse all official positions.

522
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

523
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.320
<v 0>The head,
the feathered head piece then was not a sign of public office.</v>

524
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.450
It was a token of individual and personal feeling as to his own fighting

525
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.120
capabilities.
Interesting.
Yeah.

526
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.250
It's interesting that he,

527
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.520
he obviously fought about the fact that some guys,

528
00:34:12.521 --> 00:34:14.890
we're too humble to claim the war bonnet and he will be,

529
00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:18.140
and he actually says some of the best and bravest and most capable of it.

530
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.140
I don't know.
I don't deserve it.
Yeah.
Which is,

531
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:25.210
which is in keeping with what we know about humility being the trait and the

532
00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:27.700
most critical trade of someone's success.

533
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.740
And it's also interesting that some of the people that were great fighters

534
00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:37.570
weren't necessarily going to be good leaders.
That's,
that's a reality.

535
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.220
It's a reality to this day.

536
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:44.550
It.
Here's a little bit about,

537
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.240
<v 1>okay,</v>

538
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.120
<v 0>they weight the,
the,
the way they treat each other,</v>

539
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.950
fighting between Cheyanne's either man or a woman.
Women was forbidden by law,

540
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.140
by the tribal laws.
In case of a fight,

541
00:34:56.141 --> 00:34:59.080
some chief near at hand would call out warrior,

542
00:34:59.081 --> 00:35:00.820
separate these fighters and whip them.

543
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.230
The warrior policemen on duty would respond to the call.

544
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:09.160
Abandon of them would give such punishment as seemed to them fitting.

545
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.930
If the fighters renewed their strife,
they might have punishment added,

546
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.670
might have their teepees torn down.

547
00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:18.940
Their horses killed property damage done to them in some other way.

548
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.500
Any suitable and sufficient punishment except no policemen,

549
00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:28.501
warrior nor anyone else could lawfully kill a Cheyenne Pony.

550
00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:32.830
Whips either the lashes or the heavy stick handles were not customary.

551
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:34.600
Attacking weapons in a personal fight.

552
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.760
Cheyenne's did not use as white people do.

553
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.920
Not often did any two women fight.
If they did,

554
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.900
they merely scratched and pulled hair.

555
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:50.670
It was more of a comic show than an alarming site to see two women calling each

556
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:51.504
other.

557
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.590
I never heard of any Cheyenne woman killing another nor maliciously killing a

558
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:58.920
man,
nor did the men kill women.

559
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.140
I used to hear old people talk about a Cheyenne named wounded elk who had beaten

560
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:06.480
his wife and then shot her killing her.

561
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.660
I never heard of any other case like that.

562
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.450
The incident happened before I was born.

563
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

564
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.260
<v 0>Suicides were not uncommon among us.
Men shop themselves.</v>

565
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:21.850
A women hung themselves.

566
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.410
Foolish ones yet do such acts.

567
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.980
It's interesting you says that they,

568
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.220
the Cheyennes did not use their fists as white people.

569
00:36:38.221 --> 00:36:42.300
Do you think we're talking straight grappling?
Yeah.
Right.
No strikes.

570
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.610
Strikes or does he,

571
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:48.150
is he saying that they struck in a different way and company and or something?

572
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:52.680
Yeah.
That's maybe didn't want to break their hands.
It's a pretty smart move.

573
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.800
Again,
a little bit more culture and,

574
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.630
and this is one is in wrapped in a little story to you.

575
00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:05.280
It's brothers found one time a wolf's den,

576
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.590
one of them took his lariat and crawled into the hillside cave to get pops.

577
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.600
He felt about in the darkness,

578
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.750
got the rope about a pups hind feet and dragged it out.

579
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.800
They knocked it in the head and he went in after another one.

580
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.720
This time either a pop or an old wolf bit his hand.

581
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.240
He retreated outside.

582
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:30.690
He got a fork stick with this projecting out in front of him.

583
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:33.030
He returned to attack upon the Wolfs,

584
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.860
the fork end,

585
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.180
the forked end gotten engaged in the hair and skin of the wolf.

586
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.840
That youth twisted and tugged backing out and dragging after him,

587
00:37:43.841 --> 00:37:47.920
the snarling and snapping animal.
The brother stood with his rifle,

588
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:49.480
poised and ready to shoot.

589
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.840
Limbs of brush diverted his arm and the bullet crashed into the head of the

590
00:37:54.851 --> 00:37:55.720
other boy.

591
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.870
The shocked and weeping brother put the dead body on a horse and took it to

592
00:38:01.871 --> 00:38:03.010
their home lodge.

593
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.150
People flock to see and hear you killed him in anger.

594
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.420
Somebody accused,
no,
it was an accident.

595
00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:13.900
He sobbed out and he explained how it occurred.

596
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.810
A group of warrior policemen went with him out to the wolf's den and there he

597
00:38:19.811 --> 00:38:24.370
reversed for their observation.
All the incidents of the happening,

598
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.050
they became fully satisfied that he had no intention to kill his brother,

599
00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.210
that it was truly accidental.

600
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.480
The youth was released with no penalty whatsoever.

601
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.970
Got a little blue on blue there.

602
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.020
Even the native Americans experience the blue on blue situations in the chaos

603
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:47.100
and confusion.
It's pretty,
you know,

604
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:52.130
you think about the two little kids crawl into a cave to kill wolves into or

605
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:55.660
wolf den.
That's awesome.

606
00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.090
Warrior culture,
pure warrior culture.
I love it.

607
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.050
Now we get into,

608
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.300
I guess I guess you'd call it their religion,
right?

609
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:15.220
And they call it the great medicine is what is what wooden leg refers to.

610
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.960
And I think the best,

611
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:20.830
as I looked up and tried to research what they mean by the word medicine,

612
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.840
I think the closest thing I got is,
is sort of like spirit,
spirituality,

613
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:26.471
spirit,

614
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:31.270
that that's kind of the word that it means to me is I tried to figure out

615
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.370
exactly what it meant.
I don't know if there's a great,

616
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.330
but you can see from the contexts what he means by it.
Yeah.

617
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.420
So here we go.
Back to the book.

618
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.480
I made medicine for the first time when I was 17 years old and 1875 to make

619
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:51.700
medicine is to engage upon a special period of fasting,

620
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.270
thanksgiving,
prayer and self denial,

621
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.340
even of self torture.

622
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.380
The procedure is an entirely devotional exercise.

623
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.440
The purpose is to subdue the passions of the flesh and to improve the spiritual

624
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:08.344
self,

625
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:13.780
the bodily abstinence and the mental concentration upon lofty thoughts,

626
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:18.810
cleanses both the body and the soul and puts them into or keeps them in health.

627
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

628
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.530
<v 0>Then the individual mind gets closer toward conformity with the mind of the</v>

629
00:40:28.081 --> 00:40:33.060
great medicine above us,
so that that's just awesome.

630
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.630
You know,
he's talking about fasting,

631
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.600
he's talking about focusing on on larger things.

632
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:43.440
He's talking about punishing yourself and and you know he's the term self

633
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.600
torture.
This is discipline.

634
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

635
00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:53.300
<v 0>So he goes to his medicine man,
a guy named red haired bear,</v>

636
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.660
red haired bear.
I want to make medicine.

637
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.790
I told him how he responded,
encouraged Lee,
and that's not a question.

638
00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:05.990
It's like the statement of how,
right?
How he responded.
Encourage me,

639
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.700
what number of days do you think you can endure?
The whole four days.

640
00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:14.960
I replied confidently,
how he glowed,
I will help you.

641
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.820
So he's getting,
I guess that's the,

642
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.580
I guess that's the Max limit that they go is four straight days.

643
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.980
So it's four straight days,
by the way,
on your own.

644
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.170
No food,
no water day.
That's what the deal is.

645
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:34.570
And you bear the the elements.
You can have like a little tent,
uh,

646
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.390
but you're going to bear the elements
as he's preparing to do it.
Here we go.

647
00:41:40.391 --> 00:41:40.901
Back to the book,

648
00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:45.520
the Medicine Man painted my whole body red clay mixed into water and the dish

649
00:41:45.521 --> 00:41:48.760
was used for most of the painting with the black paint.

650
00:41:48.761 --> 00:41:52.660
He made first a circle about my face,
including the forehead,

651
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:57.100
the Chin and the cheeks,
black wristlets and black anklets.

652
00:41:57.101 --> 00:41:59.980
We're next form on the middle of my breast,

653
00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:03.370
he painted a black son on my left shoulder blade.

654
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.140
He put a black moon.

655
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.310
This is going to be a hard trial for you.
The hardest trial you've ever had.

656
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.670
Throughout the four days,
you will have neither food nor water.

657
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.930
Your desires will distress you.
Other distresses may be piled upon these.

658
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.760
You may retreat now and postpone it for another time if you want to do so.

659
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.260
What?
Say you

660
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:26.650
<v 2>okay?</v>

661
00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:30.820
<v 0>I dread it.
I confessed,
but I know it will not kill me.</v>

662
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.570
I do not want to wait.
I want to go on right now.

663
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.310
I shall keep my courage from failing by fixing my thoughts upon being a good

664
00:42:40.311 --> 00:42:41.144
man.

665
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.313
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

666
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:48.180
<v 0>Legit.
Going into the,</v>

667
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:52.740
into the ceremony a little bit here.
He is hot,

668
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.220
thirsty,
yet more hot and more thirsty.

669
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.780
I prayed particularly for the strength of body and firmness of heart to carry me

670
00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:05.370
through to the end of the trial.
I loaded my pipe for a saucing smoke,

671
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.810
but it was not a solace.
The heat burned my already parching tongue.

672
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.710
I tried to sleep.
Maybe I did sleep.
I do not know.

673
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:16.020
I made attempts to meditate quietly.

674
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.190
I do not know whether I was actually thinking or is following dreams racing

675
00:43:20.191 --> 00:43:21.900
through my mind's mind.

676
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.060
All I could be sure about was that I was either sitting down or lying down all

677
00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:31.320
the time
and,
and by the way,

678
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.170
when they smoke the pipe.

679
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:35.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

680
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.730
<v 0>From what I could figure out,
he,</v>

681
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.740
they're pretty much smoking generally tobacco with sometimes other herbs that

682
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:47.900
they sometimes would mix with the tobacco,
willow bark,

683
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.540
Sumac,
white sage,

684
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:55.160
just kind of other plants and herbs

685
00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.920
back to the book.
Oh,
how lonely I was.

686
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.730
I loaded and lit my pipe.
No,
it was not good.
My mouth and throat,

687
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:06.620
we're burning water,
water,

688
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.610
but the great medicine sees me.

689
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.640
I kept thinking my thoughts world and chased each other rapidly in circles.

690
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

691
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.330
<v 0>I dreamt that I heard the footsteps of a horse.</v>

692
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.220
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

693
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.270
<v 0>Hey,
wooden leg.</v>

694
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

695
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.280
<v 0>Hey,
this is the day.</v>

696
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:25.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

697
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.350
<v 0>Happiness almost filled my heart.</v>

698
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.620
The only hindrance was in the thirst and the hot body.

699
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.060
After I'd been let out,
we smoked together.
It was a torture to my tongue,

700
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:40.770
but I did not complain.
We went then to my father's lodge in the camp.

701
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.400
My father called out an invitation to old men friends.

702
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.410
They came and sat in a circle upon the robe spread over the largest floor.

703
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.050
I sat with them by the side of my father.

704
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.980
My mother brought a bucket full of water and set it off a little distance from

705
00:44:55.981 --> 00:45:00.480
me.
I suppressed a strong desire to plunge my face into it,

706
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.660
but I could not keep my eyes from staring at it.

707
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.040
Wouldn't leg you have been four days without water.

708
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.680
Now you may drink four sips.
I seize the sides of the bucket.

709
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.810
The four sips.
We're for long drawn mouthfuls.

710
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.790
I waited for more advice.
Wooden leg.

711
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:28.380
You have been four days without meat.
Take four sliced off bites,

712
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:33.090
one for each day of the fast.
I selected a chunk from the plate.

713
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:38.070
I stuck the end of it foreign to my mouth and with a sheath knife.
I cut it off.

714
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.660
I was,
the chewing was vigorous and I soon had it swallowed.

715
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.270
The chunk was pushed a second time into my mouth and it's end caught off there.

716
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.230
A third and fourth mouthful were taken in the same manner.
After a few minutes,

717
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:56.730
more meat was allowed to me then still more.
All I care to eat.

718
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.240
It was the best meat I ever tasted

719
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.900
and I talked about that the other day.

720
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.930
If like the recalibration of knowing what it's like to actually feel hungry and

721
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.380
then how good food tastes when you haven't eaten for a while.
Yeah,

722
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:17.390
it tastes good and that's what he feeling the best meet the ever days did right

723
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:18.264
there.
Boom.

724
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.580
Now that's one little ceremony that he went through and he did.

725
00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.270
He does some more of that.

726
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.730
The second medicine experience he does was about a month after that one and he

727
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.940
did two days instead of four.
So it's something that you kind of,

728
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.180
these warriors would kind of continually keep up with.

729
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.310
And back to the book here for his third season of warrior discipline,

730
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.860
I went one morning at dawn to the top of a hill there.
I fasted,
prayed,
meditated,

731
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.810
and dreamed all day.

732
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:57.560
Another disciplinary means for subduing the flesh was to stand upright all day

733
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:00.360
from sunrise to sunset on a hill.

734
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:05.670
The divo d did not move during that time except to keep his face turned at all

735
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:07.110
times towards the Sun.

736
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.310
He might keep his eyes closed or shaded.

737
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:16.290
But as countenance had to be presented ever towards the veteran rated token of

738
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:18.240
the great medicines existence,

739
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.980
he prayed or otherwise kept his thoughts fixed on a high plane.

740
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.630
This system of self denial was varied by attitude taken.

741
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.830
One might stand all day or sit in one position all day or lie down during all

742
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:37.270
the time.
But the attitude assumed at the beginning must be kept to the end.

743
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.470
My all day supplications were made while sitting down,

744
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:47.370
standing upright in water from sunrise to sunset was one way of putting the body

745
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:48.910
under the rule of the spirit.

746
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.460
The water had to be into up to the neck or the upper breast,

747
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.940
not any drink of it was taken.

748
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.290
It was not permissible to move the body except for keeping the face towards the

749
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:03.124
sun.

750
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.540
So just go get in the water and you know these guys are in.

751
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.920
But you know these guys are in Montana,
right?
Right there in Montana.

752
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.800
Just Fyi,
I don't care if it's the middle of the summer,

753
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.470
the water and Montana is cold.
It's not cold.
No,
it's not.
Cool.

754
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:25.700
And it's also interesting that you all different military units do this kind of

755
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:28.300
stuff.
You know,
just going out and standing at attention,

756
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.060
which they make you do in the military,
which is when you're standing,
you know,

757
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.530
are wrecked with your hands at your side,

758
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.860
you're not allowed to move you that for hours and hours and hours.

759
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.900
It's interesting.
It's like that's,
that's not just a coincidence is it?

760
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.970
You know what I mean?
There is a discipline there.

761
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:46.870
There's a discipline of the body in doing that and it puts you in touch with

762
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:47.800
your soul.

763
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.460
You stand there long enough and then like I going through seal training,

764
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.490
you know,
you don't think you spend some time neck deep in water.

765
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:59.580
Just dissuading indeed gold and enduring.
Absolutely man.

766
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.340
Yoga can kind of be that,
you know,
like certain poses.

767
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:07.190
I mean to compare that as far as the magnitudes different.
But yes,

768
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.420
definitely do that.
You ever did like wall sits?
Yeah.

769
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:14.860
That's another one man where it feels physical,
physical,

770
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:17.920
but at the end of the day it's mental.
Yup.
Like you just want to be okay,

771
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:21.400
I'm done.
But the thing you don't,
you can endure it,

772
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.840
but it's a lot man.
Yeah,
the wall sits are painful after awhile.

773
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.080
And then he goes on to say the bodily torture incident to the full standard.

774
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.460
Great medicine dance.

775
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.580
What the white people call the sun dance was the most severe test of hardy hood.

776
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.510
So it was looked upon as the highest form of self scourging.

777
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.310
I never undertook this extreme step.
So the Sundance,

778
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.330
if you don't know anything about that,

779
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:54.331
it's like all all multiday fast with physical exertion,

780
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.583
with

781
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.570
borderlines self towards like didn't do piercings and slay the skin open.

782
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:06.040
I mean it's,
it's hardcore and,
and it got banned for a while and it will no one,

783
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.970
uh,

784
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:11.230
the natives don't want people to like watch it or record it because it's their

785
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:14.740
own personal thing.
So anyways,
you can probably do more research on,

786
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:19.210
it's called the sun dance,
but they do all kinds of really,
really hardcore stuff.

787
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:21.930
It's,
it's just,
you know,
some,
you know,

788
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.460
devastating hard stuff to go through that hardens.
You're so loved.

789
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:31.280
And then
is the one more interesting thing here.

790
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.181
Back to the book,

791
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:37.181
the face painting as it was done for me by red haired beard bear at my first

792
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:42.740
medicine making was adopted as my fixed mode of battle preparation.

793
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:46.220
In this regard.
It was a black ring about my face,

794
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:50.270
including lower forehead,
chin,
and cheeks in its circle.

795
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.320
All of the surface enclosed in that circle was painted yellow.

796
00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:00.370
I kept at all times right at hand a supply of charcoal and yellow clay paint.

797
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.390
It did not take long for me to apply them when an occasion for their need might

798
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:09.710
come with this preparation with my best clothing,
my shield,

799
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.660
my eagle wing bone whistle,

800
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.470
myself and my horse protected by the grass seed medicine.

801
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.520
I was almost fearless.
I was not entirely so,

802
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:24.580
but almost in every time of danger I tried to keep myself thinking the great

803
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:29.840
medicine sees me.
Now.
Um,
there's a,

804
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:34.340
there's a note,
a historical note that's written now.

805
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:38.660
It's going out of the out of wooden legs voice and it's going into a doctor

806
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:39.920
marquee,
the translator,

807
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:43.640
and he's going to put a little note here and I'm going to read it back to the

808
00:51:43.641 --> 00:51:47.630
book.
In December,
1875 pursuant to our governmental policy,

809
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.170
General Sherman then commander in chief of the United States army issued an

810
00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:52.430
important general order.

811
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:57.560
He proclaimed that all Indians found off the reservations after the last day of

812
00:51:57.561 --> 00:51:59.480
January,

813
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.560
1876 would be regarded as hostels to be fought by military forces.

814
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:09.110
It being evident that not many of the Dakota roamers in Montana would return to

815
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:11.510
reservations until they were forced to do so.

816
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.980
Bodies of soldiers were set in motion for seeking out and driving these wanders

817
00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:19.460
back within their assigned territorial bounds.

818
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.260
The active military field leaders in this campaign war Brigadier General Terry

819
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.010
Brigadier General Crook,
Colonel Gibbon,
and Lieutenant Colonel Custer.

820
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.820
Each of these four officers had been prevented.

821
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:39.980
Major General of volunteers during the civil war and what that prevented means

822
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:44.981
that it's like you get a temporary promotion to fill a billet,

823
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.250
but you're not getting paid for it and then after it you get put back.

824
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.620
But the contracting of the army after the war set each of them back to a lower

825
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:55.454
ranking.

826
00:52:55.910 --> 00:53:00.910
Terry had infantry from fort rice and Custer's seventh cavalry from Fort

827
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:06.050
Lincoln.
Dakota truck had a force of cavalry and infantry at Fort Fetterman,

828
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:07.700
Wyoming gave it,

829
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:12.230
had infantry from Fort Shaw and cavalry from Fort Ellis,
Montana.

830
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.660
From there,
three basic points in Dakota and Wyoming and Montana.

831
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:21.740
The three bodies of soldiers move towards a common central area between powder,

832
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.040
between the powder in big Horn rivers in Montana where the Indians being sought

833
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:26.874
were roaming.

834
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.990
The details of these military movements are too extensive for review here.

835
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.950
The most thrilling phase of the campaign began when Custer and his seventh

836
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:39.660
cavalry set off up Rosebud Valley to follow a recent Indian trail.

837
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.480
The result of this subsidiary proceeding was the supreme tragedy in the annals

838
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:47.760
of our American front to your warfare.

839
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.210
And of course that was the battle of little big horn.

840
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.493
<v 3>Now,</v>

841
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:59.050
<v 0>like I like it,
like you just stated,</v>

842
00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:04.110
you had these groups and they're out in the plains and there I guess tracking

843
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:10.480
each other,
or at least the,
the soldiers,
the US soldiers,

844
00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:12.550
the calvary or tracking the Indians.

845
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.040
And here we go back to the book,

846
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.910
and this is back to the voice of our man wouldn't leg.

847
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.710
We found the soldiers about seven or eight o'clock in the morning.

848
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.440
I believe we'd slept only a little.
Our horses were very tired,

849
00:54:29.441 --> 00:54:31.270
so we did not hurry our attack.

850
00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:37.260
But always in such cases there are eager or foolish ones who begin to soon,

851
00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.240
not long after we arrived there was fighting on the hillsides and all the little

852
00:54:43.241 --> 00:54:47.680
valley where the soldier camp in this early fighting,

853
00:54:47.681 --> 00:54:50.080
one of the young Cheyenne foolishly charged to foreign,

854
00:54:50.081 --> 00:54:52.570
some Indians belonging to the soldiers got after him.

855
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.670
So I'm gonna read that again

856
00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:00.940
in this early fighting one young Cheyenne foolishly charged too far and some

857
00:55:00.941 --> 00:55:03.610
Indians belonging to the soldiers got after him.

858
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:09.010
So you have this whole,
this whole war is there's,

859
00:55:09.011 --> 00:55:13.060
there's Indians or native Americans that are on both sides.
Yeah.

860
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:17.400
There's native Americans that are working with the,
with the u s cavalry and the,

861
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:21.400
and the soldiers.
And then they're fighting against other native American tribes.

862
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:24.103
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

863
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.920
<v 0>So back to the book,
they shot and crippled his horse.</v>

864
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.250
I and some other Cheyanne's drove back the pursuers.

865
00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.130
I took the young man behind me on my horse,

866
00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:38.990
and we hurried a way to the main body of our warriors.
Jack Red Cloud,

867
00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:44.260
the son of an of the old Ogallala chief red cloud was wearing a war bonnet.

868
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:50.630
His horse was killed according to the Indian way.
In such case,

869
00:55:50.631 --> 00:55:54.560
the warrior was supposed to stop and take off the bridal from his killed horse

870
00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:57.350
to show how cool he could conduct himself.

871
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.320
But young red cloud forgot to do this.

872
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:04.820
He went running as soon as it's horse fell.
Three crows on horseback,

873
00:56:04.821 --> 00:56:09.230
followed him lash team with their pony whips and jerked off and kept his war

874
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:11.840
bonnet.
They did not try to kill him.

875
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:15.950
They only teased him telling him he was a boy and not not to be worrying a war

876
00:56:15.951 --> 00:56:20.390
bonnet.
Some of his two friends interfered and the crows went away.

877
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.390
The sue told us that young red cloud crying and ask him for mercy from the
crows.

878
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.190
He was my same age,
18 years old,
white wolf,

879
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.500
a Cheyenne,
almost 30 years old,

880
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:36.760
how to repeating rifle and drawing his weapon from its scabbard at his left
side.

881
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:41.380
It was accidentally just discharged.
The bullet broke his left five bone.

882
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.910
He finally recovered and is and is yet living and this was in 1930 he still

883
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:49.930
limps on account of that accident,
a wound.
Those are two just little.

884
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:53.700
First of all,

885
00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:57.930
you know young red cloud who was wearing a war bonnet any and he's supposed to

886
00:56:57.931 --> 00:57:00.950
show how cool he is if his horse gets shot and take that bridal with you.
He,

887
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.640
he did not do that.
Yeah.
And then again,
this is an accidental discharge,

888
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.390
which it does happen occasionally.

889
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.330
It's really bad to have accidental discharge,
obviously,

890
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.800
especially when you shoot yourself in the leg.
Horrible.

891
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.650
So they stay,

892
00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:25.120
they continue moving around and they start to move towards little big horn.

893
00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.950
This,
this river,
and back to the book,

894
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:33.951
six Apropos Arapaho men came to the Cheyenne camp while we were at this place.

895
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.780
They said they were afraid of soldiers as they had killed a white man on powder

896
00:57:39.781 --> 00:57:44.280
river.
And so now you start to get,
and I'm,
I'm again,

897
00:57:44.281 --> 00:57:47.910
I'm kind of a moving quickly right now,

898
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.960
but there's now multiple tribes are starting to come together in this,

899
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:59.250
in this location.
Multiple tribes.
Each back to the book,

900
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.890
each tribe operated its own internal government.

901
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.830
The same as if it were entirely separated from the others.

902
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.340
The chiefs of the different tribes met together as equals.

903
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:12.360
There was only one who's considered as being above all others.

904
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.740
This was sitting bull.

905
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:19.020
He was recognized as the one old man chief of all the camps combined.

906
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:23.790
Almost all of our northern Cheyenne tribe were with us on Ligal.

907
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:24.720
Little Big Horn.

908
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.580
Only a few of our 40 big chiefs were were absent.
And this is,

909
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.230
this is interesting because there's a lot of controversy about how many Indians

910
00:58:34.231 --> 00:58:37.770
were there and he,
and some people say that wasn't that many.

911
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.340
He saying all of them,
he seen all,

912
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:42.000
at least all the Cheyanne's were there and there was more than just the
Cheyenne.

913
00:58:42.001 --> 00:58:44.670
So there had to be a bunch of them,
a bunch of them there.

914
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.600
Now we get into it,
some of these different

915
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.150
tribes and chiefs that were there,

916
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:02.370
the principal chiefs of the various camps were for the,

917
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.020
for the home cook.
Papa's was sitting bull,

918
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:12.360
the Ogallala,
Lowe's was crazy horse,
which we all have heard a crazy horse.

919
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.660
The mini cars,
you was lame deer.

920
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:21.120
Another tribe called arrows all gone and they had an important chief called

921
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.140
Hump,
knows there was the black feet,
which,

922
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.580
which wouldn't leg didn't know who's their chief.
And then you had the cha,

923
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.590
the Cheyanne's.
So there's a bunch,

924
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.200
I mean a massive number of native American warriors

925
00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.810
talking about their armor mint back to the book.

926
00:59:37.811 --> 00:59:39.700
Guns were not plentiful among us.

927
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.540
Most of our hunting had been with bows and arrows of the Cheyanne's,

928
00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.270
two moons and White Wolf.
Each had a repeating rifle.

929
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.790
Some others had single shot breech loading rifles,

930
00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.280
but there was not much ammunition for the good guns.

931
00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.260
So you there,
they're mostly using bone arrows,
right?
That's,

932
00:59:56.261 --> 00:59:57.400
that's Kinda what they have.

933
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.700
And at one point they kind of take their horses and they put 'em out to graze

934
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.530
and they think that they had a little,

935
01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.860
they had gotten a little scrap with the soldiers and they kind of walked them.

936
01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:09.491
Not Bad,

937
01:00:09.491 --> 01:00:13.360
but they just sort of beat him and it seemed like the soldiers retreated and so

938
01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:14.320
they put their soldiers out.

939
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:17.080
I mean they put their horses out to pasture and it seems like things are going

940
01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.910
pretty mellow.
And I'll go back to the book.

941
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:22.090
I had no thought then of any fighting to be done in the near future.

942
01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:25.750
We driven away the soldiers on the upper rows bed seven days ago.

943
01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.140
It seemed likely they would be gone a long time before they would trouble us

944
01:00:29.141 --> 01:00:29.920
again.

945
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.840
My mind was occupied mostly by such thoughts as regularly are uppermost in the

946
01:00:34.841 --> 01:00:36.280
minds of young men.

947
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.420
I was 18 years old and I like girls.

948
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:45.940
That night we had a dance.
It was an entirely social affair for young people,

949
01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:50.860
not ceremony,
not a ceremonial or war dance.
So here is,

950
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.200
they've kind of gotten a scrap seven days ago.

951
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.610
They feel like they're pretty safe.

952
01:00:54.611 --> 01:00:59.200
They put their horses out to pasture and then he starts thinking about the

953
01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:00.180
ladies,
right.

954
01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:05.920
And they basically party through the whole night.
Back to the book.

955
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:10.060
At the first sign of dawn,
the dance ended and then him and his brother,

956
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:11.520
they,

957
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.520
they kind of take off and they go down by the river and fall asleep and that's

958
01:01:17.321 --> 01:01:21.680
the end of their night.
Back to the book in my sleep,

959
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.580
I dreamed that a great crowd of people were making lots of noise.

960
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.620
Something in the noise startled me.

961
01:01:27.621 --> 01:01:29.990
I found myself wide awake sitting up and listening,

962
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.570
my brother to awaken and we both jumped to our feet.

963
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.810
A great commotion was going on among the camps.
We heard shooting.

964
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:38.410
We hurried across.
We hurried out from the trees.

965
01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:43.340
So we might see as well as hear the shooting was somewhere at the upper part of

966
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:46.820
the camp circles.
It looked as if all the Indians were there.

967
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.680
There were running away toward the hills to the westward or down toward our end

968
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:52.514
of the village.

969
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.050
Women were screaming and men were letting out war cries through it all.

970
01:01:57.051 --> 01:02:01.910
We could hear old men calling.
Soldiers are here.
Young men go out and fight them.

971
01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:03.690
<v 3>Okay,</v>

972
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:08.000
<v 0>so there they go.
They thought they were peaceful,
but they're about to get it on.</v>

973
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.410
And as he talked about before,
what does he do to prepare for battle?
He,

974
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.050
we go back to the book.
I jerked off my ordinary clothing.

975
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:20.051
I jerked on a pair of new breaches that had been given to me by another sue.

976
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.250
I had a good cloth shirt and I put it on my old moccasins were kicked off in a

977
01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:27.510
pair of beaded moccasins,
substituted for them.

978
01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:31.680
My father strapped a blanket upon my horse and arrange my raw hide Lyria into a

979
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:36.630
bridle.
He stood holding my mouth,
hurry.
He urged me.
I was hurting,

980
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.620
but I was not yet ready.
I got my paints in my little mirror.
I,

981
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.770
the blue black circle soon appeared around my face.

982
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.790
The red and yellow colorings were applied on all skin of the inns inside the

983
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:52.650
circle.
I comb my hair.
It properly should have been oiled and braided neatly,

984
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:54.540
but my father was again saying hurry,

985
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.680
so I just looped a buckskin thong about it and tied it up close to the back of

986
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:01.230
my head to float loose.
From there,

987
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.520
my bullets caps and powder horn put me into full readiness.

988
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.900
In a moment afterward,

989
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:10.950
I was on my horse going as fast as I could run to where all the rest of the

990
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:13.590
young men were going.
My brother had already gone.

991
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:18.300
He got his horse before I got mine and his dressing was only a buck strings

992
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:20.700
shirt fringe with crow Indian hair.

993
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.180
The hair had been taking from a cro and a past battle with them.

994
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.990
The air was so full of dust,
I could not see where to go,

995
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.480
but it was not needful that I see that far.

996
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.080
I kept my horse headed in the direction of movement by the crowd of Indians on

997
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:34.914
horseback.

998
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:40.080
I was led out and around and a far beyond the camp circle.

999
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.900
Many hundreds of Indians on horseback word day,

1000
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:46.950
dashing to and fro in front of the soldiers.
The soldiers were on level ground.

1001
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.360
The soldiers were on the level valley ground and we're shooting with rifles.

1002
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.850
Not many bullets were being sent back at them,

1003
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:56.880
but thousands of arrows were falling among them.

1004
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.560
I went with a throng of sue until we got beyond the behind the white men.

1005
01:04:01.561 --> 01:04:05.520
So you got a flight going on and they're starting to surround the white men.

1006
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.960
By this time though,

1007
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.930
they had mounted their horses and we're hiding themselves and the timber,

1008
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.710
a band of Indians were there with the soldiers.

1009
01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.350
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1010
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:19.600
<v 0>It appeared they were cro or show,
Shoney's.</v>

1011
01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.700
Most of the Indians had fled back up the valley somewhere across east of the

1012
01:04:24.701 --> 01:04:28.930
river and we're riding away over beyond the hills.
So there you go.

1013
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.071
This is what happens.

1014
01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:35.071
You wake is woken up and gets his war gear on and he's going into battle.

1015
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.410
And interestingly,
you know,

1016
01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:41.170
he talks about there's other Indians that they're fighting the crows and

1017
01:04:41.171 --> 01:04:43.660
Shoshone is,
it sounds like most of them are baling.

1018
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:45.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1019
01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.430
<v 0>Back to the book.
Are Indian crowded down toward the timber?</v>

1020
01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:53.200
Where were the soldiers?
More and more of our people kept coming.

1021
01:04:53.201 --> 01:04:54.460
Almost all of them were sue.

1022
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:59.560
There were only a few Cheyanne's arrows were showered into the timber.

1023
01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:03.760
Bullets whistled out of the s out toward the Sioux and Cheyenne [inaudible],

1024
01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.990
but we stayed far back while we extended our curve line further and further

1025
01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:11.290
around the big grove of trees.
So they're in circling them.

1026
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:16.450
Some dead soldiers had been left among the grass and sage brush where they,

1027
01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:17.560
at first us,

1028
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.320
it seemed to me the remainder of them would not live many hours longer.

1029
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.300
Sue were creeping forward to set fire to the timber.

1030
01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.280
You're going to set fire to the woods that they're hiding in back to the book.

1031
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:37.030
Suddenly the hidden soldiers came tearing out on horseback from the wood.

1032
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.630
I was around on that side where they came out.

1033
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:44.700
I world my horse around and lashed it into a dash to escape from them all.

1034
01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.170
All others of my companions did the same,

1035
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.720
but we soon discovered that they were not following us.

1036
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:53.590
They were running away from us.
They were going as fast as they're tired.

1037
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:57.160
Horses could carry them across the open valley space and toward the river.

1038
01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.780
We stopped,
looked a moment and then we whipped our ponies and swift pursuit,

1039
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.490
a great form of frong of sued.
We're also coming after them.

1040
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.610
My distant position put me among the leaders in the chase.

1041
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.970
The soldiers horses move slowly as if they were tired.

1042
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.020
Ours were very lively.
We gained rapidly on them.

1043
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:20.230
I fired four shots with my six shooter.

1044
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.290
I do not know whether any of my bullets did harm.

1045
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.650
I saw sue put an Arrow into the back of a soldier's head.

1046
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.080
Another arrow went down into his shoulder.

1047
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.880
He tumbled from his horse to the ground.

1048
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:36.060
Others felt dead either from arrows or stabbings or jabbing firm or blows from

1049
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:40.090
war.
Clubs of the Su horses,

1050
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:43.180
limped or stat limped or staggered are sprawled out.

1051
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:45.880
Dead or dying are war,
cries and war.

1052
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:49.600
Songs were mingled with the many during calls such as your only boys.

1053
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:52.180
You ought not to be fighting.
We whipped you and Rosebud.

1054
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.060
You should have brought more crows are sure Shoney's with you to do.

1055
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:59.700
You're fighting
little burden.
I were after one certain soldier,

1056
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.450
little bird was wearing a trailing warbonnet.
He was.

1057
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:06.840
He was at the right and I was at the left of the fleeing man.

1058
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.110
We were lashing him and his horse with our pony whips.

1059
01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:13.860
It seemed not brave to shoot him besides,

1060
01:07:13.861 --> 01:07:18.240
I did not want to waste any of my bullets.
He pointed back to his revolver.

1061
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.960
He pointed back his revolver though and sent a bullet into little birds thigh.

1062
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.680
Immediately I whacked the white man fighter on his head with a heavy elk horn

1063
01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:29.280
handle of my pony whip.
The blow dazed him.

1064
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.620
I seized the rifle strapped on his back.

1065
01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:36.420
I wrenched it to the ground at Gretsch to it and Greg drag the looping strap

1066
01:07:36.421 --> 01:07:40.140
over his head.
As I was getting possession of this weapon,
he fell to the ground.

1067
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.710
I did not harm him further.
I do not know what became of him.

1068
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1069
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.330
<v 0>The jam of oncoming Indian swept me on,</v>

1070
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:54.730
but I now had a good soldier rifle,
yet I had not any cartridges for it.

1071
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.450
Three soldiers on horses got separated from the others and started it up the

1072
01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:03.070
valley and the direction from where they had come.
Three Cheyanne's,
she sun bear,

1073
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:07.540
Eagle tail feather and little son joined some sue in pursuit of the three white

1074
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:10.930
men.
The Cheyennes told afterward about the outcome of this pursuit.

1075
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:15.200
One of the soldiers turned his horse eastward toward the river and escaped into

1076
01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:19.610
the timber.
The other two kept on southward of these two.

1077
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.680
One went off to the right up a small gulch to the top of the bench.

1078
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.880
There he was caught and killed the remaining one road on toward the mouth of

1079
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:32.600
Reno Creek.
As he neared that point,
he swerved to the right.

1080
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.310
He made a circle upon the valley and returned to the timber just across west

1081
01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:38.690
from the mouth of Reno Creek.

1082
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:43.790
Here he dismounted from his exhausted horse and got himself into the bush.

1083
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.090
The Sioux and Cheyenne surrounded him and killed him.

1084
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.580
They told that he fought bravely till his last making use of his six shooter,

1085
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.970
a war bonnet.
Indian belonging with soldiers was chased by crooked nose,

1086
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:00.620
a Cheyenne and some other Su.

1087
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:06.370
The chase was a foot across a wet SLU and into some timber northward from where

1088
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:10.970
the soldiers had been hidden in a few minutes after many exchanges of shots,

1089
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.950
after much dodging and shifting of position,
the enemy Indian was killed there.

1090
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:21.560
Just a crazy fight.
Just a crazy fight.
I mean,

1091
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:25.160
this is like stuff that you see in,
in,
in uh,

1092
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.580
western movies and people pulling each other off of horses,

1093
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.610
shooting people in the head with bow and Arrow from horse.

1094
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:36.290
That's just crazy and brutal and it,

1095
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:40.340
and I'll tell you there's some really good accounts and I started to go down

1096
01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:43.550
this road.
So if anybody that's listening is a,

1097
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:47.810
is a student of the battle of little big horn,

1098
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.420
there's um,
you know,

1099
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:55.130
lots of different stories about it and there's also some really detailed

1100
01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:55.964
accounts.

1101
01:09:56.030 --> 01:10:01.030
And I started trying to pull out and match up what was happening in this account

1102
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.260
with other accounts,
really historically accurate documented accounts.

1103
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.250
And as I started to do that,
I said,
Nah,

1104
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:12.650
I'm not going to go down this road of trying to figure out exactly which

1105
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:15.740
situation he's talking about.
There was multiple small battles out there.

1106
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.480
There was,
like I said,

1107
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:22.340
Reno and BA and Ben teen who survived with their soldiers and they made

1108
01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:26.060
maneuvers.
And a lot of people blame them.
Some people don't blame them,
you know,

1109
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.650
some people say that they should have gone to help.

1110
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:29.120
Some people say that they didn't have a chance.

1111
01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.810
There's all kinds of those things.
And as I started to try and figure out,

1112
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:33.860
which was which,
I said,
you know what?

1113
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:37.100
I'm not going to go that deep into this account.

1114
01:10:37.101 --> 01:10:41.180
What's important about this account to me is the reality of the ground combat.

1115
01:10:41.181 --> 01:10:45.920
That's what,
that's what I'm interested in in this account,
and I'm sure maybe

1116
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:49.250
at some point in my life when I have more time,

1117
01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:51.390
I would love to marry up the two and say,
oh,

1118
01:10:51.391 --> 01:10:53.930
he must've been in this situation and this must've been this person,

1119
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:57.560
and this must've been this maneuver.
He must've seen this maneuver from the,

1120
01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.590
from the cavalry.
It'd be fun to do that,

1121
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.130
especially go out and walk the ground and do it.
That would be really good.

1122
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:09.230
But anyways,
if you're a person that's fully into this,

1123
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:13.380
I'm not going down that road right now.
Okay.

1124
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:16.740
But I will go back to the book,
right?
Yeah.

1125
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:20.390
Another enemy Indian was behind a little sage brush,

1126
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.600
Nolan shooting at us.
His shots were returned.

1127
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:28.040
I and some others went around and got behind him.
See this,

1128
01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.290
I'll tell you what wooden legs all about flanking people.

1129
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:33.440
You notice that he's just flanking people all over the place.

1130
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.493
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

1131
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.340
<v 0>I and some others went around and got behind him.</v>

1132
01:11:40.341 --> 01:11:41.930
We dismounted and crept toward him.

1133
01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:47.090
As we came close upon up to him,
he fell.
A bullet had hit him.

1134
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:50.750
He raised himself up though and swung his rifle around toward us.

1135
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.830
We rushed upon him.
I crashed a blow of my rifle barrel upon his head,

1136
01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.200
others beat and stabbed him to death.
I also got his gun.

1137
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.740
It was the same as the one I had taken from the other soldier,

1138
01:12:03.741 --> 01:12:06.080
but the Indians gone had a longer barrel.

1139
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:07.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1140
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:11.470
<v 0>One of the Sioux Scalp,
the dead man.
Different ones took his clothing.</v>

1141
01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.870
I took nothing except the gun.

1142
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.480
Continuing on.
Somebody said to me,
look yonder other soldiers,

1143
01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:25.780
I saw them on a distant hill down the river and on our same side of it,

1144
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.620
the news of them spread quickly among us.
Indians began to ride in that direction

1145
01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.010
and so they're now going to do again.

1146
01:12:34.011 --> 01:12:38.360
This is where I didn't want to try and figure out exactly what bottle,
but yeah,

1147
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:41.240
so there,
there's another portion of the battle taking place.

1148
01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.240
I know in my head where he's going,
but we'll just say there's,

1149
01:12:44.241 --> 01:12:46.100
he sees other soldiers to go after.

1150
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.630
I'm pretty sure this is him going after customers.

1151
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:49.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:54.400
<v 0>And as he's going towards this other,
towards this other battle is taking place.</v>

1153
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:56.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1154
01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.470
<v 0>He passes through the camp again and he sees his dad and he says,</v>

1155
01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:02.390
my father was the only person at our lodge.

1156
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.670
I told them of the fight up in the valley.

1157
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.250
I told him of having helped in the killing of the enemy,

1158
01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:12.230
Indian and some soldiers in the river.
I gave to him the tobacco I'd taken.

1159
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:16.790
I showed him my gun and all the cartridges.
You have been brave.
He cheered me.

1160
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:21.140
You've done enough for the day.
Now you should rest.
No,

1161
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.540
I want to go and fight the other soldiers.
I can fight better now with this gun.

1162
01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:31.280
You,
your horse is tired.
He argued,
yes,
but I want to ride the other one,

1163
01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.280
so wooden leg,
he did.
He had a good morning so far,
got after it,

1164
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.970
but he sees a fight going on and because he's a warrior,
he says,
Nope,

1165
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.170
I'm getting back in the game.

1166
01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.010
Back to the book.
As we approach the place of battle,

1167
01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:50.800
each one chose his own personal course.

1168
01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.070
All of the Indians had come out on horseback.
Almost all of them.

1169
01:13:54.071 --> 01:13:58.840
Dismounted crept along the goalies a foot after the arrival near the soldiers.

1170
01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.880
I think that's
the reason I,

1171
01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:06.230
the reason I highlighted that is because you got people doing decentralized

1172
01:14:06.231 --> 01:14:09.440
command.
Oh,
you see where the battle is?
Get there,
right?
You're not,

1173
01:14:09.441 --> 01:14:12.140
we don't have to line up.
We don't have to march.
You see the word?

1174
01:14:12.141 --> 01:14:14.680
The battle is get there on your own personal course.
Make it happen.

1175
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1176
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:21.780
<v 0>Most of the Indians were working around the ridge now occupied by the soldiers.</v>

1177
01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:25.320
We were laying down and goalies and behind sage brush hill locks.

1178
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:29.340
The shooting at first was at a distance,

1179
01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:32.610
but we kept creeping in closer.
All around the ridge.

1180
01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:37.820
Bows and arrows were used more than guns from the hiding places of the Indians.

1181
01:14:38.251 --> 01:14:43.251
The arrows could be shot high and long curve to fall upon the soldiers or their

1182
01:14:44.041 --> 01:14:44.874
horses.

1183
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:50.990
An Indian using a gun had to jump on up and expose himself long to shoot the

1184
01:14:51.061 --> 01:14:52.710
arrows falling upon the horses,

1185
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:57.720
stuck in their backs and caused them to go plunging here and they're knocking

1186
01:14:57.721 --> 01:15:01.360
down the soldier.
So this is classic,
you know,
you think that the,
that the,

1187
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.970
the rifle is the better weapon,

1188
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.570
but the rifle you have to expose yourself to shoot.
Well,

1189
01:15:06.571 --> 01:15:11.571
the Indians are just hunkered down behind a knoll or behind some brush or behind

1190
01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:16.020
a valley and they're just lobbing like a mortar rounds,

1191
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.520
thousands of mortar rounds just hitting into where the soldiers are and the

1192
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:20.840
soldiers can't even do anything to yet.

1193
01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.930
The long distance fighting was kept up for about an hour and a half.

1194
01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:34.931
I believe the Indians all the time could see where the soldiers were because the

1195
01:15:36.591 --> 01:15:39.200
white men were mostly on a ridge in their horses were with them,

1196
01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.260
but the soldiers could not see our warriors has,

1197
01:15:42.261 --> 01:15:45.350
they had left their ponies and we're crawling through the gullies and the sage

1198
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.870
brush a warrior,
jump up,
shoot,

1199
01:15:47.871 --> 01:15:52.871
jerk himself down quickly and then crawl a little forward a little further

1200
01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:56.270
forward.
All around the soldier Ridge.
Our men were doing this,

1201
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:59.750
so not many of them got hit by soldier bullets during this time of fighting.

1202
01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:04.130
This is beautiful.
This is beautiful.
This is exactly what you know,
what we teach,

1203
01:16:04.131 --> 01:16:08.120
what the whole,
what the what the military teaches.
Individual Movement.
You know,

1204
01:16:08.121 --> 01:16:11.300
you shoot,
you get up,
you get back down,
you crawled,
you get up again.

1205
01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:14.810
So the enemy might see you right.
When you take a shot,
then you duck,

1206
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:17.030
and then when you pop up again,
you're not in the same place.

1207
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.760
So if you were aiming where they work,
they're not there anymore.
This is,

1208
01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.670
this is beautiful tactics.
In a few minutes,

1209
01:16:23.671 --> 01:16:27.540
the warriors were all around these soldiers.
Then lame,

1210
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:32.340
lame white man.
That's an Indian lame white man called out calm.

1211
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.830
We can kill all of them.

1212
01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:39.540
All around the Indians began jumping up,
running forward,
dodging down,

1213
01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:44.520
jumping up again down again all the time towards the soldiers right away.

1214
01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:48.120
All the white men went crazy.
Instead of fighting us,

1215
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:52.650
they turn their guns upon themselves almost before we could get to them.

1216
01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:55.650
Every one of them was dead.
They killed themselves.

1217
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1218
01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.880
<v 0>The Indians took the guns of these soldiers and use them for shooting at the</v>

1219
01:17:01.881 --> 01:17:03.410
soldiers on the high ridge.

1220
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.680
I went back and got my horse and rode around beyond the east end of the,

1221
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.010
by the time I got there,
all the soldiers were dead.

1222
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:18.510
The Indians told me they'd killed only a few of those men and that the man had

1223
01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:23.210
shot each other and shot themselves.
And this is,
this is very controversial.

1224
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:24.620
Oh.
You know,

1225
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.040
whether these guys killed themselves and I don't even know if it's that

1226
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.430
controversial.
It's like straight up.
Most people don't believe that.
Um,

1227
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:35.600
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what the answer is,

1228
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:40.640
but we know that one thing we do know they're all dead.
Mm hmm.

1229
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:47.150
Back to the book,
I saw one sue walking and I'm sure,
you know what?

1230
01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:50.690
I'm sure that somebody that's listening to this is going to give us the full

1231
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:54.110
report.
We'll deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And actually I have books.
I have books.

1232
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:58.010
And this is not,
um,
this is not the same account.
Right.

1233
01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:01.100
This is different than killing themselves.
So I know that,

1234
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:04.400
but what I'm talking about this book right now,
so I'm going with it.

1235
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.600
I saw one sue walking slowly toward the gulch going away from where we're the

1236
01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:15.170
soldiers.
He wobbled disley.
As he moved along,
He fell down,

1237
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.270
got up,
fell down,

1238
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.220
got up again as he passed near to where I was,

1239
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:24.830
I saw that his whole lower jaw was shot away.

1240
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.570
The side of him made me sick.
I had to vomit.

1241
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:33.830
I did not know him,
and I did not learn whether he died or not.

1242
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:36.763
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1243
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.210
<v 0>The shots quit coming from the soldiers.</v>

1244
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:44.220
Warriors who had crept close to them begin to call out that all the white men

1245
01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:47.880
were dead.
All the Indians then jumped up and rushed forward.

1246
01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:52.320
All the boys and the old men on their horses came tearing into the crowd.

1247
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.760
The air was full of smoke and dust.
Everybody was greatly excited.

1248
01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:01.230
It looked like thousands of dogs might look if they were mixed together in a

1249
01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:05.700
fight.
All of the Indians were saying that these soldiers went so crazy,

1250
01:19:05.701 --> 01:19:09.540
they killed themselves.
I do not know.
I could not see them,

1251
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:12.060
but I believe they did so again,

1252
01:19:12.061 --> 01:19:15.180
so he doesn't even know what the real deal is there,
but like I said,

1253
01:19:15.181 --> 01:19:17.490
what we do know is that not one of them lived.

1254
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.880
I took one scalp.

1255
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.750
As I went walking and leading my horse among the dead,

1256
01:19:24.751 --> 01:19:26.850
I observed one face that interested me.

1257
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:31.650
The dead man had a long beard growing from both sides of his face and extending

1258
01:19:31.651 --> 01:19:35.310
several inches below the chin.
He also had a full mustache.

1259
01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:41.280
All of the beard hair was of a light yellow color as I now recall it.

1260
01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:45.570
Most of the soldiers had beard growing in different lengths,

1261
01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:47.670
but this was the longest one I saw among them.

1262
01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.330
I think the dead man may have been 30 or more years old.

1263
01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:54.870
Here is a new kind of scalp.
I said to a companion,

1264
01:19:55.170 --> 01:20:00.000
I skinned one side of the face and half of the Chin so as to keep the long
beard.

1265
01:20:00.001 --> 01:20:02.010
Yet on the part removed,

1266
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:06.390
I got an Arrow shaft and tied the strange scalp to the end of it.

1267
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:10.560
This I carried in hand as I went looking further,

1268
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.880
somebody told me noisy walking was badly wounded.

1269
01:20:14.881 --> 01:20:18.780
That was another Indian named noisy walking.
I went to where he was said to be

1270
01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:20.190
<v 1>okay</v>

1271
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:24.000
<v 0>down in the gulch where the band of soldiers nearest the river had been killed</v>

1272
01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:25.770
in the earlier part of the battle.

1273
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.640
He was my same age and often we had been companions since our small boyhood

1274
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:36.720
white bowl and important medicine man was his father.

1275
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.230
Noisy walking had been hit by three different bullets.

1276
01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.320
One of them having passed through his body.

1277
01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.170
He also had some stab wounds in his side.

1278
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.140
I asked the young man,
how are you?
He replied,

1279
01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:58.600
good,
but he did not look well.

1280
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.800
One Young Cheyenne took something from a dead soldier just after all of them had

1281
01:21:05.291 --> 01:21:10.270
been killed.
He was puzzled by it.
Some others looked at it.
I was with them.

1282
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.120
It was made of white metal and had glass on one side on this side where marks of

1283
01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.550
some kind while the Cheyenne was looking at it.

1284
01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:24.220
He got it up towards his ear.
Then he put it up close.
It's alive.

1285
01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:29.140
He said,
others put it to their ears and listened.
I put it to mind.

1286
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:34.150
Tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick.
It was saying,
we talked about its use.

1287
01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:37.030
We generally agreed that it was a soldier,
special medicine.

1288
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.000
Many Indians came and wondered about it.

1289
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.740
The young man decided to keep it for his own medicine.
So they,

1290
01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.630
they found a watch on one of the soldiers,
a little windup pocket watch.

1291
01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:50.950
And to me this was just a really good example of,
of the,

1292
01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.440
you know,
the cultural differences.
They didn't,

1293
01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.660
they'd never seen a watch before and,

1294
01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:59.650
and so they were surprised and demon understanding what it was or that it was

1295
01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:02.920
not actually alive.
It was just a mechanical watch.

1296
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:05.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:10.300
<v 0>Back to the book,
noisy walking died during the night after the great battle six,</v>

1298
01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:11.740
Cheyenne's had been killed.

1299
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.030
Another man open belly was badly wounded and was expected to die.

1300
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.570
He was about 30 years old,
but he hadn't,
neither wife nor children.

1301
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:25.330
The six dead were lame.
White man,
limber bones,
black bear,

1302
01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:29.890
noisy,
barking hump.
Knows when whirlwind.

1303
01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:35.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:39.900
<v 0>And then after that battle,
during the afternoon,</v>

1305
01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:43.680
it was learned that yet another band of white men were coming up the little big

1306
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:48.660
Horn valley.
All the young men wanted to fight.
A council of chiefs was held.

1307
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:52.620
They decided we should continue in our same course and not fight any soldiers.

1308
01:22:52.621 --> 01:22:57.510
If we could get away without doing so,
all of the Indians and got ready to move,

1309
01:22:58.710 --> 01:22:59.790
probably a smart move.

1310
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.390
So then after that they have,

1311
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:13.450
they go to this area that's called greasy grass and there they have a little,

1312
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:17.700
a little war dance,
a little sort of a,

1313
01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:22.130
I guess you'd call it a ceremony or a celebration.
Back to the book.

1314
01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:26.150
Charcoal bear on medicine chief brought the buffalo skin from the sacred tp and

1315
01:23:26.151 --> 01:23:28.850
put it on top of a pole at the center of our Camp Circle.

1316
01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.210
We danced around this pole.
No women took part in the dancing.

1317
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:36.230
Many of them had sore legs from morning cuts and when they lose their,

1318
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:40.790
their husband,
they would cut themselves,
are dance,

1319
01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:42.710
was not carried very foreign to the night.

1320
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.790
It was mostly a short telling of experiencing accounting of cool.

1321
01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.720
My father told in a few words what his two sons had done when he ended the

1322
01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:58.340
telling of my warrior acts,
he said the name of this son of mine,

1323
01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:02.090
his wooden leg,
up to this time,

1324
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.560
people would still use my boyhood name,
eats from his hand,

1325
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:10.910
but now this old name was entirely gone.

1326
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:16.820
So is after that battle of little big horn is when wooden leg became wooden leg.

1327
01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:28.080
Now they proceed and together and all this big mass of tribes and at this point

1328
01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:37.190
they're about to separate their tribes and start going in their own directions

1329
01:24:37.191 --> 01:24:39.110
and then they get a report.
Soldiers are coming.

1330
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.460
The two bands of Indians began to come together again.
The warrior,

1331
01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.430
the warriors mingled themselves as being one tribe.

1332
01:24:46.431 --> 01:24:50.480
The women and children and older men both have both sets of people move together

1333
01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:54.410
up the tongue river.
The young men put themselves behind.
They're fleeing people.

1334
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:59.450
Somebody said to me,
they have captured some women.
Your sister is one of them.

1335
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:02.450
My heart jumped when this news came to me.

1336
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:07.630
I latched my horsed into a run toward where it was said they had been captured.

1337
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.760
There.
I saw the tracks of soldier horses.

1338
01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:15.350
The trail led me to the river of ice on the opposite side of the river.

1339
01:25:15.351 --> 01:25:19.520
The west side were soldiers.
They began shooting at me.
I had to get away.

1340
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:23.210
I did not see any of the women,
so I suppose they had been killed.

1341
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.840
My heart then became bitter toward these white men.

1342
01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:33.630
I hid my horse in the brush at the foot of the ridge where some warriors were on

1343
01:25:33.631 --> 01:25:35.580
its top.
I walked up there,

1344
01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:39.000
many Indians were hidden behind rocks and we're shooting towards the soldiers.

1345
01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:41.910
I chose for myself a place of hiding and did the same.

1346
01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.580
I had my soldier rifle and plenty of cartridges.

1347
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:47.190
Many soldiers were coming across the ice to fight us,

1348
01:25:47.191 --> 01:25:52.191
but we had the advantage because our position was high and on a rocky ridge.

1349
01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:57.550
So it's interesting that he,

1350
01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.200
he's doesn't even become bitter towards the soldiers until they do something to

1351
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:06.080
his sister and then all of a sudden he's bitter towards the white men and it's

1352
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:08.660
also important there.
At the end,
you got to get the high ground,

1353
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:10.340
got to get the high ground.

1354
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:13.070
That's literally the only reason that I put that in there is for a tie.

1355
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:18.071
For those of you out there that are in the military that are fighting get to

1356
01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.770
high ground,
it gives you a massive advantage over the enemy.

1357
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:25.123
<v 1>So</v>

1358
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:32.560
<v 0>after this they kind of settle up the tongue river in there.</v>

1359
01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.750
I'll go back to book.
We found plenty of buffalo there.

1360
01:26:34.751 --> 01:26:39.130
We went on West to the upper little big horn after camping and hunting there,

1361
01:26:39.131 --> 01:26:42.820
we went farther to the big horn at the mouth of rotten grass creek.

1362
01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:46.030
We did not stay there long.
We returned a little big horn.

1363
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:50.230
Most of the last part of the winter was spent in a camp and this valley all the

1364
01:26:50.231 --> 01:26:54.400
time.
During the next few months,
we had good hunting.
Soldiers did not trouble us,

1365
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.290
nor did we trouble them.

1366
01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.700
All the people had good lodges in every way we were living.

1367
01:27:00.701 --> 01:27:05.320
Yet according to our customary habits,
we were not bothering any white people.

1368
01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:09.460
We did not want to see any of them.
We felt we were on our land.

1369
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:14.640
We had killed only such people as had come for dre had come for driving us away

1370
01:27:14.681 --> 01:27:18.760
from it.
So our hearts were clean from any feeling of guilt,

1371
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:24.010
so they're kind of living there,
kind of going back to just live in their own.

1372
01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:28.480
They're the way that they were used to live in and this is where you know this

1373
01:27:28.481 --> 01:27:33.160
next chapter,
chapter seven is called the surrender of the Cheyanne's.

1374
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.200
Just before the grasp began to show itself in the early part of spring,

1375
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.990
two visitors arrived at our camp on little big horn.

1376
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:48.300
One of these was our old captured was our captured old woman,

1377
01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:52.500
sweet woman.
The other was a half breed sue.
We called white.

1378
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:58.490
Each had a horse to ride and each was leading a pack horse in their packs were

1379
01:27:58.711 --> 01:28:02.790
tobacco and other things for gifts to the principal chiefs.

1380
01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.140
The visitors said they'd been sent out from the soldier fort at the mouth of the

1381
01:28:07.141 --> 01:28:10.140
tongue.
River two invite us to come there and surrender peaceably.

1382
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.460
They brought us a promise from bear coat,
the soldier chief there,

1383
01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:17.700
that we should not be harmed and should be given plenty of food.

1384
01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:24.530
So starting to get enticed me starting to get enticed by some by eat,

1385
01:28:25.290 --> 01:28:27.600
you know,
basically food tobacco.

1386
01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.150
Back to the book,
the four chiefs came back to us at this powder river camp.

1387
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.410
White Bull was not with them.

1388
01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:39.040
They told us he had stayed with the soldiers to scout for them in hunting

1389
01:28:39.041 --> 01:28:43.000
Indians.
This news did not please us.
As we looked at it,

1390
01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:46.660
the surrendering to the soldiers was good if one felt like doing this,

1391
01:28:46.661 --> 01:28:50.230
but an offer to help them to kill friends showed a bad heart.

1392
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:54.850
I was more effected though by other news,
the chiefs broad.

1393
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:57.430
It was Kearny concerning my sister,
crooked nose,

1394
01:28:57.431 --> 01:29:02.431
one of the captives when the chiefs were only a part of the first day out and

1395
01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:07.380
coming back from the fort,
somebody followed them to tell them about her.

1396
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.560
She had been very sad in the heart because of a belief.

1397
01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:12.330
She would never again see her people.

1398
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.430
She'd felt better when the chiefs came,
but when they went away again,

1399
01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:21.300
she fell into a deep grief.
My sorrow was so great.

1400
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:25.470
Her sorrow was so great that she had gotten out or is it hidden?

1401
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:29.490
Six shooter I had given to her and she shot herself dead.

1402
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:33.810
My heart will stop beating.
When I heard about her death this way,

1403
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.410
she had been a good sister,
kind to everybody.

1404
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.480
Seven Cheyanne's from the agency came to the camp on powder river.

1405
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.870
One of them had a teepee lodge,
but no women were with them.

1406
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.160
They came only to tell us we ought to surrender at the agency.

1407
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:56.640
They said all the Indians there were being well fed.

1408
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.560
We're being well treated in every way.

1409
01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:02.400
Nobody was being punished in any manner for past conduct in warfare against the

1410
01:30:02.401 --> 01:30:07.350
soldiers.
So they're getting told basically there's another group,

1411
01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.060
there's they can surrender at the fort,

1412
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:12.300
the army fort or the concern it up the at the Indian agency,

1413
01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:17.301
which is also controlled by the soldiers and of course I just read that part

1414
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:22.320
about wooden leg sister committing suicide.

1415
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:25.620
So just a devastating blow to him.

1416
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.710
Now as this continues,

1417
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:35.890
the decision gets made by the chiefs to surrender actually at first to find out

1418
01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.610
a little bit more,
gather some more Intel,
sorry,

1419
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.530
little wolf and the other principal chiefs chose to go out to the agency and
then

1420
01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:48.850
when they come back,

1421
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:53.710
they say that it's pretty good to go.

1422
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:59.770
And when they hear this,
they hear about the food,
they hear about the whiskey,

1423
01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.650
they hear about the,
the shelter.

1424
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:08.550
They decide that the main body of the tribe sets off towards the agency to

1425
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.050
surrender back to the book.
But not all the Cheyanne's.

1426
01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.590
We're ready yet to surrender at any place.
14 or 15 men,

1427
01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:21.430
six or seven of them having wives or children separated off to go westward.

1428
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:25.210
White Hawk,
a little chief of the elk warriors was with them.

1429
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:29.890
I joined another band still desiring the most freedom we considered to be ours

1430
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:33.030
by right.
34 Cheyanne's made up this pants.

1431
01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.530
There's a couple little separate groups that break off and decide they're going

1432
01:31:35.531 --> 01:31:39.460
to continue pushing.
And as they're doing that,

1433
01:31:39.461 --> 01:31:44.380
when they get in these smaller groups,
if you can imagine,
I mean just like,
uh,

1434
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:46.900
any,
any group,
if you break it down enough,

1435
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.810
you start to lose your efficiency and that's what happened with these smaller

1436
01:31:49.811 --> 01:31:53.050
groups.
They just weren't as efficient anymore because they had less people.

1437
01:31:53.051 --> 01:31:54.520
I mean,
you can't count catches many.

1438
01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.880
You can't work in cooperation to hunt buffalo and so they didn't do well on

1439
01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:04.650
their own.
Mm.
Back to the book.

1440
01:32:04.651 --> 01:32:09.360
We were having a good many days of hunger.
Our horses had plenty of grass,

1441
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.730
but our own ribs were becoming thin.

1442
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.780
Our clothing was wearing out and we could not get enough skins to renew them and

1443
01:32:18.031 --> 01:32:20.790
keep our beds and our lodges and go to order.

1444
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:26.750
My soldier coat and breaches were gone and my last shirt and cough breaches were

1445
01:32:27.151 --> 01:32:28.380
almost in tatters.

1446
01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:32.880
The only good article of where I had now was my big white hat I'd had captured

1447
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:34.140
at the Rosebud battle.

1448
01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.820
A Cheyenne nicknamed Yellow Eagle added himself to us.

1449
01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.420
He had been at the agency not before,

1450
01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:47.450
not long before we decided to have him and white bird go there and spy out the

1451
01:32:48.301 --> 01:32:53.220
conditions.
They went in a week or so.

1452
01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:57.900
They were back among us.
Good treatment,
plenty of food,

1453
01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:02.550
blankets,
everything.
Nobody punished.
They reported.

1454
01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.910
We started right away for the agency.

1455
01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:14.430
So
when they split apart into these smaller groups,

1456
01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.830
that was definitely problematic.

1457
01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:22.610
And now they go from being out there kind of on their own hungry,

1458
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:28.110
running out of food,
don't have good equipment anymore and somebody,

1459
01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:31.810
they send somebody to the agency to check it out and they get the report back to

1460
01:33:31.811 --> 01:33:35.430
there's plenty of food and blankets and warm and all they're going to do there

1461
01:33:35.431 --> 01:33:38.790
is go ahead and give up.
So now they,

1462
01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:43.970
they move and they start heading towards the agency and when they get there,

1463
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.630
back to the book,
he made us all feel good to see hundreds of Indian lodges.

1464
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.440
As we came near to the agency,
we galloped our horses forward.

1465
01:33:55.441 --> 01:33:57.570
We cheered and fired gunshots into the air.

1466
01:33:57.630 --> 01:33:59.670
Some soldiers came running out of their tents,

1467
01:33:59.671 --> 01:34:03.570
but they soon saw we were friendly and only celebrating and notifying our people

1468
01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:07.190
we had come.
So here they are,

1469
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.433
and they,

1470
01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.180
and a white man married to Cheyenne woman was acting as an interpreter for the

1471
01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.770
soldiers.
His name was Roland,

1472
01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:19.190
but white hat did not need any interpreter and talking to us.

1473
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:24.200
He could make the sign talk so well after the general handshaking white hat

1474
01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:25.034
said,

1475
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:29.480
now you men must give me your guns and your horses.

1476
01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.650
We were not expecting this,
but we trusted him.

1477
01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.960
So we began to do as he asked,

1478
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:44.240
I'm telling you gotta be careful in this situation when you started giving up

1479
01:34:44.241 --> 01:34:48.470
your guns,
this is not a recommended course of action.
You know,

1480
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.400
if you're coming in peace,
why are you not allowed to keep your weapons?

1481
01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:56.690
This is not a,
this is not a,
I did not agree with this scenario.

1482
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:01.370
Back to the book,
the,

1483
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:07.730
we had one big chief standing elk who kept saying it would be better if we

1484
01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:11.060
should go there.
So they're trying to get them to push towards the south,

1485
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:14.270
like towards Oklahoma.
Would be what would be Oklahoma,

1486
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:16.250
and they're kind of against it.

1487
01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:19.520
They don't want to walk anymore and they feel like they,
hey look,
we came here,

1488
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:23.580
we,
we were supposed to be here.
And they're saying,
go,
no,
you know,
we're going to,

1489
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:26.810
we're going to move you guys south.
And they're all saying,
no,
we don't want to.

1490
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.760
So that's what's standing elk is talked about.

1491
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:31.970
So standing elk who kept saying it will be better if we should go there.

1492
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:36.530
I think there were not as many as 10 Cheyanne's and our whole tribe who agreed

1493
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:37.364
with him,

1494
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:41.120
there was a feeling that he was talking this way only to make himself a big

1495
01:35:41.121 --> 01:35:42.740
Indian among the white people.

1496
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:48.790
The white men chiefs would not talk much to any Cheyenne chief,

1497
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:49.934
but him.

1498
01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.860
They gave him extra presence and treated him as if he were the only tribe,

1499
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:57.920
the only chief of the tribe.
But he was.

1500
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:02.900
But one of our 40 tribal big chiefs,
one day he went about telling everybody,

1501
01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:04.580
all right,
get ready to move.

1502
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:07.040
The soldiers are going to take us from here tomorrow.

1503
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.870
Lots of shiny hands were angry.
We'd understood that when we surrendered,

1504
01:36:11.871 --> 01:36:14.360
we were to live on our same white river reservation.

1505
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.370
We'd given up our guns and our horses and had quit fighting because of this

1506
01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:24.320
promise.
Now,
after we had put ourselves at this great disadvantage,

1507
01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.270
the promise was to be broken,

1508
01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:27.900
<v 1>okay?</v>

1509
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.420
<v 0>But we could not do anything except obey him.</v>

1510
01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:36.000
So three sleeps after my small band had come to what we thought was to be our

1511
01:36:36.001 --> 01:36:40.860
home.
The whole tribe was on its way to what we now call Oklahoma.

1512
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:43.680
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1513
01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.090
<v 0>So again,</v>

1514
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.420
that's why we don't give up our guns.
When you give up your guns,

1515
01:36:51.421 --> 01:36:53.520
you give up your strength,
you give up your leverage,

1516
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.470
give up your ability to fight.

1517
01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.010
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1518
01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:01.220
<v 0>The soldier leader of our movement to the south was known as tall white man.</v>

1519
01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.220
He was a good man,
always kind to the Indians.

1520
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:08.300
We had to do whatever he said we must do.
But he talked good to our chiefs.

1521
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:11.660
So all of us,
we're pleased to have him guiding us.

1522
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:15.920
You had with him a band of soldiers.
I do not know how many,

1523
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:20.180
but I think there may have been almost a hundred of them are horses that have

1524
01:37:20.181 --> 01:37:23.210
been taken away from us at the agency were returned to us.

1525
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:27.890
Still many Cheyanne's did not own any old people who had no animal to ride.

1526
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:32.430
We're provided with them from the soldier herd or very old or sick people were

1527
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:34.460
allowed to ride in the soldier wagons.

1528
01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:39.140
Young men who owned no horses had to walk or borrow from friends.

1529
01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.730
I owned four,
I had three of them loaned out most of the time.

1530
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:49.510
So you guys actually that the treatment at this point by tall white man was

1531
01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:56.380
fairly good and it sounds like they kind of got along with the soldiers at this

1532
01:37:56.611 --> 01:38:00.720
point.
And here's an example of that.
Soldiers hunted with the Indians.

1533
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.850
All the soldiers were friendly and good to us.

1534
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.280
They were good shooters and they killed lots of game.

1535
01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:06.840
They gave us most of the meat.

1536
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:09.630
I became specifically friendly with two or three of them.

1537
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:12.990
I like to be with them and they appeared to like me.

1538
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:17.490
I went at times to their camp in the evening and visited with them when we were

1539
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.770
about halfway along in our journey.
I asked one of them,

1540
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.800
let me take your gun tomorrow.
Yes,
you may take it.
He told me.

1541
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:27.100
So I think the reason I,
I wanted to bring that up is when you get,
you know,

1542
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.090
soldiers and warriors and you put them together and you get rid of the politics,

1543
01:38:30.091 --> 01:38:32.880
guess what?
They get along well,
we liked shooting.
We like haunting.

1544
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.560
We're warriors.
We're going to get along.

1545
01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:35.883
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

1546
01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:40.660
<v 0>Kind of like the Germans playing the clean soccer,
playing soccer.
Exactly.</v>

1547
01:38:40.690 --> 01:38:43.060
You take the politics out of it and we're just going to,
you know,

1548
01:38:43.061 --> 01:38:46.870
have a couple of cigarettes,
maybe a glass of scotch and call it good.

1549
01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:53.540
Now when they get down to Oklahoma,
they kind of settle in,
in,

1550
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:57.370
in the south.
And here we go.
Back to the book I learned in the South,

1551
01:38:57.371 --> 01:39:00.340
a white man name of long hair.
The soldier,
big chief,

1552
01:39:00.341 --> 01:39:04.660
we had killed on the little big horn.
I was told he was called general Custer.

1553
01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.110
I'd heard his name spoken at the White River Agency,

1554
01:39:08.111 --> 01:39:10.390
but not understand clearly who was meant by it.

1555
01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:13.990
The southern Cheyanne's knew of him because of his having fought against them

1556
01:39:13.991 --> 01:39:18.370
before he had come into our northern country.
They had surrendered to him.

1557
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1558
01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.020
<v 0>After we'd been a year on this reservation,</v>

1559
01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:26.650
many of our people began to be asked to be taken back to the north.

1560
01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:30.280
There was no game here and we are not allowed to go off the reservation for

1561
01:39:30.281 --> 01:39:35.281
hunting and we were not given food is it had been promised we should be given at

1562
01:39:35.411 --> 01:39:35.771
times.

1563
01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:39.400
Some of our young men would violate the orders and would slip away from the

1564
01:39:39.401 --> 01:39:42.520
reservation to get a buffalo or some other animal.
Good to eat.

1565
01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:48.100
Some white people said the Indians were killing their cattle.
I do not know.

1566
01:39:48.101 --> 01:39:51.790
I did not do this.
I stayed all the time on the reservation,

1567
01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.310
but if any Indians did kill the white men cattle,

1568
01:39:54.311 --> 01:39:58.060
they did so because they were very hungry.
You could not find any wild game.

1569
01:39:58.750 --> 01:40:00.910
We ate the beef because it was the best we could get.

1570
01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.120
We always liked much better than wild game.

1571
01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.010
There was much sickness among the northern Cheyenne downs to us.

1572
01:40:09.011 --> 01:40:10.420
It was a new kind of sickness,

1573
01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:13.360
chills and fever and aching of the bones dragged down.

1574
01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:17.350
Most of us to thin and weak bodies are people die,
died,

1575
01:40:17.351 --> 01:40:22.180
and kept following each another falling one another out of this world.
Finally,

1576
01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.470
Little Wolf declared that he for one,
was moving back north.

1577
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:30.310
Whether the white people consented or not,

1578
01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:32.620
others said they would follow him.

1579
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:36.070
The agent told them that the soldiers would go on the trail,
would kill them.

1580
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:41.170
They were promised more food.
They waited for it,
but it did not come.

1581
01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.620
More people flocked a little wolf side,

1582
01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:48.370
don't knife said he would go too late in the summer.

1583
01:40:48.610 --> 01:40:51.850
More than half the tribe started out.
Little Woolf's.

1584
01:40:51.851 --> 01:40:56.200
Last message to the was the soldiers may kill all of us,

1585
01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:01.210
but they cannot make us stay in this country.
The soldiers went after them.

1586
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.060
Other soldiers from other places were sent out to head them off.

1587
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:07.930
The Cheyennes were hunted from all directions.
They were found many times,

1588
01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:11.590
but each time the Cheyenne fought off their pursuers and kept moving northward.

1589
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:14.230
Many of our people were killed,

1590
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:18.760
but most of them got back to their old home country and were allowed to stay

1591
01:41:18.761 --> 01:41:22.370
there
from the southern Cheyenne.

1592
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:26.650
I learned a great deal about general Custer's dealing with them in that country.

1593
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:31.600
All of them has said he had smoked the peace pipe with them at that time that

1594
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:34.390
they had surrendered to him seven years before he was killed.

1595
01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:37.150
According to the custom among us,

1596
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:41.740
this was understood as a promise by him that never again would he fight against

1597
01:41:41.741 --> 01:41:42.700
the Cheyanne's.

1598
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:47.200
When they learned that he had been killed by our people in the Sioux,

1599
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.790
they considered him as having deserve that kind of death on account of his

1600
01:41:51.791 --> 01:41:53.980
failure to keep his piece oath.

1601
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:59.050
I got a wife from the southern Cheyanne's.

1602
01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:03.550
She had been a girl at the Cheyenne camp at the wash.

1603
01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:07.210
It's a river when Costner and his soldiers came there and killed many Cheyanne's

1604
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:09.190
and burn their lodges in November of night.

1605
01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:14.191
Every teen 68 chief black pot was one of the ones killed.

1606
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:18.580
The women and children fled same as ours had done at Poudre river.

1607
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.710
It was winter and there was many and that was at that time a deep snow for that

1608
01:42:23.711 --> 01:42:24.544
country.

1609
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.810
Soldiers Chase the women and children and killed many of them as well as the
men.

1610
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:34.330
My wife at that time,
a girl was barefooted as others were also.

1611
01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.250
They had been surprised in the early morning she stopped and cut off pieces of

1612
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:43.330
buffalo or buffalo robe to ty about our feet to keep them warm as she ran.

1613
01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:48.580
When they got to the camp,
it's of snake Indians farther down the river.

1614
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:52.540
My wife told me she was also with the Cheyanne's when they surrendered to

1615
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:57.541
general Custer in 1869 after he had smoked a pipe with their chiefs.

1616
01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.620
When they surrendered,

1617
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:03.370
some of the chiefs were put into prison and had chains upon their ankles.

1618
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.950
When I heard all of this from my wife as well as from many of the other southern

1619
01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:09.784
Cheyanne's,

1620
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:15.180
it seemed the great medicine may have directed Custer to his death as punishment

1621
01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:18.400
for having broken his promise to the Cheyennes.

1622
01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:28.170
So eventually they do go back north and they reestablish a reservations up in

1623
01:43:33.401 --> 01:43:35.620
the north and

1624
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.400
eventually wouldn't leg proceeds up there as well.
And when he gets up there,

1625
01:43:42.401 --> 01:43:45.430
he seems,
it seems like things are in a pretty bad way.

1626
01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:48.880
Back to the book,

1627
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.080
the most sorrowful new condition found and coming back to our Cheyenne country

1628
01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.720
was in the case of little wolf himself,

1629
01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:01.940
some white man about the fort were selling or giving whiskey to the Indians.

1630
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:06.800
One night,
little wolf got a bottle of whiskey and right away he drank all of it.

1631
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:12.440
He went into the Fort Traders store and leaned forward upon the counter.

1632
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.760
He was quiet,
but he was dizzy and stumbling here and there.
The trader said,

1633
01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:20.360
Little Wolf,
you'd better go to your lodge.
But he said,
no,

1634
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:22.010
I want to stay here.

1635
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:26.960
Some Cheyenne men and women were playing cards at a table and the store famished

1636
01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:31.670
elk,
a young man,
sergeant of the scouts was with them.
He talked a little wolf,

1637
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.100
but the old chief paid no attention to his talk.

1638
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.520
Famished Wolf took hold of Little Wolf's arm and said,
calm.

1639
01:44:37.521 --> 01:44:41.420
I will help you to get you to your lodge.
He Spoken,
acted respectfully,

1640
01:44:41.421 --> 01:44:44.990
but little wolf was angered because of the taking hold of him.

1641
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:49.190
He pulled himself away.
His eyes blazed like fire.

1642
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.000
He stood a moment looking at the young man.
Then he said,

1643
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:54.710
I will kill you.

1644
01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.110
He staggered alone on out from the store,

1645
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:02.570
famished elk return to sit in the card game.

1646
01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.350
Nobody was expecting any further trouble,
but not long.

1647
01:45:06.351 --> 01:45:09.890
Afterward the door was opened in the little wolf,
stumbled into the room.

1648
01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:15.560
He straightened himself out,
leveled or rifle and fired.

1649
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.160
Famished elk sink down,
dead upon the floor.

1650
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:24.170
The old chief went back to his lodge and told his two wives would,
he had done,

1651
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:29.540
we must go.
He added,
the three of them went out into the darkness of the night.

1652
01:45:29.541 --> 01:45:31.400
Soldiers and Cheyenne search for them.

1653
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.650
They searched during the next day and the next,

1654
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:38.060
the missing man and his two wives appeared in miles city and sat themselves down

1655
01:45:38.061 --> 01:45:39.980
in a place in plain view of the people there,

1656
01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.350
a captain and some soldiers went to him.
The captain we knew as little chief,

1657
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:49.460
he told little wolf what it was he had done.

1658
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:53.420
He said he further told him,

1659
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.490
you are no more a chief of the Cheyanne's.
That is true in just little.

1660
01:45:58.491 --> 01:46:02.810
Rolf Wolf agreed.
He was not punished in any other way,

1661
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:07.990
but he further punished himself before he and his wives had left their lodge.

1662
01:46:07.991 --> 01:46:12.620
He smashed into pieces.
His medicine pipe.
Our old tribal laws required this.

1663
01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:15.170
It was not allowable for him afterward to smoke.

1664
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:19.850
It was allowable for him afterwards to smoke all alone in any small and short

1665
01:46:19.851 --> 01:46:24.590
stemmed pipes such as might be made from a deer leg bone,
but he did not do this.

1666
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.170
He denied himself all smoking.

1667
01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.510
He never made any offer even to sit in the company of other Cheyenne Smoking

1668
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:37.190
together.
White men offered him sometimes cigarettes,

1669
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.660
but he always refused them.

1670
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:43.940
After a time he learned chew tobacco habit never followed by the old time

1671
01:46:43.941 --> 01:46:48.941
Cheyanne's it seemed he did this deliberately for self humiliation.

1672
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.740
He never tried to intrude himself on any trouble,

1673
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.510
tribal public affairs that people remembered his great services in past times,

1674
01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:02.130
but nobody consulted him on tribal matters in present times,

1675
01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:07.800
truly in every way.
He was never more uh,
chief among the Cheyennes.

1676
01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:16.360
So alcohol not good,

1677
01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.420
not good for your decision making processes.

1678
01:47:22.570 --> 01:47:23.403
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1679
01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:24.740
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

1680
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:29.000
When I was 31 years old and 1889,

1681
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:33.500
I enlisted with other Cheyanne's to form a new band of scouts for the soldiers

1682
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.240
at Fort Keogh.

1683
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1684
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.230
<v 0>For a long time we did not do much except drill and work at getting out logs</v>

1685
01:47:41.231 --> 01:47:44.620
from the timber and building houses for ourselves.
So he joins the army,

1686
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:47.710
he joins the army,
becomes,
uh,
becomes a scout.

1687
01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:52.190
We Cheyenne Scouts and not get into any battle.

1688
01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:54.830
At one time we were all dressed and ready,

1689
01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:58.490
but the officers made a stop behind the hill while the soldiers went on and

1690
01:47:58.491 --> 01:48:03.150
killed many sue at a camp on a little valley.
Just over the hill.
Uh,

1691
01:48:03.151 --> 01:48:06.600
sue started that fight by killing an officer who was taking all the guns from

1692
01:48:06.601 --> 01:48:07.434
them.

1693
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:11.910
The soldiers began to shoot in many women and children were killed as well.

1694
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:13.350
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:15.660
<v 0>This trouble was on wounded knee creek</v>

1696
01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.280
at the time of our advance up the hill,

1697
01:48:19.281 --> 01:48:22.070
I was wearing a war bonnet for the first time in any battle.

1698
01:48:22.071 --> 01:48:26.180
So he's talking about,
they were present at the,
at the massacre at wounded,

1699
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:30.590
at wounded knee,
which was a horrible massacre committed.

1700
01:48:30.591 --> 01:48:35.330
You can hear there was between 150 and 300.

1701
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:36.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1702
01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:41.430
<v 0>Sue were killed by soldiers and new included.
Uh,</v>

1703
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.470
probably about half of them were women and children

1704
01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:48.573
and

1705
01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:49.540
<v 3>okay.</v>

1706
01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:51.580
<v 0>He later he's talking about,</v>

1707
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:52.820
<v 3>okay.</v>

1708
01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:57.670
<v 0>Some dreams that he has
back to the book.
I believe I slept,</v>

1709
01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:02.140
but I'm not sure whether I was sleeping and dreaming or I was only lying there

1710
01:49:02.141 --> 01:49:07.141
and thinking I kept my cartridge belt buckled on me and I hugged my rifle to my

1711
01:49:07.331 --> 01:49:10.900
body.
It seemed that angry Sioux Indians were all about me.

1712
01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.240
They were searching for me to kill me.

1713
01:49:14.150 --> 01:49:14.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1714
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:17.860
<v 0>Some of them were striking at me with war clubs and slashing and me with knives.</v>

1715
01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.680
I heard them calling my name wooden leg.

1716
01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:25.290
I jumped up and stood there wide awake.

1717
01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.120
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1718
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.230
<v 0>so he's having nightmares here.</v>

1719
01:49:28.231 --> 01:49:33.231
He's massacre happens and he feels like obviously subconsciously he's got some

1720
01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.450
some nightmares about that.

1721
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:42.040
Now back to the story of Little Wolf,

1722
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:48.410
the the chief that that shot the uh,

1723
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.130
other Indian at the card game.

1724
01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1725
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.910
<v 0>Back to book.
One day I saw the old man little wolf at the camp.</v>

1726
01:49:56.911 --> 01:50:00.570
This is years later.
I said to my wife,
I see little wolf.

1727
01:50:01.170 --> 01:50:05.670
He's my relative.
One of his wives is a sister of my father.

1728
01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.340
I think I ought to invite him to eat at our lodge.
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1729
01:50:11.341 --> 01:50:14.460
She answered,
tell him to come now.
Right away.
B,

1730
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:17.070
she began to prepare bread and meat and a coffee.

1731
01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.890
When I brought little wolf around,
I found he was partly drunk.

1732
01:50:24.090 --> 01:50:26.940
He fumbled the food and he sat and ate.

1733
01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:29.940
He ate freely as though he were very hungry.

1734
01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.780
He kept quiet and kept looking downward during all the time.

1735
01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:35.130
When he was done eating.

1736
01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:39.300
I told him of my sympathy with him in his great trouble.

1737
01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.510
He then told me all about the affair.
I love the young man and all of his people.

1738
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:50.160
I was crazy when I shot him at this time and the conversation,

1739
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.710
Little Wolf was about 70 years old.

1740
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.750
This man gave away all of his horses after he'd been pulled out of his position

1741
01:50:57.751 --> 01:51:02.460
as our greatest chief.
After that,
all of his traveling was done a foot.

1742
01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:07.110
Sometimes you went alone,
sometimes one or both of his wives accompanied him.

1743
01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:11.700
They took along whatever packs they could carry and they slept in temporary

1744
01:51:11.701 --> 01:51:15.930
shelters or with no shelter.
He went to at times to visit the crows.

1745
01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:19.380
He visited also the Arapahos in Wyoming,

1746
01:51:19.410 --> 01:51:22.110
walking 200 miles or more back and again,

1747
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:26.340
he died in 1904 at the age of 83 years.

1748
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
His wives and close friends stood his body upright on a high hill overlooking

1749
01:51:32.191 --> 01:51:37.191
the Rosebud valley where many Cheyenne's had their reservation homes.

1750
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:43.430
A great heap of stones was built to enclose him Vuss standing upright.

1751
01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:46.410
24 years later,

1752
01:51:46.411 --> 01:51:50.580
his bones were brought to the agency cemetery and put into a grave there.

1753
01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:53.940
Bird,
the old time Indian story,

1754
01:51:53.941 --> 01:51:58.680
white man who lives in New York had a stone put at the head of this agency

1755
01:51:58.681 --> 01:51:59.514
grave,

1756
01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:05.140
even in the nearest of relatives of even the nearest relatives of famish.

1757
01:52:05.141 --> 01:52:10.141
Delk never kept bad hearts against little wolf at different times I've heard

1758
01:52:10.531 --> 01:52:15.450
talk of him from Bald Eagle.
A brother of the young man killed Bald Eagle,

1759
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:18.120
said little wolf did not kill my brother.

1760
01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.050
It was the white man whiskey that did it.

1761
01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:22.053
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.560
<v 0>Now we fast forward</v>

1763
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.430
30 years after the great battle against costs.

1764
01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:38.080
There was a gathering of Indians and white people at little big horn.

1765
01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:43.510
The Cheyanne's and some other Indians went with a few soldiers to fort Custer,

1766
01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:47.030
not far from the place where the great battle had been.

1767
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:50.720
The soldiers at the fort shook hands with all of us.

1768
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:55.040
We gathered together and some friendly speeches were made by the officers and

1769
01:52:55.041 --> 01:52:59.780
Indians.
All I said was a long time ago,

1770
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:04.010
we were enemies.
Today we are friends.

1771
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:12.380
Then going even further into the adult.

1772
01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:14.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1773
01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.150
<v 0>50 years old now</v>

1774
01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:23.570
wooden leg says I was baptized by the priest at tongue river mission when I was

1775
01:53:23.641 --> 01:53:28.260
almost 50 years old.
My wife and our two daughters were baptized too.

1776
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.460
I think the white people pray to the same great medicine we do in our old

1777
01:53:32.461 --> 01:53:36.150
Cheyenne way.
I do not go to church often,

1778
01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:41.910
but I do go sometimes.
I think the white church people are good,

1779
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:46.080
but I do not believe all the stories they tell about what happened a long time

1780
01:53:46.081 --> 01:53:50.760
ago.
The way they tell us all the good people in the old times were white people.

1781
01:53:51.810 --> 01:53:54.060
I'm glad to have the white man churches among us,

1782
01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:58.500
but I feel more satisfied when I make my prayers in the way I was taught to make

1783
01:53:58.501 --> 01:53:59.334
them

1784
01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:00.350
<v 1>okay.</v>

1785
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:05.030
<v 0>My heart is much more contented when I sit alone with my medicine pipe and talk</v>

1786
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:07.850
with the great medicine about whatever may be troubling me.

1787
01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.030
We had good medicine men in the old times.

1788
01:54:12.210 --> 01:54:16.260
It may be that they did not know as much about sicknesses.
The white men doctors?

1789
01:54:16.261 --> 01:54:19.770
No,
but our doctors knew more about Indians and how to talk to them.

1790
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.260
Our people then did not die young as they so much as they do now.

1791
01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1792
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:32.250
<v 0>Now wouldn't leg had a couple daughters.</v>

1793
01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:34.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:54:34.110 --> 01:54:35.670
<v 0>and he talks about them here.</v>

1795
01:54:35.970 --> 01:54:39.960
The younger daughter fell into an illness when she was about 14 years old.

1796
01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.810
We expected she would soon be herself again,

1797
01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:48.150
but she grew worse.
Instead of better,

1798
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:52.080
she became so weak she could not stay at school any longer.

1799
01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:57.360
She continued to go downward after we brought her into our home.
Finally,

1800
01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.480
her spirit went back to the great medicine.

1801
01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:04.440
All of our love was now fixed upon the other daughter.

1802
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:09.690
She advanced to full young womanhood.
She could read the white man books.

1803
01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:12.390
She could write letters to our friends far away,

1804
01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:16.290
but she too became ill.
Same as her younger sister.

1805
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:21.920
During all of one winner,
she gradually wasted away every afternoon.

1806
01:55:21.921 --> 01:55:25.790
Her body burned with fever every night.
Her bed was soaked with sweating.

1807
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.490
Every morning she coughed almost a strangling,

1808
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:33.260
neither the medicines of the agency physician nor the prayers of our own

1809
01:55:33.261 --> 01:55:37.640
medicine men could help her.
Just when the spring grass was coming up,

1810
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:39.980
she was buried in our mission cemetery,

1811
01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.430
my heart down to the ground.

1812
01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:50.070
<v 2>I decided then that the white man's school is not good for Indian children.</v>

1813
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:54.360
I think they do not get enough of meat at the boarding school.

1814
01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:57.300
I think that they are kept in school too much during the year.

1815
01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:01.020
They ought to be out and free to go as they pleased during all of the good

1816
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:03.600
weather of the autumn and the spring.

1817
01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:13.270
<v 0>And the book closes out</v>

1818
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:14.203
<v 2>okay</v>

1819
01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:18.700
<v 0>in last years of wooden legs life.
And he's,</v>

1820
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:24.750
he's old and he's respected and he's living safely

1821
01:56:28.090 --> 01:56:29.100
a reservation

1822
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.863
and he says

1823
01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:39.640
it is comfortable to live in peace on the reservation.

1824
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:45.790
It is pleasant to be situated where I can sleep soundly every night without fear

1825
01:56:45.791 --> 01:56:50.500
that my horses may be stolen or that myself or my friends may be crept upon and

1826
01:56:50.501 --> 01:56:51.334
killed.

1827
01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:59.310
But I like to think about the old times

1828
01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:04.300
when every man had to be brave.

1829
01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:11.740
I wish I could live again through some of the past days when it was first

1830
01:57:12.021 --> 01:57:16.890
thought of
every prospering Indian.

1831
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:21.900
The first thought of every prospering Indian was to send out the call.

1832
01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:24.300
A whole friends come

1833
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.670
<v 2>calm,
calm.</v>

1834
01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:32.680
<v 0>I have plenty of buffalo meat.
I have coffee,
I have sugar,</v>

1835
01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.110
I have tobacco come friends,

1836
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:40.040
feast and smoke with me,

1837
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:50.980
and I'll tell you

1838
01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.530
that I miss those days to
win.

1839
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:05.040
Every man had to be brave.

1840
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:09.400
When comfort

1841
01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:13.360
was no guarantee,

1842
01:58:13.361 --> 01:58:17.680
when life itself wasn't a guarantee,

1843
01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.460
then I think that is one of the lessons

1844
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:26.110
<v 2>to be taken</v>

1845
01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.440
<v 0>from wooden leg is something you hear me say often is that you have to cherish</v>

1846
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:38.300
it.
Cherish the struggle,

1847
01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:44.320
the contest,
the suffering,
the risk.
Don't shy away from it,

1848
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:47.570
but instead,

1849
01:58:49.110 --> 01:58:49.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

1850
01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:50.413
<v 0>Cherish it</v>

1851
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:57.860
in another piece that I find so important,

1852
01:58:57.861 --> 01:59:02.861
so reinforcing to what I see in the world is look at how the Cheyanne's were

1853
01:59:05.361 --> 01:59:09.570
beaten.
There wasn't,
it wasn't in war.

1854
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:14.020
There wasn't in battle.
The,

1855
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:19.030
they weren't defeated by the white man's guns or the white man's tactics.

1856
01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:26.250
No,
they were slowly taking apartment,

1857
01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:28.800
convinced,

1858
01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:35.360
convinced to take an easier path and enticed by the comfort of the reservations.

1859
01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:46.360
We're food and shelter and tobacco.
When alcohol,

1860
01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:48.310
we're all readily available.

1861
01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:52.283
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:59:52.670 --> 01:59:57.670
<v 0>They weren't defeated in some diff decisive battle by weapons or by war.</v>

1863
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:02.990
They were defeated

1864
02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:08.370
and controlled by one tiny,

1865
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.600
seemingly insignificant surrender at a time,

1866
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:21.200
giving up their land and then giving up their horses and then giving up their

1867
02:00:21.361 --> 02:00:22.320
guns.

1868
02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:34.460
Then they were tricked.
They were lied to,

1869
02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:38.580
and the word was not kept in.
The promises were not kept,

1870
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:43.880
but they gave up their ability to fight back.

1871
02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.510
And it's hard to guard against that.

1872
02:00:50.511 --> 02:00:55.010
It's hard to even see it happening because it's like trying to watch an hour

1873
02:00:55.011 --> 02:00:57.020
hand move.
You don't see it,

1874
02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:04.270
you don't see it move,
and then you turn around in this,

1875
02:01:04.810 --> 02:01:09.250
this beautiful in this magnificent warrior culture

1876
02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:14.710
is relegated to

1877
02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:21.330
whiskey and dependency and entrapment on reservations.

1878
02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:33.790
And I think that's an important message.

1879
02:01:36.650 --> 02:01:38.660
I think that's an important message for our culture,

1880
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:42.410
this culture that we have now,

1881
02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:47.710
a culture of creativity and open mindedness and of strength and of individual

1882
02:01:49.701 --> 02:01:50.534
freedom.

1883
02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:53.753
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1884
02:01:53.850 --> 02:01:56.610
<v 0>that we need to stay vigilant.</v>

1885
02:01:58.950 --> 02:02:03.950
We need to stand guard against small infractions that may seem meaningless and

1886
02:02:06.091 --> 02:02:08.730
insignificant,
but that will chip away

1887
02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.490
at who we are as a people.

1888
02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.310
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1889
02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:16.300
<v 0>and as a culture</v>

1890
02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.180
and the native Americans,
I mean,

1891
02:02:22.181 --> 02:02:25.360
we could go on and on about the bravery

1892
02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:31.660
that those warriors showed even past this period in World War II.

1893
02:02:31.661 --> 02:02:36.640
There's story upon story about the bravery that they showed in the Vietnam War,

1894
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:40.600
native Americans that served with honor and courage,

1895
02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.220
but we have to learn more than just that,

1896
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:52.960
and I think it's the same thing on an individual level as well

1897
02:02:55.470 --> 02:03:00.060
because it's not that,
it's not that we,
as people said,
that we as an individual,

1898
02:03:00.061 --> 02:03:03.360
as a person,
it's not that you wake up one day and you decide that's it.

1899
02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:05.950
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1900
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:07.750
<v 0>I give up.
I'm going to be weak now.</v>

1901
02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:13.510
I'm just going to just surrender everything to be comfortable.

1902
02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.790
We don't do that in one day.
It doesn't happen.
It's not one decision.
It's a slow,

1903
02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:21.040
incremental process

1904
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:28.340
that just chips away,
chips away at or wheel and chips away.

1905
02:03:28.341 --> 02:03:29.450
In our discipline,

1906
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:34.310
we wake up a little bit later and we miss a workout than we miss another one.

1907
02:03:34.311 --> 02:03:36.260
Then we just start to eat,
but we shouldn't eat.

1908
02:03:36.261 --> 02:03:39.800
And we start to drink what we shouldn't drink.
And without even realizing it,

1909
02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:44.801
one day you wake up and you become something that you never would have allowed.

1910
02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:52.610
And instead of
being strong,

1911
02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.180
you're weak.
And instead of being disciplined,

1912
02:03:58.390 --> 02:04:00.910
you are disorganized and you are lost.

1913
02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.420
And instead of moving forward and progressing,
you are moving backward

1914
02:04:09.150 --> 02:04:10.280
and you aren't decaying.

1915
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.333
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1916
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:17.130
<v 0>And that happens without us even seeing it.</v>

1917
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:18.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1918
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:20.550
<v 0>Well allowed US recognizing it.</v>

1919
02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.350
So you have to be vigilant.

1920
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.930
You have to be on guard,

1921
02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:37.931
you have to hold the line even on the seemingly insignificant things,

1922
02:04:38.011 --> 02:04:40.830
things that shouldn't matter.
But those things do matter.

1923
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.520
And instead of going backward instead of decaying,

1924
02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:50.700
get stronger,
get better,

1925
02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:55.770
grow and learn and develop and live

1926
02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:00.660
in.
Live in such a way

1927
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:06.840
that you don't remember the old days with sorrow,
that they are gone,

1928
02:05:06.841 --> 02:05:08.130
but with pride.

1929
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1930
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:14.430
<v 0>And with gratitude that those old days led you to where you are today.</v>

1931
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:24.680
Place of wisdom and a place of knowledge and a place of experience

1932
02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:35.430
<v 4>in a place of peace.
And I certainly hope that</v>

1933
02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:40.650
wooden leg found his piece

1934
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.400
with the great medicine.

1935
02:05:46.670 --> 02:05:49.830
You don't how in,
I don't know if I,

1936
02:05:49.831 --> 02:05:51.830
I mean you're probably one of the few people

1937
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:58.430
that I know anyway that probably didn't go through high school and think about

1938
02:05:58.431 --> 02:06:00.900
history class.
Think when am I ever going to use,

1939
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:06.590
a lot of us think thought that and like this kind of stuff,
right?

1940
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:08.840
Like actual stuff,
history.
This is history.

1941
02:06:08.841 --> 02:06:12.770
This should have been in history class and it probably was.
Yeah.

1942
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:15.640
You had to have learned about the battle of little big horn.
Yeah.
You,

1943
02:06:15.650 --> 02:06:17.360
you had to have,
you may not remember it.

1944
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:20.030
I don't remember from high school that was whatever,
40 something,

1945
02:06:20.031 --> 02:06:23.900
you're wounded knee rings a bell.
Right.
You know?
Yeah.

1946
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:28.930
So that was probably the attitude for most of us.

1947
02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:32.910
Like what are we going to use this?
Why do I gotta know this?
You know,

1948
02:06:32.911 --> 02:06:36.230
1776 like why,
why do,
why?

1949
02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:40.220
How is this gonna help me in my job that I'm going to be,
you know,

1950
02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:43.430
a doctor or whatever.
Even if you had high aspirations.

1951
02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:50.420
So this,
that last part you just said,
but that's,

1952
02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:55.340
that's why for real.
The what part?

1953
02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.150
What do you mean?
The whole part?
Yeah,
at the end where you're like,
okay,
look,

1954
02:06:59.650 --> 02:07:02.300
and here's what,
how it was explained to me by my mom and dad.

1955
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:07.040
History's important because you have all the people that you learn about all the

1956
02:07:07.041 --> 02:07:11.810
events you learn about,
you learn lessons out of it.
Of course,

1957
02:07:11.811 --> 02:07:13.940
as a kid you're like,
all right,
well you know,

1958
02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:17.210
I'm just memorizing dates and events here.
But they're like,
no,

1959
02:07:17.211 --> 02:07:21.060
you learn lessons like history,
you know,
wars,
all the,
this is the,

1960
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:24.440
it's all to like settle problems.
You got to learn lessons from Mr. I'm like,

1961
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:29.300
alright,
I get it.
This,
I think on an,

1962
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:32.500
on a group level you can learn a lot of lessons.
Of course from history.

1963
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:36.030
This on an individual,
individual level,
everybody,
especially now,
Bro,

1964
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.990
now it's like was thinking about this today I'm driving home,

1965
02:07:41.010 --> 02:07:45.210
went to the pumpkin patch right in the pins and patches.
It's a,

1966
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.710
it's,
it's really cool.
It's a,

1967
02:07:47.711 --> 02:07:51.150
it was down in Bonita was it wasn't like a built one in a parking lot and then

1968
02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:55.130
you go through,
it was like a legit one and I'm hardly anyone there.
And My,

1969
02:07:55.131 --> 02:07:57.840
I'll just running around and um,
you know,

1970
02:07:57.850 --> 02:08:02.110
my wife comes from the country and stuff so she's like,

1971
02:08:02.111 --> 02:08:05.380
see this kind of pumpkin patch is great compared to the ones that built in the

1972
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:10.240
parking lot.
And I'm thinking that's where we are today where,
Oh,

1973
02:08:10.690 --> 02:08:14.060
not a pumpkin patch,
let's go build the pumpkin patch.
Like that's how much,

1974
02:08:14.130 --> 02:08:16.210
how little really we have to do.

1975
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:21.070
We're building pumpkin patches so you can go experience a pumpkin patch on

1976
02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:25.300
pavement.
Yes.
In a parking lot in a boy.
Yeah.
When we're done with this,
you know,

1977
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:28.690
Bill Finger in it,
we get,
you know,
you have shows on TV.

1978
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:34.510
I always harp on reality TV,
but man,
this is the reality
of it,

1979
02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:36.580
where we have time now,

1980
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:41.640
the time and the inclination to sit and watch hours of just other people living

1981
02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:45.550
there now.
That's embarrassing.
That's where we are today.

1982
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:49.980
I'm not saying we all do it,
but I'm saying we can if we want.
Yeah,

1983
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:53.770
we can if we want.
That's where we are.
Okay,
so consider that.

1984
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:55.690
That's the opposite of this.

1985
02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:58.490
That's like basically what you're talking about right here.
Yeah.

1986
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.130
Where you're like,
okay,
the more like kind of like,

1987
02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:04.720
you didn't really say avoid luxury,
nothing like that.

1988
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:08.800
But basically you're keep keep your capability in check.
You know,

1989
02:09:08.801 --> 02:09:13.340
like I don't want to miss the old days when I was capable,
you know,

1990
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:16.980
because I gave it up to be more comfortable.
That's it.

1991
02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.190
That's the lesson I think that you can learn individually.

1992
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:26.290
<v 0>Yeah,
no doubt.
And I think even,
you know,
the,
the culture,</v>

1993
02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.320
we're talking about cultures to cultures of warriors that they know,

1994
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:37.000
they,
they got overrun by the white man,
right?

1995
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:40.330
Overrun by the white man.
Now there was brutal battles and we're going to go,

1996
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:43.780
I mean,
you,
you could spend all day talking about,
but we're talking,
I'm just,

1997
02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.730
I'm just speaking about one aspect of this.

1998
02:09:46.090 --> 02:09:51.090
You had incredible warrior cultures that had lived this way for unknown amount

1999
02:09:51.191 --> 02:09:54.850
of time,
thousands of years,
and in what,
50 years or something?
A hundred years.

2000
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:57.220
It was completely different for them.

2001
02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.400
And Yeah,

2002
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:04.690
and what I'm saying is you think that they got crushed or destroyed or there was

2003
02:10:04.691 --> 02:10:07.780
this battle like,
no,
if you,
if you hear that story,

2004
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.330
it wasn't a fight to the death.

2005
02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.570
It was a slow,

2006
02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:18.370
just crumbling away of their,
of their culture,

2007
02:10:18.371 --> 02:10:23.230
the way they had it.
And you know,
and from a,
from a perspective of,

2008
02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:27.000
I mean,
another lesson that can be taken away from this that that's,
you know,
we,

2009
02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.430
we talk about this all the time.
That was a,
it's,
it's a form of negotiation,

2010
02:10:30.431 --> 02:10:33.680
right?
Listen,
Hey,
don't worry about it.
Just come,
come a little bit,
you know,

2011
02:10:33.681 --> 02:10:34.850
just move a little bit further down the path,

2012
02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.110
moving a little bit further down the path,

2013
02:10:36.111 --> 02:10:40.580
move a little bit further down the path and um,
yeah,
that's what I,

2014
02:10:40.581 --> 02:10:45.581
that's my point is be careful and pay attention to what you're giving up.

2015
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:50.300
Yeah.
From your,
from your individual life and from your culture as a,

2016
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:53.070
as a group,
right.
In America,
right.

2017
02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:56.510
I'm speaking now from my culture as an American.
That's our culture.

2018
02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.880
What are we going to give up?
Where is it going?

2019
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.520
That's what we need to look out for.

2020
02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.520
Because at some point we can look around and it's one thing if we don't have the

2021
02:11:08.601 --> 02:11:10.940
culture anymore,
we don't,
we have a different culture.

2022
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:13.220
But the thing that I'm talking about,

2023
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:17.630
it's okay for American culture to morph and to grow.
That's okay.

2024
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:18.950
But what I do,

2025
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:24.910
what we do have to watch out for is if we ever give up the strength to defend

2026
02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:32.150
ourselves and say,
you know what?
Okay,
you crossed the line.

2027
02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.110
Yeah.
And we are not going to do what you're saying right now.
Yeah.
You know,

2028
02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:39.890
that's what we need to be careful of.
We can never give up.
You know,

2029
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:42.140
somebody asked me on Twitter the other day and what's,
you know,

2030
02:11:42.141 --> 02:11:45.620
in 140 characters,
what should our foreign policy be?

2031
02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:50.310
And I did it in one word.
Our foreign policy,

2032
02:11:50.311 --> 02:11:54.350
she be strength.
Strength should be our foreign policy.

2033
02:11:54.351 --> 02:11:57.770
We should be strong.
And I'm telling you right now,

2034
02:11:57.771 --> 02:11:59.090
and we've talked about this before,

2035
02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.440
when you are strong and you can defend yourself and you know that you can handle

2036
02:12:06.771 --> 02:12:11.090
any problem that comes your way,
you're not going to have many problems.
Right.

2037
02:12:11.091 --> 02:12:13.850
It's not going to happen.
It's when you're weak,

2038
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:19.220
it's when you let your guard down,
that's when you have problems.
Yeah.

2039
02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.430
The strength essentially

2040
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:27.090
<v 4>capable capability.
Right.
That's a,
and I'm not saying,</v>

2041
02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.200
I'm not talking about the foreign policy thing at all.
Right.

2042
02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.790
You want to go down that path with me?
No,
I mean not now,

2043
02:12:32.850 --> 02:12:36.630
but okay,
so you know like,
like crossfit for example,

2044
02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:41.010
<v 0>right?
Oh yeah.
Okay,
well we'll buy strength.
I don't just mean strength,</v>

2045
02:12:41.011 --> 02:12:42.630
like I mean skill.
I mean

2046
02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.610
<v 4>the capability is capable because I stand corrected.
Yeah,
no,</v>

2047
02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:51.530
I didn't mean to correct.
Of course.
More like that.
You know,
I'm,
I'm contributing,

2048
02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:54.140
you know,
we'll say country,
but you know how,
um,
okay,

2049
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:57.470
so I remember when crossfit fit exploded onto the scene and people got really

2050
02:12:57.471 --> 02:13:01.820
into it and sometimes people would get criticized.
Like,
man,

2051
02:13:01.821 --> 02:13:04.940
you're doing this all this crazy word he used to getting good at working out.

2052
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:07.250
Like you're trying to get into this crazy shape for nothing.

2053
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:09.740
Like what are you training for?
You're not gonna train it for sport.

2054
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:11.600
You just training.
I mean,
I'm sure you could actually,

2055
02:13:11.601 --> 02:13:13.760
same could kind of be said about you.

2056
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:16.580
You're waking up every day trading all hard.
Like for what?

2057
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:20.330
And you're like for life,
right?
So you're,

2058
02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:23.150
you're training for capability.
I'm capable.
Oh,

2059
02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:28.290
<v 0>are you capable?
And what level of capability do you have?
You know,</v>

2060
02:13:28.770 --> 02:13:32.170
so people who've spent like an an this

2061
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.990
<v 4>by no means is any kind of judgment.</v>

2062
02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:39.050
But if you've spent your life neglecting your health or your capability,

2063
02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:43.420
you know you can be less well off,
you're not going to be very well off.

2064
02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:49.260
So with that there is that caution.
Like this is the tale,

2065
02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:50.160
a cautionary tale,

2066
02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:54.900
one of the many probably over history where if you are capable,

2067
02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:55.921
you live,

2068
02:13:55.921 --> 02:13:59.790
it doesn't seem like your environment is testing that capability in the Bro

2069
02:13:59.790 --> 02:14:00.080
Watch out

2070
02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:03.770
<v 0>man.
Yes,
yes.
Test the capability yourself.</v>

2071
02:14:04.210 --> 02:14:06.680
Here's what you got to test the capability yourself.

2072
02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:07.801
<v 4>That's a good thing too.</v>

2073
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:11.720
And the [inaudible] about spending too cause the whole the system and the
system.

2074
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:14.730
But
especially now,
like I said,

2075
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:18.570
like life is luxury right now for us word you can

2076
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:21.690
back in the day you're hunting for food,

2077
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:24.150
you were starvation here it's like too much.
For example,

2078
02:14:24.151 --> 02:14:26.550
in one of your examples from before.
So it's like it's luxury.

2079
02:14:26.551 --> 02:14:29.940
So even even like con consumption,
right?
What,
like,

2080
02:14:29.941 --> 02:14:34.530
what do you spend your money on,
you know,
spend money on entertainment.

2081
02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:39.531
Seems not really in line with improving your capability.

2082
02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:43.950
You know,
like that's what I remember when we moved,
I was like,

2083
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:48.420
oh I want to get a home gym.
And it was pretty expensive like what I wanted.

2084
02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.320
But it was easily justifiable.
Absolutely.
Because,

2085
02:14:52.321 --> 02:14:54.300
and I wasn't thinking in these specific terms,

2086
02:14:54.301 --> 02:14:57.990
but really basically that's what I was thinking like this is going to help me in

2087
02:14:57.991 --> 02:15:02.640
life.
Who's going to be for sure helped me be more capable way more.

2088
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:05.910
And I already had a gym membership,
but you want the home gym,

2089
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:10.650
you want the home day.
He can be even more capable overall.
I'm just saying.
So if,

2090
02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.170
you know,
like a lot of times that alone can justify like certain types of cancer

2091
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:19.480
<v 0>for sure.
Yeah.
If you're absolutely,
I don't even think when it,</v>

2092
02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:21.190
when it comes to me to spit,

2093
02:15:21.250 --> 02:15:24.320
making expenditures on things that are gonna make me better.
Yeah.

2094
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:27.310
There's not even like,
I don't hesitate on those things.
I hold the trigger,

2095
02:15:29.050 --> 02:15:32.740
I make it happen and play around,
you know,
do not play around.

2096
02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:36.760
And I've been known to be pretty tight with my money,

2097
02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.350
but not when it comes to something that's gonna make me better.
Yeah,
for sure.

2098
02:15:42.110 --> 02:15:46.630
Yeah,
man.
Um,
amazing book,

2099
02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:48.250
amazing life.

2100
02:15:49.090 --> 02:15:54.090
Pick this book up on amazon.com the book is called wooden leg,

2101
02:15:54.401 --> 02:15:58.500
a warrior who fought Custer.
Maybe later we'll do some more.
Maybe we'll do,

2102
02:15:58.501 --> 02:16:02.170
do the other side of this battle and maybe get a little bit more into the
battle.

2103
02:16:02.171 --> 02:16:04.720
And like I said,
there's plenty of lessons learned from Custer.

2104
02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:08.410
There's plenty of lessons learned there and there's a lot of controversy around

2105
02:16:08.411 --> 02:16:11.650
it.
And that's what I tried to avoid.
The controversy.

2106
02:16:11.770 --> 02:16:16.770
I've tried to stick with just what's being said by wooden leg himself.

2107
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:21.490
There's a lot of controversy about this battle and who did what and who is to

2108
02:16:21.491 --> 02:16:23.050
blame and what mistakes were made.

2109
02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:25.090
And they're all what I take from all of those things.

2110
02:16:25.091 --> 02:16:28.990
I'll learn from all of them.
I'll learn from every theory.
I'll learn from all of,

2111
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.030
that's my goal,
but we'll definitely get into that.
Um,

2112
02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:35.260
this book is just a great read.

2113
02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:38.650
The more you can fill your head up with different perspectives and the more you

2114
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:42.010
can pay attention to the native American and learn more about their culture.

2115
02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:46.660
Awesome culture,
worry your culture.
Yes.
A warrior culture.
Love that.

2116
02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:49.300
And like I said,
uh,
you know,

2117
02:16:49.330 --> 02:16:54.100
serve with honor in all of our wars here,
you know,
which is,

2118
02:16:54.690 --> 02:16:57.160
you know,
we should probably do a whole podcast about,

2119
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:01.780
about native Americans fighting in World War Two and Vietnam and in the current

2120
02:17:01.810 --> 02:17:02.950
conflicts we have.

2121
02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:08.380
So you can pick that up on Amazon,
on the interwebs,

2122
02:17:09.610 --> 02:17:11.130
<v 4>and if you want to help the podcast,</v>

2123
02:17:11.131 --> 02:17:14.700
you can actually do little click through of Amazon.
Yeah,
I was gonna say,

2124
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:19.230
I'll put that book link on the website,
click on,

2125
02:17:19.231 --> 02:17:22.170
it'll take you right to the book.
And

2126
02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:28.260
as far as Amazon goes,
in general,
there's a click through on the website,
so,

2127
02:17:28.290 --> 02:17:31.080
so it doesn't matter what you're going to buy,
correct.
The front of Amazon.

2128
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:33.530
If you want to support the podcast,
you know,

2129
02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:38.540
that's essentially what we're going to invest three to five seconds opening that

2130
02:17:39.301 --> 02:17:41.700
page and clicking through.
Yeah.
You want to support the podcast.

2131
02:17:41.701 --> 02:17:44.940
That's a great way to know that it doesn't cost me anything.
Yeah.

2132
02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:49.620
Getting in the game,
making yourself us,
everyone really more capable.

2133
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:53.970
Yes.
Let's improve knowledge,
capabilities,
all that stuff.
Yeah.

2134
02:17:53.971 --> 02:17:57.450
Click through Amazon.
Boom.
Um,
go to the website,

2135
02:17:57.451 --> 02:18:00.540
click through and save it to your favorites.
It's a little trick,

2136
02:18:00.541 --> 02:18:05.130
little efficient trick support,
um,
actively,
passively,

2137
02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:08.280
aggressively,
aggressively.

2138
02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:13.700
I'm also speaking of making yourself capable supplementation.

2139
02:18:16.310 --> 02:18:21.000
Um,
man,
I still haven't gotten a Krill oil yet.
I'll make that order tonight.

2140
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:25.620
That krill oil is no longer on me.
Yeah.
It's on union.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We,
you know,

2141
02:18:25.621 --> 02:18:30.300
we took the steps.
Yeah.
We're doing it.
Yeah.
It was always on me.
Let's face it.

2142
02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:35.760
It's fun to put it on your bed.
Nonetheless.
Krill oil is,

2143
02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.030
would you say that's the main one,
man?
Um,
I've been,

2144
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:43.080
I've been on Trello for a long time and I dig it.
Yeah.
There it is.

2145
02:18:43.530 --> 02:18:47.250
A krill oil warrior bars.
These are just ones I'm recommending.

2146
02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:52.590
Just go to on it on it.com/ [inaudible] that's for 10% off.

2147
02:18:52.591 --> 02:18:56.670
But if you didn't know what on it is,
it's,

2148
02:18:56.850 --> 02:18:59.160
it's just the best supplements.
We'll just say that

2149
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:03.180
you have some other cool stuff on there too.
But anyway,
indeed,

2150
02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:07.220
that's the one dope.
I think that's some new stuff coming out to,
oh,

2151
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:08.420
we'll talk about that next time.

2152
02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:15.410
I got to do an evaluation on that one.
Um,
but yeah,
on it is dope.
Um,

2153
02:19:16.410 --> 02:19:21.410
and of course subscribe to the podcast on iTunes if you haven't already.

2154
02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:24.720
Yep,
that's a good one.
And tell your friend.
Yeah,

2155
02:19:24.721 --> 02:19:28.220
tell your friend and here's the tell all your friends,
both of them.
Yeah.

2156
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:33.050
To subscribe to the podcast.
Here's the,
here's the,
it's,
I mean,

2157
02:19:33.051 --> 02:19:35.180
I guess it's kind of obvious for us to say,
hey,

2158
02:19:35.181 --> 02:19:37.790
tell your friends about our podcasts.
You know,
that makes sense.

2159
02:19:37.791 --> 02:19:41.750
But when you tell your friends about like,
okay,

2160
02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:45.560
so I have a friend who has a friend,

2161
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.970
our friends,
two of them,
they listen to his podcast.
[inaudible].

2162
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.260
We knew them for a long time.
They listened and they tell their other friends,

2163
02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:53.900
I didn't know this,
but I see on Facebook.

2164
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:59.180
Thank you for telling me about Jocko podcasts.
I,
you know all this stuff.

2165
02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:01.960
So these were people that know us but didn't know about the fire gas.
No.

2166
02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:04.780
To Bia will.
No,
no,
no.
Two people that knew us news podcast.

2167
02:20:04.890 --> 02:20:09.050
I'd be apparently had told some people he was God and I'm officially,

2168
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:13.450
here's the thing,
the more people who act like I don't take anything.

2169
02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:18.390
You talk about extreme ownership,
we'll say anybody book by the way.
Good,
good.

2170
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:21.170
But just the concept of extreme ownership.

2171
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:26.410
You get somebody implementing extreme ownership by a factor of 10% in their life

2172
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:31.700
and they're in your life.
That's an improved life.
That is an improved life.

2173
02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:32.810
That's why you,

2174
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:36.470
I would say that's that reason alone is a good reason until someone about the

2175
02:20:36.471 --> 02:20:38.560
podcasts.
Yeah.
No,

2176
02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:43.400
I mean I hear from people that say the podcast has helped them out greatly,

2177
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:46.940
which is the best.
That's why we're sitting here.
Right.
Cause if all,

2178
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:50.630
if I didn't hear that from anybody,
if we got no feedback,

2179
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:53.090
maybe we wouldn't be doing the podcast right now.

2180
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:56.930
Maybe we wouldn't have to learn about wooden leg tonight.
Yup.
Yeah.
Okay.

2181
02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:02.030
So yeah,
tell your friends about the podcast.
Yeah.
Get them in the game for sure.

2182
02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:05.720
And tell him about that youtube channel.
The youtube right.

2183
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.930
Youtube channel channel's good ankle,

2184
02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:11.360
putting up videos almost on a daily rate right now.
Oh wait,
no we don't.

2185
02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:16.400
I'm working on a good one.
It's different.
Oh Yay.
I'll tell,
I'll let you know.

2186
02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:20.390
I'll see if I can't get it up in the next week or so,
but it'd be,
it'd be good.

2187
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:24.340
Um,
and yes,
I do promise I'll put more videos on there,
but some,

2188
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:29.910
yeah,
you heard that folks above and beyond just the podcast,
I promise

2189
02:21:31.850 --> 02:21:35.930
you go to vague promise by the way,
for more videos on

2190
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:42.170
youtube videos and of course

2191
02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:47.530
if you're in to tee shirts,
go to Jacklyn store

2192
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:50.960
or rash gardens.
Here's the thing about the rash guard.

2193
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:56.630
I'm not a scientist officially,
but you know,

2194
02:21:56.631 --> 02:22:00.590
the 19% improvement of performance,
if you,

2195
02:22:00.591 --> 02:22:03.300
if you were the rash guard that,
that we um,

2196
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:07.480
it's starting to look like that is factual.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
um,

2197
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:13.430
what do you call it?
Not Proven,
but what do you call it?
Confirmed.
Confirmed,
yeah.

2198
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:18.490
UFC fighter nine year veteran UFC fighter currently fighting in the UFC.

2199
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:23.570
Confirmed it.
Confirmed.
Can Tell Bro.
If anyone can tell,

2200
02:22:23.571 --> 02:22:27.720
he can tell measurable scientific.
It's scientific.

2201
02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:32.130
Cool.
Why don't you say his name?
Because while I'm saying this,
I'm constantly,

2202
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:35.760
should I say my name is Cole Miller?
Yeah,
we know who it is,
man.

2203
02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:41.900
Cole Miller did confirm that his Jujitsu was 19% 19% on the mat confirmed.

2204
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:46.650
Confer it.
Yeah.
And again,
that's,
you know,

2205
02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:49.560
if you were going to be doing some kind of a scientific experiment,

2206
02:22:49.570 --> 02:22:52.650
you'd want some kind of a doctor.
Yes.
You know,
somebody with a phd,

2207
02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:56.790
some of them expert.
You got your expert right there.
Nope.
There you go.

2208
02:22:56.820 --> 02:23:01.710
Got Cole Miller sick Jujitsu by the way.
Yeah,
he's,
he's,
he sees it.

2209
02:23:01.711 --> 02:23:03.810
He feels 19%.
Yup.

2210
02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:09.410
Proof he's training with.
He was trained with Rowen.
Yeah.

2211
02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.550
Yeah.
There's a few people I had trained with that guy.

2212
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:14.480
Why train with him one time and that and how Atlanta,
yeah.
Yeah.

2213
02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:17.790
That was like the first time I ever went into a place and I walked in,

2214
02:23:17.791 --> 02:23:19.050
I was like,
hey man,
I just want to train.

2215
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:23.490
And he looks at ou rowing Cordy Arrow I think.
And um,

2216
02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:24.383
he's in UFC too,

2217
02:23:24.690 --> 02:23:28.020
but I shook his hand and this was like 10 years ago or something.

2218
02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.360
And I shook his hand,
was like,
hey man,
good to meet you.
I'm just here to train.

2219
02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:34.770
Can I train on your mats?
And he's like,
yeah,
are you a black belt?

2220
02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:39.390
He asked me that and I was like,
yeah,
I am.
And I dunno how he could tell.

2221
02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:45.630
He was like,
are you a black belt?
I said,
yeah man,
let's do this.

2222
02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:49.800
But he's an awesome guy.
Two minutes.
Super,
Super Nice Guy.
But,
um,

2223
02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:51.920
hopefully maybe we need to get him a rash guard too.

2224
02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:56.550
And that's not just for Jujitsu,
that's for,
um,
you know,
whatever.

2225
02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:59.160
Any physical activity that you need.
Some,
what do you call it?

2226
02:23:59.161 --> 02:24:02.820
Range of motion did that.
If that means something to you,
get the rash guard.

2227
02:24:02.821 --> 02:24:03.780
It looks dope too.

2228
02:24:03.781 --> 02:24:08.580
For people who have a certain level of aesthetic standard.

2229
02:24:08.610 --> 02:24:12.150
For those of you that care about that kind of stuff,
not,
I know.
Yeah.

2230
02:24:12.151 --> 02:24:16.440
You know you're here to win.
I dig it.
I dig it,
man.

2231
02:24:16.441 --> 02:24:20.580
I dig it and respect for that,
but in the event of you caring what you look like,

2232
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:24.810
we've got many,
many compliments on the look of the rash guard,

2233
02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:28.020
so just look at it Jocko.
store.com you can look at the rash guard.

2234
02:24:28.021 --> 02:24:31.800
Look at the shirts if you like.
I'm going to get one.
You can support that way.

2235
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:34.830
Yeah,
that's a good one.
The game,
you don't need to donate money.

2236
02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:38.640
Just look at them.
If you like them,
go ahead.
Get One.
There you go.

2237
02:24:39.090 --> 02:24:41.730
If you get when you got to buy one,
of course,
but I'm just saying,
I'm not saying,

2238
02:24:41.731 --> 02:24:44.570
Hey,
go buy this shirt.
I'm saying check it out.
Look at it.

2239
02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:48.300

then boom.
If you like what they say.

2240
02:24:48.810 --> 02:24:51.360
How they make you feel bad.
Go ahead and do that.

2241
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:55.160
Or if you just straight up need 19% improvement in your Jujitsu game to just get

2242
02:24:55.161 --> 02:24:59.070
one more of you just need a tee shirt.
But that's true.
Oh we have hoodies too,

2243
02:24:59.071 --> 02:25:02.500
by the way.
Coming out.
One,
two weeks,
two more weeks.
One week,
whatever.

2244
02:25:02.570 --> 02:25:05.820
I'm running late.
It was a good little hoodies.
Alright.
Alright.
Yeah.

2245
02:25:05.850 --> 02:25:08.610
Some patches coming out to some velcro this.

there's some good stuff on that.
Check it out if you'd like.

2247
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.090
And we might have some teeth.
We do have,

2248
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:19.230
we do have Jocko white tea and I'm gonna tell you we didn't expect Jocko white

2249
02:25:19.231 --> 02:25:23.920
tea to sell like crazy.
Oh,
but it,

2250
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.710
<v 0>it's all you guys all that are listening to this.</v>

2251
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:28.960
You guys got after it and all the white tea is gone.

2252
02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.220
Luckily I apologize for that number one.
And you know what?

2253
02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:37.980
They just took it completely off of Amazon.
They pulled it down.
Yeah,

2254
02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:39.101
I just went to,

2255
02:25:39.101 --> 02:25:41.890
cause I was gonna I was going to tweet out some of the awesome reviews that it

2256
02:25:41.891 --> 02:25:46.750
got.
Sorry.
Like people that are now dead lifting 8,000 pounds,
by the way.
No,

2257
02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:50.790
it's a fact.
Guy Review,
read his,

2258
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.000
his dead lift went from four oh five 405 pounds to 8,000 pounds with Jocko white

2259
02:25:57.491 --> 02:26:00.790
tea.
So there you have it.
That's worth it in its own right.

2260
02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:05.560
So you already say on it supplementation as good.
I don't see if uh,
you know,

2261
02:26:05.561 --> 02:26:09.410
a 7,500 pound improvement.
So,
uh,
yeah,

2262
02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:12.550
so the Jocko white tea is sold out right now,
but well,

2263
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:16.700
there's more common and depending on when you're listening this,
I'm,

2264
02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:21.340
this is what,
what is today?
October 15th?
Yes,
it's October 15th.

2265
02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:24.850
So right now it's sold out.
It will be back in full stock.

2266
02:26:24.851 --> 02:26:27.310
And not only do we have the tin,

2267
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:32.470
the deluxe 10 that you can buy,
but in the F in,

2268
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.570
you're going to also be able to buy a reload.

2269
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:38.590
Just a box with a hundred a hundred count in there.
And some people,

2270
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:43.420
someone wrote a bad review on Amazon good.
And they said,
hey,

2271
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:47.620
your price is too high,
Bro.
I love,
I love the podcast,

2272
02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:51.010
but you can't sell me this Jocko white tea for this amount of money.

2273
02:26:51.490 --> 02:26:56.020
That's not cool.
And so I talked to my tea people.
Sure.
And I said,

2274
02:26:56.021 --> 02:27:00.280
t people,
Emily are our price is too high,
what are we going to do about this?

2275
02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:00.701
And she said,

2276
02:27:00.701 --> 02:27:05.701
well your price is high because you wanted to get this special hardcore 10 to

2277
02:27:05.951 --> 02:27:09.800
serve it in.
And I was like,
well yeah,
because we make,
you know,
we,

2278
02:27:09.801 --> 02:27:14.290
we believe in quality,
right?
Sure.
And so we want to have something that is tough.

2279
02:27:14.410 --> 02:27:16.270
So we got the tin and she said,

2280
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:19.210
well that Tim costs a bunch of money to make and get sent over here and all this

2281
02:27:19.211 --> 02:27:20.830
other stuff.
And I said,
okay,
well how can we make it cheaper?

2282
02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:25.780
So we got a box with a hundred in it up the volume,

2283
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:30.370
lower the price.
So now no,
no one's gonna be able to complain about the price,

2284
02:27:30.371 --> 02:27:34.600
cause he's gonna be on a par with any other white tea except for it's gonna make

2285
02:27:34.601 --> 02:27:38.250
you be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds.
Yeah,
that's a window.

2286
02:27:38.290 --> 02:27:40.160
Which is definitely worth it.
I pay,

2287
02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:44.640
I pay premium price for that so it's good to go and yeah,

2288
02:27:44.641 --> 02:27:47.780
so check out the Jocko white tea and it's uh,
every,
it's,

2289
02:27:47.890 --> 02:27:50.770
it did sell out and reading it sold out is because people were buying it.

2290
02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:52.570
They bought one and then they bought five more.

2291
02:27:52.850 --> 02:27:56.830
It could taste so good and people aren't drinking it pre Jujitsu,

2292
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:59.740
drinking it in the morning,
drinking it before a test.

2293
02:27:59.741 --> 02:28:02.140
They're just drinking it all the time.
It just tastes good.

2294
02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:05.740
It replaces every other substance you need to drink.

2295
02:28:08.050 --> 02:28:09.350
Pretty soon,
very soon you're going,

2296
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:12.280
going out to a club and there's people going to be like,
oh good,

2297
02:28:12.281 --> 02:28:14.470
I get you a drink.
Certain he'd be like,
yeah,
I'll take a Jocko white teeth.

2298
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:20.690
They're going to have it on tap.
Interesting that you called the tin.
Uh,

2299
02:28:20.930 --> 02:28:22.040
what'd you call it?
DELAC or

2300
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.470
<v 4>luxury.
What did you call,
what you call it?
Something terrible,</v>

2301
02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:29.720
I think you said like luxury or something premium?
Nah,
he said something luxury.

2302
02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:31.850
I don't know.
Something like that.
Nonetheless.

2303
02:28:31.851 --> 02:28:34.610
And we'll play back the tape nonetheless.
This is like,

2304
02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:39.560
this is like a bunker more.
It's not luxury.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Well we don't,
we,
we,

2305
02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:43.800
we don't make things well haul.
It reinforced,
reinforced,
reinforced,

2306
02:28:43.801 --> 02:28:47.660
and what's cool is guess what holds the pen on the pans on my desk now.
Yeah.

2307
02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:51.710
One of these,
guess what it all means?
Bunch of nails out my garage.

2308
02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:54.740
One of these ships that is hard grammar.
I told you the other band,

2309
02:28:54.741 --> 02:28:58.580
like things that have dual purpose,
dual purpose.

2310
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:01.310
I'm going to do something else with it.
Yeah,
there you go.

2311
02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:05.690
There's a little book you can get.
It's called extreme ownership.

2312
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:08.630
It's about combat leadership.
If you like the podcast,

2313
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:13.940
check out the book and also you can check out the audio book that Leif Babin who

2314
02:29:13.941 --> 02:29:17.720
wrote the book with me.
You.
We read it.

2315
02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:22.190
So it's just more of us talking.
Check it out.
That's extreme ownership.

2316
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:24.440
And also of course,

2317
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:29.510
if you feel like you want to keep talking to Echo Charles and I,

2318
02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:33.290
you believe it or not,
you can just do it.
You can talk to us.

2319
02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:35.990
We're there and we're on the interwebs.

2320
02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.880
And if you're on the inner webs and we're on the interwebs,

2321
02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:43.970
that means we can communicate a little thing called Twitter on Twitter.

2322
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:47.870
Echo is at Echo Charles.
I am at Jocko Willink.

2323
02:29:48.470 --> 02:29:50.840
And remember when I said I wasn't going to back off Twitter,

2324
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:54.820
I've been holding the line on Twitter.
I'm ridiculous.
But I have just Cameron,

2325
02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:57.730
when I get what I do is when I travel,
when I travel,
I got to sit in an airport.

2326
02:29:57.770 --> 02:30:02.240
No,
I'm not going to,
I don't walk around in circles.
I don't,
I don't watch movies.

2327
02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:06.050
No.
I either read for the podcast or a hammer Twitter.

2328
02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:10.940
So that's what's going on.
It's good to do for obviously for obvious reasons,

2329
02:30:10.941 --> 02:30:14.930
but it,
it kind of keeps you informed,

2330
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:19.660
you know,
how like,
oh,
it's getting too,
too many.
Um,
you know,

2331
02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:22.370
a lot of people follow you,
you know,
so if there,

2332
02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:24.800
if you get a certain number of people falling,

2333
02:30:24.801 --> 02:30:26.690
you can't respond to everything and you can't read.
So a lot of,

2334
02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:31.130
a lot of times people will be like,
Hey,
let me hire someone to do that.
You know,

2335
02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:33.110
or,
or it,
hey,
you know,

2336
02:30:33.111 --> 02:30:35.990
I'm not going to spend more time on their whatever cause I'm too busy.

2337
02:30:35.991 --> 02:30:38.480
So instead of just maybe you know,
a little,

2338
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:41.540
they'll just be completely not shit on it,
you know?
Yeah.

2339
02:30:41.541 --> 02:30:43.820
They'll post stuff and then just kind of be it.
That'll be it.

2340
02:30:43.821 --> 02:30:47.510
But for a year you're in touch now.
You know what's going on.
Yeah.

2341
02:30:47.511 --> 02:30:50.960
And I'd get a lot of good feedback and a lot of good questions.
Yeah.

2342
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:54.850
Got a lot of good questions and so that's worth it.
So if you want it that,
yeah.

2343
02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:59.630
Twitter,
Instagram and Facebook,
we're both on there as well.

2344
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:06.730
And that is kind of where we're at with this whole gig now.

2345
02:31:10.650 --> 02:31:11.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2346
02:31:11.610 --> 02:31:14.970
<v 4>I guess to close it out tonight,
since we don't have time for questions.</v>

2347
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:16.663
<v 1>MMM.</v>

2348
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:20.130
<v 4>You know,
I just want to say thanks to everybody listening.
Thanks for everybody.</v>

2349
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:21.900
<v 0>All the feedback that you're giving me.
Hey,</v>

2350
02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:27.140
I'm hearing so much from first of all military guys,

2351
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:32.400
military service members that are out getting after it.

2352
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:36.180
Guys overseas right now that are crushing the enemy.

2353
02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:42.150
Godspeed.
Keep getting after it.
Stay aggressive.
Absolutely.

2354
02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:47.910
Stay safe.
Two police officers,
which I hear a ton from back here,

2355
02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:51.360
you guys,
thanks for what you do.
Thanks for keeping us safe.

2356
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:54.930
I can't even imagine having that job to be honest with you.

2357
02:31:54.931 --> 02:31:57.660
I can't imagine having that job.
I don't have the temperament for that job.

2358
02:31:58.350 --> 02:32:02.430
It's not.
It's not.
It's not for me.
And for those of you that do that job,

2359
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:06.960
stay strong.
I know it's hard times right now.
A lot of risk out there.

2360
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:11.990
A lot of aggressiveness of you guys are extremely precarious position every

2361
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:16.980
single day by the way.
Every single call,
every single moment.

2362
02:32:17.610 --> 02:32:22.290
So
thank you for what you do.
Firefighters,

2363
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:22.980
of course,

2364
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:27.980
same thing you guys getting after it and just running towards fire,

2365
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:33.090
right?
That's overcoming an instinct.
That's what you do for a living.

2366
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:34.770
So thank you for what you do.

2367
02:32:35.430 --> 02:32:40.430
Then of course we have all the workforce out there that is building and creating

2368
02:32:44.941 --> 02:32:49.941
things and making things happen and you are grinding and you building at your

2369
02:32:50.581 --> 02:32:51.960
world and your building our world.

2370
02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:56.310
And so thank you for doing that.

2371
02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.000
And of course,

2372
02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:05.810
and most important as you roll through and as you continue,

2373
02:33:10.280 --> 02:33:12.710
think about wooden leg,

2374
02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.460
think about living hard,

2375
02:33:17.180 --> 02:33:21.800
think about holding the line,
think about being vigilant

2376
02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:29.140
and stay,
stay uncomfortable,

2377
02:33:31.450 --> 02:33:33.490
stay true,

2378
02:33:35.390 --> 02:33:40.390
and stay forward forward of the decay.

2379
02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:47.600
And you do that
by getting out there,

2380
02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:50.490
getting after it.

2381
02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:57.640
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2382
02:33:59.220 --> 02:33:59.610
<v 2>out.</v>
