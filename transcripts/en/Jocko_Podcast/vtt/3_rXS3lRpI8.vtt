This is Jocko podcast number 88 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.250
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.210
I went into a public house to get a pint of beer.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
The Public Guinea epon says,
we serve no redcoats here.

5
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.280
The girls behind the bar,
they laughed and giggled,
fit to die.

6
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.620
I outs to in to the streets again and to myself says,

7
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.790
I owe.
It's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away.

8
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.920
But it's,
thank you Mr. Atkins.
When the band begins to play,

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.500
when the band begins to play my boys,
the band begins to play.
Oh,
it's,

10
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.370
thank you Mr. Atkins.
When the band begins to play,

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.290
I went into a theater as sober as could be.

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.050
They gave a drunk civilian room,
but they hadn't known for me.

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.450
They sent me to the gallery or round the music halls.

14
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.690
But when it comes to fight and Lord,
they shoved me in the stalls for,

15
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.020
it's Tommy,
this and Tommy that and Tommy wait outside.

16
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
But it's special train for Atkins.
When the troopers on the tide,

17
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.130
the troop ships on the tide.
My Boys,
the troop ships on the tide.

18
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
Oh,
it's special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide.

19
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.353
<v 0>Yes.</v>

21
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.540
Making Maka uniforms that guard you while you sleep is cheaper than them.

22
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:47.620
Uniforms in their starvation,
cheap and hustling.

23
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:52.621
Drunken soldiers when they're going larger bit is five times better business

24
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:57.310
than parade and in full kit.
Then it's Tommy,

25
00:01:57.311 --> 00:02:00.460
this and Tommy that and Tommy,
how's your soul?

26
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.650
But it's thin red line of Arrows.
When the drums begin to roll,

27
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.260
the drums begin to roll.
My boys that drums begin to roll.
Oh,

28
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:15.190
it's thin red line of Arrows.
When the drums begin to roll.

29
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.600
We aren't no thin red arrows.
No,
we aren't.

30
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.190
No black guards too.

31
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.810
But single men in barracks most remarkable like you.

32
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.600
And if sometimes our conduct is in all your fancy paints,

33
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.530
why single men in barracks don't grow into plaster saints while it's Tommy,

34
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:45.270
this and Tommy that and Tommy fall behind.
But it's,

35
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.630
please walk in the front,
sir.
When there's trouble in the wind,

36
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.550
when there's trouble in the wind,
my boys,
there's trouble in the wind.
Oh,

37
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.360
it's please walk to the front.
