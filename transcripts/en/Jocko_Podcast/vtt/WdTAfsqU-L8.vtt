00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.620
This is Jocko podcast number 32 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.310
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.590
And since Jocko podcast number 31 went long with the very heavy and dark book,

4
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.250
we decided to end that one and not do any Q and a,

5
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
which means that today we have 100% Q and a for the troops.

6
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.090
And obviously this comes from the questions come from you all that are
listening.

7
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.900
Um,

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.900
mostly on Twitter and on Facebook is where I get these questions from.

9
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
So thanks to everyone for submitting these questions so that we can answer them

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
for you.

11
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.870
<v 1>Echo.
Good evening,
good evening.
All right.</v>

12
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.080
The first question I want to say I like this first question.

13
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
It's a good question.
Yup.
Echo approves of the first question.

14
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.960
I have most questions for sure.
Uh,
okay.
First question,

15
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.670
how does one who grew up in the ghetto,

16
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.580
quote unquote involved with gangs,
drugs,

17
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.390
witnessing murders and all that good stuff,
overcome that mentality where you're,

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.670
your guard is always up,

19
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
come from a family of immigrants and growing up really poor,

20
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.730
we had to make a lot of sacrifices and as I get older I feel that in some of

21
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:39.240
these ways,
um,
in some ways this affects my daily life.

22
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.850
I'm proud of my beginnings and I cherish my mistakes,
but still,

23
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.380
even in my senior year in college,

24
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.980
I feel some resentment towards these privileged kids who seem like they have it

25
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.814
all.

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.890
I really find it hard to get along with them because in a way I see them as weak

27
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.450
because they haven't suffered through hard times or have have to struggle as a

28
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.284
minority.

29
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.110
What should I do to learn to love them and respect them as equals?

30
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.450
<v 0>Yeah,
that is,
that is a good question.</v>

31
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:13.451
I definitely have seen a seen that seen people go through that mentality where

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.640
they're,
they're having that attitude.
And I'll tell Ya,
when I was a kid,

33
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.530
I actually,
I had a girlfriend when I was a good,
this,

34
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.650
this girl and we know in where her friend was my friend as well.

35
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:32.150
So we were all kind of friends and one of the girls,

36
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.600
one of the things that she said,
which I thought was brilliant and she said,
uh,

37
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.050
everybody has a hard luck story.
Like no matter you go and talk to somebody.

38
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.530
They had their struggle that they went to or went through and you know,

39
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.760
whether it was divorce,
whether it was abuse,
whether it was money struggles,

40
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.340
whether there was fighting in the house,
whether it was jail,

41
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.820
whether there's drugs,
whether it was alcoholic or workaholic or whatever.

42
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.990
Whatever situation you've been in,

43
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.130
everybody's got a hard luck story or something that challenged them.

44
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.410
And it might not be really obvious on the surface.
I mean,

45
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.400
you know,
for instance,
this question here,
the,
the fact,

46
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.080
the way that the question is phrased,
you can hear he's talking about the,

47
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.220
the things that we,
you know,
he said family of immigrants growing up really poor,

48
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.050
we had to make a lot of sacrifices,
right?
So right there,
right there,

49
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
you can see that he's got a certain amount of familial pride and he's talking

50
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.610
about his family as we and a group of being together.
And you know,

51
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.060
that might not be money that might not be expensive clothes,

52
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.490
but that's an incredibly powerful thing.
It's a,

53
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.930
you're incredibly lucky to have that.
Now you tell me who's,
who's more,

54
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.510
who has a tougher challenge,

55
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.630
the person that grows up in a tight knit family where everyone sticks together

56
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.280
and everyone makes sacrifices together,
or the kid who grows up,

57
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.870
whose dad makes a ton of money,
Dad's never home,
dad chooses,

58
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.900
literally chooses work over the family.

59
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.430
And how does that affect the kids' personality?
You know,
I mean the kids,

60
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:17.110
kids can come from any background and end up in really tough situations with

61
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.820
drugs,
alcohol addiction or whatever that came from really good circumstances are

62
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.360
really bad.
Service was,
it doesn't even matter.
You can come from both.
So.

63
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.900
So that's part one.
Part one is like,
you know,

64
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.330
you don't know what kind of struggles other people have been through.

65
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.800
They might have been,
they might have,

66
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.830
they might be at a 22 year old senior in college driving a BMW that has more

67
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.050
demons in their life than you do.
So it's,

68
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.620
it's a little bit arrogant to walk around and think that your demons or worse

69
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.170
than anybody else's demons,
you just don't,

70
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.940
you just don't know what their demons are.
Now on top of that,

71
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.100
if you just want to look at like the privileged,
the monetary side of it,

72
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.090
I promise you that despite the fact that you grew up in a ghetto and you got to,

73
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:07.720
your family had to make sacrifices.

74
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.930
There are people that you're the privileged to kit cause you get some kid that

75
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.331
grew up in South America or some kid that grew up in Africa that you know,

76
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.860
you think you had it tough,
they didn't have a house.
They got,
you know,
uh,

77
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.150
political strife in their city.
They watched their parents get killed,
whatever.

78
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.910
So you're a privileged person to somebody else.

79
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.400
So let's keep that in mind as well.
And once again,

80
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.590
you don't know what that looks like.

81
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.200
You don't know what kind of struggles people have been through.
So

82
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.200
let's just try and

83
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.950
I'll use the term judge.

84
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.970
Let's try and judge people not on what they are,

85
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.900
but on who they are as a person.
And you know,
for me,
you,
you know,

86
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:57.350
you talked about the,
the minority thing.
It to me,
I don't care about race,
color,

87
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.760
creed and all that stuff matters to me.

88
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840
I don't care about socio economic background.
None of that stuff matters to me.

89
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.170
I don't judge you on that.
You know why?
Because in the military,

90
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.490
in the seal teams,
the,
the,

91
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.530
the good seals came from every background.

92
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.240
Every one of those backgrounds.

93
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320
The bad seals came from every one of those bad backgrounds.
There was,

94
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.840
there was kids that grew up rich with a silver spoon in their mouth.

95
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.460
They were awesome seals.

96
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.640
There are kids that grew up in the ghetto and their parents were gang bangers.

97
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.430
Awesome seals,
same as reverse is true.

98
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.920
There was kids that grew up with a silver spoon in their mouth and went to a

99
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.900
private school and they were horrible seals.

100
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.190
And there was kids that grew up gang bangers and they were horrible.
So,

101
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.210
so it doesn't matter what matters is not what you are.

102
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.980
It's who you are as a person.
So I,

103
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.380
yeah,
I'm,
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna judge.
And in fact,
if there's,

104
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:51.080
if I was going to name some negative traits that do bother me,

105
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:54.350
it's more of them would be judging people based on stereotypes.

106
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.740
Be Judging people,
judging the book by its cover.
If you're doing that,

107
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.590
that's a negative,
you know,
that is a weakness.
So,

108
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.010
so just check yourself and realize that you don't know what people's backgrounds

109
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:09.800
are.
You don't know what goes on behind closed doors.

110
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.840
You don't know what Tufts situation people have been through and judge them not

111
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.330
based on that stuff.
Just judge them on who they are as a person.

112
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.620
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah,
fully.
And</v>

113
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.240
I think this kind of helps,
you know how,
let's say like,
uh,

114
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.860
let's say you're in a boat,
right?

115
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.910
Like a rowboat and you're all trying to get upstream and you have all different

116
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:33.670
kinds of people and then you have,

117
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.570
you have weak or people and you have stronger people.
And the strong person

118
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.910
put,
whether it's by his choice or not,
he's strong.
He can,
you know,

119
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:46.730
he's been working out,
I don't know,
he's in shape.
He can roll a lot.

120
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.450
So he went through all this sacrifice,

121
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.330
but at the end he's a stronger person.

122
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.110
So you can look at it in a way where you now have the power.

123
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.260
So be responsible with your power,
like to help.
So you have to run,

124
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.760
it's like you have a bigger burden,
but you have to embrace that.
Not Burden,

125
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.940
but you have a bigger workload because you're more prepared for it in life.

126
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.720
<v 0>And actually speaking to that.</v>

127
00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:14.721
So now that means that you have the power to to give people knowledge and

128
00:08:15.631 --> 00:08:17.820
perspective on what you've been through and that's important.
Now,

129
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:19.890
there's two ways to do that.
We talk about this all the time.

130
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.900
If I go up to you echo and I say,
hey,
you don't know what you're doing.

131
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.750
Let me show you the correct way to film this.

132
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.120
Let me show you the correct way to use this microphone,
right?
You.

133
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.580
How would you feel about that?
I don't know if I would like that.
No,
no,

134
00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.770
of course you wouldn't.
If I came up to you and said,
listen,

135
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:41.640
you don't know what it's like to struggle.

136
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.240
Are you going to be,
are you going to be open to hear what I'm about to say?
No,

137
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:48.780
you're not.
No one is,
no one is.
But if I said,
hey man,

138
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:51.140
it's really good to meet you.
Oh,
and then we start to develop a relationship.

139
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.691
But I got,
you know,

140
00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:54.360
what's one thing that we got to remember is what it's like for maybe some
people,

141
00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:56.820
you know,
when I was growing I had to deal with this.
Oh,
okay.

142
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.660
Now your mind is open to it.
You start learning,
you start growing yourself.

143
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.690
So by not being arrogant and by being humble and thinking that you have,

144
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.480
you may have been through worse things than me or whatever the case may be.

145
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.320
We're,
we're actually going to make each other better.
And that's the goal here.

146
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.590
Yeah.
So you just got to stay humble on these things and,

147
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.240
and it'll be,
it'll,
it'll work out better for you in the end.

148
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.070
It will absolutely work out better for you in the end.
Yeah.

149
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.810
Judge people by the content of their character,
I believe is a,
uh,
uh,

150
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.620
a way of putting it.
That makes a lot of sense to me.

151
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.260
Next question,
Jocko and echo.
How do you guys feel about the ensign,

152
00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:46.261
the noise situation demoting yourself after time off the mat?

153
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.540
So this was a pretty interesting question.
And it's,

154
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.860
there's a guy named incident annoy and he's a,

155
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.000
he's a old school Jujitsu Guy,

156
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:04.510
old school MMA guy,
and he's a black belt in Jujitsu,

157
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.220
but he fought in UFC fun pride.
He was the shooto champion.

158
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.710
He's just to,

159
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:14.120
just to a really old school kind of Oh,

160
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.020
Oji from Hawaii,
from Hawaii.
And just to,

161
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.670
just a really well respected guy as a fighter and a guy that,
you know,
his,

162
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.740
he,

163
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.740
he kind of had that warrior ethos that people talk about,

164
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.480
you know,
where he would say,
look,
I'm,
I'm,

165
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.200
I would rather die in this fight than lose.
And he meant it.

166
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.670
And so he's been,
but he moved to Japan,

167
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.140
he's of Japanese heritage and he moved to Japan a long time ago.
I mean,

168
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.900
I want to say 10 or maybe 15,
maybe even longer.
Yeah.

169
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.890
A long time ago he moved back to Japan.
He's,
he's,
uh,

170
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.640
you know,
that's where he's kind of built his life is in Japan.

171
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.370
And along the way,
I think his last fight was maybe,

172
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.760
maybe eight to 10 years ago,
was his last fight.

173
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.610
And since then,
you know,
there was the,

174
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.750
the horrible earthquake and the tsunami in Japan and he did work as sort of a,

175
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.450
as sort of a charity to raise money and help out those victims.

176
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.700
So that's what he's been focused on and he's been focused on I guess his family

177
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:31.640
and whatever else.
But in that time he,
he,

178
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.900
he strayed off the mats of justice.

179
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.310
He stopped the training and,
and so,
you know,

180
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.950
he had other things going on in his life and he stopped training.

181
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.310
I don't recommend anybody stopped training and um,

182
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.200
but for whatever reason he stopped training and he stopped training and I saw a

183
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.120
little interview with him as he was talking about this.

184
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.780
He stopped training for like 10 years,
10 years of note and he said,
no training.

185
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.640
He just was stopped training and now all you know,
he's,

186
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.870
cause he's a Jujitsu guy.

187
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.130
Eventually Jujitsu gets back in your brain and he started getting back on the

188
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:08.920
mats and when he got back on the mats,

189
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.950
he felt that he didn't deserve to be a black belt anymore.

190
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.350
And it wasn't just because he was,

191
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.020
his timing was off or he was out of condition.

192
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.010
He felt like Jujitsu had had changed.
And he's right in the last 10 years,

193
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.300
digit two.
It's changed a lot.
And you know what,
yesterday Jujitsu changed a lot.

194
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.540
And the day before,
I mean,
Jujitsu changes every day.
Every day it changes.
I'm,

195
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.783
I'm shocked.

196
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.170
Dean will come up with some new thing.

197
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.820
Dean's very,

198
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.850
very good at coming up with new things and he comes up with a new thing,

199
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.490
like something I,
neither one of us had thought of.

200
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.210
He probably does that once or twice a month.

201
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.040
He comes up with this new thing.

202
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.580
I might do it once every three to six months maybe.
Or I go,
okay,

203
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:00.940
I phone to something new and I'm all excited.
And Dean goes,
well,
no,

204
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:05.290
just put your hips over there.
And then I'm like,
so
it's,

205
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.320
it's just one of those things that it changes.

206
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.210
And so ensign got on the mat again and said,
oh,
I don't,

207
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.120
I don't think I deserve to be a black belt right now.

208
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.800
And so he demoted himself back to the purple belts.
And

209
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.380
so people said,
the question is,
how do I feel about it?
Oh,
and by the way,

210
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.270
since this question got asked,

211
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.280
he actually re promoted himself back to black belch.
Right.

212
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.200
So how did that go down?
That was John.
He talked to his,
his,
his,

213
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.390
his instructor that gave him the black belt.
Right.
John Lewis,

214
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.570
from what I understand,
I didn't read it as much into that part of it.

215
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:46.210
That was mainly just reading other people's takes on it,
like their reaction.

216
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:49.920
But you didn't go to the source material almost over to the source material of

217
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:53.760
the concept more,
let's go to the source material anyway.

218
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.360
But he had a conversation with John Lewis and John Lewis said,
what?

219
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.870
What was the overall,
do you know what he said?
Well,
whatever you say,

220
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.890
I did go to the source material.
There you go.
And,

221
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.550
but I don't want to quote it exactly,
but John Louis basically said,
look,

222
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.780
you deserve to black belt.
Oh,
and you know what he said?
He said,
look,

223
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.670
someone that's a doctor that became a doctor and then that's not practicing,

224
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:22.090
but then they want to get back in the field.
They don't not become a doctor.

225
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.050
They just go and learn new techniques and get refreshed.

226
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.680
They don't have to take their doctor tag off their door and he said,

227
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:30.760
you're a doctor of Jujitsu.

228
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.710
You just got to get refreshed in the new techniques and get back into it.
And,

229
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.000
and some said,
okay,
you know,
he,

230
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:41.740
he agreed with it and he promoted himself back to black belt.

231
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:47.140
So,
you know,
again,
I think from my,
from my perspective,

232
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.440
um,
I say good for him.

233
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.090
I think both those actions I agree with.

234
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.310
I think it's actually pretty cool that he demoted himself and,
and said,

235
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.980
you know what?
I don't,
I don't,
I haven't been in the game.

236
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.640
I got out of the game and I don't deserve to be a black belt right now.

237
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.240
So I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna put it on.
I'm disgracing the black belt.

238
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.980
But I also see the mind flip of,
Hey,
you know what?

239
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.220
I fought and trained for a giant portion of my life and I have innate knowledge

240
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.670
that got me the black belt and now I need to get back in the game.

241
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:27.110
But I'm still a black belt.
I I really respect and son,

242
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.190
I think he's a,

243
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.550
I think he's a guy with a lot of heart and pride and I respect his decision.

244
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.220
I don't think it's pretty simple from my perspective.

245
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.980
<v 1>Yup.
Yeah man.</v>

246
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:44.870
It's one of those things where when you hear someone make a good point about one

247
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.080
side of the whole deal,
you're like,
oh yeah,
that's true.

248
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.650
And then you see someone else making an,
when I saw it I was like,
Dang,

249
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.580
that is good.
He that is so humble and he,
and he's really keeping it real.

250
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:58.400
He's like,
I'm not a black belt.
I'm going,
I think I'm a purple belt there.

251
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.070
Here's where I am.
And then,
um,
Chris Helder,
who's,

252
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.270
he's one of the original [inaudible] in Bro,

253
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.550
that guy's smart.
Um,
he,

254
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.720
he said essentially kind of the same thing as John Lewis Ward.

255
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.690
It's kind of the same thing where you,
you know,
Jujitsu changes,

256
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.320
it doesn't be changing whether you're doing it or not and you earned it.

257
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:20.960
You're the black belt,
you know,
your instructors,
you know,

258
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:24.140
recognize you as a black belt,
you are a black belt regardless.

259
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.650
And just cause you jumped back on the wave of Jujitsu and maybe weren't as good

260
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:33.260
as at surfing.
You know,
you're still,
you're still that,
that black belt.

261
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.610
You just got it.
Like how you said,

262
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.130
you just got to get refreshed with all the new techniques if you want to,

263
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.370
you know,
be up this week.
And he said it way more eloquently than that obviously,

264
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:44.090
but men read reading now it's like,
Dang,
he's right man.
But,

265
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:49.200
but he did say that it's like,
it's kind of like false humility,
which,
um,

266
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.430
I did pretty much everything Chris Hunter has to say about you too,

267
00:16:52.431 --> 00:16:55.940
but I couldn't really get there as far as me feeling that it was false in any

268
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:56.330
way.

269
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.600
<v 0>No.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't think so either.</v>

270
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.070
<v 1>Yeah,
I didn't,
I didn't feel that,
um,
you know,</v>

271
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.660
whether or not I understood exactly what,

272
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.320
<v 0>yeah,
I guess I could see,
what are you saying</v>

273
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.670
where he could come to that conclusion a little bit,
but I don't,

274
00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:15.300
I don't know gree with that piece of it.
I don't because to me it's actually,

275
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.840
hey look guys,
I don't think there's anything false about saying,
hey,

276
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.380
I am not good enough to be a black belt right now.

277
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.140
Sort of therefore I'm putting on,
I think I'm about purple belt level.

278
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.740
I know what it feels like to be a black belt and I don't feel like one right
now.

279
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.360
Yeah,
I think that makes sense.

280
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.180
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean it does to me too.
But ultimately I think</v>

281
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.580
it's,
it's however you,

282
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:42.220
and I think your instructors have a lot to do with it as well.

283
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.620
How however you want to see it.
You know what I mean?
I,

284
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.700
cause there is a lot to be said for someone who will do that because a lot of

285
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:51.660
guys,
they,
their black belt and they're gone.
You'll be like,
hey,

286
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.600
and some guys do it.
If they get their brown belt,
Brown belt,
I'm gone.

287
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:56.970
I'm a brown belt.
Because it does happen sometimes,

288
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.280
but it shouldn't happen at all.

289
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.460
But guys get their black belt and then stop training.

290
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.720
I know a few guys like that,
but you know,
so it's like,
Hey,

291
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:09.150
I got my black belt and I'm not saying they chose to do.

292
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.970
<v 0>Yeah.
The thing that's weird about that,</v>

293
00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:14.780
the thing that makes that surprising is that it takes a lot of dedication to get

294
00:18:14.781 --> 00:18:17.240
your black belt and the only way you can have that much dedication as if you

295
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:21.390
actually enjoy training Jujitsu.
And if you don't enjoy training Jujitsu,

296
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.750
then he'd go get your black belt.
Why would you stop training?

297
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:25.920
That doesn't make sense to me.
It's kind of like the,

298
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.390
the fact that people talk about going through seal training and they say,
oh,

299
00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:34.100
do you really eat?
If some,
if,
if you,

300
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.150
they think if you,
you can make it through.
If you don't want to make it through.

301
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.360
If you don't truly want to make it through,
then guess what,
you're,

302
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.740
you're probably not going to make it through.

303
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:44.870
And it's the same thing with Jiu Jitsu.
If you don't really enjoy it,

304
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.860
if you're doing it just for the black belt,
it's kind of,

305
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.330
it's kind of hard to do it just for the black belt.
That's my point.

306
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.680
Just like if you're going to go through seal training just to get your seal

307
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:57.080
trident and just to claim,
Hey,
I'm a navy seal,

308
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.910
if that's the only reason that you're doing it,

309
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.230
it's gonna be hard for you to get through.

310
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.910
<v 1>Right.
So,
so I would imagine anywhere,</v>

311
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.040
I would guess that it wasn't their only reason,

312
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:09.900
but let's just say either that was a big reason to begin with or just over time

313
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:13.680
that started to be the reason,
you know,
you know,
I mean,

314
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:16.320
people can fall in and out of that mindset,
in that trap,
you know,

315
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.180
where it's like,
I just want that belt.

316
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.840
I want to walk around and be known as a black belt or whatever.

317
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.580
And then that mindset starts to just creep in their mind and it becomes like a

318
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:29.220
major part of their thinking.
So it's like,
Dang,
this work,

319
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.970
especially when frustration comes in and lights

320
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.950
<v 0>kind of cool things about Nogi in the idea that,</v>

321
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.240
and everyone gives belts now with Nogi.
I mean dean gives belts with Nogi.

322
00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:43.780
I mean I support giving belts with no GI even though guide never wears a,

323
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.390
and he doesn't need a belt,
but you don't say,
Oh this guy's a black belt.

324
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.410
But one thing that is cool about Nogi and kind of,
especially during the,
uh,

325
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.070
during the rogue years of Nogi where it wasn't a thing yet and we were just

326
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:56.290
doing it and there were guys at the time that were only,

327
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.870
didn't you start off training?
Only knew Augie.
Yup.
Yeah,

328
00:19:58.871 --> 00:20:00.640
there were guys that only trained Nogi.

329
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.660
So it was really a real thing of the belts literally didn't matter cause they

330
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:07.240
didn't exist.
And then it was just how good are you?

331
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.920
Where do you fall out on the totem pole of,
I can tap you,

332
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.290
you can't tap me,
but this guy can tap me and I,
you know what I mean?
That would,

333
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.170
there was something pretty cool about that because belts for me have never been

334
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.360
a goal or anything really to me.
To me,
I just wanted to be better

335
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.880
<v 1>at the Jujitsu.
Yeah.
But regardless,
that is a part of it for a lot.</v>

336
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.770
Yeah,
a lot for some people's thinking.

337
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.030
So I think with that way of thinking,
I think,
I think he can be like that.

338
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.870
They'll get a black belt and be like,
oh,
finally now I get to focus on my career.

339
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.810
<v 0>And I would,</v>

340
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.770
the other important thing about this is like don't stop training Jujitsu.

341
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.670
Like don't just stop Turkey,
man.
That's not good.

342
00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.700
Even if you can only train a couple of times a week or once,

343
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:54.070
even if you train once a week,
man training once a week,
you know,

344
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:57.100
just to keep your head in the game,
keep your dues.

345
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.130
At least you can see the new moves,
you can see where things are developing.

346
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:03.310
Maybe that'll ignite your desire to get back on the map more.

347
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.760
But don't stop training.
You know?
And even on the days when you don't want it,

348
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:11.440
there's one day where you don't want to train Coltrane that day.
You know,

349
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.130
go train that day.
What it does to a big part of it,
it is,

350
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.940
it keeps your body in tune with the Jujitsu move from it was the general

351
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:19.230
movement.

352
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.030
Cause that's what one of the things that instance said where he was like,

353
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.030
my body wasn't moving the same,
it wasn't moving.
And there's,

354
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.270
it's one thing to be like,
okay,
I'm getting older,
I'm less mobile but negative.

355
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:30.560
If you did some move,
we didn't know anything about that.

356
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.840
But just some movement that has certain kind of movement that develops just kind

357
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:36.640
of naturally,
you know,

358
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.700
when you're rolling all the time and if you lose that 10 years,

359
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:41.230
I could see you lose that.
So it's like,
Dang,

360
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:44.890
my hip escape is really labored right now.
And I just,

361
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.640
it's hard to do when it's so easy to do normally,
you know?
So,
you know,
I can,

362
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.230
I can understand.
I see that,
you know.
Um,
but yeah,

363
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.140
that is really goes with anything.
Anything that you're doing,
like any,
you know,

364
00:21:56.141 --> 00:22:00.310
where you find this also is people that are in business that whatever,

365
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.540
whatever level they advanced out of,
they,

366
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.940
they then let's say it's uh,
they,

367
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.110
they move out of a technical position and they move up to a management position.

368
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.010
Don't just walk away completely from the technical side,
like just go,

369
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:17.050
go do it once a week.
Go get in the game.

370
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:20.620
Make sure that you still understand so that you stay so that you stay in the

371
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:23.890
game and you don't lose.
You don't wake up because you were a black belt.

372
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:26.230
That's why he got promoted above into a management position.

373
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:29.620
You are a black bottle in that technical side and they saw potential for you.

374
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.040
So when you walk away from it and when you move up,
don't just walk away.

375
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:34.750
Completely stay in the game.
Go.

376
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:39.751
Do you know if you're in the military just because you got promoted to whatever,

377
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.080
a company commander or a or a staff guy on the battalion,
they'll just say,
well,

378
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:46.880
I'm never going to go in to kill house again.
No,
no,
no.
Go on the kill house,

379
00:22:46.881 --> 00:22:51.610
so even if you can only do it once every week or,
or maybe once a month,

380
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.770
you just get to go and keep your head in the game.

381
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.240
You got to do that so you stay fresh.
You stay,
like you said,

382
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:02.320
you'd keep that mental game there.
Whereas if you just walk away

383
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.780
and where I would have guys that were senior to me come out and go through

384
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:08.800
little blocks of training with us.

385
00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:10.930
Maybe they come out and go to the kill house with us for a day.

386
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.380
They didn't know what they were doing.
They didn't know what they were doing.

387
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.750
Part of it was because they walked away for too long,

388
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.930
but even when they didn't know what they were doing,
you were still like,
hey man,

389
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:23.080
good for him for coming out.
You know?
It wasn't like you said,
oh,
look at him.

390
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:24.580
He doesn't know.
I don't respect him.
No,

391
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:27.520
you're actually actually the opposite is true.
You'd say,
aw man,
props,

392
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:30.610
props to the Bossier for coming out and getting after it with the boys for a
day.

393
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.980
He doesn't know what he's doing,
but maybe we can help them.

394
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.700
And if they had that mentality the whole time because it's pretty,

395
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:39.040
it's a lot easier to maintain a scale than it is to learn it.

396
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.120
So all you have to do,
you're a black belt man.
Get on the mat once a week,

397
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:47.520
you know,
just,
just get in there and roll.
Some people,
roll them up.
Yeah.

398
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.840
But um,
I back to ensign.
I dig it.

399
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:55.841
Either way I even dig it that he did it and then really took some peer review

400
00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:01.030
and it was like,
I maybe didn't look at it.
This is an open minded making process.

401
00:24:01.031 --> 00:24:04.730
When you went back in,
went to the stores as instructor?
Yeah,
we support down,

402
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.960
return back to the instructor and he was like,
hey.
And he was like,
yes,
yes sir.

403
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:10.880
You know,
that's kind of where it,
where it all came from.

404
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.350
Eni Eni went back to black belt.
Even that,
I can't help but respect,
you know,

405
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.790
pull situation it.
What if it's like a whole side note.

406
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.980
What if,
what if you go like,
um,
I will give you your black with Fabio,
right?
No.

407
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.220
Deanlets teen.
Okay.
So let's say you took 10 years off,

408
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.420
you came back and rule with dean.
Dean was like,
Bro,

409
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.530
I am your instructor.
I'm taking your belt,
I'm giving you a purple belt.

410
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.180
That would be awesome.
But like,
is that,
is that like,
you know,

411
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.610
as far as like,
can you do that or what?
Uh,
how do you feel about that?

412
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.110
I don't know,
but that would be very cool to see that happen.

413
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.360
Even just even just,
Oh,
you want to,

414
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.320
do you want to hear an old school story on Old School Jujitsu story?
Of course.

415
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:58.910
This is,
okay.
This is awesome.
So,
uh,
back in the day,

416
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.830
back in the day I was a blue belt.
Uh,
Dean was,

417
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.450
I think dean was a blue belt too.

418
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.010
He might've been a purple belt and there was another person that was a blue belt

419
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:12.080
at the time.
My wife,

420
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.830
your wife has a blue belts and blue belts and she was good.

421
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.080
She's a really good athlete.
Is that how you met your wife?

422
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.810
She was posed Jujitsu upon her,
wants me to write good.
So,

423
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.410
you know,
it was all good.
And we were training with Fabio and Fabio's,

424
00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:29.300
no fraud for populous,
great instructor.
And,

425
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.510
and we were at the academy one day and there's a guy from out of town in right.

426
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.580
And he's a purple belt,
purple belt.
You know,
you figure the guy's good,

427
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.370
but this is back in the day too.
This isn't that in the mid nineties,

428
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:46.490
so probably like 90,
I'll see 96.

429
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.830
And so this guy comes in from out of town and you know,

430
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.010
there wasn't that many Jujitsu schools in San Diego.

431
00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:57.350
There was like to write and it was that,
it was Fabio.
There was Rodrigo,

432
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.390
I think that was it at the time.
So anyways,
this guy comes in,

433
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:05.570
he's kind of a,
he's probably 35 years old,

434
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.100
probably 150 pounds,
purple belt.
So,
you know,

435
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.610
we're rolling and we're a little bit like,
okay,
the guys are pro vote.
Um,

436
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.450
but there's that attitude of the guys know,
the guy knows what he's doing.

437
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.990
So I didn't roll them,
but I'm watching him.
I'm rolling with Dean,

438
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:23.840
we're doing our thing and it's kind of the open mat period.
And,

439
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.400
and Fabio has enrolled with my wife and so my wife's,

440
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:33.290
you know,
she's good.
She's,
but she's,
uh,

441
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.690
the rolling and he gets her in a choke.

442
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.690
He gets her in a rear naked choke and she buries her chin,

443
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:45.980
like a white belt of like a,
like a defense,
you know,
I'm going very much answer.

444
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.420
He's not gonna choke me.
He chokes her face,

445
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:53.690
like I'm talking legit gets after it on her face and she starts crying and a

446
00:26:56.401 --> 00:27:01.160
little bit of blood all day and she had so,

447
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:06.090
so I'm just like,
and so I hear her scream or whatever.
And then I,

448
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:10.350
and then,
uh,
you know,
she gets up and he lets go and he's kind of like,
oh,

449
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:14.070
sorry,
uh,
blah,
blah blah.
And Fabio,
it looks at me,
he goes,

450
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.970
and the guy didn't know this.
My wife,
Fabio goes,

451
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.930
was Jocko,
you row with him now.
And I go,
okay.

452
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.540
So I even,
I,
I was like,
okay,
I'm going to smash him.

453
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.740
But I didn't intentionally like,
oh,

454
00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.030
assault him.
I just smashed him.
I mean I'm,

455
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.520
I crushed him and submitted him,

456
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:42.330
but I didn't like break his arm and,

457
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.650
but I smashed him and I was doing a lot of neon stomach at the time,

458
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:50.250
so I was just driving.
No dude,
it was like an early version of the park bench.

459
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:55.251
Sean's Dude I had who did the knee in his neck and we're smashing him and um,

460
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.880
and then I get done and I wore them out pretty good.

461
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.370
And Fabi was like,
now I will roll with you.

462
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.640
And Fabio tore him up and uh,

463
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.700
was like cracking armbars on him and choking him and smashing him.

464
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.570
And then the guys like the guys like broken down and Fabio is,

465
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.850
Fabio said,
you're not a purple belt.

466
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.310
And I can't remember if he took his purple belt,

467
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.290
but he kicked him out and he said,

468
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:27.660
don't ever come back here and you're not a purple belt.
And He,

469
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.510
I think he took his purple belt and said,
you're not a purple boat.
No.
You know,

470
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.030
he,
he's,
he also said,
I have one thing I remember him saying,
he was like,

471
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.540
this girl's been training here for two and a half years.
She's never been hurt.

472
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:40.320
She's never had a problem.
You come in here and hurt this girl,

473
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.690
you're not a purple belt.
You don't know what you're doing.

474
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.730
Give me your purple belt.
Yeah.
So that was a cool demotion.

475
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:52.020
Courtesy of Fabio Santos,
the old school Jujitsu.
Right.
They're so dang.
Yeah.

476
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:56.340
That's um,
yeah,
different situation though.
Yes,
it is a different situation,

477
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.970
but I think,
I don't know,
maybe we need to see more demotions in Jiu Jitsu.

478
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.050
That's a possibility.
Maybe I needed to get started on that.

479
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:08.940
Demote myself right now.
So,
all right,

480
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:12.750
that's awesome.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Man.
Old School Jujitsu.
Fabio.

481
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.520
But it's kind of interesting though,
right?

482
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.400
Cause it kind of falls the thing in the same way,

483
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.810
like in the same line is is that acceptable for a professor to demote their

484
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:25.590
student if they lost a step or once you earn that,

485
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.420
that black belt or the whatever the belt is once you earn it it's like you paid

486
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:33.490
those dues.
Yeah,
that's a tough one.
It's

487
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.230
interesting.
I,
I dunno,
I think,

488
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.650
I think I might be wrong in terms of the way view it,

489
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.550
but I think d motion is,
is kind of cool.
I think,

490
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:48.100
I think more demotions need to happen.
Like,

491
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:50.890
oh you haven't been coming to the gym for two years.
Cool.

492
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.160
Give gimme your brown belt.
You know what I mean?
Hey man,
sorry.
You know,

493
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.410
no one's ever going to come to my academy.
No,
I wouldn't say that.

494
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.680
That could be the case.
If the re like if you're,

495
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.990
if you're this highly competitive uh,

496
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.200
philosophy type team where you,
if you go out in autonomy,

497
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:14.950
you have to represent and that was the culture.
Real rigid like that then.
Yeah.

498
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.800
But you know Jiu Jitsu for life,
you know,
you can take 10 years off Jujitsu,

499
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.220
it's kind of part of you or whatever.

500
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.660
You were awarded this belt through your time efforts and stuff like that.

501
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.150
Then it's like now I've got to worry about all my time and effort that would

502
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:32.750
scare people off to go back cause I don't want to get demoted.
Yeah,
exactly.

503
00:30:32.751 --> 00:30:36.160
We got to do to earn it back.
But like I said,

504
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.920
if there was a job that you had to do,

505
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.870
basically it's like if you have a job to do as a brown belt,

506
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.840
you have to represent you.
You know,
like in a,
in a company or something,

507
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.150
you can't be the director of sales,

508
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.130
get that job and then now your performance sucks.
You know,

509
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.590
you can't do remit because you have a job to do.
But like I said,

510
00:30:53.591 --> 00:30:55.930
you just is not really a job where,
I don't know.

511
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.150
I mean when you're a brown belt in their school,

512
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.330
you have to go and help train the other people.
That's part of your job,
right?

513
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:05.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to show up and train with me,
right?
Yeah,
for sure.

514
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.820
Yeah.
If you're violating some,
you know,
some ethics or something like that,

515
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:12.190
then I mean even then you don't really take away the belt.

516
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.960
You'd take away their whole get outta here.
You know that.
But I think so.

517
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:19.570
So the bottom line is,
although I think demotions would be cool,

518
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.720
I don't think it's probably going to happen.
And I think that the,

519
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.690
I think that's tradition because although I do believe,

520
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.860
I think emotions are good idea.

521
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.430
I also do like some of the traditional aspects of Jujitsu and one of the

522
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:33.550
traditional aspects is when you get a belt to belt,
yeah you did it,

523
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:36.170
you put it all that time,
all that effort,
all that knowledge,
you know,

524
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:41.160
alright you get to keep your belt people barely.
But here's the,

525
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.090
here's the thing,
I think that's,

526
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.000
that's interesting about those funny is at the gym I will shout out things like,

527
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.640
like take that guys cause brown belt,

528
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.890
purple belt is really doing good against the brown belt.
I'll be like,

529
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:55.370
take his brown belt from him,
do it,
or kind of an instigator.

530
00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.020
I liked that.
I liked it.
That's part of our fun culture where you can say,

531
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.860
or if you roll with it,
let's say like,
oh,

532
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.750
I'll do this with like my friends or whatever.
If they're a brown belt in a in,

533
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.130
you know,
same belt as you,

534
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:12.190
and you get them and you get them like kind of easy or with a new move or

535
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.740
something that's real flashy or something,
you take their belt and say like,

536
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:17.850
you don't deserve that right now.
We're going to roll your doorbell.

537
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.410
You know what I mean?
But I think that that's kind of what's in our minds anyway.

538
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.830
So let's say a guy rolls in and he's a brown belt and he's getting smashed or

539
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:28.420
whatever by like purple belts.

540
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.660
One of the best things about Jujitsu is that the belt,

541
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.730
it doesn't really mean anything because you,

542
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.480
if you're a black belt and you come in here getting smashed by blue belts,

543
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.430
no one's sitting there thinking,
wow,
he's a black belt.
They're thinking,
no,

544
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:44.190
there's something wrong with them.
Yep,
exactly.
No,
no black button here.
So that's,

545
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.600
that's one of the best things about Jujitsu is the truth is on the mat.

546
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.340
So I guess it doesn't,
you don't need to get demoted.
Your mere existence is it

547
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.970
<v 1>motion if you're not,
if you're not training,</v>

548
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.690
like he goes back to what I was saying where you put in all that time because

549
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:59.870
it's really,
the belt is based on specific things and those things,

550
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:04.340
if you've done those things,
you've taken the time is one of them.
The knowledge,

551
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.040
the,
you know,
understanding of all this.
So I'll basically all,

552
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:11.750
all that the belt is based on,
that doesn't really go away.
You put in that time,

553
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:15.650
you have that knowledge,
you know.
All right.
I think echo scared.

554
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:19.980
I'm going to take his belt away
from,
maybe I'll take your belt through it.

555
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.860
Bring it,
there's going to be about a 45 second break in the podcast right now.

556
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.280
Anyway.
All right,
next question.
Dead Horse.

557
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.200
Go Jocko.

558
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.520
What do I say to someone I've trained and later claims this person claims that a

559
00:33:41.191 --> 00:33:45.650
certain thing was not covered in the training.
Uh,

560
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.440
in addition to the question says,
obviously excuses,

561
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.810
<v 0>obviously excuses.
So this is,
uh,</v>

562
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.000
this is a really pretty common question of how do you handle these situations.

563
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:59.120
And I've actually been lucky enough in my life to run a lot of training into a

564
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:01.130
lot of different situations,
mostly in the military.

565
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.590
And I've absolutely had this happen.

566
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:08.750
And there's one thing that I do when this happens,

567
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.770
and you can probably guess what it is,
I take ownership of it.
So check it out.

568
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:14.150
If somebody comes to me and says,
Oh,

569
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.040
you were supposed to train us on x and you didn't,
and I know that I did,

570
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.950
and it was in the curriculum and we covered it.
And I say,
I don't say no.

571
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:25.940
I trained you in into here it is.
No,
I say,
okay,
let's get it trained.

572
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:28.790
Then what do I gotta do?
Lay.
Here it is.
Let me Redo the curriculum.

573
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.520
Let me show it to you again because here's the thing,
as a trainer,

574
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:36.050
it's not just your job.
This is what I used to tell my guys when I ran training.

575
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.060
The guys that were the instructor cadre,
I'd say,

576
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:41.270
listen to it isn't your job just to run the training,

577
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.800
just to provide the training.

578
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.240
It is your job to ensure that the training is absorbed.

579
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.400
That's the difference.
That's a big difference between philosophies of training.

580
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.850
I,

581
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.810
my goal when I'm training someone is to make sure that the training is absorbed

582
00:34:56.811 --> 00:35:00.800
into the mind.
Otherwise go watch a youtube video because a youtube video,

583
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:03.350
you can see the same instruction.
Yeah,
but no,

584
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.690
I need to seek you out and say,
okay,
where?
Where did you miss it?

585
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:12.320
Where did and also where did I fail in my training?
If I covered it,

586
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:13.190
why don't you remember it?

587
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.270
That means I didn't cover well enough or I didn't teach it well enough and I

588
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:21.410
think that you,
you then you retrain them.

589
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.640
You get them up to speed.

590
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.070
At some point they're going to realize that you did train them.
I mean,

591
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:28.850
if they truly forgot or even if they didn't forget,

592
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:30.200
but they're just placing the blame on you,

593
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.620
they're going to realize that you know,
they're gonna know that you know,

594
00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:38.250
that you train them when they,
when you reflect the same information

595
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.860
<v 1>and do it again.
So I think it's pretty simple answer.
Uh,</v>

596
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.520
when someone is saying you haven't trained them,
take responsibility for it,

597
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:51.120
take ownership for it and say,
okay,
look,
let me get you trained on it.
My,

598
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:53.220
my apologies.
I'm here to train you.

599
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:56.730
Let me make sure that I train you and make sure that you absorb it.
Let's go.

600
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.250
I think that your way of training should be

601
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.120
done or performed with kids as well.
Like parents with their kids,
you know how,

602
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.660
cause you know how the kid,
the kid's misbehaving and the variants,

603
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:16.740
like I dunno why he does that.
I told him not to pitch a fit.
Oh yeah,

604
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.390
I know you've probably told them or you went through the motions of telling them

605
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:20.370
or whatever.
But man,

606
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:23.490
you gotta you gotta train them and make sure that it's absorbed.
You know?

607
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.350
Absolutely.
Still.
And I always kind of think of it this way,
not kind of,

608
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:32.250
I really think of it this way where if your kid is misbehaving,

609
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.010
it's something you did or didn't do,
of course.

610
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:38.090
So you can't really sit there and be like,
oh,

611
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.200
blaming the kid for misbehaving or whatever.
Or you know,
you're,
you're right.

612
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.070
I wonder,

613
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:49.070
isn't it weird that you can have families where one kid can go to go to high

614
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:55.230
school and do well and do great on their sats and get to a great college and go

615
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:59.970
to and go be a doctor and the other kid can become a heroin addict.

616
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.250
Yup.
Isn't that strange?
It's interesting,
but I,

617
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.800
and I think long time ago I would talk to you about this like long time and how

618
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:11.460
do we blame the parents and well that's the thing.
That's the,

619
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.980
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm not saying blame the parents.

620
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:16.740
I'm not saying that cause because that would,
if you're blaming them,

621
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:19.170
nothing thing.
It's so easy.
Why didn't you do that?
I blame you.

622
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:20.670
You don't kind of thing.
It's not easy.
Probably.

623
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.230
There's so many different dynamics to every kid's experience.
So you know how,

624
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:28.050
and this is how the conversation kind of,
if I remember correctly,

625
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:31.170
kind of started when you were like,
Hey,
I have,
you know,
four kids or whatever,

626
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:36.450
and they're just different.
They are all,
and then I said,

627
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.630
and this was before I had kids by the way.
So you weren't really feeling what,
Oh,

628
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.560
the day you didn't,
you don't really care about that.
Well,

629
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.620
not to say you did anyway.
I said,
um,
I said,

630
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.510
okay.
Yeah,
it's kind of complicated.
So Oh,

631
00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.180
kids are different.
Yeah.
But they're not just different,
like that's not it.

632
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.490
That's not nature.
Annulation yes,
yes,
yes.
Fully.

633
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.210
So consider every kid starting point is different.

634
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.530
So you can't expect everyone,
every kids ending point to be the same.

635
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.610
Even though they go through the same experience.
Just being the second born,

636
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:19.650
you're starting out as a completely different human being.
Just being two years,

637
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:22.410
one year,
five years younger than your older brother is.

638
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.530
Minor variables end up creating some major differences.

639
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.630
Yes,
of course.
At,
at certain points in development,

640
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.500
they're going to have kind of the same needs but in a different environment.

641
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.210
So the way that you fulfilled

642
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.820
<v 0>those same needs with the first kid are going to look different as far as them</v>

643
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:44.010
being translated with the second kid and the third kid and the Fort,
you know,

644
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.243
however many kids you have,

645
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.360
that's going to be making slight adaptations to what you did to the second kid.

646
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:53.050
And the first,
and to keep a handle of all those dynamics is it's hard.

647
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:57.990
So that's why it's only that it's not an exact science.
Yeah.
And,

648
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.810
and the way kids react way people,
it's not just,

649
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.210
we're not just talking about kids here,
we're talking about people you know,

650
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:07.240
because you get different people that you hire at different times or different

651
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:09.880
people that join tunes at different times and they have a different attitude.

652
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:12.730
So yeah,
you got to adjust.
But the,
the bottom line is,

653
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.540
the thing that remains constant through all this is that if you're trying to

654
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:19.870
impart knowledge on people,
you need to take responsibility,

655
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.790
not just for showing them the knowledge,

656
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.740
but to making sure that they absorb the knowledge.

657
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.580
And the primary methodology of doing that is by explaining to people why they're

658
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:32.581
doing what they're doing and why you're telling them this and why this occurs.

659
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.230
So if,
like you said,

660
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:39.820
you tell your kid don't have a temper tantrum and then you never explained to

661
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:41.560
them,
here's why you don't want to have a temper tantrum.

662
00:39:41.561 --> 00:39:44.440
But when you're doing this,
you could hurt yourself.
You could hurt other people.

663
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:46.130
You're going to do things that regret.
You can invite,

664
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.750
break something in the house.
I can't control you.
I can't bring you anywhere.

665
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:51.970
If you're going to act like this,
that means we can't go out and have fun.

666
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.730
So you've got to explain why.
And once you explain why,

667
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:58.000
then people have a better chance of absorbing the information.
But yes,

668
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:00.190
you as a trainer,
parent leader,

669
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.210
teacher has a responsibility not just to impart knowledge,

670
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:08.800
but to ensure that the knowledge is absorbed.
Yeah.
Rant,
complete.

671
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.400
And of course,
like I said,
it's for parenting.

672
00:40:15.401 --> 00:40:17.510
It's not just that easy.
You know,

673
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.610
parenting is very difficult leadership situations.

674
00:40:20.611 --> 00:40:24.970
So it's really a lot like Plinko considered,
you know what I mean?

675
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:29.350
He started at a different point and he's very well,
but yeah,
there you go.

676
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.860
So next question
Jocko.
Yes.

677
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:40.060
In the seal teams you lead all male teams.

678
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.280
Any leadership difference?
In business?

679
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:46.000
We're in the business world with mixed agenda or female teams.

680
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.790
So first of all,
in the military I did work with women.
There's,

681
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.710
there's no women in the seal teams,
but there's women that are an intel.

682
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:56.170
There's women that are in logistics,
there's women in the,
in the,

683
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.090
some of the logistics support units that go out in the field sometimes.

684
00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:06.091
So definitely worked with women in the military and in the civilian sector.

685
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.430
With the,
with echelon front,
I've worked with all kinds of women,

686
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.560
all kinds of women in every level,

687
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:15.430
from CEO's on down to frontline troopers.

688
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.570
And here's the deal.
For me,
it's no factor,
no factor to me.

689
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.280
What's a factor to me is can they do their job?

690
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:27.820
Do they have an open mind?
Are they humble?
Do they treat people with respect?

691
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:31.750
Those are the kinds of things that I'm judging.

692
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.600
It's like what we talked about earlier.
I'm judging,

693
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:39.020
but I'm not judging based on what they are.

694
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:43.430
I'm judging on who they are and who they are as a person.
So that's,

695
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.150
I see no real difference.
The leadership,

696
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.190
the way that you lead doesn't change in my opinion from the,

697
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.060
from the women I've seen in leadership positions to the men I've seen in

698
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:57.490
leadership positions.
The,
the,

699
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.040
the way they lead is successful because the way they lead,

700
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:04.220
not because they're male or female.
And you know,

701
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:07.340
some of the stereotypes that that you might see out there.

702
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.150
Um,
like he,
like,
like for instance,
men are tougher than women or,

703
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.120
or men or women are more emotional than men.

704
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.600
That's just garbage.
Jane,
if you see,
I've seen,

705
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.720
at least when you get to a leadership position,

706
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.590
I've definitely seen women that were way tougher than than guys were in terms
of,

707
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:29.990
hey,
we've got to make this move for the company.
Here's what I'm going to do.

708
00:42:29.991 --> 00:42:31.130
Boom.
They execute it.

709
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.050
And I've seen men that were way too emotional attached to this scenario and

710
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:40.700
ruined it because they're just way more emotional than the stereotypical woman

711
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:43.640
might be.
So that's why I don't think you can trust them.
I look at a person,

712
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:44.540
not whether they're a man or a woman,

713
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:48.170
I'm looking at there the content of their character for the second time.

714
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:51.030
I'll say that today.
Mlk.
Um,

715
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.750
and now when we start talking about combat,
um,

716
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.470
there's some physical differences that make,
that make a definite impact.

717
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:01.730
And I talked about on the Tim Kennedy,

718
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:05.900
if you want to hear ever hear me talk about that because yeah,

719
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.500
when you get into some physical things,
men are stronger than women.

720
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.320
And so there's a,
there's some physical limitations there.

721
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.970
But in terms of leadership capabilities in the,
in the civilian sector,

722
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.940
there's,
yeah,
I'm not,
I'm not,

723
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.950
I'm not worried about men and women do.
Yeah.
Okay.
Are there some nuances there?

724
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.450
There are.
There are new apps for instance,
who were like,
one you'll hear is,
um,

725
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.550
I'll get asked,
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a female and I'm in charge of these guys.
Uh,

726
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.330
you know,
how should I act or what should I do?
Cause they,

727
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.700
they might not like working for a,
for a,
for a girl.
Right.

728
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.670
And I say they fired that guy.

729
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:46.730
Probably wouldn't like working for a guy either or a free younger guy or for a

730
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:50.510
guy that got moved from another department.
There's,
it's the same thing.

731
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.480
It's the same thing.
So what are you going to do?
It's the same thing.

732
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:56.390
I always say,
be humble.
Listen to what they have to say.
Keep an open mind.

733
00:43:56.391 --> 00:44:00.770
That's what you're gonna do regardless.
Male,
female,
whatever.
It just older,

734
00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:03.130
younger,
doesn't matter.
You want it.
The being a good leader,

735
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:07.220
the principles don't change.
That's all there is to it.

736
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:13.110
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause as an insecure guy giving,</v>

737
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.120
getting led or,
or,
or,
or,
uh,

738
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.330
a girl calling shots or whatever will affect them.

739
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.060
[inaudible] but like how you said,
if they,

740
00:44:22.061 --> 00:44:25.360
if their leadership principles are sound,
yeah.
It doesn't matter.

741
00:44:25.361 --> 00:44:28.660
They're making the right call.
It's going to be obvious that,

742
00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:33.310
that like that guy's messing up or you know,
like he's,
he's,
um,

743
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:37.170
um,
acting out of insecurity or not acting out of insecurity.

744
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:40.350
It's gonna be obvious the leadership part.
As long as that sound,

745
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.660
you're going to have success.

746
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.270
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

747
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.770
<v 0>So,
yeah,
that's no factor to me.
Yeah.</v>

748
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.493
<v 2>Next question.</v>

749
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:59.220
<v 0>Maybe I should bring some of the female leaders that I've worked with on the</v>

750
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:01.350
podcast.
You know,
the thing,

751
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:04.980
the problem with that is there are no different than the male leaders I've

752
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:07.260
worked with.
So I'm sure that there's some,
some women would have listened this,

753
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:07.981
Nicole.
Oh,

754
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:12.510
you don't know how hard it is when acts or you don't know.

755
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:13.861
But that's what I'm saying.

756
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:17.520
Like they'll good female leaders I've worked with have been like,
oh yeah,

757
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:19.170
that can be sometimes a problem because I'm a woman in,

758
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:21.960
here's what I do to negate it,
right?
Because I guess what?

759
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.360
The next day I'll be working with a different client and the,

760
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.860
it's a man and he goes,
well,
you know,

761
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:29.060
I have to do with x and this is how I mitigate it,
so everyone's dealing with x,

762
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.490
right?

763
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.000
Everyone's got some factor that they're trying to overcome and it's just a good

764
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:37.620
leader will find a way around that factor or find a way to mitigate that factor

765
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:42.120
and a bad leader won't and we'll then use that factor as an excuse,
right.

766
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.480
Rather than just as an advantage.
You know,

767
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:49.080
there's a huge difference between taking ownership of these problems and saying,

768
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:51.000
oh,
you don't want to,
here's the issue.
Okay,
I'm going to own that.

769
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:53.550
I'm going to take care of it,
and we can find a way around it.
Instead of saying,

770
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.750
Oh,
I'm younger,
I'm older,
I'm a woman,

771
00:45:57.751 --> 00:46:00.780
I'm a man trying to lead these words.
It's just like,
no,

772
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.460
you're a human leading another human being.
And so step up and lead,

773
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:07.200
figure out what the issues are and overcome them.

774
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.413
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.093
Jocko,

776
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.530
<v 1>I've taken a lot of inspiration from your philosophy of good,</v>

777
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.890
how do you apply this without succumbing to Pollyanna Chism did I say that
right?

778
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:28.063
So

779
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.810
<v 0>pollyannish is a,
is a,
is a term and it actually comes from a,</v>

780
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:39.770
from a novel from the early 19 hundreds,

781
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:41.340
but it,
uh,

782
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.120
the name of the novels Pollyanna in anyways Pollyanna and the book has this

783
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:50.121
really super positive attitude and it's almost so positive that it overwhelms

784
00:46:51.701 --> 00:46:53.700
and it kinda changes people's attitudes in the town.

785
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.850
But there's a pejorative meaning of this word,

786
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.810
which is what this guy's asking about.
And it is,
that is when,

787
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:03.810
when someone is so positive that they,

788
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:09.300
that they forget about reality of a situation,
you know?

789
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.800
And so that's,
that's,
that can be absolutely problematic.

790
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.520
And that is not what I'm telling anybody to do.

791
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.420
In fact,
the,
the,
let's,

792
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.550
let's not mistake the,

793
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:28.610
the good philosophy as one that negates reality,

794
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:32.230
that totally off.
That's not what I'm telling you wanted to do.
In fact,

795
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.980
the very first thing you have to do is accept reality.

796
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:38.560
That's the first thing you gotta do.
You gotta look at what's happening.

797
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.980
You've got to assess it,
assess the reality of it,
and then you say,
okay,

798
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:45.880
good.

799
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.780
Now instead of dwelling on the negatives and what's going to go bad and what's

800
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:52.750
wrong,
you deal with them,
but then you look at,
okay,

801
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:54.460
now what are we going to do positive out of this?

802
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:58.510
What good's going to come out of this?
And that's,
that's all it is.

803
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.310
It's definitely not denying or being delusional about the situation by any

804
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:06.160
stretch,
but it is also not being,

805
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:10.330
woe is me and all of this happened and now,
oh my gosh,

806
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:12.830
everything's going horrible.
I'm doomed.
No,
that's,

807
00:48:12.831 --> 00:48:14.170
that's not what I'm talking about.

808
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.530
Obviously I'm not talking about that and it's also not like it's okay,

809
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.360
everything's wonderful.
No,
that's why the term is good and not wonderful,

810
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.870
right?
I'm not saying everything's wonderful,
but good.
Okay,

811
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:27.690
now what are we going to find out of this?
What are we going to figure it out?

812
00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:30.790
But this is what are we going to make happen now because I'm going to deal with

813
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:35.410
reality.
I'm going to accept reality,
I'm going to accept reality.
Yeah.

814
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.000
Then there's some people that you know,
like the,

815
00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:41.680
the self help gurus that are like,
no,
I'm just not going to accept that.

816
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.290
It's not going to happen.
I need to grow in reality.

817
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.950
I'm going to be so positive that I'm going to get that million dollars tomorrow.

818
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.680
No,
no,
actually you're not going to get that million dollars tomorrow.

819
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.270
You're going to have to work.
You're gonna have to work for a long time.

820
00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:54.010
You're going to have to work hard.

821
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.390
You're gonna have to stay focused on your goals,

822
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.700
and then you get your million dollars.
Good seal strong.
Urf.

823
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.310
Yes.
So that's it.

824
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.400
Deal with reality except reality than find the good in it and move forward.

825
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.540
That's a cool video by the way,
that you,
that you mean

826
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:21.220
you liked that video?
I do.
I think is that you fishing for a compliment?

827
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.300
That video is a,
I think you,
I spend a lot of people watch that video.
Yeah.

828
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:32.280
It's interesting too because you made that video and you made another video.
Uh,

829
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.160
where does discipline come from?
And I actually personally,
I like to,

830
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:41.140
where does this passion come from?
Video better.
But the good video,

831
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.320
it just strikes a chord with people.
The APP.
Cause I think,

832
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:49.180
I think because it applies so universally to negativity in the world,

833
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:51.790
like okay,
the up,
these bad things are happening right now.
In fact,

834
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:56.780
I get so much feedback of people that literally say,
you know,

835
00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:00.490
thank you for introducing me to that idea,

836
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:04.540
that philosophy because it's changed my attitude and now when things go wrong I

837
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:06.700
say good,
now what am I going to do about it?
Right.

838
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.900
So I think that's why that video is,
is,
is quite popular.

839
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.710
That and the unbelievable editing that was done when it was put together.

840
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:19.030
Yeah.
And it,
it does seem like a real,
um,

841
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.790
like personal,
like deeply personal thing.
Like,

842
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.790
cause it's like,
it's more,
um,
it's not sensationalization

843
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.570
<v 1>of it.
It's just,
it's real kind of kind of dark,
whatever.
And like how you said,</v>

844
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:33.770
like the negative part of it,

845
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:38.240
it's like I said this last time or it's a painkiller.
So then a Multivitamin,

846
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.910
you know,
what do you mean by that?
Meaning of heard you say that before.

847
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:45.280
Meaning like if you have a problem,
you just in nature,
when you,

848
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:50.270
when you're going along,
what are your brain is,
is evolved to recognize problems.

849
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:54.230
And if something isn't a problem,
it'll start to filter that out.

850
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.760
That's just how you bring it.
Okay.
So in life,
when you have problems,

851
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.230
that's what's always on the radar.

852
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.430
Now you have this little personal like tool that's talking to you of how to deal

853
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:08.180
with those problems.
Nice.
You know what I mean?
So,
um,
so it's,

854
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.910
it's kind of that like the discipline,
where does discipline come from?

855
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:14.270
It's Kinda,
that's more starts to go into the multivitamin thing where it's like,

856
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.930
this is not a big problem.
I'm going to try to recognize it as a problem.

857
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:22.040
I need more discipline,
you know?
But it's not really this huge problem,

858
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:25.940
but it does help,
you know,
kind of thing.
So it's like a multivitamin.
Interesting.

859
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.600
Um,
but I like the discipline one as well.

860
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.980
Okay,
next question,
coach Jocko,
what are your thoughts?

861
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:41.690
I wonder who does that mean?
Did you,
did you guy wrote that?
Uh,
pink.
So must be,

862
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:44.480
it must,
must be,
but is it someone from like the Jimmy Think,

863
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.600
I dunno to address me as coach and first of all,
if you come to my gym,

864
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:51.710
you don't have to call me coach.
Maybe that's why he's doing,

865
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:54.270
maybe he just knows him a black belt and thinks I should be called coachable.

866
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.320
Yeah.
Or it could be like,
when I'm like chief,
you know,
hey,
what's up chief?

867
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:01.520
What's up coach?
I've heard coach.
In fact,
I don't mind coach in that regard,

868
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:06.690
but only a brown belt.
How can you like coach?
Nah,
but in life,
you know what?

869
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.590
I remember when I said long time ago where I was like,
no,
I don't like,
no,

870
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:14.060
I don't mind.
Oh,
you don't like boss?
Yes.
Or Dude,
when a girl says,
dude,

871
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.540
but I actually,
I used to joke and I'd say,
look guys,

872
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.840
if you don't feel comfortable calling me Sensei or instructor or coach,

873
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.760
you can just call me master either one.

874
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:32.270
But the reality is just call me Jocko.
Yeah,
I heard someone call you coach,
um,

875
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.100
is,
you know,
I'll certain guys they liked that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Correct.

876
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:40.400
People I don't say,
don't call me coach,
you know,
I just,
I'm okay.

877
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:44.390
I don't care what people call me to be honest with,
with you.
Well,
oh,

878
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.060
but yeah.
Yeah.
The guy called,
he was weird.
Was like he kept calling.
No,
there's,

879
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.210
there's a,
there's definitely a handful of people that call me coach.
Yeah.

880
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.210
Maybe they don't know what my name is.
All right.

881
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.360
So go back to the question.
Click coach,
uh,

882
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.320
coach Jocko.

883
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.290
What are your thoughts on dealing with old age when getting physically stronger

884
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:10.700
and faster ain't going to happen?
Well,
I don't know.

885
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.380
I don't know the answer to that question

886
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.650
about age because it's not happening to me.
I'm not getting any older.
I mean,

887
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.380
when is it that it that it ain't going to happen anymore?

888
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:26.040
I don't know because I'm continuing to train on

889
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.060
<v 0>continuing to do what I do.</v>

890
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.160
I've had people tell me that wall when you hit 30 and then I had to,

891
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.430
when you hit 35 and then you get 40 now it's when you hit 45 now I'm here and

892
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.070
when it's 50 so,
um,
yeah,
I don't know.

893
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.460
I just know that I'm just going to keep getting after it.

894
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:42.480
I'm going to keep getting stronger.

895
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:44.130
I'm gonna keep getting faster and we keep getting better.

896
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:49.110
And if I can't beat my record,
well then how close can I get?

897
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:53.520
How close can I get to the record?
And I think I've talked about this before,

898
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.640
is like I always think about decay and how if you don't fight the K it starts to

899
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:05.340
just,
you won't notice it.
It's slow and it's,
it's,

900
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.640
it's like moving like the hour hand.
Like you don't see it happening.

901
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:12.030
And I think that's why I think this is why a lot of aging happens because people

902
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:14.700
don't notice that it's happening.
So don't pay attention to it.

903
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:18.150
So what happens is they don't hold the line,

904
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:23.070
hold the line.
And like I track my workouts,
I'm not OCD about it.

905
00:54:23.071 --> 00:54:25.740
I'm not like a psycho.
Like,
you know,
hey,

906
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:29.970
I did it in 14 minutes and 32 seconds and then,
and then I refer back to it.
No,

907
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:34.440
but I know the general trends and I know where the numbers are and I know where

908
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:39.441
they should be and I know that I need to always keep those in mind.

909
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:45.000
You know,
how many pull ups can I do?
How much can I squat,
how much,
you know,

910
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:47.580
just those,
just those numbers.
So you keep them in line.

911
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:48.790
And I think what that does the,

912
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.710
I do that so I can't hold the line because like I said,
I think age sneaks,

913
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:54.090
I don't think age just salts.
You,

914
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:59.840
I think it sneaks up on you and the way it sneaks up on you is a missed rep

915
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:04.160
there and uh,

916
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.260
and a slower lap over here and a missed workout over there and you just boom.

917
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.190
There's just that little age is chipping away at you.
It's just chipping away.

918
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:17.520
It doesn't,
it actually doesn't want you to notice.
He doesn't want,

919
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.110
that's why it doesn't hit you all at once.

920
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:22.620
It doesn't just wants to chip away and then you fast forward 15 years and you're

921
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:27.300
not the same guy you were because those chips I've taken taken all your

922
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.940
strength,
the way they've taken your flexibility way.
They've,
they've,

923
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.990
they've done a done work on you.
So that's why I,
like I said,

924
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:39.020
I don't know what am I going to be able to hold the same records when I'm 59 and

925
00:55:40.741 --> 00:55:45.741
when we got some older guys like you know Gordon Gordon's 54 and I trained with

926
00:55:47.641 --> 00:55:51.690
Gordon.
Yeah.
I tried with Gordon,
I mean Gordon's legit blackbelt and,

927
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.120
and he's not just a legit back but with knowledge like you can train with him

928
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:54.954
and he trains hard.

929
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:59.490
So I'm just very,

930
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.360
I try and stay self aware and I think I try and prevent the cutting of corners

931
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.720
and I try and maintain the daily discipline in all things.

932
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:13.860
That's what I try and do because when you start cutting those corners is when I

933
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:17.190
think it adds up over 15 years and you wake up and you're not the person that

934
00:56:17.191 --> 00:56:20.670
you remembered that you were and you're not the person you want to be.

935
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.450
So you to maintain and hold that line as long as you can.

936
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:27.850
And I'm always actually trying to do new things too,

937
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.790
like trying to figure out something else that's new.

938
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.940
Some other technique I've never done before.
Some exercise,

939
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:37.510
I haven't got to buy some weird piece of exercise gear because I'll see

940
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:40.780
something cool on the interwebs and I'll go,
Dang,
I can't do that.

941
00:56:40.781 --> 00:56:43.330
How's that 14 year old girl doing that?
I can't do that.

942
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:47.830
I want to learn how to do that.
And so that's,
that's,

943
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.230
I think you've got to fight it.

944
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.360
<v 1>Yeah.
And that,
that,
that's a good analogy.
The hour hand,
where are you can't,</v>

945
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.810
you can't see it when you watch it all day.
You can't see a nope,

946
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.170
but look away for one second.
Not One second,
but you know,

947
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.320
look away for a little while.

948
00:57:03.321 --> 00:57:06.860
You look back and boom that things snuck right up on you and,
and that's,

949
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.530
I mean that's how you really slick.

950
00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:13.850
That's how little assault you as far as age and decay goes where if you,

951
00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.610
if you stop for awhile and you try to come back,

952
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.730
if you stop for 10 years and you try to come back,

953
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:23.750
that hour hand moved a lot and moved a lot.
The MN.
So if you weren't fighting it,

954
00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.560
yeah cause you can hold that our line,
I mean you can hold it up.

955
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.210
Maybe you can't stop.
It could slow that song.

956
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.660
Just got to keep your eye right on the back.
It's not moving it off.
And sure.

957
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:36.523
You know,
like I said,

958
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:41.270
when you're 90 and you've been looking at that hour hand since you were 25 then

959
00:57:41.271 --> 00:57:41.991
yeah,
you're going to be like,

960
00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:45.050
oh I remember back when I was 25 is way over here and I'm way over here fitness

961
00:57:45.051 --> 00:57:49.610
wise or whatever.
Or I can squat less or whatever.
Of course,
you know that's the

962
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.930
inevitability.
But just like how you said,
yeah,
if you,
you just stay on that,

963
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.140
that discipline in all things and you're going to hold that,

964
00:58:00.141 --> 00:58:04.670
you're going to hold it good.
Do not go gentle into that good light.
Yeah.

965
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.890
Rage,
rage against the dying of the light.
And with that,
the,

966
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.800
you know,
this kind of balance to all things don't get crazy.

967
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.910
You know how guys will just be red lining their workout cause they're trying to

968
00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:21.060
maintain that match.
You can't,
you gotta be careful about that.
Yeah man.

969
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:24.410
Cause it's just like a race car.
You can't keep the race car in the red.

970
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.650
You got to,
you got to bring it back to the shop.
Sometimes I get a little tuneup.

971
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.810
Yup.
They've got to be part of the routine.
Yeah.

972
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.580
<v 0>And I can only,
I'm,
you know,
I'm pretty good.</v>

973
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:36.160
That's another thing is the more you work out,
the more you train,
the more the,

974
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:39.600
the,
the better.
You know,
your own body.
Yeah.
And you know,

975
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.680
you walk up to the gym sometimes.
Like what was it yesterday?

976
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.090
Yeah.
Yesterday,
man,
I felt like Superman.

977
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.330
Like I was just super strong.
I was doing one of my work,
I was strong,

978
00:58:51.331 --> 00:58:54.450
I was just technical.
I just felt great,
you know?

979
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.430
And I would say there's some days that I go in the gym and I'm like,
what?

980
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:03.230
You know,
I got to stretch.
I got to like take an easy day.
And,

981
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.570
and then there's some days where I say I gotta take an easy day,
but anyways,

982
00:59:06.571 --> 00:59:09.490
I'm just going to get crushed and I'm just going to crush this thing.
But,

983
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:11.010
and part of that,
again,

984
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:15.240
because I see that you got to make sure that you're not cutting corners.

985
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.720
Got To make sure that you're not taking your eye off the hour and sometimes you

986
00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.440
don't let nothing get up,
get one up on you cause you're lazy.
Right.

987
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:26.740
So that's why going,
this is sometimes a lot of workouts I have,
you know,

988
00:59:26.741 --> 00:59:28.470
I have some days,
some days where I feel like Superman,

989
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.570
I have some days where I feel like,
uh,
like horrible.

990
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:34.350
And I have a lot of more like Lois Lois Lois Lane or something.
Yeah.

991
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.530
Some days where I feel like I'm just going through the motions,

992
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.940
but going through the motions is okay.
Yeah.

993
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.000
It's okay to go in there and go through the motions.

994
00:59:42.001 --> 00:59:45.240
It's okay to go in there and not break any records going in there and going

995
00:59:45.241 --> 00:59:49.860
through the motions is generally a thousand times better than not doing
anything.

996
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:54.810
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And that,
that's actually,
I mean,
red lining it all the time is,

997
00:59:54.811 --> 00:59:57.930
uh,
is the easy way to get knocked right out of the game.
Yeah.

998
00:59:57.931 --> 01:00:00.300
Well you'll get injured after awhile.
Yeah.
That's what I mean,

999
01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:01.740
especially when you start getting older.
You know,

1000
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.690
<v 2>maybe
I need to say that.</v>

1001
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:15.820
All right,
next question.
What do you got?

1002
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.720
<v 0>What are your favorite podcasts in a y Hashtag name dropping is.</v>

1003
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:27.420
Okay.
Um,

1004
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.290
so anybody that listens to me,

1005
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:34.420
there's,

1006
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.730
there's a couple of podcasts that I listen to and they're really obvious and

1007
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:42.260
they're like the big,
the big podcasts
you got.

1008
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.670
Well,
Tim Ferris,
boom,
right?
You got Joe Rogan,
boom.

1009
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.190
You've got Sam Harris,
boom.
Um,

1010
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.380
and you've got hardcore history with Dan Carlin and he's got another one that's

1011
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:59.000
called the common sense.
And I,
the those,
those all those,

1012
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.230
uh,
are really,
really good podcasts.

1013
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.120
And,
um,
I'm,

1014
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:12.480
I've been listening to a podcast for many,
many years now,
uh,

1015
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.710
before listening to podcasts.
It was cool.
I was listening to a podcast.

1016
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.620
I actually grew up listening to radio shows.
I've talked about that before,
but I,

1017
01:01:19.621 --> 01:01:23.810
I have and I forget,
I actually,
I cannot remember how I got into podcasts.

1018
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:26.960
I do not remember how I got into podcasts.
Um,

1019
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.190
but anyways,
whenever I got into podcasts,

1020
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.040
those are the kind of the ones that I listened to you.
And I've,

1021
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.090
I sample a lot of other podcasts and sometimes I'll search for certain topics

1022
01:01:38.091 --> 01:01:42.710
and I'll just listen to a random podcast.
Um,
one of the,

1023
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:43.820
but there's one more.

1024
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:48.410
The only one that I have that's like not on the main,
uh,

1025
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.630
sites,
hey look,

1026
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:54.790
in people's view is a podcast called martyrmade and it's by a guy named Daryl

1027
01:01:55.850 --> 01:02:00.530
Cooper.
And I can't recommend that,
that podcast strongly enough.

1028
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.220
It's outstanding.
It is an outstanding podcast.

1029
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:09.040
And Daryl Cooper,
I don't even know,
like ease,

1030
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:13.190
just this underground guy.
I think he's a,
I think he was in the navy,

1031
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:18.230
but he does not.
He's not anymore.
He's,
he doesn't do it.

1032
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:22.620
It's not like a profession for him,
but he should be.
He should be.

1033
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:26.550
It's a great podcast.
So check out Marger made.
It's also a,

1034
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.270
he's on Twitter under martyrmade,
his,
his,
his,
his call sign,

1035
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:35.550
but he's got like 142 followers,
like no one knows about it.

1036
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.160
No one knows about them.
And actually,
you know what,

1037
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.120
it was somebody on Twitter and I don't forget who it was.

1038
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.710
It was somebody on Twitter that told me about Margaret made and just said,

1039
01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:49.140
check it out.
And when people tell me to check them out,
man,
I check it out.

1040
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.800
And it's,
as soon as you opened it,
you know,
you're gonna,
you're gonna,

1041
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.800
you're gonna realize why it's so good.
Um,
really detailed,

1042
01:02:55.801 --> 01:03:00.270
really very good historical research and it's a great podcast.

1043
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.020
And those are the,
and,
and you know what?

1044
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.320
I'm a really picky podcast guy too.
Like,
I'm really,

1045
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.690
I need somebody to get,
I need,

1046
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:14.460
somebody needs to bring it on their podcast for me to like it.
I try all,

1047
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:19.461
I try new podcasts all the time and I don't get a lot of repeat customers

1048
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:24.060
myself.
Like I don't repeat a lot.
Um,
because

1049
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:30.270
I just,
I just,
yeah,
it needs to be really,
really solid.

1050
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.680
That's for me to list for me,

1051
01:03:31.681 --> 01:03:36.330
do for me to invest hours worth of my time.
That's,

1052
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:39.990
that's gotta be a heavy investment and it's gotta be something that's worth my

1053
01:03:39.991 --> 01:03:42.510
while.
And that's why those that I mentioned,
let me grab,

1054
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.720
I'm just seeing if on my phone,
if there's any others that I might've missed,

1055
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.880
but I don't think as far as like massively good ones that I can recommend across

1056
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:58.200
the board.
Um,
those are them.
And you know,

1057
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.340
there's other ones that I'll occasionally listen to,
but,
um,

1058
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:07.230
and those are all kind of like the Po,
the popular ones that come out.

1059
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.160
Danko Jones has got a good podcast and he interviews talks about rock and roll.

1060
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:15.900
I dig that one only because I really dig Danko Jones.
Uh,
the band as well.

1061
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:20.890
The martyr made one.
Yes.
What's kind of the format with felony?

1062
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.380
It's sip.
No,
it's similar to a hardcore history.
It's a him,

1063
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.700
it's Daryl Cooper just talking about,
and that one,
I think it's going to be his,

1064
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.890
it's about the Israeli Palestinian conflict that goes all the way back to the

1065
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:38.310
beginning and talks to you about what it is and what it's about.
And it's,

1066
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.320
it's really good.
So those are the main podcast that I listened to.

1067
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.050
Um,
again,
you've got to,

1068
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.260
and it's just a big investment of time.

1069
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.910
And especially cause I don't have a commute so I don't drive anywhere.
So,

1070
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:56.400
and I'm in,
in,
I can't,

1071
01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:02.210
I can't do anything mentally and do a podcast at the same at the time and

1072
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:06.390
listened to a podcast so I can't read and listened to a podcast doesn't work.

1073
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.180
The only thing I can do is drive and do yard work.

1074
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.710
Like anything that's like actually when I have a big project to do at the house,

1075
01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:17.830
I love it cause I can get it all caught up on podcasts and whatever.
So,
but yeah,

1076
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.040
you know

1077
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.630
<v 1>what that is,
you know girls can do that.
You know that I was not aware of that.</v>

1078
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.250
Yeah.
So this is all it is.
That's how it works.
Girls can they sit?
They,

1079
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.800
I don't want to be dismissive and call it multitasking because it's,
it goes,

1080
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.060
it's more deep than multitask.

1081
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.490
Girls can do things that require re like attention.
They can do more than one.

1082
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:42.760
Um,
and then you guys can't,

1083
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:47.650
I would be impressed by a girl that could listen to a legit podcast and read a

1084
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:50.650
book and get like the full value out of both of them.

1085
01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.560
So how girl's brains are wired?

1086
01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.610
They can do that a lot better than guys and guys.
But how's this though?

1087
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.820
This is kind of interesting and I used to do this all the time to mess with

1088
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:05.210
girls.
Guys have a different spacial awareness and girls do.

1089
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.580
So one of the tests that was done,
it was like,
ah,
I want to say 16,

1090
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.910
I don't know the numbers,
but it was a classroom just full of guys,

1091
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.760
classroom full of girls.
Then they'd run all these tests,
different tests.

1092
01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:19.450
But one of them was you have to draw a bicycle.
That's it.

1093
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.300
So a bicycle is this kind of in a way,

1094
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:23.980
kind of in this unique thing when you draw it,

1095
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.150
because you have to know where this goes because that affects,
you know,

1096
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.160
the pedals got to affect the chain that affects it's s it proved a or indicated

1097
01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:36.430
spacial awareness,
right?
So of the experiment,
all the guys could do it.

1098
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:38.650
You don't have to be an artist.
Some bikes didn't look amazing,

1099
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:41.170
but they were working.
You don't have to be an artist.

1100
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.720
And it doesn't matter if you're a bike rider too.

1101
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:49.240
So all the guys could do it.
You know how many of the girls could do it?
No.
None.

1102
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.280
Really none.
Yes.
So,

1103
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.810
and I've done this experiment and if you're going to do this experiment,

1104
01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:59.560
do it correctly.
Don't be like,
Hey,
here's a bike.
Copy this,
but don't,

1105
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:03.100
don't cheat on it.
Really.
If you really want to get to the bottom,
tell ASCA girl,

1106
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:08.050
any girl,
woman,
no matter what age,
draw a working bicycle,

1107
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.360
they can't do it.

1108
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.360
I have yet to come across the girl that can do it tonight as a and as a guy,

1109
01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:19.000
it's pretty,
most guys will do it.
Hmm.
Yeah.
It's weird.

1110
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:23.050
But anyway,
it's just,
just how the brains are different.

1111
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:25.000
Cause other fun stuff too.

1112
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.900
For me it is very difficult to actually engage in a book and reading,

1113
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:33.430
um,
or writing while I'm listening to someone else talk about something

1114
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:37.230
intellectual.
It's very challenging for me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fully.
That's it.

1115
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.440
To get the full value.

1116
01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:42.490
I mean I can do it but at the both efforts are half ass and I don't get anything

1117
01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:46.840
out of him.
Well yeah.
Did you,
is there any podcasts you listen to?

1118
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:50.360
God I mentioned strangely it's the same thing except for the martyr made one.
Um,

1119
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.700
are you,
how could you not ask?

1120
01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.530
So martyrmade I've told you about that a bunch of times.

1121
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:57.730
Like he's his scarcity of resources,
man,
that resource being time.

1122
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.240
But nonetheless,
actually,
even though the ones I do listen to,

1123
01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:05.110
I don't listen to it as much cause I don't drive this much and um,

1124
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.810
I don't do as much yard work anymore

1125
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.440
except for that London real one.

1126
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:14.950
The one that you were under the guy I've actually looked like he's on my,

1127
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.970
he's not a podcast though.
It is really?
Yeah,
I'm subscribed to it.
Yeah.

1128
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.340
I didn't know it was an actual podcast.
I thought it was only youtube.

1129
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.800
I think it's like he takes the audio and put some good.
Yeah,
he's good.

1130
01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:30.210
He does it.
And that's the thing.
Like a lot of times people will like this.

1131
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:34.070
Brian Rose London real.
Yeah,
that's a good suggestion.

1132
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:37.520
He gets some cool people on this on a show and really,
really,

1133
01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:39.350
I mean put real simply.
It's an interview.

1134
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.950
Even Tim Ferriss is mostly like just interview,

1135
01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:46.790
you know Tim Ferriss is actually absolutely an interview and then you have Joe

1136
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.800
Rogan who's kind of like kind of an interview,

1137
01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:51.100
but it's more of like they're just talking about at the conferences.

1138
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.540
So there's like all these little different subtleties that are,

1139
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:55.130
that makes them different,
but

1140
01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:01.470
it takes a lot of skill to interview people.
Good.
Um,
and this,
uh,
the,

1141
01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:04.170
the London real guy goes,
yeah.
He's,
um,

1142
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.460
he's good down to like who he chooses.

1143
01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.860
They're like pretty much across the board.

1144
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:13.100
Everybody's interesting even if the subject isn't your thing.
Okay.

1145
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.660
But the guys he chooses for those subjects are,
are pretty solid.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1146
01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:18.494
That's a good one.

1147
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:20.840
<v 0>Oh yeah.
And I,
I really do.
I,</v>

1148
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:26.020
I really like podcasts a lot and you can get so much information out of them and

1149
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:31.300
I love the audio format.
Yeah.
You know,
I,

1150
01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:35.390
I just,
it's just great when you can,
when you can just sit down and listen.

1151
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.570
And that's always what I've said for,
for,
for this podcast.

1152
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:41.720
Like I want it to be something where people sit down and kind of put their

1153
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:43.800
headphones on and say,
okay,

1154
01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:49.160
I'm getting ready to plus PR press play three,
two,
one.

1155
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.330
Here it comes.
Yeah.

1156
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.090
And I mean like we're doing a Q and a and obviously Q and a doesn't have that

1157
01:09:56.091 --> 01:10:01.091
same level of impact as if I'm going to read something either that I wrote or

1158
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.960
something that somebody else wrote.

1159
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:07.190
That's a very important subject matter that we're going to break down.

1160
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.750
Then that's sort of,
that's,
that's what I like.

1161
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:13.830
<v 1>Yeah.
These,
these um,</v>

1162
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.550
these Q and a ones are cool because it is like,

1163
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:21.230
of course we're just having a conversation about this stuff,
but it's,

1164
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.720
there's a third person in the room as well for every question because it's their

1165
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:25.430
question.
Yeah,
yeah,

1166
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.990
<v 0>that's true.</v>

1167
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:28.190
And that's one thing that's interesting is like when you're listening to,

1168
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.820
when you're listening to any of these podcasts that I talked about,

1169
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.270
you're basically a third person in the room sitting there listening to the

1170
01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:37.730
conversation.
And actually when I was on Sam Harris,
you know,

1171
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.430
your brother drove up with me and he was in the room listening to the

1172
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:43.700
conversation.
You know,
it's kind of,
it's kind of interesting,
but you know,

1173
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:44.870
when you're listening to the Joe Rogan,

1174
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:49.020
and actually one thing that's pretty cool is I've,
you know,

1175
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.320
I've done an interview with Sam Harris,
had done an interview with Joe Rogan.

1176
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:54.170
I've done an interview with Tim Ferriss.
Um,

1177
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.950
I've had some good conversations with,
with um,

1178
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.690
with Dan Carlin and I might end up being uncommon sense at some point,

1179
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.010
but I would with the other three with Derek Cooper,
I don't know him,

1180
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:10.400
but I know those guys.
I know,
I know him.
And so when I'm,

1181
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.970
when I'm listening to a podcast,
I do feel like I'm kind of in the room with,

1182
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.700
and sometimes I want to like answer and say something and whatever.
So,

1183
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.450
uh,
yeah,
it's the,
and I think everybody,

1184
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:23.490
I think even people that never met Joe Rogan,

1185
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:26.230
but they listen to all of his podcasts,
they think they're in there with them.

1186
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.893
When I went,

1187
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.670
I did a thing with Joe Rogan played pool with him and I went up to that studio

1188
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:37.200
before.
Where'd you go up for?
With Haluk or something?
I went with,

1189
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:41.700
yeah.
For a Holly.
Okay.
With them.
Yes.
For some stuff.
Um,
yeah.

1190
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:43.350
So that time when it went up,
I asked him,
Hey,

1191
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:48.351
do you encounter people who basically feel like they know you,

1192
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.810
like personally?
And they'll just roll into a conversation if you like.

1193
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:56.520
You've known me every single time.
Even I'm experiencing that now.
When I,

1194
01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.760
when I meet someone that goes,
hey man,
I listened to the podcast.

1195
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:02.470
Hey and they're like talking to like,
well you,
y'all,

1196
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.860
what's going on with echo in blah blah blah.

1197
01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:07.750
And they were like talking about me like,
like we're Bros and it's,

1198
01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:11.550
it's pretty cool cause in a way you are talking to them for a long time.

1199
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.100
I know I was thinking about this.
Um,

1200
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.430
so like hardcore history,
the,

1201
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:21.270
the one podcast that is called blueprint for Armageddon,

1202
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.250
if you haven't listened to it,
just stop and go listen to it.
It's awesome.

1203
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:31.260
But that thing is,
it's five episodes,
about four hours each.

1204
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:33.650
So that's 20 hours.
And when you get done with it,
man,
you,

1205
01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.510
you feel like you're pretty tight with Dan Carlin.
I mean that's 20 hours.

1206
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:39.530
And then one day I was doing the math last week and we,

1207
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.390
cause we got to 30 podcasts in there,
basically two hours each.
And I'm like,

1208
01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.670
my God,
that's 60 hours,

1209
01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.940
60 hours worth of worth of conversation with you and me.

1210
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:54.830
And so absolutely people start feeling like,
you know,
hey,
oh yeah,
I know,

1211
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:58.460
I know what Jocko is going to think about this or say about this.
And,
and,

1212
01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:02.760
and they're basically in the room here talking to us and there's that added

1213
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:03.300
element there,

1214
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.650
which is going to make that even more so with us because these are there,

1215
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.160
these are your questions are questions and,

1216
01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:15.340
and I do converse with them,
you know,
on the interwebs too.
So,

1217
01:13:15.341 --> 01:13:16.680
so people are like,
oh,

1218
01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:19.860
and they'll hit me with a question and sometimes it's not enough to get on the

1219
01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:23.970
podcast,
but I'll just say,
yeah,
don't do that.
Right.
You know,
don't do that.

1220
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:26.880
That's not smart.
Or yeah,
no,
that sounds like a good plan.
Execute,
you know,

1221
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:30.720
stuff like that.
Yeah.
Just the nature of the,
but yeah,

1222
01:13:30.721 --> 01:13:35.610
get your podcast on and spread the word.
And,
and by the way,

1223
01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:39.130
thanks to thanks Tim and Joe,
uh,

1224
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.090
those guys brought me on before I had a podcast.

1225
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:44.550
Tim brought me on when the book wasn't out.

1226
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.770
I was d basically no human being knew who I was if you weren't like in the

1227
01:13:49.771 --> 01:13:53.910
direct,
like if you weren't in the seal teams with me.
And,

1228
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:59.040
and then Joe heard that podcast and then we connected on Twitter and he goes,

1229
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:03.030
come to be on my podcast.
And I was like,
awesome.
So,
and then Sam Harris.

1230
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.510
So anyways,
thanks to those guys for having me on and,

1231
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.690
and spreading the word a little bit.
Yeah,
I like Sam Harris is one as well.

1232
01:14:09.691 --> 01:14:11.980
That's actually one of the,
one of

1233
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.910
<v 1>the few that,</v>

1234
01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:17.890
that remember how we were talking before you did a podcast.
We're were like,
oh,

1235
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:19.420
it'd be weird you just talking,

1236
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.390
which actually thinking about it wouldn't be that weird.
Really.
I mean,

1237
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.380
<v 0>if you think about like even in the last podcast that we did where I just read</v>

1238
01:14:26.381 --> 01:14:30.370
the book,
uh,
uh,
four hours in my life.
Right.
You didn't say much.
Right.

1239
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:34.600
And you said enough to maybe get me through some,
some,

1240
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:38.890
some spots where you had a question or maybe I didn't make something clear,

1241
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.290
but,
um,
you know,
I think that's,
I think I could do it,
but,
you know,

1242
01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.560
yeah.
I don't,
I don't know why I would,

1243
01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:51.580
<v 1>yeah.
Overall,
yeah.
Overall,</v>

1244
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:53.860
especially with with the Q and a whip.

1245
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.360
And I think sometimes you'll go into things that doesn't apply to everyone's

1246
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:58.660
common knowledge.
You know,

1247
01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:02.980
maybe only military guys will know it or only execs my notes.
So I don't,

1248
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.960
you know,
there's less stuff.
I Dunno.
So I have the luxury of being here with me.

1249
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.990
What do you,
what does this mean?
What does ROTC mean?

1250
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:16.900
Just kidding.
I don't want ROTC me anyway.
But yeah,
Sam Harris is good though,

1251
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:21.670
where he just does it Solo.
I've actually followed Sam Harris from long time.

1252
01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.340
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah,
he did the one with Scott reads for the LAPD.
That's a good one.</v>

1253
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.740
Yeah.
And I like the Tim Ferriss one with Josh Waitzkin.

1254
01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:33.030
He's got a couple with him.
Josh Waitzkin really?
Uh,
his Jujitsu player.

1255
01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.720
He's a world champion chess guy.
And uh,

1256
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:41.580
just just cause an interesting attitude about stuff.
Yeah.
It makes me feel like,

1257
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.220
uh,
know there's a lot more to learn out there about things.

1258
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.880
He wrote a book called the art of learning.
Anyways,
that's a,

1259
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.760
that's a really good one.

1260
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:53.280
Joe wrote so much of what Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan,

1261
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:56.790
he's always worth less than two.
And it's weird.

1262
01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:58.410
Like I pretty much would Joe,

1263
01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.310
I listened to the people if I know the person that he's got on there and I don't

1264
01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:03.930
listen to a lot of comedians.
Right.

1265
01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:06.150
Cause I don't know why I like Comedians don't make me,
yeah,

1266
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.980
<v 1>that's the weird,
not weird.</v>

1267
01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:10.560
That's the good thing about your Oregon because he has so many different

1268
01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.630
elements of interest is the comedians that you did to guys.
And we make a,

1269
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.120
it's what

1270
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.900
<v 0>he does really well is he makes people talk in,
he,
you know,</v>

1271
01:16:18.901 --> 01:16:23.570
I've heard him get some criticism for,
you know,
let's say he's got like a,

1272
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:27.450
uh,
uh,
a religious guy on there and he doesn't believe in religion,

1273
01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:31.650
but he'll let that person talk about religion and won't like jump on them and

1274
01:16:31.651 --> 01:16:33.120
get in their face and say no.

1275
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:37.320
But that's part of what makes it cool is like he's just trying to learn,
man.

1276
01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:40.410
He's not trying to confront people,
you know,
he's just trying to learn.

1277
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.040
And I think that's,
I think all those people do that for the most part,

1278
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.580
they're people that are interested in learning and they're,

1279
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.250
they're trying to figure stuff out themselves.

1280
01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:54.630
And so I think it's cool that that Jill Rogan's not getting in somebody's face

1281
01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:55.770
about something they don't believe in.
I mean,

1282
01:16:55.771 --> 01:17:00.690
not that he doesn't disagree with people sometimes.
So that's,

1283
01:17:00.691 --> 01:17:03.900
that listened to some podcasts and,
and you know,

1284
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.360
the other thing about this is like,

1285
01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:12.260
we are putting out one podcast a week and that,

1286
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:17.600
I don't even know if that's sustainable.
Um,
only because of time.

1287
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.080
I mean the amount of time that it takes to prepare a podcast.

1288
01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:26.720
In the beginning it was pretty easy for me cause I was doing a bunch of books

1289
01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:29.450
that I already read.
I already read them all.
I just crack them open.

1290
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:31.010
And most of those books I read,
well read,

1291
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.300
I mean about face already had that thing outlined and highlighted.
Um,

1292
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.980
last hundred yards already ended.

1293
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.360
A bunch of those beginning books were already done and it wasn't until like

1294
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.200
until everyone on Twitter started telling me,
hey,
check out this book.

1295
01:17:45.201 --> 01:17:48.290
And now most of them are reading books I've never seen before and I've got to

1296
01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:51.950
read the book and what I do is I read it and I go through it and highlight it

1297
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:54.800
and somebody asked me this question you like,
how do you prep?
So I read the book,

1298
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.311
I go through,

1299
01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:57.920
I highlight the whole thing of what I think is impactful when I think is

1300
01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:02.420
important.
But then once you read it,
you can't just,
it does,
doesn't

1301
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.130
it?
You just don't pick it up and read the highlighted parts in order.

1302
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:09.650
Cause that doesn't always make sense.
And it also doesn't always have the,

1303
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.870
it doesn't make people think,

1304
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.120
it doesn't make me think about what I want to think about.

1305
01:18:14.121 --> 01:18:18.620
It doesn't have the impact that I want it to have.
So once I have it highlighted,

1306
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:21.260
then I have to go through and plus I'll highlight,
you know,

1307
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:23.390
let's say a highlight half the book.

1308
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.940
Well then you're not going to read half the book.

1309
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.690
So then I got to go in and figure out what really is important.

1310
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:33.560
And then from there I got to organize it in the way that the timeline that I'm

1311
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:38.561
actually gonna read it aloud and then make notes about whatever comments I have

1312
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:43.040
about it as I'm reading it.
Because that's sort of,

1313
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.600
that's sort of why I'm doing it.

1314
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:47.240
Because I want to comment about what I'm reading because otherwise people just

1315
01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:49.820
go by the book and read the book yourself.

1316
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:52.190
But I'm trying to give my perspective on some of it.

1317
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.220
And so that's challenging.
And,
um,
and then the other weird thing is,

1318
01:18:58.221 --> 01:19:01.280
like,
I,
I've met,
I meet people all the time because I travel all the time.

1319
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:04.040
I go to events and speak and companies that I'm working with.

1320
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:08.320
And a lot of times the people that are there that are totally into the podcast,

1321
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:11.070
if they're not even caught up there,
they're not caught up with podcast.

1322
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.190
They're like,
hey,
I'm almost caught up.
And I'm like,
what do you mean Nicole?

1323
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:16.510
I fell behind because I,
I,
I blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I,
um,

1324
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:18.560
I'm only on 26 right now.

1325
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.700
And so sometimes I think,
well,
maybe people are just,

1326
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:25.250
we're just turning out at such a high rate.

1327
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.020
But then there's some people that I've talked to as,
as I think about like,
well,

1328
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:31.940
maybe I need to slow down a little bit.
I've talked to some of the,

1329
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:35.180
some of the people that I work with and people that listen to podcasts that are

1330
01:19:35.181 --> 01:19:39.230
into it.
And I say like,
you know,
we might go down to once every two weeks,

1331
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.360
and it's like,
I just smacked him in the face.
They're like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1332
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:46.330
You know,
I think it'd be,
you know,
you,

1333
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:49.820
but sometimes they also feel that

1334
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:53.900
if I had more time that I would be able to do a better job.

1335
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.930
Like maybe that's something I need to weigh as well.
Um,

1336
01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:01.670
and if you think about like hardcore history,
you call that Guy Dan Carlin is,

1337
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.770
he just makes people,
he tortures people,

1338
01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:08.190
making them wait and it make you wait and wait and,
and um,

1339
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.210
so I don't know,
maybe we,
maybe we need to go to once every two weeks.

1340
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:14.310
Maybe I just need to suck it up and just keep doing.
I don't know.

1341
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.940
Maybe I don't know yet.
But,
um,
yeah,

1342
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.900
with the one thing that's good about all these other podcasts is that gives you

1343
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:24.510
an opportunity to go listen to something else.
That's true.

1344
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.940
Or do you go back and relisten?
Yeah,

1345
01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:35.190
we'll see.
I'm sure we might get some feedback on that one.

1346
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.271
Yeah.

1347
01:20:36.271 --> 01:20:39.870
So people think if you out there thinks you'd be okay with us going every two

1348
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:44.420
weeks or if it's gonna ruin your life.
Yeah.

1349
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.770
Yeah.
Cause it probably takes 15 to 20 hours.
Now I'm a slow reader.

1350
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.740
I'm a slow reader.
So when I'm reading a book,

1351
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:57.090
I read at the same pace that I talk.

1352
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.130
Now when I'm on the podcast,

1353
01:20:59.131 --> 01:21:02.340
I'm talking a little bit slower than I normally talk.
But when I'm reading,

1354
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:04.500
I'm reading about the pace I'm speaking right about now.

1355
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.200
This is just a normal and what's good about it.

1356
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.110
And I learned this in college when I read and I'm reading at this pace,

1357
01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:13.680
I remember just about everything that I read.
If I read fast,

1358
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:17.550
all a Tim Ferriss and speed reading,
I don't retain the same amount.

1359
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.290
And so I read slow,
I absorb,
I'm thinking about it,
I'm making some notes.

1360
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:25.590
So to get through a book takes 10 15 hours.

1361
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:27.870
So then you get through with that.

1362
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:32.760
Now you've got to go back through it again and decide what the actual,

1363
01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:37.200
the actual script timing that you're going to read it.

1364
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.130
So now I'm like marking up the book and I'm going back and writing the page

1365
01:21:41.131 --> 01:21:43.860
numbers and I'm tapping it out.
That takes a few hours,
three hours.

1366
01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:47.460
And so by that it was all said and done.
You know,
you're talking about 20 hours,

1367
01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:50.400
15 to 20 hours to prep,
and

1368
01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:54.600
we every single day,
like today or yesterday,

1369
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:58.930
I got done prepping for this podcast.
Or actually I got done prepping for the,

1370
01:21:58.931 --> 01:22:02.190
the,
the four hours of my life.
As soon as I got done,
I literally picked it up,

1371
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.380
picked it up,
I stood up at my bookshelf and I started looking,
okay,

1372
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:06.780
what's going on?
What's coming next?
Because I want wanna start reading it now.

1373
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:11.040
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that's the,

1374
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.460
the Jocko preparedness.
Yeah.
You know,
hyper preparedness,
right.

1375
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:20.790
Hyper preparedness.
And also it's because when,
like I said earlier,

1376
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.150
when somebody presses play on the podcast,
I want them to,

1377
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.490
I want them to be getting a piece of quality material.

1378
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.450
I'm not going to turn out something that's just,
that's just crap.

1379
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:32.280
I would rather not do it at all.

1380
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:36.810
I'd rather shut down and take a six month break or a lifelong break and never do

1381
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:37.450
it again.

1382
01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:41.550
Then just start turning it out for no reason or escalated that real quick.

1383
01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.640
And I know,
you know why?
You know why I did that?

1384
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.760
Because I have to maintain that attitude of like it like I'm not doing this,

1385
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.290
I'm doing this because I want to do it.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1386
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:58.110
I'm doing this because I want to do it and if I don't want to do it then I'm not

1387
01:22:58.111 --> 01:23:02.700
going to do it.
Right.
And it is,
I mean,

1388
01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:07.060
like I said,
I like to hit,
I like hit play on a podcast and be like,
okay,

1389
01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:07.481
this is it.

1390
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:10.630
Just like sitting down to listen to great music or anything like that that the

1391
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:13.660
podcast for me is like that.
It's like reading a great book.

1392
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:17.620
It's like watching a great movie.
It's sitting down pressing play and going,
okay,

1393
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.360
this is going to have impact on me.

1394
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:22.060
And so I want to turn something out like that.

1395
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.490
I don't want to turn out to second rate stuff.

1396
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.960
I want to turn out something legit.
And if I,
if I failed to do that,

1397
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.490
then I'm not going to do it.

1398
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:37.090
At least now I'm seeing if I was failed to do it,

1399
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:38.830
but I was trying my hardest.
Okay.

1400
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:40.810
I might continue cause I'm just trying to make them.

1401
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.990
But if I was failing to do it cause I wasn't putting the effort into it,

1402
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.150
then I'm not going to do it.
Cause that's,
I think,

1403
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:51.180
I think that my personal expectations and the expectations that people have when

1404
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:54.730
they press play,
they want to get something good.

1405
01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:59.110
They want to get some quality,
they want to learn something,
they want to,

1406
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.580
they want to enter into the game.

1407
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.760
Whereas if they start pressing play and they hear garbage,

1408
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:08.350
man,
I don't want them to hear that.
And I don't want to be that.

1409
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.550
That's not my gig.
My gig is going hard,

1410
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.490
putting out hard and putting out something that,

1411
01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.600
that people want to listen to because it helps them not doing it just to do it.

1412
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:24.580
That's not my thing.
Yeah.
And if you start slipping in that regard,
right,

1413
01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:29.410
you can smell it from a mile away,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what,

1414
01:24:29.411 --> 01:24:31.990
the one thing I have realized when I first started,
I thought,
oh,
well,

1415
01:24:31.991 --> 01:24:34.630
I don't know.
You know,
there's only so many books you know,

1416
01:24:34.631 --> 01:24:37.570
that I could actually do cause I'm,
I'm thinking books that had impact on me.

1417
01:24:37.571 --> 01:24:41.620
Real legit impact.
There wasn't some huge list,
right?

1418
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:45.010
But as soon as I started going down the path,

1419
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.170
now I realize that there's literally I could,
I could,

1420
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:49.810
I'm not going to be able to do in my lifetime all the books I want to do.

1421
01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.070
You know what I mean?

1422
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:55.030
Not just not going to happen in enlisting other people to make suggestions,

1423
01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:56.390
which people are enlisted to.

1424
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.110
Every trooper out there sending me two or three books and saying,
hey,

1425
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:02.380
check this out.
My Amazon Bill.
Click through to Jocko podcasts,

1426
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:05.530
click through to Amazon.
We got it going on because after that monies from me,

1427
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.290
because I'm ordering books all the time,
when somebody says,
Hey,

1428
01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:10.690
check this book out.
I don't really have time to play around.

1429
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:13.900
Do you know what I do?
I just order it.
I just click through ordered on Amazon.

1430
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:14.831
Well I need,

1431
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:19.831
I'm literally literally getting a new bookshelf in my house because I've got so

1432
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:24.310
many books piling up and yeah,
that to me,

1433
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.390
well what's good about it?
I love this guy.
And this is another thing,

1434
01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:31.600
and I told you this early on because early on you said,
hey,
you know,

1435
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.250
it was like three weeks into it,
you're like,
hey,

1436
01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:35.770
I don't know if we were able to keep up this pace.
And I said,
you know what?

1437
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.490
I like this grind.
I want to be a maxed out,
I want to have the pedal down.

1438
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.220
And you know what?
I want to be going hard.

1439
01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:46.000
And I think the people that listened to the podcast are people that are going

1440
01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:50.020
hard in their perspective lives.
They're going there,
they're working hard,

1441
01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.300
they're making things happen,
they're being aggressive.

1442
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.720
And that's what I'm doing here.
That's what we're doing here.

1443
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.750
And so I think that's why it resonates with some people.

1444
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.230
And there's some people that are listening to this that know that they kind of

1445
01:26:02.231 --> 01:26:05.740
step it up a little,
you know?
And that also is a good thing.
Yeah.

1446
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.840
I don't think there's too many people that are like,
Jocko get your,
get your,

1447
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:12.530
get it together.
You need to get your game on.
They know I'm bringing my a game,

1448
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:13.670
right.
I,

1449
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:18.410
I'm bringing my a game and people know that but the day that I can't bring my a

1450
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:22.060
game then a couple of things,
maybe it's I'm okay,
you know what,

1451
01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:27.090
I need more time cause I don't want to turn out crap or I don't do it anymore or

1452
01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:33.190
we do it whenever.
But
I like being driven.

1453
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:38.140
I like a deadline.
I learned a lot from the podcast from,

1454
01:26:38.290 --> 01:26:39.340
from getting ready for it.

1455
01:26:39.341 --> 01:26:43.450
Cause you gotta remember I read a book so you got a little bit by listening to

1456
01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:47.110
an hour of me talking about a book,
I read a book,
I absorbed it,
I highlighted it,

1457
01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.370
I outlined it,
I researched it,
I looked up and I look up.

1458
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.530
Oh that general,
he sounds like an interesting,
I don't,

1459
01:26:53.531 --> 01:26:55.900
we just do a real quick fact check to see if there's anything in the behind the

1460
01:26:55.901 --> 01:26:58.090
scenes I needed to tell about him.
Oh,
you don't want,

1461
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.140
there's a poem that's related to this.
I'm taking out poems that I didn't know,

1462
01:27:02.141 --> 01:27:04.840
didn't understand in reviewing them.

1463
01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:10.000
So all these little things that you don't want and who knows?
I mean,

1464
01:27:10.001 --> 01:27:13.260
does this,
should this be the full time job?
I've,

1465
01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.590
I don't know you,
you know,
and by the way,
the whole time that I'm doing this,

1466
01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:19.180
I got a business,
you know,

1467
01:27:19.181 --> 01:27:21.910
with life that were traveling and working with companies.

1468
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:26.500
I got other books in the hopper that I'm writing currently and I have to spend

1469
01:27:26.501 --> 01:27:30.460
time doing that,
which I'm super pumped about those as well.

1470
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.020
But like those,
that takes time.
So yeah.
Dang.
But,

1471
01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.640
but again,
you know what,
bring it on.
Bring it on,
bring it on.

1472
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:43.030
You mean jump in there?
I'm going to answer your Twitter questions.

1473
01:27:43.031 --> 01:27:46.510
I'm going to deliver some podcasts yet.
Baja.
I can make it happen.

1474
01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:54.910
Some people choose to get after it and red line and we encourage that red line.

1475
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:57.520
That's what I'm talking about in a red line.
This bad boy.

1476
01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:01.630
Speaking of red lining.
Next question,

1477
01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:06.810
please discuss how discipline equals freedom can and should apply to one's

1478
01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:12.470
financial life.
Thanks from all the strippers,

1479
01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.960
uh,
d obviously if you want to be financially free,

1480
01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:21.550
you got to have financial discipline.
That's just the way it is.
So here's,

1481
01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.310
it's just simple,
not easy.
Save your money.
Boom.
That's number one.

1482
01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:31.360
Don't buy an X.
Here's one.
Don't buy an expensive car

1483
01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.520
until you own a piece of property.
That's just a basic rule.
Yup.

1484
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.140
If you're driving a Mercedes

1485
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:46.770
s class from 2015 is that a good one to ask?

1486
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.080
It's a very good one.
Yeah,
it's a very good one,

1487
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.700
but it's also $120,000.
But if you're living,

1488
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:58.290
if you're renting the wrong move,
sell that thing and buy a piece of property.

1489
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.720
A car is a depreciating of properties or properties and appreciating asset to

1490
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:08.130
try and put your money into your appreciating assets.
Spend less than you earn.

1491
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.240
Boom.
Stay off the credit cards.

1492
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.823
Boom.

1493
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.300
Invest your money in something.

1494
01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.150
I like to invest money in me
in things that I'm going to do.

1495
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:25.710
That's what I want to do.

1496
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.730
I want to invest money in things that I know and understand and what better do I

1497
01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:31.710
know and understand that then things that I'm doing,

1498
01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:35.160
people that I know or things that I'm involved with.
So

1499
01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.680
that's what you gotta do.
You want us,
you want to get your money taking care of,

1500
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:42.660
you want to,
you want to have financial freedom,

1501
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.720
you've got to just have the financial discipline that that's all there is to it

1502
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.280
and work hard,
you know,
or card make things happen.
But your,

1503
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.370
your major gains,
you know,

1504
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:57.600
most people don't become rich by their salary,
right.

1505
01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.270
They become baby,
they,
they earn their wealth,

1506
01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:04.660
they gained their wealth through bigger things like buying properties.
You know,

1507
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:08.580
we got a Jiu Jitsu player at the,
at the academy,

1508
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:13.020
a girl and you know,

1509
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.030
a year ago she was kind of talking to me about,
oh well you know,

1510
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:22.590
you know,
she just got married and Blah Blah Blah.
And we started talking.
I said,

1511
01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.430
you,
you,
you know,
with,
I'll think about moving.
I got this condo and I was like,

1512
01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:28.140
we started talking about buying properties and boom,

1513
01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:32.700
she disclosed on a like a four four unit property in San Diego.

1514
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.310
And the day she got the keys,

1515
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.310
she was making $400 a month.

1516
01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:42.990
She went from paying $1,900 a month in mortgage.
The day she made,

1517
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:46.530
she got the keys.
All of a sudden that she rented that place out,

1518
01:30:46.630 --> 01:30:49.890
she's got three units she's living in with crappiest unit and she's got those

1519
01:30:49.891 --> 01:30:52.590
things rented out and now she's making $400 a month.
So that's a,

1520
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:56.730
that's a Delta of what,
$2,300 a month in the black.

1521
01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.250
That's impressive.
And it took her a year to get done,
but she did it.

1522
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:05.970
And now I said,
she's like,
I'm so happy.
I'm like,
that's cool.
Start saving.

1523
01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.310
Start saving for your next property.
I'm like,

1524
01:31:08.311 --> 01:31:10.770
the market's going to take a downturn.
You gotta be ready if it doesn't,

1525
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:12.900
if it does,
but you gotta be ready to make that next move.

1526
01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:15.330
So start saving your money.
Start paying that thing down.
Start saving your money.

1527
01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:16.530
Started saving the next down payment.

1528
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:19.290
That's where you're a wealth gets established as an easy,

1529
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:24.050
long term strategic moves that you make.
And you know,

1530
01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:27.570
I'm no financial expert,
but you don't have to be a financial expert to know,

1531
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:31.970
to save your money,
to spend less than you earn.
Um,
and,

1532
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:36.420
and property to me is a good thing to invest in.
It does go up and down,
you know,

1533
01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:38.310
and there's a lot of people that got crushed in the,

1534
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:43.520
in the market downturn in 2007 in 2008 and I was in the military,

1535
01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:46.230
so I was buying houses and I didn't even know that the market downturn,

1536
01:31:46.231 --> 01:31:48.720
it didn't matter to me cause I had had a steady job and I just bought those

1537
01:31:48.721 --> 01:31:50.850
properties just to,
just to have properties.

1538
01:31:50.851 --> 01:31:52.980
I wasn't buying them to flip them and sell them and all that.
No,
I was just like,

1539
01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:55.950
okay,
in some,
some time in the future,

1540
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.990
someone's going to be paying me rent and it's gonna go in my pocket.

1541
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.300
And that sounds like a good to me cause they're not making any more real estate

1542
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:05.500
by the beach.
Right.
Um,
so,
so yeah,

1543
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:10.360
I'm not a financial genius.
Talk to somebody that is smart.

1544
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.050
Talk to somebody that understands finances,
but save your money,

1545
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:17.680
spend less than you earn.
Don't be renting if you don't be renting a place,

1546
01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:22.681
if you're buying a outline and Mercedes s class or a seven series or a range

1547
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:27.040
rover by low piece of property,
but I little thing.
Yup.
Bye.
Little thing.

1548
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:31.840
Don't just go by that little something.
Get in there,
get it started.
Yeah man,

1549
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:36.400
I like this.
Invest in yourself.
Yeah,

1550
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.780
because and invest in yourself.
That's a such a broad term.

1551
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:46.650
And actually it's kind of started to become like a little like cliche catch,

1552
01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:49.680
freeze yourself.

1553
01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:55.070
<v 1>But if you really think about that,
you yeah.
You invest in yourself,</v>

1554
01:32:55.071 --> 01:32:59.060
you don't go by,
you know,
I used to work in the nightclub industry,
right?
So I'm,

1555
01:32:59.061 --> 01:33:00.890
and I'm now,
I'm looking with my mindset now,

1556
01:33:00.891 --> 01:33:04.180
looking back at the people I used to deal with.
I used to be,

1557
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:08.990
see people come in there every weekend and spend a lot of money.
I don't know,

1558
01:33:08.991 --> 01:33:11.150
maybe some of them are already are rich or,

1559
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:15.470
but I know that if that's what you're spending your money on,

1560
01:33:15.471 --> 01:33:19.700
you're going down and essentially just buying drinks,
buying nightclubs,

1561
01:33:19.701 --> 01:33:22.790
there's no essential oil.
That's what you're doing.
You're throwing,

1562
01:33:22.791 --> 01:33:26.330
if thinking back like thinking back five years ago,

1563
01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.750
you spent all your money,
not all your money,

1564
01:33:29.751 --> 01:33:33.950
but you spend a bunch of money on drinks and what you have literally nothing to

1565
01:33:33.951 --> 01:33:38.090
show for it.
And in most cases those it's gonna mess you up in one way.

1566
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:40.490
You going to do something you regret or whatever potentially.

1567
01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.150
So think of that same five years and be like,
Dang,

1568
01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:49.151
what if I started these two things that in my prediction is going to help me in

1569
01:33:49.881 --> 01:33:52.730
five years?
And let's say you did that five years ago and you did it.

1570
01:33:52.731 --> 01:33:56.180
I don't know,
you even practice it like an hour a day,
whatever it is.

1571
01:33:56.390 --> 01:34:00.710
Even just improving your knowledge on the economy or something,
I dunno.
Anything,

1572
01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.610
anything that improves your knowledge.
Five years later you could,

1573
01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.460
you could be essentially an expert at it.
So now just consider it.

1574
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:12.560
Now,
what is it that you should have gotten into?

1575
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:15.470
Because you probably have a handful of interests that are pretty cool to you.

1576
01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.390
Even if it's like playing guitar,
I don't know,
whatever,

1577
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:21.380
but if you can make it something that you can anticipate in five years,

1578
01:34:21.381 --> 01:34:24.110
it's going to be your,
if you're talking about financial stuff,

1579
01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:28.490
it's going to help you make money.
It didn't do that.

1580
01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:32.750
Don't,
and I harp on reality TV a lot,

1581
01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:37.280
but I think it kind of deserves it because you don't learn much reality TV yet.

1582
01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:42.281
You lost like that hour and if you spent that hour and really you could kind of

1583
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:45.650
keep watching reality if you want,

1584
01:34:45.651 --> 01:34:49.800
but just spend that one hour doing something that you anticipate if you're

1585
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:54.820
really good at it would help you financially do that thing for one hour and then

1586
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:58.060
one day's going to come and you're to think back,
oh

1587
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.980
<v 0>look,
just the same way.
I'm thinking back five years ago,</v>

1588
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:04.490
I mean in my case is more than five years ago,
but just the same way.

1589
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:07.410
I'm thinking back of those people at the nightclub industry.
Same Way.

1590
01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.600
I'm thinking back about that.

1591
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:11.030
You're going to be thinking back at yourself and you'd be like,
Dang,

1592
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:13.640
I'm so happy I got into that,
you know?
Yeah.

1593
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.070
And there's all kinds of things you could have done.
I mean,

1594
01:35:16.071 --> 01:35:19.940
I've looked at the money I wasted over the years in the bars.

1595
01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:23.420
It's ridiculous.
You know,
being a young seal out,

1596
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:27.560
getting after it with the boys Thursday,
Friday,

1597
01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.550
Saturday and the Sunday.
That's how we used to roll.
Yeah.

1598
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:34.670
That's how we used to roll and it was just,
hey,
we'd show up.

1599
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.260
I'm the richest guy in the world.

1600
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:39.950
I have all the money that I ever need and I can buy whatever I want.

1601
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:43.910
That's what every night was like.
So not wise.

1602
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:49.110
Don't do that.
Yeah.
And I'll even
go out,

1603
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:53.330
have some fun.
It's cool.
You can still do it.
I'm just saying,
think of that.

1604
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:57.080
Think of what you're doing right now and your cause for these people and for

1605
01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:59.930
these people I was talking about back when he was working the nightclub
industry,

1606
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:01.940
they are really,
technically,

1607
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:05.520
they are committed to spending their money committed to it.
Yeah.

1608
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:09.890
If you're doing something every single week for years,

1609
01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:10.963
you're committed to it.

1610
01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.250
So just take one of those hours or take maybe 10% of that money that you're

1611
01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:20.370
spending,
25% all of it,
whatever,
and put it in something that you anticipate.

1612
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.010
And the other thing is,
I mean,

1613
01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:24.680
invest in yourself as like actually build something.

1614
01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:27.560
Actually built a little company,
you know,
make something.
That's what that,

1615
01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.790
that's what I was meant.

1616
01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.260
You've got another perspective which is also very viable and makes just as much

1617
01:36:33.261 --> 01:36:38.030
sense.
I was literally talking about,
you know,
from your perspective,

1618
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.850
oh you like guitars,
cool.
Figuring out how to make a cool guitar.

1619
01:36:40.851 --> 01:36:42.590
Stand at your house,
you know,

1620
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:47.360
and then see if he can get that thing produced and then,
oh,
it's really good.

1621
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:51.980
Maybe we start running production.
Let's do that.
That is internally,

1622
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:52.880
not only,

1623
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.600
not only will you possibly end up with some kind of a product that sells,

1624
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:59.030
but you'll have grown something.
You've had fun,

1625
01:36:59.031 --> 01:37:00.470
you created something for the world,

1626
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:02.970
you've learned the lessons that you learned about building,
getting,

1627
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:05.270
get him African.
That's how it's all going to be worthwhile as well.

1628
01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:10.580
So there's no this,
this,
I'm not saying this,
um,

1629
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:12.470
with regards to that,

1630
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.040
you're going to come up with this product and you're going to get rich.

1631
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.380
It's not going to happen.
It's not going to happen.

1632
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:22.910
But can you use that to build knowledge,

1633
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:27.911
can use that to get gain experience that will then compound with other things in

1634
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:33.491
your life and eventually make you financially free because you had that

1635
01:37:34.221 --> 01:37:37.380
discipline?
Absolutely.
Yes.

1636
01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:44.090
Yup.
Next question.

1637
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.590
Does micromanaging ever work?

1638
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.160
Well,
yes.
And,
and more.

1639
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.410
Does it work?
Yes.
Sometimes it works.
And more importantly,

1640
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:01.680
sometimes you have to micromanage.
Um,

1641
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:06.690
so you get somebody that isn't good at their job,
doesn't do a good job,

1642
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:10.650
doesn't show up,
doesn't run things right.
Of course,
you know how you fix them.

1643
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.330
You got to get in there to micromanage.
Well,
first of all,

1644
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:14.880
you can't do mission failure.
So you gotta get in there to micromanage.

1645
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.110
Once you're done micromanaging or,
or once you've got them up to speed,

1646
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.510
then you can stop micromanaging.
This is,

1647
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:24.330
this is totally good to go.

1648
01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.090
And even if you asked life or you know,

1649
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:30.060
the other platoon commanders that worked for me or assistant between commanders

1650
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:30.894
at work for me,

1651
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.360
if when we say when they got to know me,
when they met me,

1652
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:40.140
I was Mike Rowe manage master cause I'm in their grill,
hey this,

1653
01:38:40.141 --> 01:38:41.520
you got to do this.
No,
come over here a little bit.

1654
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:44.730
No and wouldn't give any slack.
But then as soon as I see that they get it,

1655
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.960
of course then it's like,
okay,
you got this,
you got this and I'm going to,

1656
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:51.990
I'm going to macro manage and barely manage and let them run with it.

1657
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:53.303
And so that's,

1658
01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:57.900
that's absolutely micromanagement is sometimes it's a necessity.

1659
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.860
And by the way,
if you're getting micromanaged,

1660
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:04.020
that's a little bit of a red flag.

1661
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.900
I'm sure you might have somebody that's a control freak that is a compulsive

1662
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:08.460
micromanager and that sucks.

1663
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:10.710
But you also might have somebody that doesn't trust you yet.

1664
01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.890
And so how do you build up their trust?
Is it by hiding from them?
No,

1665
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:16.050
it's by being open and being like,
hey boss,
here's what I'm gonna do.

1666
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.200
You actually send them more information than they could even want.

1667
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.760
You show them how responsible you are.

1668
01:39:20.761 --> 01:39:24.090
You show them what a handle you have on the situation and that's how you can

1669
01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:26.130
help overcome the micro manager.

1670
01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.730
But if someone's not doing what they're supposed to do or they're failing or

1671
01:39:29.731 --> 01:39:31.320
they're,
they're letting you down,
then yeah,

1672
01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:33.030
you've got to get in their grill and micromanage them.

1673
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.140
The other time that sort of said this is when you're mentoring someone,

1674
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.400
that can also be viewed as micromanagement because now I'm sitting side by side

1675
01:39:41.401 --> 01:39:44.970
and my breathing down your neck a little bit and that might be viewed as

1676
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:47.730
micromanagement.
But again,
sometimes it's necessary.

1677
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:49.650
If you don't know the ropes yet,
I got to show you the ropes.

1678
01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:53.010
That means I've got to sit by you and make sure you know it.
Um,
teaching.

1679
01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.520
So if you're teaching somebody something in a work environment,

1680
01:39:56.521 --> 01:39:59.700
that can also be viewed as micromanagement,
it actually is because you're saying,

1681
01:39:59.701 --> 01:40:04.170
hey,
put this over here,
put that over here,
wait back off,
let me do this.
No,
no,

1682
01:40:04.171 --> 01:40:05.520
you don't know how to do it.
So I got to show you how to do,

1683
01:40:05.521 --> 01:40:09.620
I'm teaching you how to do it.
So there's that and,

1684
01:40:09.621 --> 01:40:13.050
and then that's teaching and then sometimes you've got to show people how to do

1685
01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:15.900
it.
And I told that long story in here one time where I just said,
hey,

1686
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:18.120
you sit and watch how I'm going to run this squad.

1687
01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.860
And I ran the squad and got fired up and told people where to go and move down

1688
01:40:22.861 --> 01:40:26.250
the line.
And the platoon commander looked at me and said,
okay,
I can do that.

1689
01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:28.170
And as soon as you saw at one time he got it.

1690
01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:32.010
So that's sometimes micromanagement is okay.

1691
01:40:32.011 --> 01:40:35.670
The thing is you don't want to get stuck in the Rut of micromanagement.

1692
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:39.180
So if I mentor you,
if I teach you,
if I instruct you,
if I showed you the way,

1693
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:42.390
it doesn't mean stay there and keep micromanaging cause you're not doing your

1694
01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:43.224
job.

1695
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:47.580
You shouldn't have the capability or the capacity to micromanagement to

1696
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:50.550
micromanage everybody that works for you.
If you have that ability,

1697
01:40:50.551 --> 01:40:53.010
you're not doing your job,
you're not looking up the chain of command,

1698
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:55.360
you're not looking out your troopers,

1699
01:40:55.361 --> 01:40:58.900
your subordinate leadership should be stepping up and leading and you should

1700
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.950
expect that of them.
And if you have to micro management,

1701
01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:05.080
it should be a chore that you don't like doing.

1702
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:08.470
And when you get in there and you micromanage for a certain amount of time,

1703
01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:13.330
then you say,
okay,
you got this.
You know,
um,
I'm stepping back.

1704
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:17.290
And then you've got to step back because no one likes to be micromanaged.

1705
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:22.030
So once you get people up to speed,
step back,
let them run,

1706
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.460
let your leaders lead.
Yeah.

1707
01:41:24.710 --> 01:41:29.710
Sometimes those people who like to micromanage or they feel compelled to,

1708
01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:35.380
they can fall in that trap where,

1709
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:38.230
where let's say they do need to micromanage and they'll get that payoff of,

1710
01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:39.790
Oh yeah,
I see this guy kind of getting it.

1711
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:43.240
But instead of understanding the full scope of things where,
oh,

1712
01:41:43.241 --> 01:41:47.500
he's getting it now,
I need to,
I don't need to manage as much.
There'll be like,

1713
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:51.670
they'll still start chasing that payoff of them getting it with their little

1714
01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:52.720
micromanagement,
you know,

1715
01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:55.990
so they'll like constantly need that pay off some people now that you mentioned,

1716
01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:59.860
some people micromanage because their ego that they want to,

1717
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:02.440
they want to exercise,
they want to do two things,

1718
01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:05.680
exercise their power over the person or,

1719
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.450
or show off their knowledge to the person.
Yeah,

1720
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.200
so those two are just such a pain.
There's such a pain,
but you know what?

1721
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.040
What do you do?
Okay,
cool.
I'm going to work harder.
I'm going to be ahead of you.

1722
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:21.130
I'm going to get better at this and we're going to move on.
Yeah.

1723
01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.480
That showing off knowledge thing that,
that,

1724
01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:27.490
that it's in a micromanagement situation it seems like,
okay.

1725
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:30.580
It's obviously you shouldn't do that and you could probably see it from a mile

1726
01:42:30.581 --> 01:42:35.140
away,
but just in everyday life,
that's a compelling thing to want to show people.

1727
01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:35.950
You ever,

1728
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:39.250
you ever hear someone telling you something that you already know and you just

1729
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:41.710
want to tell them?
Probably.
I already know.
I know.
I know.
You know,

1730
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:45.190
like you don't have to explain it to me when really when you really kind of

1731
01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:48.280
search your own feelings,
it's not that they're wasting your time,

1732
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:51.600
it's kind of that you just want to let them know that I have that knowledge,

1733
01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:54.280
don't worry about it.
You know what I mean?
I see that all the time.

1734
01:42:54.281 --> 01:42:58.600
I feel that all the time she's got to grin and bear it.

1735
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:02.590
But I think that's,
that's a real compelling like desire,
you know,

1736
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:07.450
to to show,
hey,
I already know that.
Or look how much I know.

1737
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:10.200
You know?
Yeah.
People definitely like that.
It's,

1738
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.950
it makes them feel good and look at what,
I know,
you know,

1739
01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:19.630
<v 2>last question
Jocko.</v>

1740
01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.570
<v 0>Focus in a battle is easy.
How do you keep focus in a long war</v>

1741
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.740
<v 2>I.
E.
Longterm goals</v>

1742
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:37.420
<v 0>that that Greg can definitely be true.</v>

1743
01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.440
It can be pretty easy to focus on the battle that's right in front of your face.

1744
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:51.100
And when you're doing that,
sometimes you can lose track of the,

1745
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:52.430
the long term goal.

1746
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.080
But I want to have that,

1747
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:59.780
that long term goal.

1748
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:05.350
So embedded in my mind that I'll never lose sight of it ever.

1749
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:13.900
And those little tasks and projects and short term goals that you tackle,

1750
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:18.350
they need to lead toward that strategic victory,

1751
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.830
winning the long war

1752
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:28.670
and we get very caught up in instant gratification.

1753
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:33.790
We want results now we want the shortcut to the winner's podium

1754
01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.420
and sometimes you know,

1755
01:44:41.421 --> 01:44:45.320
when we don't get that short term glory that we want,

1756
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.920
we lose track of those long term goals and you,

1757
01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.560
you look up and in six weeks or in six months or in six years and you've made no

1758
01:45:01.221 --> 01:45:02.054
progress,

1759
01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:04.203
<v 2>no,</v>

1760
01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:06.960
<v 0>you never moved.</v>

1761
01:45:08.730 --> 01:45:13.730
You might even be further from your goal then you were

1762
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:23.023
<v 2>why?</v>

1763
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.660
<v 0>Why did you let that happen?</v>

1764
01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.530
It's because you lost sight of that longterm goal

1765
01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:40.540
and at some point after you lose sight of that goal and years have gone by,

1766
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:44.540
you'd think to yourself,
maybe I can't,

1767
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:46.540
<v 2>okay,</v>

1768
01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.680
<v 0>maybe I can't do it.</v>

1769
01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.600
And so you give up and you let it feed

1770
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:59.780
and you settle.

1771
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:06.380
You settle for mediocrity,
you settle for average,
you settle for

1772
01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:08.063
<v 2>oh well,</v>

1773
01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:14.160
but no,
no,

1774
01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:16.403
don't do that.

1775
01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:21.640
<v 0>Embed that long term goal in your mind,</v>

1776
01:46:21.850 --> 01:46:23.830
burn it into your soul,

1777
01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:29.620
think about it and write about it and talk about it and hang it up on your wall.

1778
01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:32.260
But most important,
do something about it.

1779
01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:37.500
Do something about it.
Every day,
every day.

1780
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:42.590
Do something that moves you toward that goal that keeps the goal alive and

1781
01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.330
insight and in focus.

1782
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:49.440
<v 1>However,</v>

1783
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.960
however small or insignificant that step might seem,
take it.

1784
01:46:55.230 --> 01:46:59.190
Do it to that little piece,
make it happen,

1785
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:07.340
because that goal isn't going to achieve itself.

1786
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:14.850
Eats all on

1787
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:17.343
<v 2>you.</v>

1788
01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:26.070
<v 1>And I think that's all I've got for tonight,</v>

1789
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.330
which means
it's time to wrap it up.

1790
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:33.990
Echo,
what else do we have?

1791
01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:39.660
We have the four important fact that if you're into supplements,

1792
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:43.920
these are the supplements that we,
I'm gonna speak for you for a second.

1793
01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:46.980
Will you recommend it's on it?
Supplements,

1794
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:54.740
specifically Krill oil for your joints and shroom tech for what does it do it

1795
01:47:59.070 --> 01:48:01.780
metcon performance it,

1796
01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.470
it in a nutshell kind of boiled down.
It's it,

1797
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.470
it helps you utilize oxygen consumption,
which is a good thing.
Yes.

1798
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:13.230
Performance side,
very much so.
And yes,
it does work.

1799
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.120
Ask anyone who's ever taken it and then what were your bar?
That's a good one.

1800
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:21.450
Yeah,

1801

Anyway,
there's a lot of good stuff on there.

1805
01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:42.150
Supplements you can read about them.
If you read about the quality,

1806
01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.090
it's some gear equipment on there as well.
Yeah,

1807

get yourself some Zombie bells,

1808

[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko 10% off all supplements

1809
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:58.200
or before you do Amazon shopping.
If you shop at Amazon,

1810
01:48:58.201 --> 01:49:00.090
which I think we all do before that,

1811
01:49:00.091 --> 01:49:04.740
before you go to amazon.com go to Jocko podcast.com and then click on the Amazon

1812
01:49:04.741 --> 01:49:08.040
links like a little affiliate thing.
Beautiful on that.

1813
01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:11.790
You can support Jocko podcasts.
That's a beautiful shopping,
easy,

1814
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.120
easy to really easy.
Trust me,
I've done it before.
And then,
um,

1815
01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.890
Jocko,
store.com.
That's where if you,
if you like sh you know,

1816
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:22.800
shirts and apparel in regards to this podcast is good.

1817
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:26.370
Some good ones I think speaking of which,

1818
01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:30.240
if you didn't already know,
we have the trooper one just kind of new.

1819
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:34.870
It's the new stuff.
If you're on youtube anyway.
Yep.

1820
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:38.460
That's just like the Jocko podcast tee shirt.
Yeah.
You know,

1821
01:49:38.461 --> 01:49:42.940
and there's no doubt what that t shirt is.
Yeah.
Cause Jocko podcast.
Yeah it does.

1822
01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:47.070
Yep.
It's true.
And you know there's,
I put layers,

1823
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:51.340
I try to put these different layers on the apparels,
not just Ooh,
jacket pocket.

1824
01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.850
So there's a little some more to it.
Right,
right.

1825
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:55.900
So then I'm not going to say what it is for this one,

1826
01:49:55.901 --> 01:49:58.840
but there's another layer to it.
So if you want,
yeah,
Jocko,

1827
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:02.710
store.com if you want to look at it and just evaluate it,
you like it,

1828
01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.490
go ahead and get it.
That's a good way to support the podcast.
Yes,
very much so.

1829
01:50:06.491 --> 01:50:08.900
Or if you like to discipline equals freedom.
That one,

1830
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:12.670
which we talked about today.
What is the,
what is sort of the,

1831
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:16.240
the most popular of the tee shirts?
It goes in waves.

1832
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.060
So I'd say generally speaking,

1833
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:22.930
discipline equals freedom because the is the solid seller.
Yeah.

1834
01:50:22.931 --> 01:50:27.850
And that makes sense.
Because again,
like that's their mantra.
Yeah.

1835
01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:29.950
And,
and that's not,
it seems like,
oh,

1836
01:50:29.951 --> 01:50:34.630
it's kind of intriguing as of a thing like discipline equals freedom is kind of

1837
01:50:34.631 --> 01:50:37.180
counterintuitive,
but when you really think about it,
I dunno,

1838
01:50:37.181 --> 01:50:40.990
it's kind of impactful.
I think it's a good thing to live by anyway.

1839
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.960
I agree with you nonetheless.
So maybe that's why,
I dunno.

1840
01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:47.530
And then I'm the good one is kind of cool.

1841
01:50:48.610 --> 01:50:52.720
I think that was more festive,
you know?
But yeah,
there's a few on there,

1842
01:50:52.721 --> 01:50:56.660
some stickers and some mugs as well if,
um,
but yeah,
if you go on there,
Jocko,

1843
01:50:56.670 --> 01:51:00.490
