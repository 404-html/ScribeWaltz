This is Jocko podcast number 13 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.973
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.550
<v 0>This is extracted from US army f m three tack Oh six.one one combined arms</v>

5
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.350
operations in urban terrain.

6
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.790
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union,

7
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.560
the people of Chechnya began to seek full independence.

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.890
By 1994 Chesney had fallen into a civil war between pro independence and pro

9
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.810
Russian factions.
In December,

10
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.810
1994 Russia sent 40,000 troops into Chechnya to restore Russian primacy over the

11
00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:01.241
breakaway republic and attack was launched by 6,000 mechanized troops against

12
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:04.850
the Cheshin capital of Graziani.

13
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.600
<v 0>Instead of the anticipated light resistance,</v>

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.190
Russian forces encountered heavy resistance from the Chechens.

16
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.910
Armed with massive amounts of anti tank weapons,

17
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.040
the Russians will repulsed which shockingly high losses.

18
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.840
It took them another two months of heavy fighting and changing their tactics

19
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.390
before they were able to capture Graziani.

20
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.630
<v 0>Between between January and May,</v>

22
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.631
1995 Russian losses in Chechnya were approximately 2,800 killed,

23
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.040
10,000 wounded and over 500 missing or captured the cash and cash.

24
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.730
The Cheshin casualties were also high,

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660
especially among noncombatants.

26
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.570
This war is a major and cautionary episode in military history,

27
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.220
the large scale lessons of Chechnya lie in these areas.

28
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
It showed again the limited effectiveness of heavy weaponry in urban terrain.

29
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.570
And by extension,
the crucial importance of well trained,

30
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.390
well lead,
well equipped and highly motivated infantry.

31
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.490
It proved again that a society judged primitive or chaotic by western standards

32
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.940
can still generate a tremendous fighting spirit and very effective military

33
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:42.540
discipline.
This is not a new lesson

34
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.300
does,

35
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.300
that's a little introduction to the focus for today.

36
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.190
And that's this Soviet attack on Chechnya,

37
00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:59.620
the breakaway republic.

38
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.380
And it's just urban combat,
the urban combat.

39
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.650
And that's what's,
I found it very fascinating.

40
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.080
And I remember the first time I started to

41
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.030
the first significant moment when I remembered hearing about the lessons learned

42
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.350
from Chechnya.
Cause you know,
you watch it,
you,
you,
you know,
we all watched it.

43
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.450
I was in the military at the time,
you know,
um,

44
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.200
but the first time I remember hearing about the lessons learned was actually

45
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:34.201
when I was going through officer candidate school in 1998 and for whatever

46
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.850
reason s uh,

47
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880
one of the Marine Corps drill instructors had had put this series of lessons

48
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:45.700
learned of the Russian military up on the wall.

49
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.320
And this is something I talk about occasionally is that the,
the,

50
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.010
the lesson that I remembered seeing there was that it was when they,

51
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.930
when they stopped shaving,
when the,
when the Russian troops stopped shaving,

52
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.040
it was like the beginning of the end discipline fell apart,

53
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.310
morale fell apart and everything turned into a disaster.

54
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.590
And there were a bunch of other lessons aren't.

55
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.190
And I've looked for that specific document and I haven't been able to find it.

56
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.210
So I don't know what the specific document was that said that.

57
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.690
But I've found others that are close to that.
But what's interesting is that now,

58
00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:21.101
and this,

59
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:26.101
this field manuals army field manual that I'm reading from a,

60
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:29.140
was actually published in 2002.

61
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.680
So we had definitely looked at at this war and it was brutal.

62
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.640
And if you want to go into some dark places,

63
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.090
you can go to some dark places because this is one of the first,

64
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.640
it definitely is one of the first,
where were you had,

65
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.060
you know,
information warfare happening.
Meaning there was propaganda coming out,

66
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.700
homemade propaganda.
You can see it on youtube,

67
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.390
especially from the Cheshin side of just brutal brutal behavior.

68
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.170
Yeah.

69
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.170
And they were doing that purposely to strike fear into the hearts of the Russian

70
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.260
soldiers.
And they,
they,
they,
they were effective in doing that.
They did do that.

71
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.020
Yeah.
It was crazy how they make those videos available to everybody.

72
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.630
They do.
It is,
it is crazy.

73
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.550
So as we dig into this a little bit,

74
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:32.551
this is still from within the FM three tack one oh six but they're quoting

75
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.270
lessons learned from the world turned upside down.

76
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300
Military lessons of the Chechen war by Mr Anatole leaving.

77
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.850
And he said it cannot be emphasized too strongly,

78
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.880
therefore that the key to success in urban warfare is good infantry.

79
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.870
And the key to good infantry rather than good weapon tree is a traditional

80
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.400
mixture of training,

81
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.880
leadership qualities and NC shows and junior grade officers and morale implying

82
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.910
a readiness to take casualties.

83
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.000
So this is classic.

84
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.940
<v 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.420
<v 0>this is what we,
this is what Ramadi was all about as well.
You know,</v>

86
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.430
good infantry,
which they absolutely had great NCO leadership,

87
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.490
which they absolutely had.
The junior officers were outstanding,

88
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.470
and the morale which,

89
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.570
which he says the morale is a readiness to take casualties.
And it,
you know,

90
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.960
that's one of the things
that no doubt about it,

91
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:40.320
Colonel Sean McFarlin that was running the brigade,

92
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.510
he had to overcome that fear that many people had,

93
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600
which was when you push into these enemy controlled territories,

94
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.610
you are going to take casualties.
It is going to happen.
You cannot avoid it.

95
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.660
And that's something that we seals had to deal with as well because seals had

96
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:00.534
been in,

97
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.770
had been in Iraq for three years at this point and not had any seals killed in

98
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:12.210
action.
So this idea that we're going to push into this,

99
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:16.590
a heavy urban fighting
meant to us.
We were gonna,

100
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.310
we were going to take casualties at some point.

101
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.710
The U s back to the book,

102
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.540
the u s will not always have the ability to pick and choose.
It's wars.

103
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.160
And the key reason Chechnya,

104
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:36.161
is that there will always be a military actions in which it determined infantry

105
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.220
men will remain the greatest asset.

106
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.330
And that is very near and dear to my heart,

107
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.180
knowing that it's not the technology,
it's not the the drones,

108
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:53.670
it's not the aircraft,
it's the infantry men,

109
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:58.671
it's the soldier that makes the difference and the leader,

110
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.300
the leaders of those soldiers that make the difference.

111
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.700
Now here was the Marine Corps analysis.

112
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.880
First of all,
strategic lessons.

113
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.230
Military operations alone cannot solve deep seated political problems.

114
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.513
Okay?

115
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.850
Military commanders need clear policy guidance from which they could work

116
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.800
steadily.
And logically,

117
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.530
confusion generated by missing or conflicting policy guidance is made worse by

118
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.320
poorly defined lines of command and control.

119
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.480
So those first two messages,

120
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:45.481
right there are all about clear guidance and I,

121
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.190
this happens all the time in the business world where you don't see clear

122
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:54.700
guidance making it all the way down to the front lines to the chain of command.

123
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.913
<v 1>Okay?</v>

124
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.060
<v 0>Russian senior command lacked continuity and was plagued by too much senior</v>

125
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.240
leadership involvement at the lower operational level.

126
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.490
<v 1>Okay?</v>

127
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.390
<v 0>Lack continuity.</v>

128
00:09:08.391 --> 00:09:11.600
There's gotta be clear message that every leader's got to be basically saying

129
00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:13.970
the same fundamental message.

130
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.940
<v 0>Contrary to initial expectation,</v>

132
00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:21.230
operations were neither of short duration or low cost.

133
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.350
When Russian security operations began achieving results,

134
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.560
the Cheshin started attacking targets within Russia.

135
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.530
It was difficult to unite police and military units into a single cohesive

136
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.100
force.

137
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.420
Distinct tactical advantages accrue to the side with less concern for the safety

138
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.460
of the civilian population.

139
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.840
That is something that we absolutely dealt with in Ramadi.
Again,

140
00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:58.310
it's that the distinct tactical advantage accrue to the side with less concern

141
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.730
for the safety,
the civilian population.
This was,

142
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.973
<v 1>yeah,</v>

143
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.900
<v 0>of utmost concern.</v>

144
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.640
<v 0>To every soldier and marine on the ground in Ramadi was trying to protect the</v>

146
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:16.641
civilian population and of course the al Qaeda and surgeons that we are facing

147
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:21.660
did not care at all about the civilian population or an either buildings or any

148
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:24.540
of their,
their lives or children or women or anything else.

149
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.203
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.200
<v 0>Concern about civilian casualties and property destruction declined as</v>

151
00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:35.500
casualties among Russian forces.
Rose.

152
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.590
<v 0>So initially the Russians were also concerned about civilian casualties,</v>

154
00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:44.860
but as they started taking casualties got worse and worse.

155
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.660
Here are some operational lessons

156
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.340
having well-developed military doctrine for urban warfare is not enough in and

157
00:10:58.611 --> 00:10:59.444
of itself.

158
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.220
Got To have that creativity doctrine does not answer everything.

159
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.640
Situation oriented training would have improved Russian military effectiveness

160
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:13.080
and we're going to talk about that later today,

161
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:18.081
but situation oriented training and that is when you put yourself in situations

162
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.540
and you make,
people have to think,

163
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:22.930
<v 1>okay,</v>

164
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.460
<v 0>it's not about executing preplan moves.
It's just like in,
in martial arts,</v>

165
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.600
it's not about being able to do a Cada and do a movement.

166
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.340
That's not what it's about.

167
00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:38.341
It's about reacting to another free thinking human being.

168
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:41.470
And in this case,
a group of free thinking human beings.

169
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.970
How do you react in those situations?
And they're in specific situations as well,

170
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.210
right?
Like they'll situate like in Jujitsu we do situational train.

171
00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:52.090
They'll be like,
okay,
here,
half guard.
Yeah.
If you get on top,
you know,

172
00:11:52.091 --> 00:11:54.220
you start all over.
If you know,
tapped the guy,
whatever,

173
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.220
you start all over in half guard,
start all over,
you know,
and half guard.

174
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.420
Inadequate training in the most basic maneuver and combat skills,

175
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.940
inhibited Russian operations.

176
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.800
So you've got to be trained up in the basics,
no doubt about it.

177
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.520
Urban combat is extremely manpower intensive and produces significant attrition

178
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:21.490
of men and materiel among the attackers.

179
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.170
Overwhelming fire power can make up for organizational and tactical deficiencies

180
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:36.010
in the short run if one is willing to disregard collateral damage.

181
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.900
So yeah,
you can just bomb,

182
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.720
bomb the crap out of places and you can make up for your tactical and

183
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.820
organizational problems in the short run if you don't care about a collateral

184
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:51.710
damage,
you know,
this is w we we,
we don't do that.

185
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.130
We as Americans don't do that.
You care about collateral damage,

186
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.430
the sudden requirement to deploy to Chechnya coupled with the unique supply

187
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:07.170
problems posed by the weather and the urban environment overwhelmed the already

188
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:09.960
fragile Russian military logistics system.

189
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.330
<v 0>And these are just bullet points.
By the way,
if this sounds stilted,</v>

191
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:16.670
the way I'm reading it,
I'm just reading bullet after bullet.

192
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.560
A lack of high quality intelligence made operations more difficult and dangerous

193
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.100
on the Russian forces.

194
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:32.010
The geometry and perspectives of urban combat are very different from combat in

195
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:36.730
the open.
Urban combat is much more vertically oriented.

196
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.770
So in in the desert you do have elevation,

197
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:44.290
you know you have hills,
mountains,
whatever suits.

198
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.550
So there is some vertically oriented things that you have to deal with.

199
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:50.890
But in urban combat,
every,
you know,

200
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.710
every foot can be separated by 10 stories,
you know.

201
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.420
And so it is a 360 degree environment.

202
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.280
Not to mention you get subterranean situations,
you have basements,

203
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:07.960
you have sellers,
you have underground sewers and pipes and things,
uh,
uh,

204
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.670
tunnels that go from building to building.

205
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:13.030
So it's a 360 degree environment for sure.

206
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.230
Fratricide was a serious and continuing problem throughout the campaign in

207
00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:25.070
Chechnya because it was difficult to tell friend from foe.

208
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.590
That's friendly,
fire friendly fire.

209
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.150
And this is obviously in our book

210
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.250
I started off,
I mean the first chapter is about a fratricide that happens.

211
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.940
So obviously we learned this,

212
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.330
you know,
in the,

213
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.330
in the most horrible way and anybody that's been in hardcore urban combat,

214
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:50.511
and again,

215
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:55.511
I'm not talking doing an an operation with let's say one unit against a bad guy

216
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.620
in an urban environment.

217
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:03.130
I'm talking about urban and combat where you have multiple units all over the

218
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.080
place,
right?
Friendly units,

219
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.830
<v 1>okay.</v>

220
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.970
<v 0>In buildings,
on roads and they're mixed in.
There's no way he can help with.</v>

221
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:15.380
They're mixed in with enemy and it becomes very,

222
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.310
very challenging.

223
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.320
Standard Russian military unit configurations were inappropriate for urban

224
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.163
combat.

225
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.310
<v 0>For going.
Peacetime maintenance is a false economy.</v>

227
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.230
<v 1>Okay,</v>

228
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.580
<v 0>so there's something to think about.
Peace time maintenance for good.</v>

229
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:39.760
When you say,
you know what,
there's nothing going on right now.

230
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.380
We'll just kind of slack off.
You know what?

231
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.040
I don't need to train in the off season.
Right?
I don't need to prepare right now.

232
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.900
Guess what you do?
You do need to prepare right now.
Yeah,

233
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.470
it's,
it's a lie to think you're going to get away with it.

234
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.500
The potential for special forces for urban operations was never realized in

235
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:04.430
Chechnya.
Well,
we realized it in Ramadi for sure and how to work it.

236
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.520
The nature of cities tends to channel combat operations along narrow lanes of

237
00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:15.880
activity.
That's just a [inaudible] that they were called roads and,

238
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:21.060
and just like when you're in downtown San Diego in the Gaslamp district,

239
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:25.500
guess what?
Things are channeled onto long,
narrow,
long,
narrow lanes of activity.

240
00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:29.000
It's called the road.
That's kind of an obvious one.

241
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.820
Tactical lessons.

242
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

243
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.550
<v 0>Rigorous communication.</v>

244
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:39.470
Security is essential even against relatively primitive enemies.
And this is the,

245
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.120
what the Russians found out was that the,
the Chechens,

246
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.350
many of whom spoke Russian,
they,
they would listen to radio calls,

247
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.820
listen to radio commands,
they would,

248
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.410
they would actually get on the radios and give false commands.
So it was,

249
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.160
it was just a nightmare for them.
Now in the,

250
00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:00.170
in America we have very highly sophisticated encryption systems.

251
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.300
So this is really no factor for us.

252
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.720
Knight fighting was the single most difficult operation in Chechnya for infantry

253
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:14.520
forces.
Again,
this is something that we are very good at.

254
00:17:14.521 --> 00:17:18.780
We being America,
we are awesome at fighting at night.

255
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.770
We have incredible capability on our night vision.
We do it all the time.

256
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.360
And actually that's,
that's worth mentioning.
The reason that we're good at it,

257
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:29.970
cause we do it all the time.
We trained it all the time.
We do it all the time.

258
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.290
And which is a used to be in living in that way will used to live in that green

259
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:36.150
world of night vision

260
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.770
tanks and apcs cannot operate in cities without extensive dismounted infantry

261
00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:46.914
support.

262
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

263
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.490
<v 0>Down Ramadi,
they absolutely operated</v>

264
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.050
<v 1>and they operated with phenomenal success.
But they,</v>

265
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.900
but they did have an infantry support

266
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.740
usually very close by,
although they were,
uh,

267
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.840
they did push and do,
do incredible operations on their own as well.

268
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.300
<v 0>Forces operating in cities need special equipment,</v>

269
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.310
not usually found in the Russian toe,

270
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:18.390
which is the basically the table of Organization of a company.
Some of the,

271
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.230
the list of normal things that they had,

272
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.960
lightweight ladders were invaluable for assaulting infantry.

273
00:18:23.961 --> 00:18:28.250
And this is all my first deployment to Iraq.
We actually,
uh,
we,

274
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.710
we just built little ladders.

275
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.230
We built little two by four ladders because there's walls all over the place.

276
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:33.970
So we just,
we just have ladders,

277
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.390
have him hooked on to Humvees when we needed them,
we just pop them off.

278
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.250
I'm over bare was Fairwood two by fours,
right?

279
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.910
Trained snipers were essential,

280
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.970
but in short supply we had plenty of snipers obscure.

281
00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:56.200
UNSW are especially useful in fighting and cities as a smoke grenades and other

282
00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:57.790
ways of blocking vision.
But yeah,

283
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.500
that's one of those things when when I was a kid in the seal teams and we would

284
00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:04.870
learn like,
hey,
you got to throw smoke.
And once you feel the smoke,

285
00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:07.810
you can run away and he kind of,
it almost seems

286
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.210
like a joke almost.
I mean,
right.

287
00:19:11.211 --> 00:19:13.820
That almost sounds funny when I say it like Batman.
Yeah.

288
00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:16.240
It's almost like Batman or,
or James Bond,
you know,

289
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.490
we've got the little smoke button.
It's a freaking real,
it's real.

290
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.830
Like you throw that smoke out,

291
00:19:21.831 --> 00:19:24.950
you let that smoke start to pour out and then all of a sudden you can get out of

292
00:19:24.951 --> 00:19:29.150
there and it's again,
it's one of those things that

293
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.290
it almost seems like a joke when you first hear about it.

294
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:35.480
When you're a kid you're like,
wait,
really?
That's a real thing.

295
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.710
That's a real thing.

296
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.940
Recovering damaged armored vehicles is especially difficult in cities.

297
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.650
We absolutely learned to that.

298
00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:50.651
The insurgence took out dozens of tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles and

299
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:57.491
Humvees and it was always very difficult for the engineers to get in there and

300
00:19:57.981 --> 00:19:59.000
get those things out of there.

301
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.830
A failure of small unit leadership,

302
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.100
especially at the NCO level,

303
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.550
was a primary cause of Russian tactical failures in Grozny.

304
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.720
So when you hear me say leadership is the most important thing on the

305
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.390
battlefield,
that is what I am talking about.

306
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.660
That is exactly what I am talking about.

307
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.320
And it's the same thing in businesses.

308
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:35.250
It's the same thing in teams.
And it's the same thing in life.

309
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.630
When we talk about leadership,

310
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.360
we're not just talking about the overall person in charge.

311
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:41.860
We're talking about leadership at every level.
Yeah.

312
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.230
Both sides employed commercial off the shelf technologies for military purposes

313
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.760
be ready for that.
You know,
in,
in Ramadi,
they,

314
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.790
the enemy absolutely huge.
Know a little Motorola walkie talkies.

315
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.680
They had Motorola base station set up.
I mean they were,
they were using it.
Hmm.

316
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.650
Tactical Communications proved very difficult and Graziani again,

317
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.230
you can't change the laws of physics.

318
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.910
And radio waves cannot punch through more than,
you know,
a couple,
two,

319
00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:21.810
three buildings.
So once you get a couple,
two or three buildings away,

320
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.070
you're not going to be able to talk to the other units,
you know,

321
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:29.880
maybe four or five buildings.
And the only way to do it is get on the rooftops.

322
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.350
And so,
you know,

323
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.300
I was almost always on a rooftop cause I was know my main role was usually to

324
00:21:36.301 --> 00:21:40.800
make communications with a various troops that were out there,
army and my guys.

325
00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:45.360
And so I was almost always on a rooftop with a big old antenna sticking off my

326
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.553
shoulder.

327
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

328
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.300
<v 0>And that's when you know,
when one of the guys needed to talk to me,</v>

329
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.340
they knew to go to the rooftop and they'd catch me.

330
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.483
<v 2>Okay.</v>

331
00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.870
<v 0>The cabs of supply trucks must be armored,
no doubt about that.</v>

332
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.570
Bunker busting weapons are invaluable for urban and combat.

333
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.230
This is something that we used a ton of.

334
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.260
Who is the Carl Gustaf 84 millimeter?
Yeah.

335
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

336
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.170
<v 0>Big Thunder</v>

337
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.540
helicopters are not well suited for urban combat.

338
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

339
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.440
<v 0>And there's no doubt about that one.
Again,
in Ramadi,
we found that</v>

340
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.180
anytime helicopters came into Ramadi,

341
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.770
they received so much small arms fire that they left immediately.

342
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.120
It was just too hot for them to go into these situations.

343
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.930
When a helicopter comes in,
what does it take to take down a helicopter?
The UK?

344
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:56.500
I mean,
you could take one round,
right?
It's almost like a human body.
You know,

345
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.990
there's some,
some something you hitting the right spot in the right spot.

346
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:02.260
You could,
you could take it out.
But um,

347
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.160
so it's really hard to put an absolute on that.
But you know,

348
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.260
generally they can take,

349
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.790
they can take some punishment and especially the Apaches which are,
you know,

350
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.870
pretty well armored,

351
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.000
but they're not well armored enough to get in there and do what they would want

352
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:22.350
to do.
Right.
So they end up just taking so many rounds that they leave.

353
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.530
They couldn't,
they couldn't stay.
Yeah.
Like if you hit in that loop,

354
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.000
that that rear propeller,
yeah,
maybe you hit it and the weak spot,

355
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.480
there's gonna be issues,
which I won't talk about.

356
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.040
All right.
Now we,
that was the Marine Corps analysis,
and again,

357
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:44.090
this is all from the same manual,
but I'm going to,
I'm going to go into date.

358
00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:48.890
So they covered what the corps analysis had and now this is the US army infantry

359
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.580
school analysis is Russian army lessons learned from the battle of Grazi.

360
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.550
You need to culturally Orient your forces so you don't end up being your own

361
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:01.970
worst enemy.
Simply out of cultural in ignorance.

362
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.590
Many times Russian soldiers made see serious cultural errors in dealing with the

363
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:11.591
Cheshin civilians once insulted or mistreated the Chechens became active

364
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:16.880
fighters or at least supported the active fighters.

365
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.820
Russians admit they underestimated,

366
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:22.370
they have the effect of religion on the conflict.

367
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.200
So you got to know your enemy and you got to know your friends.

368
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.640
And this is something that they definitely,
uh,

369
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.560
they definitely make that important in the u s military that,
you know,

370
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:37.610
you've got to understand the local culture.

371
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.820
And there was a true hero named Travis Patrick one who we will have to do a show

372
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:45.344
on at some point,

373
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.660
but Dravis Patrick Quinn was with us over in Iraq in Ramadi,

374
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.140
and he was just incredibly smart guy and a former SF guy.

375
00:24:58.521 --> 00:24:58.941
He was,

376
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:03.941
then he became a captain in the army and he spoke Arabic and

377
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.790
he's the guy really that started saying,
look,

378
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:13.820
if this is what we gotta do to make friends with these locals.

379
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.830
And he ended up producing this,

380
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.920
this actually pretty famous PowerPoint brief that just had a bunch of stick

381
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:26.150
figures of,
Hey,
this is the local guy,
this is what he sees you as,

382
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:27.740
this is what you see him as,

383
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.880
but this is what he really is and this is what you know.
And it was a great,
uh,

384
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:36.670
great,
uh,
document,
a very simple document,

385
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.250
brilliant in its simplicity in the way it explained and it,

386
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.240
and it ended up being circulated all over the place.

387
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.050
And that was written by a guy named Travis Patrick Ward who's just again,

388
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.650
hilarious guy,
very nice guy,

389
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.220
and really had a vision of and a full understanding of the Arabic culture,

390
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.230
the tribal culture,
the shakes that were there in Ramadi.

391
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.170
And he did an amazing job moving that whole

392
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.520
scene and that whole piece of the battle.

393
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:21.521
He did an amazing job moving us forward and making sure that we were culturally

394
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:26.990
oriented to understand the locals.

395
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.263
And

396
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:36.080
unfortunately after we left her madi and,
and they were still there,

397
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.650
Captain Patrick when Patrick,

398
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:43.680
when Travis Patrick and was in a vehicle,

399
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
I think it was heading south on a road called sunset and they hit an IED and he

400
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:54.411
was killed in action and it was a tragic loss of an incredible,

401
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.960
not only incredible soldier but just an incredible human.

402
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.330
Someday we'll uh,
we'll go into some more depth about,
about Travis.
Patrick.
Great.

403
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.130
Cause he really had a huge impact.

404
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.140
Next bullet point you need is some way of sorting out combatants from

405
00:27:17.141 --> 00:27:18.400
noncombatants.

406
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.150
The Russians were forced to resort to searching the pockets of civilians for

407
00:27:23.151 --> 00:27:28.151
military equipment and to sniffing them for the smell of gunpowder and gun oil.

408
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.970
This is crude and not very reliable.

409
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.990
Train dogs were used to tack the smell of gunpowder explosives,

410
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:38.260
but we're not always effective.
Nevertheless,

411
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.680
specially trained dogs are probably the best way to determine if a person has

412
00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:43.690
been using explosives or firing a weapon.

413
00:27:43.691 --> 00:27:47.650
Recently what was good for us was,
you know,

414
00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:51.130
working alongside the Iraqi soldiers.
They could tell,

415
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.170
they could tell where people were from,

416
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.520
they could tell where their accent was from.

417
00:27:54.521 --> 00:27:56.320
They could tell with a couple of questions.

418
00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:01.240
Who could tell you're the Iraqi soldiers when we went in to speak to some random

419
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.950
Iraqi civilians.
Yeah.
They could,
they could tell.

420
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.460
I wouldn't be able to tell in a million years.
Right.

421
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.630
Just like if you took an Iraqi and transplanted,

422
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.520
I'm hearing and putting them in a room with a guy from New Jersey and a guy from

423
00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:14.980
southern California and a guy from Georgia,

424
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.850
they wouldn't be able to tell where any of these people will find it,

425
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.710
but any American could talk to any of those three people immediately know where

426
00:28:20.711 --> 00:28:21.770
they were.
Gotcha.

427
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.860
So we use the Iraqi soldiers to help us with that and are also our interpreters.

428
00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:30.000
We had,
you know,
uh,
interpreters that had,

429
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:35.010
were fluent in language and generally came from either Iraq or some other Arabic

430
00:28:35.321 --> 00:28:36.220
speaking country.

431
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.490
And so they had the same knowledge and they could do the same thing.

432
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.433
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

433
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.360
<v 0>The psychological impact of high intensity urban combat is so intense units</v>

434
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:53.410
should maintain a large reserve that will allow them to rotate units in and out

435
00:28:53.411 --> 00:28:56.440
of combat.
If a commander does this,

436
00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.460
he can preserve a unit for a long time.
If he doesn't,

437
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.780
once it gets used up,
it cannot be rebuilt.

438
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.673
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

439
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.460
<v 0>so that statement about the psychological impact of high intensity urban combat,</v>

440
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.660
and there's so many little things that make this true.
You know,

441
00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:29.590
I already talked about the 360 degree threat.
There's the Iud,

442
00:29:29.591 --> 00:29:34.220
there's the civilian populace,
there's the close inviting,

443
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.240
there's all these things that make urban combat the most intense kind of combat

444
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.640
psychologically,

445
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:50.450
and you have to be careful with your troops to make sure that you give them

446
00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:57.051
enough time out of the fight that they can maintain a long deployment in that

447
00:30:00.871 --> 00:30:01.890
sort of intensity

448
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.780
and the Russians did not always do a very good job of that.

449
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.163
<v 2>Okay,</v>

450
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.550
<v 0>next bullet.
Training and discipline are paramount.</v>

451
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.580
You can accomplish nothing without them.

452
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.200
You may need to do the training in the combat zone.

453
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:30.200
Discipline must be demanded once it begins to slip.

454
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.530
The results are disastrous.

455
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.460
That is

456
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
something I believe in across the board.
I think you mentioned that before too,

457
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:54.610
by the way.
I may have mentioned that a few times and there it is.
Again,

458
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:59.200
training and discipline are paramount.
Discipline must be demanded,

459
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.580
one to begins to slip.
The results are disastrous.

460
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.210
You have to hold the line on the discipline you have to.

461
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.500
The Russians were surprised and embarrassed at the degree to which the Chechens

462
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:19.830
exploited the use of cell phones.
Motorola radios,

463
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.070
improvised TV stations,
lightweight video cameras,

464
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:25.710
and the Internet to when the information war,

465
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.510
the Russians admitted that they lost control of the information coming out of

466
00:31:30.511 --> 00:31:33.870
Grazi early in the operation and never regained it.

467
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.480
As expected.

468
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.340
The Russians reiterated the need for large numbers of trained infantry men.

469
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.930
They said that some tasks such as conducting a log pack,

470
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.820
that's logistics operations could only be conducted by infantry men.

471
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.370
The logistical unit soldiers were hopelessly inept at basic military skills such

472
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:07.090
as perimeter defense,
establishing security,
Overwatch and so forth,

473
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.630
and their bet thereby felt easy prey to the Chechens.

474
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.830
So that's something that our troops in America have

475
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:21.390
have really done an outstanding job of adapting to the logistics,

476
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.290
support people being combat ready.

477
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.170
Because every time you're,
you know,
if you're,

478
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:34.171
if you're a supply guy in the army and you got to bring whatever it is,

479
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:38.010
water,
food,
ammunition from Baghdad to Ramadi.
Mm hmm.

480
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.510
That means you're doing a combat patrol.
That means you,

481
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.230
you could likely get attacked.

482
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.460
And so America did a really good job of getting their folks trained up to run

483
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:48.860
these convoys.
And you know,

484
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:53.861
the logistics teams that supplied the war fighters,

485
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.670
the frontline troops,

486
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.850
they came under all kinds of attacks and did an outstanding job.

487
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:03.510
So all you folks that are listening that were running those logistics Kahn

488
00:33:03.511 --> 00:33:07.040
voice,
thank you.
And you did an outstanding job.

489
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:10.820
And I know there's huge risk every time you rolled out the front gate.

490
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.120
Next bullet,

491
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.720
they found that boundaries between units were still tactical weak points,

492
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.500
but that it wasn't just horizontal battery boundaries that they had to worry

493
00:33:26.501 --> 00:33:27.334
about.

494
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:31.600
In some cases the [inaudible] held the third floor and above,

495
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.200
while the Russians held the first two floors.
And sometimes the roof,

496
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.090
if a unit holding the second floor evacuated parts of it without telling the

497
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:41.350
unit on the ground floor,

498
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.150
the Chechens would move troops in an attack the ground four unit through the

499
00:33:46.151 --> 00:33:46.984
ceiling.

500
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:51.370
Often this resulted in fratricide is the ground floor to unit responded with

501
00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:56.050
uncontrolled fire through all of the ceilings,
including the ones below.

502
00:33:56.051 --> 00:34:01.051
That section of the building still occupied by the Russians and tire battles

503
00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:04.000
were fought through floors,
ceilings,

504
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.730
and walls without visual contact.

505
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.510
That's gotta be scary,
right?
Yeah.

506
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.270
Ambushes were common.
Sometimes they actually had three tiers.

507
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.890
Chechens would be underground on the ground for and on the roof.

508
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.190
Each group had a different task in the ambush.

509
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.100
The most common response by the Chechens to the increasingly powerful Russian

510
00:34:36.101 --> 00:34:36.760
indirect,

511
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.760
Ariel indirect and Ariel firepower was hugging the Russian unit.

512
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.860
The hugging tactics because the Russians,
sorry if the hugging tactic,

513
00:34:47.861 --> 00:34:51.190
because the Russians to cease artillery and air fires,

514
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:56.460
it became a man to man fight and the Chechens we're well equipped to win it if

515
00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:59.230
they didn't cease the supporting fires.

516
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:03.130
The Russian units suffered just as much as the Cheshin fighters did.

517
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:08.190
Sometimes even more and the morale effect was much worse on the Russians.

518
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:17.370
So there's,
I mean it's very simple.
Go.

519
00:35:17.371 --> 00:35:17.790
If the,

520
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.270
if the enemy is going to use or if the Russians are going to use big bombs and

521
00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:24.840
big artillery and big bombs from the sky to to defeat us,

522
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.730
we'll just get so close in.

523
00:35:26.731 --> 00:35:30.300
We'll just close the distance and be so close that if you want to drop bombs,

524
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.440
you're going to kill your own people.

525
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.180
Both

526
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:43.130
<v 1>the physical and mental health of the Russian units began to decline almost</v>

527
00:35:43.131 --> 00:35:46.940
immediately upon initiation of high intensity combat.

528
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.700
In less than a month,

529
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.760
almost 20% of the Russian soldiers were suffering from viral hepatitis,

530
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.570
which is a very serious depilling debilitating with slow recovery.

531
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.500
Most had chronic diarrhea and upper respiratory infections that turned to

532
00:36:05.811 --> 00:36:10.610
pneumonia easily.
This was blamed on the breakdown of logistical support.

533
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:15.410
That meant units had to drink contaminated water
unit.

534
00:36:15.411 --> 00:36:18.890
Sanitary discipline broke down almost completely.

535
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.170
<v 0>So that discipline,
like I said,</v>

536
00:36:24.171 --> 00:36:26.090
it starts with the shaving and the next thing you don't,

537
00:36:26.091 --> 00:36:27.070
you're not boiling your water.

538
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.300
The next thing you know you're sick and the next thing you know you're crapping

539
00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:31.010
all over the place and next thing you know other people,

540
00:36:31.011 --> 00:36:34.430
you're making other people sick and it starts with the discipline.

541
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

542
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.890
<v 0>According to a survey of over 1300 troops is a Russian troops made immediately</v>

543
00:36:45.591 --> 00:36:46.700
after the fighting,

544
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:51.020
about 72% had some sort of psychological disorder.

545
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.860
Almost 75% had an exaggerated startle response that that's like when there's a

546
00:36:57.681 --> 00:36:59.090
loud noise in your shutter.
From It,

547
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.920
about 75% had an exaggerated startle response.

548
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.590
28% had what was described as neuro emotional and almost 10% had acute emotional

549
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:13.760
reactions.

550
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.880
The Russians recommended to psycho physiologists,

551
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.250
one psychopharmacologists,

552
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:27.430
one psychiatrist and one medical psychologist at each u s Corp sized unit.

553
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.570
That's a huge recommendation from mental health.

554
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.790
Although their experience in Afghanistan prepared them somewhat for the physical

555
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:38.720
health problems.

556
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.080
They were not prepared for this level of mental health treatment.

557
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.840
Many permanent combat stress casualties resulted from soldiers not being

558
00:37:47.841 --> 00:37:50.780
provided proper immediate treatment.

559
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.133
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.361
<v 0>Again,</v>

561
00:37:56.361 --> 00:38:01.361
this boils down to how harsh that urban combat is and they were not ready for

562
00:38:04.851 --> 00:38:05.330
it.

563
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:10.330
They will not ready for the psychological damage that that urban combat does

564
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.300
to the soldier's mind.

565
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.550
How it gets in the head and you've got the startle response and the emotional

566
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:23.960
acute reactions.
It's a nightmare.
It's a nightmare.

567
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.400
That acute emotional reactions,
that's like,
like what the break down,

568
00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:30.930
breaking down,
breaking down thing.

569
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.640
Chechens afraid of tanks or BMPS and BNP is like a Bradley fighting vehicle.

570
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:45.610
It's basically an armored personnel character carrier for the most part with a

571
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:46.510
big gun on top.

572
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.890
They assigned groups of RPG gunners to fire volleys at the lead and trail

573
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:57.610
vehicles.
Once these were destroyed,
others were picked off one by one.

574
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.090
Oh,
this is battle Grazi some facts.

575
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:06.450
The Russian forces oss 20 of 26 tanks 102 have 120 bmps in the first three days

576
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:13.560
of fighting.
Yeah.

577
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.390
So imagine you've got a convoy of 12 vehicles with a tank in the front of the

578
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:23.170
tank in the back and the Chechens take out the front and back.
So now what?

579
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:23.711
Now guess what,

580
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:27.040
your stock and then they just sit there and pick off the rest of the vehicles.

581
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.150
Ducks,
Chet.
This is also

582
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:32.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

583
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.450
<v 0>Important.</v>

584
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.070
Cheshin chose firing positions high enough or low enough to stay out of the

585
00:39:38.071 --> 00:39:41.920
fields of fire of the tank and BMP weapons.
So you know the,

586
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.420
the angle of fire can only go so high and so low.

587
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.300
So they just stayed out of those two angles.

588
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.200
Russian conscript,

589
00:39:54.201 --> 00:39:59.201
infantry sometimes refuse to dismount and often died in their BMP without ever

590
00:40:00.351 --> 00:40:01.730
firing a shot.

591
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.920
<v 1>Okay,</v>

592
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.360
<v 0>so this is a,
this is a nightmare.
Your vehicle gets hit and if you know anything,</v>

593
00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.310
when your vehicle gets hit or like your convoy gets hit,
get out.

594
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.650
In other words,
you have to vehicle can't move,

595
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.580
right because it's trapped by other vehicles are trapped by the road or it's

596
00:40:19.581 --> 00:40:21.440
trapped,
whatever.
Get out of the vehicle,

597
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.720
get out of the vehicle and take down a building,

598
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.040
get out of the vehicle and move to cover.
Get Out,
but get out of the vehicle,

599
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.950
the vehicles,
just a bullet magnet at that point and an RPG magnet.

600
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:36.440
So just get out of their Russian elite infantry did much better but didn't

601
00:40:36.441 --> 00:40:39.350
coordinate well with armored vehicles initially.

602
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:46.670
So I can tell you that we coordinated with the armored vehicles beautifully and

603
00:40:46.771 --> 00:40:48.000
we loved them.

604
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.780
We loved the U s army armor that we work with,

605
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:58.200
absolutely loved them and we coordinated with them and we worked together with

606
00:40:58.201 --> 00:41:00.540
them in a beautiful manner.

607
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.330
Chechens were brutish,
especially with prisoners.

608
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.510
Some reports say the Russians were no better,

609
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.530
but most say that the Chechens were the worst of the two sides.

610
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.420
Whoever was at fault,

611
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.990
the battle degenerated quickly to one of no quarter asked none given,

612
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:25.360
<v 1>okay,</v>

613
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.360
<v 0>Russian wounded and dead were hung upside down in the windows have defended</v>

614
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:32.230
gestion positions.

615
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.550
Russians had to shoot at the bodies to engage the Chechens.

616
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.600
Russian prisoners were decapitated and at night their heads were placed on

617
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:49.181
stakes beside the roads leading into the city over which Russian replacements

618
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.950
and reinforcements had to travel.

619
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.660
So you know,
you don't think of that in this day and age.

620
00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.810
That's something you hear you read about in the history books,

621
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.290
you remember from the history books.
But there it is.

622
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.770
And this is 1994,
1995,

623
00:42:13.771 --> 00:42:18.180
1996 heads on stakes,

624
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.290
both Russian and Cheshin dead or routinely booby trapped.

625
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:34.360
The Russians were not surprised by the ferocity and brutality of the Chechens,

626
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.740
but they were surprised by the sophistication of the Cheshin you use of booby

627
00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:45.730
traps and minds,
Chechens mind and booby trapped.

628
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.820
Everything showing excellent insight into the actions and reactions of the

629
00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:53.290
average Russian soldier.

630
00:42:55.510 --> 00:43:00.130
Mine and booby trap awareness was hard to maintain and it's,

631
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.840
as you look at this more,
I mean they,
they booby trapped.
Anything that WWE,

632
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.090
they talk about,
um,
how they showed insight into the actions and reactions.

633
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.710
The average Russian soldier,
they knew what would attract them.

634
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.740
They knew what they couldn't keep their hands off of and that's what they'd

635
00:43:14.741 --> 00:43:17.280
booby trap some old shiny objects,

636
00:43:17.281 --> 00:43:20.850
a little something that looked expensive or something that looked worthwhile.

637
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.180
It was booby trapped.

638
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.440
Now that kind of wraps up that first book,

639
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.410
but I pulled out some other little articles that I thought had some good

640
00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:38.390
information.
This one,

641
00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:43.391
here's Russian tactical lessons learned from fighting Cheshin separatists by

642
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.130
Timothy L.
Thomas.

643
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:49.953
This section

644
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.500
with regard to general ambush guidance.

645
00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.860
Kozloff offered the following.

646
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

647
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.830
<v 0>First and foremost,</v>

648
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.540
mobilize your will knowledge and experience.

649
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.030
No matter how difficult this may be,

650
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:16.160
in order to reestablish command and control,
repost the enemy attack,

651
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.280
seize the initiative and report the situation

652
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.200
that that is an,

653
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.690
that is a powerful statement and it's a powerful statement on how to react to

654
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:32.280
any situation.
First and foremost,

655
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.260
<v 3>mobilize your will.</v>

656
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.443
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

657
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:46.030
<v 3>I love envisioning the will as like a military unit.</v>

658
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.500
First and foremost,
mobilize your will.

659
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.790
Bring it to bear.
Wake up.
We'll it's time to get it on.

660
00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:01.150
<v 4>Yeah.
In college and football,
they'd say,
well,
I'm,
I heard this other places do,</v>

661
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:05.140
but they'd say,
buckle up in cart.
Your grill can,
what was it?

662
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:10.170
Buckle up and guard your grill.
Yeah.
So it's like,
you know,
get ready to,

663
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.933
to go

664
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.860
<v 3>mobilize your will,
your knowledge and experience,</v>

665
00:45:14.861 --> 00:45:17.280
no matter how difficult this Ma,

666
00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:22.150
maybe in order to reestablish command and control.

667
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.310
So you've lost it.
It's saying mobilize your will.

668
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:31.430
Reestablish Command and control Rep.
Polst the enemy.
Attacked,

669
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:34.550
seize the initiative and report the situation.

670
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:40.230
Has some damn good advice.
Some damn good advice.

671
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.300
Moral psychological support also was a training area for improvement of

672
00:45:50.111 --> 00:45:51.040
particular concern.

673
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:56.041
Here we're the mood swings that were observed among Russian servicemen during

674
00:45:56.891 --> 00:45:57.724
combat.

675
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.940
So you seen these drastic mood swings and and so much of this was psychological

676
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:11.430
on the Russians and Russians are hard people.
Yeah.
Cause I mean we're not,

677
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.390
we're not talking about soft people.
These are Russians.

678
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.250
I mean Russians are hard people.

679
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.300
The end result of such training would be to improve the servicemen,

680
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:22.590
his fighting spirit.

681
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.220
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.400
<v 3>Use of common sense and rationale to overcome confusion,</v>

683
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:32.230
the ability to act Bowlby actively and decisively in battle and the ability to

684
00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:35.830
achieve one's assigned goal.
Again,

685
00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.940
this is a talking about training the mind to think,

686
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.420
do,
use common sentence,
what you want to do with all your people.

687
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:47.810
I don't care what business you're in,
whether you're in a war,

688
00:46:47.811 --> 00:46:51.500
whether you're in business,
whether you're in some kind of team.

689
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:53.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

690
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.150
<v 3>Train the mind to use common sense.</v>

691
00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:03.290
Drain the mind for the ability to act boldly and decisively.

692
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.130
Got to train the mind.
You've got to free your mind.

693
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.843
<v 4>Now,</v>

694
00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:23.310
<v 3>that same article pulled out Russian lesson learned from Spitz knots,</v>

695
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.260
Gru reconnaissance point of view,

696
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:33.340
<v 0>and the authors were k nicotine and s Kozloff.</v>

697
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.990
They called this one section the commandments for servicemen and Chechnya,

698
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:50.570
and what they actually were was cultural tips on cultural sensitivities for

699
00:47:50.571 --> 00:47:53.900
Russian soldiers and they are as falls,
and when I read through these,

700
00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:01.390
this is a directive on how to treat other human beings that you're dealing with

701
00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:07.040
Cheshin,
Russian,
American,
subordinate,

702
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:09.860
superior,
doesn't matter.
What was the title of that?
Again,

703
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.240
tips on cultural sensitivities for Russian soldiers.

704
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.670
One,
always maintain your authority among the local populace.

705
00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.880
That sessions are very critical of people who try to create a false authority

706
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.840
for themselves.

707
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.830
A sole cold,

708
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.210
patronizing attitude towards others usually afflicts those who cannot gain

709
00:48:35.211 --> 00:48:39.320
authority through other means.
We talk about this all the time.

710
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.990
You don't run around throwing your rank out,

711
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:45.740
make you look like a jackass.

712
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.123
<v 2>Okay,</v>

713
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.773
<v 0>next,</v>

714
00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:56.400
avoid unwarranted compensation as an uninformed unlawful requisitions of food

715
00:48:56.401 --> 00:49:00.180
and property.
That one makes pretty easy sense.

716
00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:04.320
Don't steal from people.
Next one,
be fair.

717
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.360
Every local inhabit.

718
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:11.390
It must be dealt with firmly but fairly injustice gives rise to negative

719
00:49:11.791 --> 00:49:13.350
attitude in any person.

720
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.490
So be fair.

721
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.800
Reward a Cheshin who performs as a ta assigned task.

722
00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:29.580
Well to accomplish a task that you need to get accomplished,

723
00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:33.480
choose the most authoritative person among the local inhabitants and get him to

724
00:49:33.481 --> 00:49:34.590
carry out the task.

725
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.760
If he does the job right and does it quickly,

726
00:49:38.761 --> 00:49:41.910
you should reward the elder by giving him additional authority and by giving

727
00:49:41.911 --> 00:49:43.140
them some kind of gift.

728
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.640
Reward your people when they do a good job.

729
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.460
It's all we're saying here

730
00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.700
when dealing with Cheshin,
this display a calm,
a display,

731
00:49:56.701 --> 00:49:58.740
a sense of calm and self worth,

732
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.270
you will achieve more through this then through screaming obscenity.

733
00:50:02.271 --> 00:50:04.940
Absurdities never beat a Cheshire

734
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.430
and it goes on to say Chechens are a proud people with a very intense sense of

735
00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:12.540
pride in self worth.

736
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.120
Therefore you will achieve nothing by humiliating them,

737
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.240
by screaming at them and by abusing them you will only in bitter them,

738
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.060
right?
This

739
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.870
<v 2>is how you treat other people.
And it goes on to say,</v>

740
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.460
even in casual conversation,

741
00:50:33.461 --> 00:50:37.900
do not give orders and do not use profanity that you might normally use as

742
00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:39.820
interjection.
I interjections

743
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.750
<v 0>so this idea of yelling and screaming and you think you're going to,</v>

744
00:50:46.751 --> 00:50:49.210
people will do what you want them to do,
doesn't work.

745
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.550
Next,
respect.
[inaudible] women,
girls,

746
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.070
old men and children as if they were Russians.

747
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.810
Always remember that Chechens respect manly qualities therefore never permit any

748
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:08.770
disrespect of vulgarity with regard to their women.

749
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:15.520
Never allow yourself to curse at defenseless people in revenge for the outrages

750
00:51:15.521 --> 00:51:19.030
of militants against Russian women,
old men and children.

751
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.260
So keep yourself in check and made sure you're not blaming people for something

752
00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:26.220
that somebody else did.

753
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.180
Studying.
Be respectful of national traditions.

754
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.720
The more you know about the Chechens national traditions,

755
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.980
the more you will understand their behavior.

756
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.400
That means you will be able to predict their actions at the same time.

757
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:51.230
A person that respects the local traditions will be respected himself.
Gee,

758
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.020
what a novel idea.
Know who you're dealing with.

759
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.510
Respect what they do.

760
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.010
Always remember that the above mentioned commandments apply to the fullest

761
00:52:11.011 --> 00:52:16.011
extent possible to local inhabitance and they do not apply at all to the

762
00:52:16.891 --> 00:52:17.820
militants.

763
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.250
Never forget you are in a region where there are insurgents against whom you are

764
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:24.090
at war.

765
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.440
Therefore you can never be certain that the person with whom you are speaking is

766
00:52:28.441 --> 00:52:30.210
not helping the militants

767
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.320
under conditions of guerrilla warfare is better to turn down an invitation into

768
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:40.190
someone's home and risk offending the host than it is to take advantage of is

769
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:44.540
hospitality and ending up being an easy catch for insurgents.

770
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:52.371
Again,

771
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:56.900
I think those were just like rules on how to treat other human beings in the

772
00:52:56.901 --> 00:52:58.370
world and be successful.

773
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.170
Now we get to a,
uh,

774
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.100
another little excerpt that I found and this is from

775
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.160
sole dot.
Who Daci,
which is a basically to magazine.

776
00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:15.590
It's almost like a soldier of Fortune magazine.

777
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.043
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.450
<v 0>And he,
these are where some of the,</v>

779
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.940
some of the rules for a soldier and a zone of armed conflict

780
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.720
fighters can be anywhere posing as peaceful citizens in the daytime and changing

781
00:53:29.721 --> 00:53:30.860
into killers at night.

782
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:35.840
Don't accept someone's friendly just because they speak Russian and wear

783
00:53:35.841 --> 00:53:40.130
camouflage.
Close is perhaps my favorite one right here.

784
00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.950
You don't get a second chance in war time.

785
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:50.100
Never lose the feeling of danger or of the strength of the spirit of the Russian

786
00:53:50.471 --> 00:53:55.330
soldier.
Never leave a base without the commanders permission in the field.

787
00:53:55.331 --> 00:53:59.110
Never touch bright or expensive objects as they may be mind.

788
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

789
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.260
<v 0>In the mountains,
whoever is higher is stronger.</v>

790
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.700
Take the high ground or the high ground is going to take you.

791
00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.820
Pay attention to the flanks.

792
00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:20.170
Has the basic maneuver of the insurgence is to get around your back and envelop

793
00:54:20.171 --> 00:54:23.260
your force.
Always check your flanks.

794
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.050
I'm going to burn through some of these now.

795
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:32.260
These are tactical observations from the Graziani combat experience by Brett.

796
00:54:33.441 --> 00:54:34.910
See Jenkinson,

797
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.570
who is a major in the U s army.

798
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.730
He wrote a really good article worth checking out Google it,

799
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.090
but I broke down some of these

800
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.870
Cheshin lessons learned.
This is from the Cheshin side.

801
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.400
Hit and run tactics confused.

802
00:54:55.401 --> 00:55:00.401
The Russian units targeting Russian radio operators destroyed Russian command

803
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:05.890
and control small units provided good mobility and weren't effective.

804
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.740
Basic maneuver unit
hugging,

805
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:15.700
which we already talked about,
which was staying 50 to 250 meters of the enemy.

806
00:55:15.701 --> 00:55:18.120
It was the most effective way to avoid enemy artillery,

807
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.310
mortars or close air support.

808
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:27.110
Synchronize the ambushes confused the enemy to the point that he did not know

809
00:55:27.111 --> 00:55:30.710
where to shoot back as a result,
Russian.

810
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:31.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

811
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.240
<v 0>Units would start firefights between themselves.</v>

812
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.510
He's throwing the lead and train vehicles and then each vehicle in between could

813
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:46.210
easily isolate Russian armored columns.

814
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:52.470
Shooting enemy soldiers in the legs caused snipers to engage other soldiers

815
00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.600
trying to evacuate the wounded.

816
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

817
00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.140
<v 0>And on leadership,</v>

818
00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:04.170
a loosely organized unit that allowed greater freedom of action was effective to

819
00:56:04.301 --> 00:56:05.560
defend Graziani.

820
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.200
Little bit of freedom on the battlefield goes a long way.

821
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.350
Now the Russian lessons learned training and preparation of the most important

822
00:56:14.351 --> 00:56:15.550
thing in winning battles.

823
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:19.390
Urban combat training must be longer than days or weeks to be effective.

824
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.833
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

825
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.810
<v 0>Urban combat must be tailored to fit the enemy's situation.</v>

826
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

827
00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:33.110
<v 0>Task organizing to small squad sized combined to salt groups worked better than</v>

828
00:56:33.121 --> 00:56:34.350
large units.

829
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:39.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

830
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.280
<v 0>Russians underestimated the Cheshin will to fight</v>

831
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.720
lessons learned from successful tactics should be integrated into fall on

832
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:53.000
missions to be successful.

833
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.730
One must adapt quicker than the enemy.

834
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

835
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:05.190
<v 0>For the leadership perspective,
again,</v>

836
00:57:05.191 --> 00:57:09.300
this is the Russians adapted lessons learned from previous urban battles provide

837
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.860
proved invaluable.

838
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:15.510
The greatest challenge to leadership was maintaining morale.

839
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.220
High casualty rates destroyed the already low morale of combat units.

840
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.140
Another challenge to morale was the Russian soldiers.

841
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.110
Fear of enemy mistreatment if captured,

842
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:35.880
and this is an important one of failure to justify the nature of Russian

843
00:57:35.881 --> 00:57:39.990
military intervention in Chechnya resulted in low morale,

844
00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:43.860
so the troops on the ground not knowing and not understanding why they were

845
00:57:43.861 --> 00:57:46.680
there and not understanding the strategic and important are the vision,

846
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.870
hurt their morale.
Big Time.

847
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.930
Now I have a couple excerpts here from,

848
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.960
this is from an article that was in the La Times January 13th,

849
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.650
1995 by Sony F Ron.

850
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

851
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:09.420
<v 0>Captured Russian soldiers paint bleak picture of Cheshin conditions.</v>

852
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:15.000
So this is Grazia Graziani,
Russia,

853
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.860
Russian troop morale is so low.

854
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:20.700
Conditions are so poor in losses are so heavy that the rush attempt to take Razi

855
00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:24.870
is floundering to Russian soldiers.
Captured in the capital of the breakaway.

856
00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:29.580
Republic of Chechnya said Thursday the soldiers are against this war.

857
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.350
And so our commanders

858
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:37.350
said Alexia 20 year old junior sergeant was caught while trying to steal food

859
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:39.150
from an empty house and grounds me after you're gone.

860
00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:43.530
Five days without a say solid meal,
we are forced to fight.

861
00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:48.240
The two soldiers said Russian positions had frequently been bombed by Russian

862
00:58:48.241 --> 00:58:49.170
war planes.

863
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:53.610
Many soldiers had been killed by friendly fire from the Russian side and

864
00:58:53.611 --> 00:58:57.630
constant vehicle breakdowns made it impossible for them to pick up their dead

865
00:58:57.631 --> 00:58:58.500
and wounded.

866
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:07.680
And this is I,
I haven't found the book yet and I'm sure I will.

867
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.280
The book that takes you into the battle onto the ground,

868
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:14.970
cause I've been talking to all the strategic stuff and generally I don't like to

869
00:59:14.971 --> 00:59:17.610
do that.
I want to hear from the person on the ground

870
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:23.060
and this is where you start to get it.
You start to see what the Russians,

871
00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.340
what the frontline troopers were thinking and what it was like for them.

872
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.510
And here you had him saying that many soldiers had been killed by friendly fire

873
00:59:32.511 --> 00:59:33.860
from the Russian side.

874
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:39.230
Constant vehicle breakdowns made it impossible for them to pick up their dead

875
00:59:39.231 --> 00:59:43.540
and wounded
in a company that had a hundred men.

876
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.560
Now they're only 50 left in our battalion.

877
00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:51.820
Out of 350 men,
over 250 had been killed.

878
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.160
The soldiers accounts indicate that the new official figures putting the Russian

879
00:59:57.161 --> 01:00:01.750
military death toll at 394 soldiers are vastly understated.

880
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.770
Cheshin sources put the Russian casualties at about 3000 dead.

881
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.980
These Russians are worse than fascists.

882
01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:15.150
Said Gregory a smear NOFX 50 who's beloved.

883
01:00:15.151 --> 01:00:19.650
Cherry tree was decapitated by the rocket for young guys have been killed in our

884
01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:22.230
street.
They weren't fighters,
they weren't against anyone.

885
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.010
I apologize for what Russia is doing here.
Smirnoff said,

886
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.800
I'm embarrassed by my country in front of the whole world.

887
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.750
A month after President Boris Yeltsin promise the Russian public that law and

888
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:40.340
order would be restored and Chechnya and that the illegal armed formations in

889
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:42.170
Grozny would quickly be disarmed.

890
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.900
It was unclear whether Russian forces could soon breakthrough the fierce cheshin

891
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.790
resistance.

892
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:53.000
I don't think they can take the city said one Cheshin fighter,

893
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.360
they can destroy it but they can't capture it.

894
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.890
The two Russian prisoners who had entered Grazia on December 20th looked

895
01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.740
exhausted,
filthy and frightened.

896
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.770
If their condition is typical of the rest of the enemy.

897
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.030
It is not surprising that the Russians have not yet attempted another all out of

898
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:15.240
infantry assault on Graziani.
Frankly,

899
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.350
there is no discipline,
no anything in the military.

900
01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:22.920
Now the prisoner said the soldiers are weakened.

901
01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.810
They haven't washed for a long time.
They are hungry and unshaven.

902
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.350
Even a soldier when he wants to describe how bad things have gotten,

903
01:01:34.351 --> 01:01:38.610
he says that the soldiers are dirty,
hungry,
and unshaven.

904
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:43.890
There were times where more of us were getting killed by our own people than by

905
01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:48.540
the Chechens.
We don't even have time to pick up our dead.
Just no time.

906
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:49.171
We're eating,

907
01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:53.790
fighting the Cheshin or our own air force is bombing us.

908
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.860
A prisoner added that they'd been ordered to kill everybody from kids to old

909
01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:02.370
people,
not just [inaudible] but also Russians.

910
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.170
This is a nightmare.

911
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.970
The two soldiers said they went into a house,

912
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:12.360
northeast Grazi neighborhood to look for food because they hadn't had a proper

913
01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:14.010
meal for five days.

914
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.330
They've been surviving on dry rations that were never enough and were delivered

915
01:02:18.331 --> 01:02:22.500
to their posh positions irregularly.
As the prisoner spoke,

916
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:25.110
Cheshin fighters gathered around them to listen upon hearing.

917
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.210
The Russians admit that they had broken into the house.

918
01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.150
One man shouted angrily looters.

919
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.690
<v 2>Okay,</v>

920
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:36.390
<v 0>oh we wanted to have something to eat.
Modern the prisoner</v>

921
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.813
now.

922
01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.473
<v 2>Okay,</v>

923
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.060
<v 0>we got to remember we've got up,
you know,
this is the,</v>

924
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.070
this is the Soviet Union.
This is Russia.

925
01:02:48.071 --> 01:02:51.700
So they have their own media and I found this article

926
01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.080
and I'm,
I shouldn't be laughing cause it's,
it's,
it's horrible.

927
01:02:56.081 --> 01:02:59.670
But this is the Moscow Times talking about the other story of Grosse knee.

928
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.290
The city of Grazia is cold and dirty.
Again,

929
01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:06.730
this is some kind of a state approved message.

930
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:09.010
There is no water,
no electricity at night.

931
01:03:09.011 --> 01:03:12.160
The streets are illuminated only by distant fires sparked by Russian shelling

932
01:03:12.161 --> 01:03:15.370
and the occasional flares here is full of sound,

933
01:03:15.371 --> 01:03:17.830
constantly thumping of artillery shells,

934
01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:21.130
the screams of Grad missiles and crackle of machine gun fire.

935
01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.480
The only source of heat and the burned out basements of draws near from homemade

936
01:03:25.481 --> 01:03:30.130
furnaces that Russian soldiers at fashion from bricks of destroyed buildings at

937
01:03:30.131 --> 01:03:32.500
night.
Officers and soldiers huddle around them,

938
01:03:32.501 --> 01:03:35.680
their faces dirtied and covered with sweat since they are really have water with

939
01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:40.600
which to wash it and almost looks like they are wearing the kind of camouflage

940
01:03:40.601 --> 01:03:44.140
paint that is issued to soldiers in western armies.

941
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:48.340
These men are by and large normal decent to people.

942
01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.120
They believe that they are doing their duty in Chechnya.

943
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.750
That's a little bit contrary to what we just heard from the prisoners.

944
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:55.810
So of course now the prisoners,

945
01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:00.460
those guys are in a dress situation too cause there might get their heads

946
01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:01.570
chopped off at any moment.

947
01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:05.530
So they're probably making the case the best they can that,
hey,
you know,

948
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.470
we're not in supported Russia.
They're just trying to stay alive.

949
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.900
They insist the back to the article.

950
01:04:10.901 --> 01:04:13.540
They insist they do not intentionally attack peaceful civilians.

951
01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:17.260
Butter instead waging battle against an organizing pitiless enemy,

952
01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280
the conscripts who are risking their lives and Chechnya might as well be

953
01:04:21.281 --> 01:04:22.780
considered volunteers.

954
01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.893
<v 2>Okay,</v>

955
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.490
<v 0>this is the paper,
you know,
saying that these poor guys that are fighting,</v>

956
01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.310
they should be considered volunteers even though they're con scripts that are

957
01:04:32.311 --> 01:04:35.700
being forced to fight there.
They might as well be considered volunteers.

958
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.310
Russia is not declared a war or martial law,

959
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.960
so nothing threatens deserters except the moral condemnation of the comrades

960
01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:44.040
they leave behind.

961
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.680
The army's morale has been steadily improving as it becomes more experienced in

962
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:55.340
street fighting.
Again,

963
01:04:55.341 --> 01:05:00.341
there's countless documented cases of the morale completely falling apart and

964
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:03.920
being one of the premier causes of a loss of the battle.

965
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:10.540
It's casualty rate is falling and is able to inflict increasing punishment on

966
01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:11.830
the Cheshin fighters.

967
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:16.270
The military is confident of victory among the soldiers.

968
01:05:16.271 --> 01:05:20.050
You hear a different about the war than what you read in Moscow.

969
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:25.850
Many reports in the media about Chechnya campaign or obviously biased against

970
01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:28.730
the military.
Some may even be censored.

971
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:32.000
When I was in Chesney on January 22nd,

972
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:36.170
a crew from Russian television was in Graziani shooting report for the evening

973
01:05:36.171 --> 01:05:37.070
news program.

974
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.510
The report included graphic footage of the bodies of Russian soldiers who had

975
01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:44.030
been mutilated by the Chechens.
However,

976
01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:48.740
the host of the program refuse to error without even seeing it.
Of course,

977
01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:51.770
only a fraction of the Russian army is fighting in Chechnya,

978
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:56.960
but they'd been sent here there from virtually every military district in the

979
01:05:56.961 --> 01:05:57.794
country.

980
01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.880
Eventually they will return to their bases and tell their stories to the rest of

981
01:06:02.881 --> 01:06:07.680
their comrades in arms and those soldiers will put a lot more stock and what the

982
01:06:07.681 --> 01:06:12.681
Cheshin Chechnya veterans have to say than they will at any press reports or

983
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:15.150
human rights activists.

984
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.330
So there's the,
uh,

985
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.560
the official Russian version.
Brutal.

986
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.630
In your experience,
does that ever happen here?
Like look,

987
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.900
your stuff in the media and you're like,
Dang,
that's,
that's not,
oh yeah,

988
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.700
it happens.
It definitely happens here.
There's no doubt about that.
Um,

989
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.470
the way that the media portrays things is,
is very wrong.

990
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.510
You know,
often very wrong.

991
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.990
I think one of the classics that I've been telling lately are talking about

992
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:51.940
lately is that they,

993
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.600
they never portray the Iraqi people as normal human beings that just want to

994
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:00.100
live normal lives.

995
01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.030
They never portray the Iraqi people like that

996
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.610
when that's what they are.

997
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:12.750
The vast majority of Iraqi people are normal people that want to have a job,

998
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:16.510
raise their kids,
let their kids go to school,
improve their lives,
do better.

999
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.610
That's what the vast majority of Iraqi people want.
But you know,
when,

1000
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:26.611
when's the last time you saw an American family on the news that was going to

1001
01:07:29.471 --> 01:07:33.760
the store to go grocery shopping and then come home and do some yard work in the

1002
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:36.390
afternoon?
Right?
No,
they don't show that because it's not news.

1003
01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:41.770
And it's the same thing in Iraq.
They don't show that.
Yeah.

1004
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:46.960
So we always get this impression that you know that everyone in Iraq is some

1005
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:51.550
kind of militant or they're just tired of us being,
yeah,
that's not true.

1006
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:54.040
Not True at all.
Interested.

1007
01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.120
So that's one of the biggest points I can think of where the media comm just to,

1008
01:07:58.121 --> 01:07:59.260
they just get it wrong.

1009
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:04.510
They just get it wrong and it really leaves people in America thinking will of

1010
01:08:04.511 --> 01:08:07.720
God,
why are we there?
It's so crazy that we would do we,

1011
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.300
you know why they don't want us there?
No,
actually they do want us there.

1012
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:14.320
But you don't show those people.
You show the protesters because that's news.

1013
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:16.040
It's not news

1014
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.140
<v 4>to interview someone that says,
yeah it's great having the Americans here.</v>

1015
01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:20.600
Hopefully they can maintain the peace.
That's not news.
Yeah.

1016
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:25.100
Isn't that crazy how it,
sure.
That's not news.
And that kind of makes sense.

1017
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.980
You know,
what are you,
why would you report on an American family?
You just,

1018
01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:30.510
you know,
the dad went to work.
You want to report on that,
cause that's not news.

1019
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:31.880
So that makes sense.

1020
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.240
But the fact that you're not reporting everyday stuff is essentially changing

1021
01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:41.090
the,
the accurate message into a message that's inaccurate,
then that's something,

1022
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:41.924
you know.
Yeah,

1023
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:46.250
<v 0>it is.
It is.
It's uh,
it's horrible.</v>

1024
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.260
It's horrible to see.

1025
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.490
This is just another little section.

1026
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:57.080
The Russian counterinsurgency operation in Chechnya,

1027
01:08:57.081 --> 01:09:01.730
part one,
a winning the battle,
losing the war by Matthew in

1028
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:08.410
Genco RPG and sniper fire focused on unexposed Russian troops.

1029
01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:14.330
Small groups of 10 to 20 Cheshin fighters moved in and out of buildings and the

1030
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:18.500
surrounding mountains to engage heavily armed and armored Russian troops.

1031
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:24.500
The Cheshin teams would attack and shifts some attacking while the others

1032
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:25.100
rested.

1033
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:30.100
So that a force of no more than 50 held entire battalions at bay bottleneck in

1034
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:35.480
the narrow streets and cities or the trefle tremor or the treacherous deaf lays

1035
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:36.410
of the mountains,

1036
01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:42.050
chess and utilization of information and space and they're highly sophisticated

1037
01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:45.740
networking allowed them a tremendous advantage in terms of physical combat and

1038
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.390
even more important advantage in terms of psychological impact on their enemy

1039
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:55.850
rather than a group of Ragtag and surgeon fighters fueled by hatred and national

1040
01:09:55.851 --> 01:10:00.170
fanaticism that Cheshin fighters were highly trained,
disciplined,

1041
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:03.170
well equipped and knowledgeable of the terrain.

1042
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:05.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1043
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.790
<v 0>From the individual up through the army level,</v>

1044
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.750
the Chechens held the advantage in all but air power and fire support.

1045
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:14.510
And we already talked about how they overcame that.

1046
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.690
The Cheshin fighters proved better,
trained,
equipped,

1047
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.770
technically skilled and fed and demonstrated remarkably higher morale and

1048
01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:26.210
motivation in addition to an intimate knowledge of the hazardous terrain.

1049
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:27.703
So it's inquiry,

1050
01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.660
it's just incredible how over and over again they point out on both sides how

1051
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:37.190
big of a factor Miralis.
So if you're in a leadership position,

1052
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.200
whether you're working with a team,
whether you're working with a company,

1053
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.690
with your Turkey,
working,
uh,
with a business,

1054
01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:46.100
morale is so important and you have to pay attention to it.

1055
01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.180
<v 4>Yeah.
It seems that kind of added glance or something.</v>

1056
01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:54.510
It seems like morale is kind of this extra thing,
you know?
Oh,
what,

1057
01:10:54.511 --> 01:10:57.540
you don't feel good when you know,
business is business.
You know,

1058
01:10:57.541 --> 01:11:01.290
you don't feel good about it,
but man,
that's,
that's kind of the fuel,
you know,

1059
01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:06.330
you don't have the fuel,
it's quite,
and do it.
Yeah.
I wouldn't say it's a fuel.

1060
01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:10.490
I'd say it's the fire.
You Go.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1061
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:14.160
Throughout the first Chechen war fighters,
many

1062
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 0>of them,
former Soviet soldiers,
we've combat experience in Afghanistan,</v>

1063
01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:21.750
dug into the hills and a defensive and fierce war of attrition with the Russian

1064
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:25.110
troops,
not unlike their former after any counterparts,

1065
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.300
although both sides engage in acts of brutality to weaken the enemy's a resolve

1066
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:34.890
to fight Cheshin fighters far out did their Russian counterparts in these

1067
01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.320
grizzly psychological tactics.

1068
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.480
They hung Russian wounded,
upside down,

1069
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.530
wounded and dead upside down in the windows of defensive positions,
for example,

1070
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:51.270
forcing the Russians to fire at their combat comrades in order to engage the

1071
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:54.090
rebels.
Clearly that's the second time we've talked about that.

1072
01:11:54.091 --> 01:11:55.590
Clearly that had a huge impact.

1073
01:11:55.591 --> 01:12:00.510
I can't even imagine what that does to you psychologically when you want to

1074
01:12:00.511 --> 01:12:02.230
shoot at the enemy and you got to shoot at one a,

1075
01:12:02.231 --> 01:12:05.280
your brothers who's either wounded,

1076
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:10.080
I mean he might be dead bees possibly just wounded and either ways.

1077
01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:12.120
He's right there.
You got to shoot.
Yeah.

1078
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:16.980
It's the both Russian and Cheshin dead were routinely booby trapped by the

1079
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:19.350
Chechens who showed sophisticated insight.

1080
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:21.020
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1081
01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.900
<v 0>Into the likely actions,
reactions of the average Russian soldiers.</v>

1082
01:12:23.901 --> 01:12:25.070
We already talked about that.

1083
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.043
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1084
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.071
<v 0>In addition,</v>

1085
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:32.400
Cheshin fighters use dirty tactics collectively learned from dozens of

1086
01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:34.440
asymmetrical gorilla conflicts before,

1087
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:38.670
such as instructing snipers to aim for the legs of Russian troops injuring but

1088
01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:40.020
not in capacitating them,

1089
01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:44.250
and then shooting free range at the subsequent rescue parties that we're sure to

1090
01:12:44.251 --> 01:12:45.084
come.

1091
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:45.820
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.820
<v 0>Some snipers aimed specifically at the groin dealing a crippling and humiliating</v>

1093
01:12:52.421 --> 01:12:56.710
wound and a humility humiliating wound that resulted in a slow,

1094
01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:59.490
painful death.
And we,

1095
01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:04.890
we experienced this in Iraq to where in part of it was like rumor mill are as

1096
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:08.830
people would say,
Oh man,
these,
cause there was a,

1097
01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:12.460
I remember in Falucia there was a sniper that shots couple guys and the in the

1098
01:13:12.461 --> 01:13:13.950
groin and then you know,

1099
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:18.970
one person got shot in the groin and in Ramadi and I just remember everyone,

1100
01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:21.730
if they could all their goal,
the though this is what they need,
psychological,

1101
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:23.320
it's a psychological attack.

1102
01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:29.340
Chechens routinely dressed in Russian uniforms to gain access to bases and used

1103
01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:33.490
these opportunities to launch surprise attacks from behind enemy lines.

1104
01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.870
Each Cheshin took seriously the notion that the center of grabbing the war was

1105
01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:39.550
no longer the enemy's army,

1106
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:45.490
but rather the enemy's people tactics were devised to attack the psyche of the

1107
01:13:45.491 --> 01:13:48.280
Russians,
aimed at creating a constant level,

1108
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:53.310
high level of psychological stress on the Russian servicemen to undermine their

1109
01:13:53.711 --> 01:13:58.420
morale.
So the Chechens,
we're attacking the morale,
attacking them,

1110
01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:01.720
doing things that were attacking them psychologically

1111
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.310
hardened by United sense of purpose.
In driving out the invader,

1112
01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:12.910
the Cheshin troops terrified and terrorize that Russian troops slowly bleeding

1113
01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:17.560
out their morale and willingness to fight the Russian troops.

1114
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.800
Many still in their teams were woefully unprepared at undertrained in

1115
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.334
comparison.

1116
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:30.540
The result of such a disparity and morale and military expectations had tragic

1117
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.380
consequences.

1118
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:34.283
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1119
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:36.350
<v 0>According to one ration participant,</v>

1120
01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.620
the men on the ground shaking and angered by their losses were just taking it

1121
01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:43.610
out on anyone.

1122
01:14:43.611 --> 01:14:48.611
They found there was revenge in the air for those comrades who had been killed

1123
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.140
and now you end up with so the Russian troops get so frustrated,

1124
01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:57.530
they're so psychologically damaged that there's going out and taking it out on

1125
01:14:57.531 --> 01:15:00.680
the local Cheshin,
which are some of these are Russian.

1126
01:15:00.681 --> 01:15:05.660
Some of these people are are good Russians and they're taking out on them.

1127
01:15:05.661 --> 01:15:08.600
They're taking out on any way that could be an insurgent and now what happens

1128
01:15:08.601 --> 01:15:11.750
you now everyone starts turning against you.
It's a nightmare

1129
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:17.420
without recourse to set piece conventional battle,

1130
01:15:17.421 --> 01:15:18.710
the Cheshin and church and said,

1131
01:15:18.711 --> 01:15:23.711
argumently arguably achieved the acme of skill by subduing their enemy largely

1132
01:15:24.951 --> 01:15:28.820
before the fighting began.
At the same time,

1133
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
the Russians with their vast superiority in military fire power failed to use

1134
01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:35.390
it,

1135
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:40.390
use it to tactical and strategic advantage by employing air and space power

1136
01:15:42.231 --> 01:15:44.900
thoughtlessly or unimaginatively,

1137
01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:51.040
the Russians power was less effective or even disastrously impotent.

1138
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:57.870
So a lack of imagination,
a lack of creativity,

1139
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.560
brutal brutal war

1140
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.710
and a lot of lessons learned.

1141
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.130
And I can tell you that there's a lot of lessons that were learned by those

1142
01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:13.131
Russians on the ground that were absolutely implemented by American forces in,

1143
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.970
I know in Ramadi.
Absolutely.

1144
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.060
The amount of similarities for that urban combat and the things that we watched

1145
01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:30.900
out for because of the sacrifices made by the Russian soldiers.

1146
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.560
I'd say he had a huge impact and I'm glad that we were able to take away some

1147
01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:39.030
lessons

1148
01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.250
and take those to the battlefield and Ramadi and do things like protect the

1149
01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:47.010
local populous and do things like understand their,

1150
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:52.460
their culture and do things like not take out our aggression on the local

1151
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:56.400
populace,
which only turns to a local populace against you.

1152
01:16:58.170 --> 01:16:59.970
And it was that professionalism

1153
01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.920
of the US military of the U S Army soldiers of the US marines.

1154
01:17:07.501 --> 01:17:08.940
That professionalism

1155
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 4>to maintain that discipline.</v>

1156
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1157
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.400
<v 4>Throughout the battle that was actually absolutely critical</v>

1158
01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:24.340
in bringing about the victory.

1159
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.180
It's crazy how all these um,
uh,

1160
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:34.990
these strategies and tactics or it's all the same.

1161
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:39.860
The Patton book,
like all the books that these messages are,

1162
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:44.450
it's all the same.
It's crazy.
It is.
It is.
It is all the same.

1163
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.950
It is crazy how similar they are and when they just completely lined up and

1164
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.311
again,

1165
01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:54.311
it's amazing how the tactics from the battlefield reflect the tactics in

1166
01:17:57.801 --> 01:18:02.780
business and reflect the tactics in human life.
Yeah.

1167
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.010
You know what you're going,
which kind of gave me an eerie feeling is one,

1168
01:18:06.011 --> 01:18:08.120
you talked about the,
the Chechnyan

1169
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:13.550
rebels that there were the rebels,
right?
Because I'm chatting real there,

1170
01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.030
how they'd attack the Russian morale.
Right.

1171
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:20.830
So what give me an eerie feeling is that's what you get with like,
um,

1172
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:24.620
guys who abuse their girlfriend or their wife.
That's what they do.

1173
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.850
They attack their morale.
Yes,
yes.
I don't know why they gave me that feeling,

1174
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:30.140
but it's like,

1175
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:35.141
so because it gave you that eerie feeling because you understand how

1176
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:38.500
devastating.
Yes.
You know,
and it's not exactly,
yeah,

1177
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.780
that's the perfect way to put it because it's not this thing where it's

1178
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:44.480
different than chopping off the guys heads and putting it in,
you know,
on,

1179
01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:47.360
on steaks.
That's something for sure.
But it's way different.

1180
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.230
It's on this weird like kind of covert level,

1181
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.780
but still so devastating.
So it's weird,
man.

1182
01:18:55.850 --> 01:19:00.600
It's bad when you,
you see a guy doing that too,
like to a girl.
It's,

1183
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:04.790
it's,
it's,
it's horrible.
And also in,
you mentioned this earlier,

1184
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.040
the morale piece is something that gets ignored so often.
Yeah.

1185
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.740
Especially in the business world where people just,

1186
01:19:12.741 --> 01:19:15.830
their morale will take a beating,
the market's bad,
all these things.

1187
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.430
And if you don't prop up that morale and you don't protect the morale and you

1188
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:22.160
don't defend them around,
you don't strengthen the morale.

1189
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:25.760
That's when you get what's,
what's,
what happened to the Russian soldiers,

1190
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.900
the morale fell apart.
Yup.
Yeah.
And a lot of times,
um,

1191
01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.290
if the morale is down,
like in a company or something,
the leader,
if he's bad,

1192
01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.590
he'll kind of blame them.
Like,
you guys have bad attitudes.
You know,

1193
01:19:39.591 --> 01:19:41.930
we're trying to do some business here and you guys have it bad attitudes,

1194
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.480
but it's,
you know,
yeah.
That sounds good.
At the opposite,

1195
01:19:44.481 --> 01:19:48.440
they're a leader that's not taking ownership of this situation,

1196
01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.130
which is why ownership is so important.

1197
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:57.050
Because the minute you start blaming,
I mean you're,
you're just,

1198
01:19:57.051 --> 01:19:59.780
you're just putting a nail in the coffin when you start blaming people for bad

1199
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:01.730
morale,
you know,
it's,
uh,
it's the,
hey,

1200
01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.700
the beatings will continue until morale improves.
Right?
Right.
Yes,
exactly.
Yeah.

1201
01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.220
Doesn't work.
Yeah.
You know,
the beatings

1202
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.420
<v 3>do not improve morale.</v>

1203
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.950
Would you say kind of off the top of your head,

1204
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:18.630
would you say that that's more common than not that just that whole thing where

1205
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.380
you know,
just to blame people in general?
Oh absolutely.
Absolutely.

1206
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.640
I mean it is absolutely a very common problem in leadership.

1207
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:31.920
Yeah.
That's,
that's why our book has done really well because people say,
Oh man,

1208
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.550
yeah,
I do that.
Oh I,
I can't believe I do that.
Yeah.

1209
01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:38.850
Cause we never hear any of this stuff.
Like growing up the you'll say,
okay,

1210
01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:39.810
don't blame.
But it's,

1211
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:43.560
it's not like a real strong message that you're saying growing up.

1212
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.460
I know I wasn't,

1213
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:49.610
I don't think that that people have isolated and focused on ownership at this

1214
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:54.414
level.

1215
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1216
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.770
<v 3>I think that's why I think that's why the book has done very well.
Yeah.</v>

1217
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:03.420
I think that's why people continue to contact me and say,
hey you guys,

1218
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:05.640
thank you for writing this book.
It's changed the way I look at everything.

1219
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.500
It's changed the way I've done my business.

1220
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:10.950
It's changed the way I'm treating my wife.
Yeah.
Changed my family.

1221
01:21:10.951 --> 01:21:15.510
It's changed my outlook on my physical failings.
So,

1222
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:20.040
so when you take ownership to that high level and that intensity and you called

1223
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.840
extreme ownership.
Yeah,
I think,
I think it has a huge impact.

1224
01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:26.430
And I think that we are the first people that have said,
you know what?

1225
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:30.270
This needs to be the focus,
right?
This is the game changer.

1226
01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:35.271
This is the fundamental principle in life that is going to turn you from failure

1227
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:41.130
to success.
It's not when you say,
hey,
this person didn't help me in,

1228
01:21:41.131 --> 01:21:45.300
this person went against me in this person sabotage me.
That's great.

1229
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:49.260
But it doesn't matter when you take ownership of everything.

1230
01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.500
Somebody sabotaging me,
I got to own it.
I've got to figure out how to stop them.

1231
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:55.410
Yeah.
And it's just so when you,

1232
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.110
when you kind of know that or you kind of get wind to that,

1233
01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:02.100
it almost seems so obvious.
Like,
yeah,
well,
what was I thinking?

1234
01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:03.540
If I'm going to blame someone said no,

1235
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.760
of course they're going to blame me back if I,

1236
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:08.610
if I get belligerent towards someone,
of course,
like Nate belligerent back.

1237
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:11.940
But you don't,
you and you already knew that really if you're ass,

1238
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:16.500
but it's almost,
it's almost like you don't think if I take ownership,

1239
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:19.890
everyone else is going to talk to start taking ownership.
You know?

1240
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:24.150
You don't really think about that that much,
even though after you know it,

1241
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:29.140
it seems real obvious.
These things are simple but not easy.
Well,

1242
01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:32.520
not easy.
Yeah,
they really are.
And ownership.

1243
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.980
When you take ownership of problems,

1244
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:38.850
when you take ownership of your life and when you don't have anybody else to

1245
01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:42.900
blame.
Yeah,
it hurts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It hurts.

1246
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:48.060
It hurts the ego.
It hurts the mind.
It hurts.
So people,

1247
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.610
even though it's really easy,
I'm going to take ownership of everything.

1248
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.080
It's hard to do.
It's difficult for people to do.

1249
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.780
And when they do do it,

1250
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:02.720
when they do step across that line and they do take ownership,

1251
01:23:02.721 --> 01:23:07.420
they absolutely see things turning around.
And I,
I've heard that,
you know,

1252
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:09.400
I mean,
thankfully for the Internet,

1253
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.650
thankfully for Twitter and Facebook and all these things,

1254
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:16.690
people hit me up every single day and say either,
hey,

1255
01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:19.030
this changed my life.
But sometimes it's just something minor,
you know,

1256
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.690
they'll say,
had some issues at work today.
Took ownership over them,

1257
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:24.880
problem solve.
And you're like,
okay,
that's great.

1258
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.520
What would that person had done a month ago before they read the book?

1259
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.740
They would have blamed somebody else.
They would have shifted the problem.

1260
01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:32.110
They would,
you know,
they would,
they would have ignored it.

1261
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:34.270
They would've cast blame somewhere else and they wouldn't have solved the

1262
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:37.150
problem.
So when you take ownership,

1263
01:23:37.151 --> 01:23:40.000
it allows you to then solve the problem.

1264
01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.093
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1265
01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.890
<v 3>So that's what you got to do.</v>

1266
01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:52.220
So now it is time for questions from the interwebs.

1267
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.900
<v 4>Yeah.
We actually have a current event question,</v>

1268
01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.120
which technically has never happened.

1269
01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.300
<v 3>Well,
I would say it's not,</v>

1270
01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.560
I'll explain why it's not a current event once you ask the question.

1271
01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:10.960
<v 4>Right.
Cause it's not.
It is,
but all right.</v>

1272
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.930
All right.
What are your thoughts on

1273
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:19.900
the Conor McGregor versus Nate Diaz fight and the Holly Holm versus Misha Tate

1274
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:24.250
fight?
UFC One 96 this past weekend.

1275
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.170
Women's Bantamweight Championship.
Holly Holm,
Bruce Misha Tate.

1276
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.880
And then it was like a super fight,
right?
Super fight.

1277
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:38.881
Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor was a champ at one 45 and here's why.

1278
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:40.660
This is not a

1279
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:46.920
<v 3>current events question to me because this is just a question about fighting.</v>

1280
01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:52.020
It really is because,
and you could say this at any time,

1281
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:56.580
these were good examples and we'll be talking about these examples in one year,

1282
01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.290
five years.
And there's other fights that are similar examples.

1283
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:06.140
Holly Holm,
who is a world class kick boxer and boxer.

1284
01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.960
Yeah.
And a very good mixed martial artists.
However,

1285
01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:13.650
not that great at Jujitsu.
Not,
not horrible.

1286
01:25:13.651 --> 01:25:17.280
I'm not trying to bag on her because she is awesome.
And a smart fighter.

1287
01:25:17.281 --> 01:25:19.980
Two very smart with a great coach,
great corner.

1288
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:23.670
She lost her.
Misha Tate,

1289
01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.440
who is definitely not as good of a striker,
but who is better on the ground.

1290
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.220
Yeah.
And she's real relevant.
Well rounded.
Well rounded.
Yeah.

1291
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.400
She's extremely well rounded and she's also gotten beat twice by Ronda Rousey.

1292
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:42.480
And the,

1293
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.480
the strategy in those fights that she had was awful in the Misha Tate,

1294
01:25:48.481 --> 01:25:51.060
Ronda Rousey fight for some reason me shut,

1295
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.840
kept clinching and grabbing and trying to take the fight to the ground against

1296
01:25:54.841 --> 01:25:59.190
Rhonda,
which was just stupid.
She was clearly a better striker.
So I don't know.

1297
01:25:59.191 --> 01:26:03.380
I think that might change the next time they fight Leesha we'll hopefully have a

1298
01:26:03.381 --> 01:26:08.240
smarter game plan then trying to grapple with Rhonda.

1299
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.580
There's no reason for it.
Yeah.
A better striker.

1300
01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:14.150
She needs to take advantage of it.
Yeah.
On the other hand with Holly Holm,

1301
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.200
she does get the grappling going.
Yes.
And not,
not easy,
you know,

1302
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:24.960
all anyone's good at avoiding the takedowns
man.

1303
01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:28.680
So good.
Um,
but yeah,
finally does it in the,
in the fifth rush,

1304
01:26:28.681 --> 01:26:33.370
she had her at the end of the second round,
but you know,
kind of,

1305
01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.750
you know,
the time ran out.
Um,
and then yeah,
managed to end in the fifth round.

1306
01:26:37.751 --> 01:26:42.751
Managed to get it to the ground and immediately finish.

1307
01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.153
Yeah.

1308
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:49.060
I mean she managed and it's key that you said that she managed to like get get

1309
01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:52.060
it to the ground cause it wasn't a beautiful take down or anything.

1310
01:26:52.061 --> 01:26:55.510
She got in on her finally she'd gotten stuffed a couple times.

1311
01:26:55.511 --> 01:27:00.511
It was Holly was doing a really good job of keeping her at bay and Holly,

1312
01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:04.090
he was obviously scared cause even in the second round she got once it was on

1313
01:27:04.091 --> 01:27:08.500
the ground or he's just domination by Misha and then

1314
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:13.120
Holly didn't want to go to the ground where there again,

1315
01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:17.040
but then she let her get in and then like you said me,

1316
01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:20.260
she just forced that been kind of dragged it in an ugly way.

1317
01:27:20.261 --> 01:27:22.300
Just kind of make an audit to the ground.

1318
01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:24.160
I want you to have the grumps got her back but got her back.

1319
01:27:24.161 --> 01:27:26.890
And then when she got her back she got the choke in.

1320
01:27:26.891 --> 01:27:28.120
Once you've got the choke in.

1321
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:29.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1322
01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.760
<v 3>Holly kind of tried to flip her off and</v>

1323
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.190
even that was a little bit of mistake of Hollywood.

1324
01:27:36.191 --> 01:27:38.010
It just like students shook her off.
Yeah.

1325
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:42.060
Mike a really good experience Jujitsu player might do,

1326
01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:43.501
but she didn't.

1327
01:27:43.501 --> 01:27:47.130
She flipped her over and landed on her back and then be shattered.

1328
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.980
The choking deep.
Yup.
And Finisher and niches.
I mean we,

1329
01:27:50.981 --> 01:27:54.750
she's been in some scraps before.
She is a scrappy,
tough,

1330
01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:58.290
she's got a big heart.
She fights with a lot of heart.
I give her,

1331
01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.100
I give her some props.
I mean,
so does Holly,
of course.
I mean,
Holly went to sleep.

1332
01:28:02.101 --> 01:28:05.460
She didn't even tap,
you know,
she was like,
what?
No,
I'm not tapping.
Yeah.

1333
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.170
And you could see her instinctively started throwing punches at the end.
I mean,

1334
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.860
into the air in a different direction because that's her,

1335
01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.300
that's her trainer goes to.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1336
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:19.260
It's just crazy how you see that all the time.
Even when guys get knocked out,

1337
01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:22.350
ever see guys getting knocked up and then start grappling with their eyes for

1338
01:28:22.351 --> 01:28:26.160
sure with the RAF or some shit like that.
Just kind of an unconsciously doing it.

1339
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.600
Yeah.
It's kind of a kind of a compliment,
I would say.
You know,
their skill,

1340
01:28:30.601 --> 01:28:34.800
like that's all automatic.
Yes.
So automatic.
She's throwing punches at the air.

1341
01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:39.810
Yup.
Even though she's asleep.
Yeah.
So,

1342
01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:44.790
yeah.
So in this case,
straight up.
Yeah.
Jiu Jitsu works,

1343
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:49.410
right?
Yes.
Okay.

1344
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.400
We'll talk about t give us a debrief on the Mcgregor Diaz fight.

1345
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.903
See the,

1346
01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.550
I think it was there a lot of components I think to that.

1347
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:05.010
I think that the,
just give us the outlook of what happened just now.
Okay.
Yeah.

1348
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:10.011
They fought the fight at one 70 in Nate Diaz is either one 55 or I think

1349
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.380
sometimes he's farther,
we'll know he's,
he's part of one 70 before.
Yeah.

1350
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:19.830
But,
but he's be,
his normal weight for fighting is one 55.

1351
01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.510
So Mcgregor's normal way for fighting is one 47 he came up 10 pounds.

1352
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:28.260
But due to the late nature of the bout,

1353
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.550
they actually ended up finding out one 70.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1354
01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:37.290
So they fight and it was,
it was a little battle and I think from what I saw,

1355
01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.840
he was,
it was close,

1356
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:45.950
but I think Conor McGregor caught him like some solid ones called them a couple

1357
01:29:46.871 --> 01:29:48.390
of solid ones.
Yeah.

1358
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:51.380
<v 4>And then,
um,
then yet shifted.</v>

1359
01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.680
And then Nate started catching him and jamming him up and,
and,

1360
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.560
and I think that's really what did it,
because he,

1361
01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:02.090
he started beating him up and then Connor went for a take down.

1362
01:30:02.091 --> 01:30:03.900
And that's what you typically,
what you do when you,

1363
01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.990
when you go for that takedown and the way he did,

1364
01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.340
that's when you get beat up and you'd go for the clinch.
You know what?

1365
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:11.390
I want to avoid getting beat up.
Even in boxing,
they do that,
you know,

1366
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.500
you can beat it.
You go for the parents.

1367
01:30:12.501 --> 01:30:16.480
So that was kind of what that kind of was.
And in MMA you just,

1368
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:19.700
you go for the take down.
That's kind of what it is.
Um,
so he did,
but,

1369
01:30:19.701 --> 01:30:24.670
and that's the thing that here comes to Jujitsu right where he is.
She,
it's,

1370
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:29.210
so the reality is Conor McGregor couldn't,

1371
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.800
that wasn't an option for him,
were sure he went for the take down.

1372
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.550
But going to the take down is even worse now because Nate Diaz is one of the,

1373
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.150
he's a really good Jujitsu,
got really good.
So,

1374
01:30:41.151 --> 01:30:44.690
and kind of McGregory still working on his Jujitsu good from what I hear or

1375
01:30:44.691 --> 01:30:48.880
whatever.
But not like Nate Diaz.
Nate Diaz is like levels above them.
Absolutely.

1376
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.200
So it goes to the ground and it really showed,

1377
01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:54.130
so not only is Connor kind of beat up a little bit and,

1378
01:30:54.131 --> 01:30:58.580
and dazed now he's on the ground.
He has to do Jujitsu now,
which is,
that's a,

1379
01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:02.870
that's a double a double strike on him.
So of course he,
you know,

1380
01:31:02.871 --> 01:31:06.470
he takes a couple more shots and then Nate choked him out pretty pretty quick.

1381
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.590
<v 3>Yeah,
I bought him that your Jyutsu skill and,</v>

1382
01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:15.150
and one thing that does is pointing out the whole week when they were getting

1383
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:17.040
interviewed and everything.
He says,
uh,
you know,

1384
01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:18.930
here I have better training partners in you.
They'll go,

1385
01:31:18.931 --> 01:31:20.940
I'm rolling with and look who he is rolling with.
Yeah.

1386
01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:22.440
He's running with his brother Nick.

1387
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.440
He's one with Jake shields who's a beast on the ground.

1388
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:28.460
I mean he's run with all those little bad ass wrestlers to,

1389
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:32.160
he's got uncrowned.
Yeah,
you got grown up there.

1390
01:31:32.161 --> 01:31:36.510
I mean these guys are getting after it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
And so,
uh,

1391
01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:40.220
who's,
I mean,
I don't know.
I mean he trained with Gunnar,

1392
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:44.730
what's Mcgregor train with gunner gunner's good and everything.
But yes.

1393
01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:48.930
But the thing is about the Jujitsu and about the training,

1394
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.230
the guys that you're training with all the time,

1395
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:56.940
that's the guy that you trained with every day.
That's what makes you good.

1396
01:31:57.090 --> 01:32:00.400
Not The guy that comes out for a two week camp or a four week camp or a six week

1397
01:32:00.401 --> 01:32:04.930
camp that does not make you good at Jujitsu.
Might sharpen up one or two things,

1398
01:32:05.290 --> 01:32:07.380
but it's not the life,
right.

1399
01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:11.230
It's not the deep daily grind with the,

1400
01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:14.880
with the masters,
you know,
that's what's make you really good.
Yep.

1401
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:20.740
So I think that,
like I said,
I mean it's,

1402
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:25.420
it's definitely showed the Jujitsu definitely works.

1403
01:32:25.890 --> 01:32:26.723
Uh,

1404
01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:31.730
and it also shows you how hard it is to get good at how much harder it is to get

1405
01:32:33.671 --> 01:32:37.990
good at,
as dragging,
meaning Misha.
No,
she was not dominating,

1406
01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:41.260
but she was surviving on the stand up.
You know what I mean?

1407
01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:43.720
And this is a world class striker.
I mean she's,

1408
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:48.370
she's definitely a better striker than Misha.
Tate is a grappler.

1409
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:52.840
I mean Misha Tate doesn't have any tremendous accolades as a grappler.

1410
01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.920
She's a high level MMA grappler but she's not a world champion grappler.
Right.

1411
01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:00.040
And yet,
you know,

1412
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:04.960
she was able to hang because striking is uh,
for the most part,

1413
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:10.590
from a thought perspective is a linear thought pattern of throwing strikes and

1414
01:33:11.351 --> 01:33:16.210
another human grappling is infinitely more complex,
infinitely,

1415
01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.100
infinitely more complex.

1416
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:23.670
And so you have to learn it earlier and if you want to

1417
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.060
do may make something of it.

1418
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.430
I mean cause striking striking has an element of luck to it.

1419
01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:34.390
I don't care what you say is striking has,

1420
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:38.980
I mean we know when to MMA fighters go in the cage.
There's not a guy that says,

1421
01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:43.510
hey,
I can definitely knock this guy out.
There is absolutely there's,
you know,

1422
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:47.840
knockouts are seldom even in boxing where the ole object is a punch.

1423
01:33:47.841 --> 01:33:49.180
The other guy and they had knocked them out.

1424
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:53.620
Whereas a rear naked choke is a rear naked choke.
You know it like you,
you know,

1425
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:56.890
it's a real Nigga joke.
It is a very,

1426
01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:02.250
very assured weapon to be utilizing in those situations.

1427
01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:05.850
<v 4>Yeah.
I remember one time I was talking to Henner Henner Gracie,</v>

1428
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:09.630
he just made a real small short comparison to,
I think it was boxing.

1429
01:34:09.631 --> 01:34:14.631
He said the average person can walk into a boxing gym in and rock someone and

1430
01:34:16.591 --> 01:34:17.071
knock them out.

1431
01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:21.210
He used the word he and rock someone if he just swings for the fences.
Right.
And,

1432
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.590
and that is possible.
But Jujitsu,
when you can't really do that,

1433
01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.453
you can't really,

1434
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.470
a new guy come in as a white belt and just go real hard and just saying somehow

1435
01:34:31.471 --> 01:34:35.550
catch someone.
One of these submission holds.
So yeah.

1436
01:34:35.551 --> 01:34:40.290
And once you learn that you and the other guy doesn't know it and he hasn't

1437
01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:43.740
learned it or it hasn't learned it even close to how much you've learned it,

1438
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:47.760
it's that,
it's that easy.
Really.
It's the really,

1439
01:34:47.770 --> 01:34:51.000
the best way to say it is you have that much control over the fight

1440
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:55.410
<v 3>you do.
Now,
the thing is,
I don't want to make,
like all of a sudden,</v>

1441
01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:58.000
Jujitsu

1442
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
<v 0>by itself is the all powerful thing because you can't discount that the dozens</v>

1443
01:35:04.181 --> 01:35:07.600
and dozens and dozens of Jujitsu people,

1444
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:11.260
Ben had been beaten in MMA,
they've been beaten down,
they've been knocked out,

1445
01:35:11.261 --> 01:35:15.010
they print an ad,
they're shots stuffed.
So there,

1446
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:17.560
there's no doubt about that.
But

1447
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:21.020
it's,

1448
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.760
it is definitely the skill that you have to have in this day and age for mixed

1449
01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:34.750
martial arts for sure.
I mean,
without it,
you know,
you get beat and without it,

1450
01:35:34.751 --> 01:35:39.550
what you have is UFC one and UFC to Jujitsu just beats the other martial arts,

1451
01:35:39.551 --> 01:35:41.230
whether it's wrestling or whether it's boxing,
it doesn't matter,

1452
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:43.743
<v 1>you know,
but</v>

1453
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.000
<v 0>you do have to train everything.
I mean,</v>

1454
01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:50.240
and Jujitsu it takes the longest to learn.
There's the most to learn.

1455
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:51.980
So you should start with it.
But you've got to know how to box,

1456
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:54.120
Kinda know how to Russell,
you know,
gotta Know Moy Tai.

1457
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.633
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1458
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.510
<v 4>And that's the way it is.
Yeah.</v>

1459
01:35:58.511 --> 01:36:03.340
And when you have that much of a discrepancy between like a certain element of,

1460
01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:04.980
of people's game,
like in,

1461
01:36:04.981 --> 01:36:09.981
and I think Jujitsu tends to be the more prevalent because a lot of times people

1462
01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.020
will be like,

1463
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.190
oh well certain guys like let's say like a chocolate l or Klieg Weda they're

1464
01:36:15.191 --> 01:36:18.370
like,
hey,
these aren't,
well actually we'll just say chocolate dough.

1465
01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.460
He's not necessarily a Jiu Jitsu black belt and he was champion or whatever.

1466
01:36:21.461 --> 01:36:24.670
But the thing is he knew he had a wrestling background so he had grappling but

1467
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.350
he knew about Jujitsu or,
yeah,

1468
01:36:26.351 --> 01:36:29.680
for sure early he knew about like where the arm bar comes from,

1469
01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:33.280
where the jokes come from,
how to defend the choke,
all these things.

1470
01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.560
So knowing you did sue saying like you need to know Jujitsu isn't,

1471
01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:40.570
doesn't necessarily mean you gotta be a black belt in Jujitsu or you have to

1472
01:36:40.571 --> 01:36:43.450
have the slickest,
sharpest submissions necessarily.

1473
01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:48.780
You just have to know Jujitsu and if you don't know it or know very little you,

1474
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:53.860
I'd say the chances of you getting exposed,
exposed is really high.
Yeah,

1475
01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:00.640
I agree with and I think these just so happened last night,
um,
that,
that,
that,

1476
01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.560
those fights exemplified that.

1477
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:07.340
<v 1>I agree with you.
Got It.
Got another Jujitsu.</v>

1478
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.680
<v 4>As I was listening to your recent podcast,</v>

1479
01:37:10.681 --> 01:37:15.030
I thought that have a few topics you could discuss that would be good and

1480
01:37:15.031 --> 01:37:18.960
helpful for your young guys.
Want to join the military and go special ups.

1481
01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:25.250
I know that bud and other training or just baseline entry level schools,

1482
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:30.720
but in my experience those stories are what get guys excited and fired up.

1483
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:33.220
<v 0>So you know,</v>

1484
01:37:33.230 --> 01:37:38.230
guy wants to hear about bud stories and what it's like going through those

1485
01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:41.210
stories through,

1486
01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:44.780
through those types of training because it gets people excited and fired up.

1487
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:49.140
Well,
there's,

1488
01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:54.150
there's actually kind of a reason why I don't sit around and talk about buds,

1489
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.830
<v 3>which is basic seal,
basic underwater demolition seal training.</v>

1490
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.820
There's a reason I don't sit around and talk about it a bunch.
Um,

1491
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:07.850
one of those reasons is because buds is not the seal teams at all and it doesn't

1492
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:09.661
mean anything.

1493
01:38:09.661 --> 01:38:14.040
And I try and say that as often as I can because I don't want people to get the

1494
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:15.540
impression that

1495
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:22.100
that the seal teams is the little initial training that does barely even a

1496
01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:27.090
fraction of your career in the seal teams and it has nothing to do with what you

1497
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:29.160
actually do when you get in the seal teams.

1498
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:35.010
I also don't want,
and this is an intentional,

1499
01:38:35.011 --> 01:38:36.720
this is more of a response to the question,

1500
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:41.721
but I don't tell stories to get guys fired up to join the military about buds

1501
01:38:43.771 --> 01:38:47.400
because that isn't what the seal teams is.
That's not what an SF ODA team is.

1502
01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:50.880
That's not what ranger battalion is.
Ranger Battalion.

1503
01:38:50.881 --> 01:38:55.881
An SF is not the selection course to that you go through to get into them.

1504
01:38:56.581 --> 01:39:00.480
That's not what the job is and you shouldn't be joining

1505
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.960
the military and shouldn't be trying to get into special operations because you

1506
01:39:05.961 --> 01:39:07.490
want to do that training.

1507
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.920
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1508
01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.130
<v 3>you should do the training because you want to do the job.</v>

1509
01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:19.210
You want to do the actual job of being in special operations and being in

1510
01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:23.930
special forces in bean rangers,
in being in Marsoc and being in the seal teams,

1511
01:39:23.931 --> 01:39:25.790
you should want to do that job

1512
01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.720
and if you wanted do that job,

1513
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:38.480
what it really boils down to an running or walking or pull ups or swimming or

1514
01:39:38.481 --> 01:39:39.440
any of that crap.

1515
01:39:39.441 --> 01:39:44.441
It boils down to whether you have the two wheels that I talk about that war is

1516
01:39:44.481 --> 01:39:45.470
determined by.

1517
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.013
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1518
01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.810
<v 3>and that is</v>

1519
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:56.790
the will to kill because that is the entire premise of your job.

1520
01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.480
If you're in the military at all,

1521
01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:03.460
you may be somehow

1522
01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.980
supporting that if you were in the military,

1523
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:14.070
but the ultimate goal of the military is to kill the bad guys and if you're

1524
01:40:15.851 --> 01:40:17.590
going to be in special operations,

1525
01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:19.870
you're going to be on the tip of the spear of that.

1526
01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.090
So you absolutely have to make sure that you have the will to kill

1527
01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:29.560
and you also,

1528
01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:33.940
obviously if you're going to join special operations or you want to be in the

1529
01:40:33.941 --> 01:40:35.170
seal teams,

1530
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.470
you have to have the will to die.

1531
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.270
Not that you want to die,
not that you want to be a martyr,

1532
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.200
not that you're freaking suicidal or anything like that,

1533
01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.160
but you absolutely have to make sure that you have the willingness

1534
01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:01.830
to die.
And I would say put your life on the line.
But no,
I'm going beyond that.

1535
01:41:01.831 --> 01:41:04.290
I'm talking about the willingness to die

1536
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:12.690
because if you join special operations or you join the seal teams or you join

1537
01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:17.860
any of the combat arms in the army or in the Marine Corps,

1538
01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.330
<v 2>okay,</v>

1539
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:24.930
<v 3>you will be asked to put your life on the line</v>

1540
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.870
and you gotta be ready to do that.

1541
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.250
You got to have that.

1542
01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:38.100
Will you gotta be ready to make that commitment?

1543
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.240
And I mean the training,
if you,

1544
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.680
if you have that will to kill and you have that will to die,

1545
01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:56.000
the training,
Rhonda Swim,
do pushups,
do pull ups,
dips,
sprints,

1546
01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:59.690
do rope,
climbs,
do flutter kicks,
all that stuff.

1547
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.090
It's the easy part.

1548
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:13.440
And so if you're sitting there and you see seal training on TV and you think,

1549
01:42:13.441 --> 01:42:14.760
oh,
that'd be cool.

1550
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:21.000
Don't think about that as what being a CEO is,
because it is not.

1551
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:24.530
That is just the selection.

1552
01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:25.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1553
01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.760
<v 3>It's just the weeding out of the week.</v>

1554
01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:34.810
If you want to be a seal means you want to be a commando.

1555
01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:37.720
It means you want to go into harm's way.

1556
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:41.770
It means you want to meet to the enemy on the field of battle.

1557
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:46.450
That's what being a seal is,

1558
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:57.610
and that's why I really don't sit around and tell bud stories.

1559
01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.110
I don't think I have too much more to say about that one.

1560
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.060
I'm sure at some point I'll get,
I mean,

1561
01:43:08.061 --> 01:43:10.820
there's funny things that happened in buds.
I mean,
of course,

1562
01:43:10.821 --> 01:43:15.140
but there was this compared to like what happens in a seal platoon there just no

1563
01:43:15.141 --> 01:43:19.340
big deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's interesting how you put it.

1564
01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.110
Don't focus,
don't do it because you want to go through that training.
Yeah.

1565
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:27.080
Do it too,
because you want to do the job.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a big,

1566
01:43:27.110 --> 01:43:28.160
that's a big mistake.

1567
01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:30.890
Maybe I can help some people out that are out there right now thinking,
oh,

1568
01:43:30.891 --> 01:43:34.100
I'd really like to go through that training.
[inaudible] no,

1569
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:38.900
don't do it to go through the training.
Go do it because you want to do that job.

1570
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:42.200
Yeah.
Is it true the,

1571
01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:46.390
they take a pin and they stick it in your skin and clip,

1572
01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.290
pin it on your skin that you,
they do that well when you get your trident.
Yeah.

1573
01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:56.330
D the it has like three little prongs that go out the back of it to stick it

1574
01:43:56.331 --> 01:43:59.360
under your uniform and when you get your training,
yeah.

1575
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:03.230
They put it into your skin.
Yeah.
It's like you standing there with no shirt.

1576
01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:04.080
They're like,
oh,
like that.

1577
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:07.250
Then they and then they like punch it in and then yeah.
You know everybody,

1578
01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:07.790
when I went,

1579
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:11.900
when I got my tried and the whole team lined up and everyone punched you right

1580
01:44:11.901 --> 01:44:14.960
in the chest until you're just bleeding everywhere and the big bruise under
just,

1581
01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:18.560
yeah.
Interesting.

1582
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:20.180
Next question.

1583
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:25.230
<v 4>Do you have experience with people telling you that you're too intense?</v>

1584
01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:29.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1585
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:33.710
<v 4>Or the need to work on not being so upfront and straightforward?</v>

1586
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:36.470
Sometimes it's called working on your how.

1587
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:40.490
I think it would be great to hear how you could apply this using extreme

1588
01:44:40.491 --> 01:44:44.990
ownership in the business world.
There is a big push on diversity,

1589
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:45.920
which is wonderful,

1590
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:51.490
but often it comes with also Dave diversifying away from intensity and male

1591
01:44:52.341 --> 01:44:54.800
aggression,
quote unquote.
I'd love your thoughts.

1592
01:44:58.450 --> 01:44:59.380
<v 3>Well,
this is</v>

1593
01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:00.700
<v 2>okay.</v>

1594
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.640
<v 3>It's kind of interesting to get this question.</v>

1595
01:45:02.641 --> 01:45:06.210
It's kind of strange get this question because all the time when I talk about

1596
01:45:06.211 --> 01:45:07.044
leadership,

1597
01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:13.100
I talk about how often do you hear me say take the indirect approach to

1598
01:45:13.411 --> 01:45:15.090
something [inaudible].
Yay.

1599
01:45:15.110 --> 01:45:19.650
I always talk about the indirect approach because the direct approach is,

1600
01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.330
is not Jujitsu.

1601
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:25.650
The direct approach is beating your head and punching someone in the face.

1602
01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:29.370
So I'm always talking about using the indirect approach.

1603
01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.710
So by it's very nature,

1604
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:35.670
indirect is not straight forward.
Right,

1605
01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:37.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

1606
01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:41.630
<v 3>It's not intense.
Yeah.
So no,</v>

1607
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.200
I don't have people telling me I'm too intense or I'm too straightforward.

1608
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.870
Why don't I have them telling me that?
Because I'm not

1609
01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

1610
01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.060
<v 3>I am not,
and I'm not saying that I'm not intense.</v>

1611
01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:56.060
I'm not saying that I'm not straight forward,
but I'm very,

1612
01:45:56.061 --> 01:45:59.180
very careful not to go too far with either.

1613
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:00.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1614
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:01.490
<v 3>This is,</v>

1615
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:05.540
this is like a fighter that's swinging too hard or being too predictable or just

1616
01:46:05.541 --> 01:46:10.480
will stand and trade and take damage and do damage.

1617
01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:11.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1618
01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.990
<v 3>That's the direct approach.
The direct approaches.</v>

1619
01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:18.010
I punched you in the face and you punch me in the face and we play a war of

1620
01:46:18.011 --> 01:46:22.510
attrition.
I don't want to enter into a war of attrition.

1621
01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:27.430
I do not want to enter into a war of attrition.

1622
01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.480
I want to use a maneuver warfare.
I want to move,

1623
01:46:31.690 --> 01:46:36.690
I want to slip unseen into the weak areas and set my bombs and have them go off.

1624
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.770
So I just got this asked this the other night by a relatively new client of
mine,

1625
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:47.060
you know,

1626
01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:51.480
are you going to get in their faces and and getting the feces of the leadership

1627
01:46:51.481 --> 01:46:53.640
and tell him straight up that they need to get their act together.

1628
01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:58.641
And you could see that this person was very excited by that idea and it was one

1629
01:46:58.681 --> 01:47:02.040
of the senior leaders are not.
That was that you had this idea that I was,

1630
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:07.041
would come in and just get in their faces and tell him how screwed up they were.

1631
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.730
And
I said,
no,
I,
I likely will not do that.

1632
01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:15.900
And then I said to him,
I said,
look,

1633
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:18.510
what if I told you that you are all screwed up when you were a failure at your

1634
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:20.430
job and you do.
You're a weak leader.

1635
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.680
<v 2>Nope.</v>

1636
01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.970
<v 3>What would you then be,
feel like you really wanted to listen to me?</v>

1637
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:31.520
Would you,
would you be open to my suggestions at that point?

1638
01:47:31.521 --> 01:47:33.920
Do you think I'd be an efficient coach?

1639
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.910
Do you think I would even appear as an intelligent human being?

1640
01:47:39.570 --> 01:47:44.570
If the best I could do to coach you was to tell you that you sucked as a leader

1641
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.760
and you are a failure at your job and you're screwing everything up

1642
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.560
and are we see the answers were no,
no,
no,
of course not.

1643
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:55.020
I would be a horrible coach.

1644
01:47:55.021 --> 01:48:00.021
I would be a horrible leader myself if that's what I resorted to.

1645
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:02.763
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1646
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:04.580
<v 3>And most importantly,</v>

1647
01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:08.140
if I want you to change n,

1648
01:48:09.710 --> 01:48:14.710
the way I'm trying to get you to train is by the change is by being abusive and

1649
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.900
begging you to send up your defenses and not listen to me.

1650
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:22.670
And what the hell good am I doing?

1651
01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:28.880
Why would I do anything that's going to inhibit my goal?

1652
01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:32.300
Which my goal is to get you to change,
get you to be a better leader.

1653
01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.310
So if I slap you in the face

1654
01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:41.670
with aggression or it's straight forwardness,

1655
01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:45.820
that makes you defensive.
How does that help me?

1656
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.190
The answer is it doesn't.
Now again,

1657
01:48:50.191 --> 01:48:53.550
that doesn't mean that I'm never straight forward and then I'm never aggressive.

1658
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.670
But I calculate those moments.

1659
01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:03.640
I calculate those woman's,
there's a reason

1660
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:08.390
why we sugarcoat medicine for little children,

1661
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:13.580
right there is why is it so they take it?

1662
01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.880
It's so they take it into their system

1663
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:23.350
and it's the same thing with adults.
And people say,
don't sugar coat it,

1664
01:49:23.351 --> 01:49:26.170
don't you?
Don't just tell me how it is.
They don't mean it.

1665
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:34.030
They want it sugarcoated because they want to accept it into their body.

1666
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:42.370
It's just like Jujitsu.
You need to use Jujitsu.
You need to set things up.

1667
01:49:42.371 --> 01:49:44.380
You need to manipulate,

1668
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:48.280
get people to do what you want to do,

1669
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:51.550
especially if it has to do with them changing themselves.

1670
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.490
One of the worst ways to get someone to change is by telling them exactly how

1671
01:49:57.491 --> 01:50:01.480
you want them to change.
I mean,
of course their situation.

1672
01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:03.900
We have this beautiful relationship and you've built it with someone.

1673
01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.330
You have this intimate trust with another human being.

1674
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.230
I don't think I have that with anybody,

1675
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:16.590
but there have been situations in my life where I've had,
oh,
just complete,

1676
01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:17.830
utter trust with,
you know,

1677
01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:21.940
maybe there's three or four people that I have that within my whole life that I

1678
01:50:21.941 --> 01:50:25.300
can just say,
listen man,
here's the deal.
Don't get defensive.

1679
01:50:25.301 --> 01:50:29.710
Here's what's going on.
Here's what you need to adjust.
Very few people do.

1680
01:50:29.711 --> 01:50:31.960
You have that relationship in life.

1681
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.580
So you gotta use that

1682
01:50:40.290 --> 01:50:45.150
nuance and that maneuver warfare.
And it's the same thing with aggression.

1683
01:50:45.151 --> 01:50:47.670
It's the same thing that this we just read in this article,

1684
01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.250
don't yell at the Cheshin people.

1685
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.600
You're not going to be able to get what you want from them.
And like I said,

1686
01:50:54.601 --> 01:50:57.990
it doesn't just apply to those people that applies to all people.

1687
01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:03.900
You got to bring people in and you got to manipulate them.
And I know that,
again,

1688
01:51:03.901 --> 01:51:06.360
that has negative connotations,
but it's what you're doing.

1689
01:51:06.361 --> 01:51:09.570
You're trying to get someone to think a different way.
That's manipulation.

1690
01:51:09.571 --> 01:51:11.310
You can call it influence,
you can call whatever you want,

1691
01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:12.600
but that's what you're trying to do.

1692
01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:16.710
And the most difficult way to manipulate someone is to slap them in the face

1693
01:51:16.711 --> 01:51:17.544
with aggression.

1694
01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.300
So there's a little dichotomy here of course,
because you know,

1695
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:28.630
I always say the default mode has to be aggressive,

1696
01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:33.820
but I don't mean necessarily overtly aggressive.

1697
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:38.821
It means that you're aggressively forcing things to go in your direction through

1698
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:44.460
every means necessary through overt and covert and clendette Stein.

1699
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:46.030
And honestly,

1700
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.040
the preferred method of all is covert.

1701
01:51:50.710 --> 01:51:55.710
The preferred method for me to get an echo to do something different is for echo

1702
01:51:56.191 --> 01:52:01.191
to never even think I had an opinion on it is for me just to sneak in there

1703
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:04.150
behind enemy lines,

1704
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:09.390
plant the seeds and let them grow and let echo come to the conclusion that

1705
01:52:11.411 --> 01:52:13.120
you're going to change the way you're doing something.

1706
01:52:13.121 --> 01:52:16.600
You're going to do it up the think differently about something.

1707
01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:20.080
That's leadership.

1708
01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:25.750
That's real leadership,
so

1709
01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.810
that's what you got to work on.

1710
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:35.250
If somebody is telling you you're too intense and too aggressive guests what you

1711
01:52:37.451 --> 01:52:38.284
are,

1712
01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.410
you're giving away your greatest weapon.

1713
01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:50.270
You're advertising your attack.

1714
01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:56.800
Surprise is one of the most key components in a battle,

1715
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:04.270
and when you tell people aggressively an overtly

1716
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:11.660
what you're doing,
you're giving up that element.
Don't do it.

1717
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:17.470
I'm asking you not to be a manipulative person behind the scenes,

1718
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:20.953
<v 1>okay?</v>

1719
01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:23.400
<v 3>With weird plans,</v>

1720
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.670
but that is what I'm asking you to do.

1721
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:35.870
That's is what I'm asking you to do because that is how you get things done.

1722
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:40.080
That is how you get into people's minds.
That is how you lead.

1723
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:48.110
Not by yelling,
not by being overly aggressive,

1724
01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:53.000
not by being so intense that people don't want to listen to you because

1725
01:53:53.001 --> 01:53:54.860
intensity is a form of emotion.
Right?

1726
01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:58.940
And the minute you come across as an emotional intense maniac,

1727
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:04.070
people are questioning already your validity.
This guys,

1728
01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:07.190
you're too intense.
Don't be that guy.

1729
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:12.190
Manipulate influence,

1730
01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:16.780
be clandestine and covert.
And that

1731
01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:19.203
is how you win.

1732
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:25.100
<v 4>The reason that it was kind of laughing,
um,</v>

1733
01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:27.170
what was reading this question is

1734
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.330
that it kind of makes sense from someone to kind of from the outside and the

1735
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:32.620
only,

1736
01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:37.620
and the main terms when me personally where I would view you as being intense or

1737
01:54:38.361 --> 01:54:39.340
aggressive or,

1738
01:54:39.341 --> 01:54:44.341
or is like when you're just talking about something that you,

1739
01:54:44.361 --> 01:54:48.500
you're never doing it towards anybody,
you know,
like you'll never lose it.

1740
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:51.290
I've never been,
I've known you since

1741
01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:57.650
Oh six I pink,
something like that.
Yeah.
Um,
in,

1742
01:54:57.710 --> 01:55:01.730
I've never seen you'd lose your temper.
Get Mad.
I mean,
kind of l one time.

1743
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.580
It's funny I was talking to laugh about it.
Oh,

1744
01:55:04.581 --> 01:55:06.320
we'd never really seen you get mad,

1745
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:11.321
but maybe one or two times you have this aggressive and intense persona for

1746
01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:14.990
sure.
And when you talk about things,
for sure.
But yeah,

1747
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:16.220
when you're dealing with people,

1748
01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:20.540
it's real like basically the way you'd want to be

1749
01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:25.910
<v 3>engaged with another human.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1750
01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:30.480
Just Justin wants to have somebody get aggressive with them.
It's never,

1751
01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.170
it never,
the only time it works,
it's like if you're handling a prisoner,

1752
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.090
like literally if I'm handling a prisoner,
I'll be aggressive with them.

1753
01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:44.010
Yeah.
If I'm trying to get command of a,
of a,

1754
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.830
of a chaotic situation and there's a,

1755
01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.680
there's another aggressor in the situation,

1756
01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.440
I might have to be more aggressive than that person,

1757
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:56.910
but any normal situation dealing with human beings,

1758
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:02.610
aggression isn't a attribute.

1759
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:07.400
It's a negative because all it does is make people defensive.
Yup.

1760
01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:09.520
Now listen,
eat.

1761
01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:15.140
It doesn't mean that you're sitting back in your shirking and s and shriveling

1762
01:56:15.691 --> 01:56:16.590
up.
No.

1763
01:56:17.190 --> 01:56:21.960
But it means that you're finding the balance with another person and you're,

1764
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:27.140
you're working with them and conversing with them to bring them along into your

1765
01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:33.090
way of thinking.
Yeah.
That's what it is in,

1766
01:56:33.091 --> 01:56:36.450
in,
you know,
when somebody asks me a question like this,

1767
01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:39.780
it,

1768
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:44.780
it really signifies to me that it makes me nervous because I think to myself,

1769
01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.320
I see this all the time.
I mean,
I say use the indirect approach.

1770
01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:55.500
Don't get people's defenses up.
I say this all the time,

1771
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.770
and yet someone can still come back and say,
you know,

1772
01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.470
people are telling me I'm being too aggressive.

1773
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:04.440
Like they're not even taking ownership of the fact that they're being too

1774
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:08.910
aggressive.
Right.
It's like the other people are weak.
Yeah.

1775
01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:12.210
And therefore since they're weak,
they think I'm too aggressive.

1776
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:16.080
I can't believe how pathetic they are.
Yeah.
That's the reality.

1777
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:18.000
That's what's going through someone like this mind.

1778
01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:22.950
Like sometimes it's called a working on your,
how,
you know,

1779
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:26.460
he's kind of saying,
oh,
they're,
they've got a euphemism for it.
And,

1780
01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:30.510
and in the business world there's a big push on diversity,

1781
01:57:30.511 --> 01:57:34.590
but it comes with diversifying away from intensity and male aggression.

1782
01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:38.310
I mean,
you can guarantee what the,

1783
01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:41.550
what this this guy thought I was going to say like,
no,

1784
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:44.790
you got to just stay the path you've got to,
if people can't take it,

1785
01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:49.010
you got to crush them.
Nope.
No,
actually that's a complete wrong answer.
Yeah.

1786
01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:54.080
If people can't take it,
it's because you are being too aggressive,
you know?

1787
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:57.000
The way you're giving it is wrong.
The way you're to is wrong.

1788
01:57:57.810 --> 01:58:02.810
So that aggression needs to be channeled in such a way that it's being utilized

1789
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:05.610
to further the goal.

1790
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:09.320
<v 3>To further the goal and you know who you get aggressive with.</v>

1792
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1793
01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:15.750
<v 3>Yourself.
Yeah.
You get aggressive with yourself.</v>

1794
01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:18.810
That's who I get aggressive with.
You know?
I'm straight forward with,

1795
01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:23.190
I'm straightforward with myself.
That's who I'm straight forward with.

1796
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:27.930
I'm the one guy that I'm allowed to get aggressive with,

1797
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:30.660
to be straight forward with,
to put things in,

1798
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:35.940
to not sugarcoat anything.
I'm allowed to do that with me,

1799
01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:42.040
but I'm not allowed to do it with another human because it's ineffective

1800
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.920
<v 4>way of leadership.
It just is not.</v>

1801
01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:46.693
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:52.910
<v 4>Yeah.
It's fun.
It's fun.
It's funny how like,
that's absolutely true.</v>

1803
01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:56.870
And with you what I said is abs.
Absolutely true.
I don't think

1804
01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:03.020
I've ever seen you get mad at someone else,
but at the same thing,

1805
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:07.260
at the same time.
And I think a lot of people who may not know you good but,

1806
01:59:07.261 --> 01:59:10.710
but have,
have experienced being around you,
they all feel,

1807
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:14.690
I would say that they all feel the same way and that is that,
yeah.

1808
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.320
Fucking jackals cool or whatever.

1809
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:21.450
But if he were to like lose his temper on me,
he PR,
I'd probably die.

1810
01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:26.790
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
And they're right.

1811
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:30.330
Like I'm glad I'm not losing my temper.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

1812
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:34.620
That wouldn't be good at all.
Yeah.
That'd be bad.
I have,
you know,

1813
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:38.510
that would not be good for people.
I don't think

1814
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:44.730
that's the dichotomy though,
right.
That is that,
that sense of safety,

1815
01:59:44.731 --> 01:59:49.320
yet the sense of impending doom is there at the same time.
Yeah.

1816
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:54.440
Yeah.
And,
and,
and I think,

1817
01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:57.930
I think it does genuinely surprise people.
Yeah.

1818
01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:03.630
Because I look like a serial killer.
I'm a big guy,
whatever.

1819
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:05.490
And they expect

1820
02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:07.253
<v 2>that</v>

1821
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:11.260
<v 4>dad,
I'm going to be aggressive in implementing this and you know,</v>

1822
02:00:11.261 --> 02:00:14.740
you gotta get your shit together.
Right.
But it's just not,

1823
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:19.000
it just ineffective way of leadership.
If that was,
if that was leadership,

1824
02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:22.390
leadership of the visa would be easy.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just gonna yell at everyone.

1825
02:00:22.391 --> 02:00:25.140
They're going to do what I say,
you know?
Yeah.

1826
02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.210
I'm just going to yell at everyone and then they'll do what I say.

1827
02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:31.210
That just does not work.
Yeah.
It's crazy though,

1828
02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:33.940
because just the way you talk a lot of the times,
not all the time,

1829
02:00:33.941 --> 02:00:37.240
but just the way maybe it's like just how you saw it.
I don't know your voice.

1830
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:39.700
I don't know.
It's probably everything really is,

1831
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:42.880
you do sound intense even though you're not being intense,
you know,

1832
02:00:42.881 --> 02:00:46.140
you just kind of seem that way for all these reasons.
Of course.
Well,

1833
02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:50.020
it's like you said earlier when I'm talking about something that I care about,

1834
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:53.740
right?
Yes.
I am definitely going to be intense about it,

1835
02:00:53.741 --> 02:00:58.741
especially when it's something that is impactful to me and something that means

1836
02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:01.960
something to me and trick to me.
Leadership does mean a lot to me.
Yeah.

1837
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:06.410
And and trying to help people lead.
Yeah.

1838
02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:10.720
It is an important thing to me.
I enjoy it and I like to see people succeed,

1839
02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:12.130
so therefore when I talk about it,

1840
02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:17.020
sometimes I get a little bit fired up and I get intense with what I'm saying.

1841
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:22.190
That is it scary that just Kinda,
it's like indirectly scary,
so it's not,

1842
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:25.180
let me scare you.
Okay.
I'll just,
I'll use the word scary.

1843
02:01:25.181 --> 02:01:27.250
It's indirectly scary where when you do it it's like,
oh,

1844
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:30.640
I'm not scared of what you're doing,
but you kind of can't imagine.
You're like,

1845
02:01:30.641 --> 02:01:33.640
all right.
What if you know,
you're kind of like,

1846
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:37.020
you're like this raging hurricane that when it comes by,

1847
02:01:37.021 --> 02:01:39.190
it turns into like a warm,
gentle breeze.

1848
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:44.450
<v 3>You know what I mean?
Like,
and maybe that's a,</v>

1849
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:48.880
that's probably part of the advantage.
Yeah.
Part of the advantages people,

1850
02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.050
you know,
I said this,
I think it was Tim Ferriss,
I said this to you.

1851
02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:58.150
People are surprised when I can sit there and have a conversation with them and

1852
02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:03.440
I'm not aggressive with them and I'm,
my mind is open to what they're saying.

1853
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.880
Yeah.
That's part of the game.
Yeah.

1854
02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:14.690
<v 2>All right,
next question.</v>

1855
02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:22.360
<v 3>Okay.
Jocko,
your reaction to mar soc,
right?
Marcel,
Marcel,</v>

1856
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:27.390
m e r s o c Performing Marine Corps Special Operations Command.

1857
02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:33.420
Yeah.
So that's a new,
the new thing.
Um,
so,

1858
02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:35.070
and this is the question that he's asking it.

1859
02:02:35.071 --> 02:02:39.180
So Marines think bill their seals now or,

1860
02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:43.950
yeah,
we should be or we should have been marines all along.

1861
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:48.950
So this is a question about,
like I said,

1862
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:53.570
the Marine Corps Special Operations Command,
it was formed in,
I don't know,

1863
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:57.110
2005,
2006 maybe.

1864
02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:00.980
Um,
and,
and if you don't know,

1865
02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:04.850
the army has its own special operations group.

1866
02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:08.810
The navy has its own special operations group.

1867
02:03:08.811 --> 02:03:13.100
The air force has its own special operations group and the Marine Corps did not

1868
02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.750
wait.
What is force recon?
Have you ever heard of it?
Yeah,

1869
02:03:15.751 --> 02:03:18.530
of course we can force recon was a part of the marine corps,

1870
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:20.930
but it wasn't broken off and,

1871
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:24.170
and it didn't get the extra money in the extra funding and it didn't fall into

1872
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:28.820
the chain of command of special operations.
Gotcha.

1873
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:31.820
And so when they made mar soc,
it did,

1874
02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.880
so now they took a bunch of the force recon guys and put them into a group and

1875
02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.900
have their own funding and everything else.
So the bottom line is on this

1876
02:03:43.930 --> 02:03:48.130
is that the Marine Corps is awesome and I loved the Marine Corps and I think

1877
02:03:48.131 --> 02:03:49.480
that this was long overdue.

1878
02:03:50.050 --> 02:03:54.130
I think that the Marine Corps as a whole

1879
02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.900
is likely,

1880
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:05.310
it's likely the most capable fighting unit the world has ever known,

1881
02:04:05.411 --> 02:04:08.680
to be honest with you.
I mean maybe the,
in addition,

1882
02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:14.220
the airborne divisions from the army or also just highly capable,

1883
02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:18.940
but the marine corps with its air ground,

1884
02:04:18.941 --> 02:04:21.820
see it's got command and control.
It's got integrated intelligence,

1885
02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:24.730
it's got everything and it can use it all together.

1886
02:04:24.731 --> 02:04:27.130
And so that makes it just an extremely

1887
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:35.030
effective and efficient fighting force.
And they are highly disciplined,

1888
02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:38.280
they're highly motivated,
there's an incredible a spree decor.

1889
02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.640
<v 0>So
for me,</v>

1890
02:04:41.670 --> 02:04:46.670
this was long overdue and I think that I actually did a turnover with the,

1891
02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:54.320
with the initial kind of mar soc group in 2004 in Baghdad.

1892
02:04:56.190 --> 02:04:58.080
And I had worked with the Marine Corps on,

1893
02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:01.740
I had more work with force recon on multiple deployments when I was a younger

1894
02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:04.800
seal and they took a bunch of those guys,

1895
02:05:04.801 --> 02:05:09.801
a bunch of just legendary force recon guys and put them into this first mar soc

1896
02:05:11.311 --> 02:05:16.200
company and they were awesome,
awesome warriors,
awesome guys.

1897
02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:22.440
And I think I actually have one thing that that's a huge benefit to them is in

1898
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:25.740
the Marine Corps you're in the Marine Corps.
So every marine corps,

1899
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.150
every marine is a rifleman.

1900
02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.920
They have the opportunity to work with big conventional infantry companies and

1901
02:05:31.921 --> 02:05:34.350
platoons and battalion.
So,

1902
02:05:34.351 --> 02:05:37.020
so their guys will be very experienced.

1903
02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:41.220
And I think that they are going to be,

1904
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:45.210
I mean I think that the Marine Corps Special Operations Command is going to be

1905
02:05:45.211 --> 02:05:49.080
an extremely capable force in the future.

1906
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:54.840
And I am glad to say the least,

1907
02:05:55.650 --> 02:06:00.650
that they will be defending our country and freedom around the world for many,

1908
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:08.970
many years to come.
Yeah.
That kind of goes along with what,

1909
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:13.200
how you were saying or a lot of these points that these books make about how the

1910
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:15.600
discipline and the training are so paramount,
you know,

1911
02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:20.250
in success and now you have yet another division that's going to get some solid

1912
02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:21.930
training,
you know?
Yeah,
for sure.

1913
02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:25.470
There's no doubt the marine corps will put these guys through outstanding

1914
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:26.304
training.
Yeah.

1915
02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:28.473
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1916
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:31.103
<v 0>Next question.</v>

1917
02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:36.770
Do you consider shooting a martial art and how has your firearms training been

1918
02:06:37.501 --> 02:06:41.220
like or unlike martial arts training?
Well,

1919
02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:46.800
shooting is absolutely a martial art.

1920
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:52.170
I mean maybe not the way people pictured martial arts nowadays be because when

1921
02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:54.450
you picture a martial art people picture,
you know,

1922
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:59.250
a guy with a Guiana doing karate.
That's,
that's right.
That's the generic picture.

1923
02:06:59.251 --> 02:07:02.460
To me that's not,
that's not martial arts.
Actually,
to me,

1924
02:07:02.461 --> 02:07:05.910
martial arts is the art of war.

1925
02:07:05.911 --> 02:07:10.911
The Art of the individual warrior skills that it takes and firearms are

1926
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:16.200
absolutely a martial art because it's something that you train.

1927
02:07:16.201 --> 02:07:17.850
It's something that you get good at.

1928
02:07:17.851 --> 02:07:22.851
It's something that you need to maintain your skill at and it is absolutely a

1929
02:07:24.751 --> 02:07:26.040
martial art and to me,

1930
02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:30.850
<v 2>okay</v>

1931
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:34.000
<v 0>it's another piece of the puzzle.
It's another thing that you should know.</v>

1932
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:36.070
You need to know how do and

1933
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:41.070
<v 3>just like tactics that go along with shooting are an important part of being a</v>

1934
02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:42.484
warrior.

1935
02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:48.060
You need not a shoot and the training is very similar in my mind to martial arts

1936
02:07:50.231 --> 02:07:54.040
training in that it takes,
you know,
repetition.

1937
02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:58.300
You have to know what the basics are and you have to repeat those basics and

1938
02:07:58.301 --> 02:08:02.920
then you get more advanced and it's,

1939
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:07.950
it's about movement and getting efficient with your movement

1940
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.600
in.

1941
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:15.600
Then you want to train it very similar to the way that you train mixed martial

1942
02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:18.250
arts or martial arts in general.
And that is,
you know,

1943
02:08:18.251 --> 02:08:20.680
you're going to have different threat levels and how you get to deal with them

1944
02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:23.350
and you want to deal with your weak side.
You know,
you can,

1945
02:08:23.351 --> 02:08:28.351
you shoot with your off hand in various environments and the low light in the

1946
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:33.310
dark in the rain and the,
you want to mix it up.
So you're used to all of it.

1947
02:08:33.311 --> 02:08:35.410
You want to be used to people at close range,

1948
02:08:35.411 --> 02:08:37.780
you want to be used to people at farther range.

1949
02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:43.840
And then once you get all those mechanical skills down,

1950
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:47.170
then you want to train your mind around this thing.

1951
02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:52.650
You want to train your mind around this skill so that your mind knows how to

1952
02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:59.650
utilize this skill when things are unexpected and when there's chaos and when

1953
02:08:59.651 --> 02:09:03.880
there's mayhem going on.
And that's,

1954
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:07.450
that's one of the things that I really like about simunition training or paint

1955
02:09:07.451 --> 02:09:11.230
ball training or laser tag training is it allows you,

1956
02:09:12.850 --> 02:09:17.040
it allows you to have somebody else shoot back at you from,

1957
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:21.730
which is just like,
you know,
just like Roland in Jujitsu or sparring,

1958
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:25.750
more tie or sparring.
MMA is you have to react to the person.

1959
02:09:25.751 --> 02:09:28.040
It's no longer just a Kata,
right?

1960
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:32.050
It's no longer just shooting paper targets that don't shoot back and don't move.

1961
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:39.610
So you,
so I love to take it.
Once you've got the skills down and then you learn,

1962
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.590
you've got the fundamentals down,

1963
02:09:41.591 --> 02:09:46.591
then you'd take the advanced fundamentals and then you begin to train to

1964
02:09:47.321 --> 02:09:50.500
simulate combat.
And this is oc tell Ya,

1965
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:52.670
I had these,
um,

1966
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:58.830
I got these laser tag guns for my son and I just got two of them at first.

1967
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:03.640
But that escalated very quickly because they were awesome.

1968
02:10:03.641 --> 02:10:08.641
They were these little nerf laser tag guns and you could shoot each other at,

1969
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:14.590
I dunno,
maybe a hundred meters,
which is a pretty good shot.

1970
02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:19.210
And it was like a pistol.
And so when I got these,

1971
02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:21.910
and as soon as I got two of them and I realized how good they were,

1972
02:10:21.911 --> 02:10:25.360
I bought two more so I could go against my son and his friends and they could go

1973
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:26.194
against each other.

1974
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.640
And I taught my son like all the basic military maneuvers that he would need to

1975
02:10:30.641 --> 02:10:35.130
know.
And this is when he was maybe eight years old.
Okay.
And

1976
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:39.530
we would play this game all the time,
you know?

1977
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.080
And so I taught him how to have cover and move.

1978
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:43.760
I taught him how to get elevated positions.

1979
02:10:43.761 --> 02:10:48.530
I taught them how to do individual movement techniques where you don't show your

1980
02:10:48.531 --> 02:10:50.750
face at the same spot like twice in a row.

1981
02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:54.590
Every time you get up you move a little bit.
And he,

1982
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:58.700
he realized that that's how you win in these little games and they're real.

1983
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:02.780
Those are the real tactics.
And so I had a speaking,

1984
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:07.730
speaking of speaking of the Marine Corps,
I had a friend that,

1985
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:08.990
uh,
was,

1986
02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:14.120
was came over to the house one time and he was,

1987
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:17.330
you know,
of a marine.
And

1988
02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.410
we got in the conversation and all of a sudden,
you know,

1989
02:11:21.411 --> 02:11:26.090
my son comes out with the laser tag guns and my son's like,
oh,
you know,

1990
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:30.350
do you want to go?
And the guy's like,
Yo,
yeah,
of course,
let's do it.

1991
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:36.070
So my son looks at him and says,
indoor or outdoor and he,

1992
02:11:36.071 --> 02:11:38.900
all of a sudden you could see there was something going on and the guy goes

1993
02:11:38.901 --> 02:11:39.770
outdoor,
outdoor.

1994
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:44.720
So my son that you press the button on the thing and it counts down for 10

1995
02:11:44.721 --> 02:11:48.740
seconds and then it's on.
So wait,
so you go find cover or something like that.

1996
02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:52.370
So 10 seconds.
My son hits the thing,
my son takes off out the door,

1997
02:11:53.150 --> 02:11:54.150
so I'm watching the guy and the guy,

1998
02:11:54.151 --> 02:11:58.680
this guy is doomed because you know you're going against the train.

1999
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:05.540
So the guy comes out and,
and it's dark,
right?

2000
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:08.210
But the guy comes out of the door and I'm watching him and he's kind of crouched

2001
02:12:08.211 --> 02:12:11.700
a little bit and all of a sudden his gun,
because it all is in this once a,

2002
02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:14.780
it's all takes place inside the gun.
You don't wear a helmet,

2003
02:12:14.781 --> 02:12:17.720
you don't wear anything that you actually are shooting the other person's gun.

2004
02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:19.190
And when it's shot,
when he,

2005
02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:23.120
when he gets shot and exist and shakes and a red light flashes.

2006
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:28.380
So he walks out and sure enough,
my son had run around the block,

2007
02:12:28.381 --> 02:12:32.060
gone in an elevated position.
And as soon as he came walking out,

2008
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:36.590
my son started drilling him and the guys like Steve Freezes.
It's interesting.

2009
02:12:36.591 --> 02:12:39.290
Like he freezes.
He doesn't even think to myself,
oh,
I'll take cover.
No,

2010
02:12:39.291 --> 02:12:41.300
he just froze and got drilled.

2011
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:45.140
And then as soon as it's easy standing there is kind of looking around,

2012
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:47.540
looking around,
looking around.
And finally he sees my son.

2013
02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:50.780
He starts to point the weapon up towards my son.
My son just disappears.

2014
02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:53.940
And then the guys could keep,

2015
02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:56.240
the guy starts kind of walking over in that direction.

2016
02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.460
And then 15 seconds later my son pops up on his flank and drills them again from

2017
02:13:01.461 --> 02:13:04.910
behind another fence in a hole in the wall.
And anyways,
he ends up killing them.

2018
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:07.310
And then the guys,
okay,
let's go again.

2019
02:13:07.311 --> 02:13:11.900
And my son beat him like three times in a row.
And it's because he had the basic,

2020
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:17.390
the basic skills,
basic infantry men skills is what it was,

2021
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:21.770
you know,
he would shoot and then move and that's what it boils down to.

2022
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:24.170
So that kind of thing is,

2023
02:13:24.250 --> 02:13:29.250
is very important in as far as being a martial art.

2024
02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:31.950
And you should train.

2025
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.940
<v 0>You don't,
that's another thing,
you know,</v>

2026
02:13:32.941 --> 02:13:37.910
I said this to Sam Harris when I was on his podcast.
You know?
Yeah,

2027
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:42.950
maybe there's no chance because you live in a bubble and you live in a great

2028
02:13:43.651 --> 02:13:45.060
neighborhood and you're well protected.

2029
02:13:45.061 --> 02:13:46.740
You have alarm system in your house and all that,

2030
02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:50.790
and maybe you're never going to have a problem.
And that's great.
I mean,

2031
02:13:50.791 --> 02:13:52.110
there's always a chance.

2032
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:54.300
I would never believe that you're never gonna have a problem,

2033
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:58.530
but there's always a chance that is going to crunch that evil is going to enter

2034
02:13:58.531 --> 02:14:02.550
your world and you want to be ready for that.
Now,

2035
02:14:02.551 --> 02:14:04.890
if that makes me sound paranoid,
okay,

2036
02:14:04.891 --> 02:14:09.560
let's just say you're not paranoid and you don't think it's ever going to

2037
02:14:09.561 --> 02:14:10.394
happen,

2038
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:16.040
but it is still highly valuable to train in these situations because they make

2039
02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:20.640
you a better person.
They make you sharper,
they make you smarter,

2040
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:23.370
they make you more prepared if something does happen,

2041
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.290
it's just good to know this stuff and it makes you a better person,

2042
02:14:28.291 --> 02:14:30.670
more reliable.
It's a real skill set.
You know?

2043
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:35.770
I always was kind of bummed out about basketball or football or baseball because

2044
02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:40.780
those are the,
there,
there are life skills involved in them.

2045
02:14:40.781 --> 02:14:45.690
I don't want to say that,
but the skill itself
of throwing a baseball,

2046
02:14:45.691 --> 02:14:46.860
of shooting a basketball,

2047
02:14:46.861 --> 02:14:51.861
of throwing a football is not as valuable as a skill,

2048
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:57.060
as number one,
a martial artist,
you know,
moy,
Thai boxing,

2049
02:14:57.090 --> 02:14:58.740
wrestling,
Jiu Jitsu,

2050
02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:03.720
because those are real applicant applicable to life 100%.

2051
02:15:06.230 --> 02:15:07.640
And this the same thing with shooting a gun.

2052
02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:11.540
I mean that is a real applicable skill that you may need at some point in your

2053
02:15:11.541 --> 02:15:13.250
life.
And you should have it.
Let me know.

2054
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:18.340
What supplements do you an echo take?

2055
02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:26.090
What supplements do you take?
Well,
my number one supplement is steak.

2056
02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.960
Steak.
Yes.
Beautiful steak.
That's the number one.
Um,

2057
02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:38.330
well there,
there are a couple things that I take.
Number one,
I take Krill oil.

2058
02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:42.890
I've taken it every day for probably

2059
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:47.720
10 years,
maybe a little bit longer day.

2060
02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:53.440
And I take glucosamine and I've taken that every day for 10 plus years.

2061
02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:57.440
I got,
I had,
well,

2062
02:15:57.441 --> 02:16:02.390
my shoulder was bothering me many years ago and someone said,

2063
02:16:02.391 --> 02:16:07.280
hey,
take krill oil,
take glucosamine.
And I said,
actually,
know what?

2064
02:16:07.281 --> 02:16:11.420
It wasn't Krill oil.
It was fish oil.
At the time.
Right.
But at the same time,

2065
02:16:11.421 --> 02:16:15.530
I just started taking both and within a short period of time my shoulder got

2066
02:16:15.531 --> 02:16:17.930
better and it had been a nagging nine month injury.

2067
02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:21.560
So I don't know which one of those two did it,

2068
02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:25.720
but I'll never going to find out cause I'm always going to take them both.
Um,

2069
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:28.880
I,
you know,

2070
02:16:28.881 --> 02:16:32.560
I eat a lot of coconut oil whenever I get the chance.

2071
02:16:32.561 --> 02:16:37.390
I like dipping things in coconut oil.
Coconut oil is a,
if you get a taste for it,

2072
02:16:37.391 --> 02:16:41.620
it's a really nice tasting thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's,

2073
02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:45.610
that's the supplements that I take.
Uh,
you know,

2074
02:16:45.611 --> 02:16:47.950
one thing that's been really cool is,

2075
02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:52.770
is picking up a sponsorship from on it for the podcast.
You know,

2076
02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:57.730
from Joe,
uh,
who's obviously been a big supporter.
He's the,

2077
02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:01.210
he's actually the reason that we're sitting here right now just because Joe

2078
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:03.160
Rogan,
I mean,
Tim Ferriss said the same thing with Joe Rogan said,

2079
02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:08.170
you need to have your own podcast.
And I said,
okay,
and here we are.
Uh,

2080
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:10.660
and he was,
you know,
real supportive.

2081
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:15.610
So I definitely like supporting him.
And his company,
uh,
with on it.

2082
02:17:15.611 --> 02:17:20.611
But what's great is they make good quality stuff and it's real simple.

2083
02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:27.250
<v 4>Yeah.
Well funny as in I didn't really tell you about this,
but if you go,</v>

2084
02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.480
if you go on gone on the website on,
on it,
the Onnit website,

2085
02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.280
you can get stuck on there for a long time.
Just reading all this stuff about it.

2086
02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:41.170
You know like the Krill oil was one and I knew about Krill oil from long time

2087
02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:43.240
and there krill are like these little,

2088
02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:46.630
they're like little shrimp basically teeny tiny.
Sure.
Anyway,

2089
02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:50.140
so teeny tiny shrimp.
Yeah,
for lack of a better way of putting it.

2090
02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:51.610
But how they get it is like,

2091
02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:55.720
it's all ecofriendly where it doesn't destroy the or affect the ecosystem.

2092
02:17:55.750 --> 02:18:00.220
Even the big ship,
the vessel that they used to the harvest,

2093
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:05.170
the Krill is like low emissions,
specifically certified like Dang.

2094
02:18:05.171 --> 02:18:07.930
It's real in depth thing.
He gets stuck on this real interesting too.

2095
02:18:07.931 --> 02:18:10.090
Cause they tell you like what are the benefits,
you know,

2096
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:12.850
how do they know that these benefits are there?
Cause you can't just say,
hey

2097
02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.590
<v 0>take this,
it'll cure this.
You can't just do that.</v>

2098
02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:21.360
You got to go through this process too.
I switched over to Krill oil,

2099
02:18:21.361 --> 02:18:23.520
I dunno,
maybe like seven years ago or something.

2100
02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:28.560
At some point I went from fish oil.
Krill oil.
Yeah.
Apparently there's fun.

2101
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:31.770
It's like little bit,
a little bit better.
So I think he's a lot better.
Yeah.

2102
02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.910
Well at least when you read about it,
but to me people ask me,
you know,

2103
02:18:36.930 --> 02:18:41.790
Oh what do you do?
You know,
cause I'm 44 years old.
Old Man.

2104
02:18:42.050 --> 02:18:44.760
Right.
But I don't feel 44 yeah,

2105
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:48.000
I feel 24 you don't feel 40 for I feel,

2106
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:53.270
I feel 24 and actually the thing that originally turned me on to fish oil was

2107
02:18:54.421 --> 02:18:59.421
there was a guy that was a bad ass guy and he was 54 but he was a competitive

2108
02:19:04.590 --> 02:19:08.910
power lifter when he was younger and he was in really good shape.

2109
02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:11.230
And this is probably when I was,
well one,
it was,
I had done at that,

2110
02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:13.020
so 15 years ago or something like that.

2111
02:19:13.021 --> 02:19:18.021
I was like 30 years old and this guy looked young and healthy and I said,

2112
02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:21.060
you know,
hey w w what do you do?

2113
02:19:21.061 --> 02:19:23.970
Like what's your main thing to keep you so young and healthy?
And he said,

2114
02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:26.970
I take fish oil every day.
I said,
okay,
cool.

2115
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.740
<v 4>Let's try that.
Yeah,
we'll get on board that train.
Yeah.</v>

2116
02:19:32.210 --> 02:19:33.800
So yeah,

2117
02:19:33.801 --> 02:19:38.300
too bad ass city for some today and no,
no Krill oil.

2118
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:40.470
We'll get you some critical.
Right on.
Thank you.

2119
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:44.440
Had you could get criminal Krill oil at uh,

2120
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:49.850
on a.com back slash Jocko.
That's right.
What would flesh it thing?

2121
02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:53.390
I don't know what it is forwards last actually I put it on the,

2122
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:54.980
on the website on both websites,

2123
02:19:54.981 --> 02:19:57.740
the chocolate store website and the Jocko podcast website.

2124
02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:02.000
So wheat and oil and you and they give us a discount.

2125
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:03.800
So or so on.

2126
02:20:03.801 --> 02:20:08.801
It is giving our listeners a discount like 10% my people and what I did find out

2127
02:20:09.561 --> 02:20:12.110
on audit,
regardless of whatever discount you get,

2128
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:17.111
the you have free shipping on everything except I want to say that the big old

2129
02:20:18.330 --> 02:20:21.650
dump kettlebells,
but everything else is telling me you get free shipping.

2130
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.700
We just kind of seems like a small deal and doing it cause that's so things

2131
02:20:25.701 --> 02:20:30.360
online and stuff before like 10 shirts
I've been under.
So teacher,

2132
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:35.180
um,
and of course I bought things online,
but when you see that free shipping,

2133
02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:38.800
I don't know,
it's just something,
it seems small meals like legit.
Yeah.
You,

2134
02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:41.900
you kind of feel it,
you know,
knew it wouldn't nonetheless,

2135
02:20:41.901 --> 02:20:44.180
people probably want to know what supplements you take.

2136
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:48.230
People mainly would ask me that in college is when everyone wants to see what's

2137
02:20:48.231 --> 02:20:52.460
up because they think for some reason that supplements give you big muscles or

2138
02:20:52.461 --> 02:20:55.310
something.
They don't,
they don't think about that whole working out.
Yeah.

2139
02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:59.160
The whole working out thing.
I mean,
yeah,
that was secondary.
Um,

2140
02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:01.750
but yeah,
in the,
in,

2141
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:05.540
in Jujitsu that they care less about muscles there this little,
they'll be like,

2142
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:06.950
Eh,
you know,
it's actually,

2143
02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:10.670
you get kind of teased sometimes in Jujitsu if you have big muscles,
it's weird.

2144
02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:15.620
You don't get teased,
but you lose credit for your skill suggest on your side.

2145
02:21:15.621 --> 02:21:20.330
Yeah.
That too.
But you kind of do get tea every role with,

2146
02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.420
you know,
you get done rolling.
They're like,
man,
you're strong.

2147
02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:30.440
You Damn right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I been training for 20 years too,
by the way,

2148
02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:34.330
has nothing to do with this.
I take,
uh,

2149
02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:39.590
the only supplement I take Alpha brain,

2150
02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:45.650
the instant one.
Oh,
the yesterday and I w I do take a pre workup,
which is,

2151
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:47.570
I mean,
I'm going to be honest,

2152
02:21:47.571 --> 02:21:50.210
I don't know if I should take a pre workout pre workout.
Is it just,

2153
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:52.760
you know what that is,
right?
It's like a little powder.
It's like,

2154
02:21:52.761 --> 02:21:57.610
it's a stimulant.
It's caffeine basically has caffeine in it typically.
And um,

2155
02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:01.700
an Otu nitric,
nitric oxide,
it basically makes your,

2156
02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:05.730
it Faisal dilate to you so your vessels get dilated.
So it delayed,

2157
02:22:05.770 --> 02:22:08.450
you get more of a pump,
it gives you energy.
It's just like,

2158
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:12.310
it's basically stimulate energy.
Um,
so you know,

2159
02:22:12.311 --> 02:22:15.770
if you're not in the mood for working out,
but I found this little sweet,

2160
02:22:15.890 --> 02:22:20.360
sweet little combo you put out for bring instant with it.
Or just with coffee,

2161
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:24.020
drink some coffee and the Alpha brain incent.
It hits you at the same time.

2162
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:31.250
If you didn't want to work out,
you'll want to work out without Jack.

2163
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:33.780
But yeah.
So yeah,
that's it.
That's pretty much it.

2164
02:22:34.050 --> 02:22:37.620
It's funny because a lot of people,
they think that if you take protein powder,

2165
02:22:37.621 --> 02:22:42.330
it'll make your muscles big.
Like it'll help you get big muscles.
Um,
but no,

2166
02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:45.510
like if you take your favorite supplement,
which is steak,

2167
02:22:46.890 --> 02:22:50.220
just eat normal.
You know,
and if you're working out,

2168
02:22:50.221 --> 02:22:51.210
you're going to eat a little bit more.

2169
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:56.040
That's how you get big muscles work out good and have the correct workout for

2170
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:58.880
muscles.
We did a different kind of workout and if you want to,
you know,

2171
02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:01.980
get conditioning or something like that and then eat enough,

2172
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.190
that's what you gotta do and eat right after you work out.

2173
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:07.620
I know you you to do that too.
I think.
No actually I think I don't,

2174
02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:14.880
you go in somebody actually somebody put on Twitter the debt I was right.

2175
02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:19.530
There's like some about you're not going to foster own release or HGH or is

2176
02:23:19.531 --> 02:23:23.460
there some kind of something happened in your system?

2177
02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:25.280
We'll research that one again.
Yeah.

2178
02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:30.150
I don't want to have an uneducated argument right now at all.
So

2179
02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:36.920
Joe Rogan and them call it bro Science [inaudible] science road right now.

2180
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:41.880
That would be wrong.
But yes,
to answer the question,
supplements

2181
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:47.040
output,
that's like an everyday supplement to Alpha brain by the way.
Um,

2182
02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:52.240
and then the pre workout and oh no problem.

2183
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:54.920
Shroom tech.
And I've been taking,

2184
02:23:54.921 --> 02:23:58.790
even before we started this podcast I took shoot no gun.

2185
02:23:58.791 --> 02:24:02.030
I remember you getting all fired up for the shoot tech.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2186
02:24:02.031 --> 02:24:05.570
Cause cause he gave you the cardio Jude when Miss.
Yeah.

2187
02:24:05.650 --> 02:24:09.800
So we have to kind of explain to people that,
you know,

2188
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:16.440
we need more.
I'm not in,
you know,
I'm just saying echo in the past,

2189
02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:21.420
I think it's safe to say I don't feel uncomfortable by saying there was a little

2190
02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:25.290
bit of a cardio deficits that would be reached very quick Echo Charles on the

2191
02:24:25.291 --> 02:24:26.020
mats.

2192
02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:30.570
So being tired was more of an issue for me.

2193
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:32.340
Like dealing with being tired,
you know,

2194
02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:35.040
certain people will get tired but they just don't care.
Like Dan Henderson,

2195
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:38.340
like you'll get tired but he,
he'll just keep fighting it.
See I didn't have that.

2196
02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:41.640
No,
it was the opposite.
So yeah.
So I,

2197
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:45.240
so when I take the shroom tech sport,
you could feel it.
I can feel it.

2198
02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:49.920
I can feel like it's like almost like you'd expect to get more tired than you

2199
02:24:49.921 --> 02:24:53.160
really are.
That's how I felt.
Yeah,
I was taking that before.

2200
02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:55.680
But that's in specific cases only with Jujitsu.

2201
02:24:55.681 --> 02:24:59.160
Like if I'm doing like conditioning,
like now,
like a metcon or something,

2202
02:24:59.161 --> 02:25:02.010
I won't take it because you don't want to give yourself the extra.

2203
02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:06.340
And it seems like if I'm trading just for conditioning it's kind of like I want

2204
02:25:06.341 --> 02:25:11.280
the turbo for the mats.
Yeah.
Heck yeah.
But yeah.

2205
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.890
Yeah,
that's it.
That's all the supplements right there.

2206
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:18.780
I will take the Krill oil though for sure cause that's gonna help me.

2207
02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:24.070
Last question Jocko.
I would enjoy hearing your

2208
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:29.070
<v 3>thoughts on leading others to a strong finish in both a deployment and in the</v>

2209
02:25:30.341 --> 02:25:34.780
civilian life.
This is,
this is something that I saw.

2210
02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:37.240
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2211
02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.073
<v 3>in combat.</v>

2212
02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:41.860
Even though my first deployment to Iraq and it's something that I try to train

2213
02:25:41.861 --> 02:25:46.861
out of people and that was a tendency to relax once a target with secure or the

2214
02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:52.960
vehicles were loaded and we were leaving the target area,

2215
02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:58.950
people would have a tendency to let their guard down,

2216
02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:08.220
but you can't let your guard down then

2217
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:14.880
or ever really can.
In training.
When I was running training,

2218
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.890
we always hit the platoons hard on target,
but we always,

2219
02:26:21.390 --> 02:26:24.540
we always hit him even a harder after they left the target.

2220
02:26:24.570 --> 02:26:27.800
Once they were patrolling back to base and their mind,

2221
02:26:27.801 --> 02:26:32.550
they'd already gone home and then turned off.

2222
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:34.470
And that's when we bring it to him.

2223
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:39.900
We hate him from multiple angles with all kinds of mayhem

2224
02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:47.770
because I wanted to instill into them.

2225
02:26:47.771 --> 02:26:51.580
I wanted to instill that attitude,

2226
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:53.290
the muscle memory

2227
02:26:55.260 --> 02:27:00.260
to always keep going and always stay focused a cause.

2228
02:27:02.011 --> 02:27:02.844
That's,

2229
02:27:03.690 --> 02:27:07.500
that's the mentality that you have to have is that it's never finished.

2230
02:27:08.130 --> 02:27:08.540
<v 2>Okay?</v>

2231
02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.550
<v 3>It is never finished.</v>

2232
02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.800
You always have to do more.
Another mission,
another task,

2233
02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:18.000
another goal,

2234
02:27:22.390 --> 02:27:27.390
and have that attitude that the enemy is always watching and waiting and

2235
02:27:28.661 --> 02:27:29.494
looking,

2236
02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:33.820
looking and studying you for that moment of weakness,

2237
02:27:36.690 --> 02:27:39.030
looking for you to exhale,

2238
02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:43.650
put your weapon down and close your eyes.

2239
02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:48.550
That's when they attack.

2240
02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:56.760
So my rule is don't be finished.

2241
02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:02.550
Be Starting,
be alert,
be ready,
be attacking.

2242
02:28:02.730 --> 02:28:04.290
Be Relentless

2243
02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:10.710
at the enemy.
Stop.
Let the enemy rest.

2244
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:13.860
Let the enemy finish,
but you

2245
02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:18.120
don't finish.
Don't stop.

2246
02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:23.180
Don't rest until enemy is completely

2247
02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:26.210
destroyed.

2248
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:33.070
And even then,
even then

2249
02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:36.850
when the enemy's gone,

2250
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:44.550
that's when you turn that focus inward on yourself and you take the opportunity

2251
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:49.680
not to rest.
But as always,

2252
02:28:49.890 --> 02:28:54.570
you take that opportunity to make yourself better,
faster,

2253
02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:56.580
smarter,
stronger.

2254
02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.060
And with those goals,

2255
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.903
<v 2>nothing</v>

2256
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:08.230
<v 3>is it ever finished.</v>

2257
02:29:12.010 --> 02:29:12.843
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2258
02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:15.280
<v 3>So thanks to everybody</v>

2259
02:29:17.350 --> 02:29:20.350
tuning into the podcast and listening to it.

2260
02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:27.640
Thanks for subscribing and reviewing and spreading the word,

2261
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:30.230
telling other people about the podcast.

2262
02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:36.180
Thanks to [inaudible] dot com for the support.

2263
02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.480
And what do we got with amazon.com for support?

2264
02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:46.400
<v 4>Um,
the,
I put a little link can be,
again,</v>

2265
02:29:46.401 --> 02:29:50.330
both the websites where you can,
um,
like if you shop at Amazon,

2266
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:53.450
it's like an affiliate.
It's like just like a way to support this podcast.

2267
02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:58.830
If you shop on Amazon,
you click through there first and um,

2268
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:02.480
it kind of gives us a referral kind of fee,
you know,

2269
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:08.600
all these books that people are buying from the podcast.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

2270
02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:11.450
Yeah.
Yeah.
So yeah,
if you click through the website,
you get,
you know,
we,

2271
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:15.380
we'll get like a little percentage or whatever.
It's like a referral thing.
Um,

2272
02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:19.400
and your book is actually on,
on there as well.
Extreme ownership.

2273
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:24.950
Nice.
Nice.
I like that.
But yeah,
that's it.
That's a good way.
Good deal.

2274
02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:25.620
Cool.

2275
02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:30.200
Couple of ways to support the podcast and the Onnit stuff is pretty obvious when

2276
02:30:30.201 --> 02:30:31.670
you go on there,
you can click on there,

2277
02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:36.920
click on that link to if you're going to show if you're going to get alpha brain

2278
02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:40.430
or or or a shroom tech or or Krill oil or whatever,
whatever,

2279
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:43.580
all the dope stuff on there.
But um,

2280
02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:47.390
if you click through there,
you'll get the 10% off.

2281
02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:51.620
Oh Nice.
Or just go to on it on it.

2282
02:30:51.650 --> 02:30:55.430
O n n I t.com/jocko same thing.

2286
02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:12.320
he's paying for server costs and all this stuff Quitman and whatnot.

2287
02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:18.510
Me,
I'm just showing up and talking so appreciate the support.

2288
02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:22.530
So echoes not common out of pocket for the Gig.

2289
02:31:25.350 --> 02:31:29.370

2291

2293
02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:48.940

2294
02:31:53.191 --> 02:31:56.010
to start a Facebook page,
I think,

2295
02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:01.170
and Echo Charles is going to start a Facebook page,
Jocko podcast,

2296
02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:05.400
Facebook page.
That'll be good.
I think

2297
02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:10.620
Andy,
thanks for leaving reviews and the podcast on iTunes.
That's kind of how,

2298
02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:15.090
another way that the word gets spread and of the book,

2299
02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:19.230
extreme ownership on amazon.com that also helps us.

2300
02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:21.203
And finally,

2301
02:32:23.620 --> 02:32:27.820
if you really want to help me get out there in the world,

2302
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:32.470
in your car,
in the train,
at your apartment,

2303
02:32:32.471 --> 02:32:36.520
at your house where every you are at work or at play,

2304
02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:41.020
get out there and get after it.

2305
02:32:44.310 --> 02:32:48.930
So until next time,
this is Jocko and echo

2306
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.630
out.
