This is Jocko podcast number 75 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.570
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.080
We have shared the incommunicable experience of war.

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.120
We have felt we still feel the passion of life to its top

5
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.720
in our youth.

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.500
Our hearts were touched by fire.

7
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.840
That's a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes Supreme Court judge.

8
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.460
Lots of people know that,
but they may not know.

9
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.850
Civil War soldier served with the 20th Regiment of Massachusetts,

10
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.680
volunteer infantry

11
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.450
saw action all over the place.
Peninsula campaign,

12
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.540
the wilderness.

13
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.010
He was wounded at the battle of balls bluff,

14
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:14.011
also wounded and Antietam and also wounded at the battle of Chancellorville.

15
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.520
So I think it's safe to say that he knew and understood war.

16
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:26.521
And that quote right there is from the beginning of another book about another

17
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:34.680
man that new war,
Major Dick Winters.

18
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:39.180
Now we've covered Dick winters before his book on this podcast.

19
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
Number 17 beyond band of brothers.
Great Book,

20
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.060
lots of lessons learned,

21
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.340
but there's another book which is called the conversations with major dick

22
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:55.050
winters life lessons from the commander of the band of brothers.

23
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.040
And it's written by a guy named Colonel Cole c King seat,

24
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.460
who was a friend,
Dick Winters,

25
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.770
and who actually was the coauthor behind that book,

26
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.060
beyond band of brothers.

27
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080
So what's cool about this book is it really parses out some lessons about

28
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.690
leadership in a conversational manner with Dick winters.

29
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.800
The things that he thought and the lessons that he learned,

30
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.570
which I mean,
when you get an opportunity to learn for someone like this,

31
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:30.420
you know what I do?
I just be quiet.
I listened and I learned.

32
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.800
Or in this case I read and I learned.

33
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.910
So this is also the guy,
if you haven't seen this series on Hbo,

34
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
Band of brothers,
just go stop and just go watch it.
It's,
I dunno what it is,

35
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.510
like 12 suit,
12 episodes.
They're all awesome.
Everybody asks me all the time,

36
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.511
what's realistic war movies that one band of brothers and then the Pacific,

37
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.040
all both HBO series,
they're both phenomenal.
And I recommend you watch,

38
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.960
you'll learn a lot about dick winters on that.
And the,

39
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.120
and the guy that plays Dick winters does a great job.

40
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.300
And the way they tell the story and the realism and all that.

41
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.040
It's just an awesome series.
But here we can learn,

42
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
not interpreted through a movie but actually from the man as he spoke it.

43
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680
So here we go.
Taking it to the book right now

44
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.110
from Dick Winters

45
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.090
d day was my first time in combat.
So right there.

46
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.270
Let's just talk about that for a second.
Your first time in combat,

47
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.710
what's your mission?
The day

48
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.790
one of the largest military operations of all time.

49
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:44.650
That's your first day in combat.
Get some
back to the book.

50
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.490
I was mentally prepared and felt that I had done everything necessary to prepare

51
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.491
myself for this precise moment and you never know if you will measure up as a

52
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:58.180
leader until the minute arrives.
When you face the enemy for the first time,

53
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.310
baptism by fire as a soldier sacrament,
there was always doubt.

54
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.020
Hopefully in combat you perform as you train.

55
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.370
So I can't imagine that baptism by fire d day again get get some sense of

56
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.800
another good movie saving private Ryan.

57
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.500
The opening scene of that is the same thing.
And
that's,

58
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.100
that's one of the most intense parts of a movie ever is the d day when they're

59
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.160
hitting the beaches.
It's crazy to watch but watch it.

60
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.370
Cause it'll give you a feeling for what Dick winters is talking about.

61
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.600
And just imagine all these preparation that you do.
You're getting ready.

62
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.770
And guess what?
Here it comes.
Little mission called D Day.

63
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.270
Now they all they have,

64
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.020
that was their initial operation was during the day,

65
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.760
but then they fought all over the place.
And again,

66
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.040
we cover this and in beyond band of brothers,

67
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.030
but one of the most intense parts of their campaign was at Bastogne.

68
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.080
So even though d day was hard,
things didn't get easier once dd was completed,

69
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.540
as much as I'm saying,
Oh yeah,
d day was crazy.
Guess what?

70
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.010
It wasn't even the hardest part for them.

71
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.580
Things got worse back to the book.

72
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.610
Most of the soldiers and easy company also felt that Bastogne was the most

73
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.993
challenging month of the war.

74
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.340
Staff Sergeant Bill Guan near later claimed that he had been scared before,

75
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.560
but he was absolutely petrified at Bastogne.
From my perspective,

76
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.640
Bastogne was the most miserable place I've been in my life.

77
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.250
I was wet through and through and naturally being a paratrooper.

78
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.370
I didn't have a change of clothes,
no blanket,
nothing,

79
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.220
and it was a cold son of a gun.

80
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.440
Things were all snafued walking around in the black of night,

81
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:57.220
not knowing where we were,
exactly where everybody else was.
Houses,

82
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.730
burning civilians,
crying,

83
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:03.590
wringing your hands and behind every Bush a a perspective enemy.

84
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.340
We took our greatest number of casualties during that campaign.

85
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.710
Easy company was never the same after Bastogne we lost so many because we lost

86
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.710
so many veterans who had fought in Normandy and Holland,

87
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.030
Joe Toy Bill Gorn,
Air Buck Compton,

88
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.140
dawn who blur and many others.
So this is,

89
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.550
this is where I started thinking,
okay,
leadership lesson learned right here.

90
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.760
I operated the battalion command post that was situated approximately 75 yards

91
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:42.510
from the main line of resistance.
You might not think 75 yards.

92
00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:43.440
It's consequential,

93
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.800
but it gave me the opportunity to think things through and divorce myself from

94
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:52.590
the chaos surrounding the front line and to make calm,

95
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.870
rational decisions under pressure.

96
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.020
That is the toughest challenge for any leader.

97
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.630
So obviously we're talking about detachment here,

98
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.580
and I've talked about the fact that in order to detach,

99
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.410
you can move off the line like six inches.
I'm not kidding.
In a smaller group,

100
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.300
you know when a single platoon,
he's talking about a battalion,

101
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:16.020
so they've got hundreds of guys,
so 75 yards is more appropriate.

102
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.100
But if you're running a smaller unit,
like one company or maybe a platoon,

103
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.960
you got 30 40 guys.
If you move back off that firing line,

104
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.190
six inches,
a foot maybe,
you know,
maybe three feet or six feet,

105
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:33.120
you just step back and you get yourself out of that firefight where you can look

106
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:35.700
around.
That's what you're going to be able to do.

107
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.790
You're going to be able to detach yourself from the chaos and the mayhem and

108
00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:45.120
make calm,
rational decisions under pressure.
And that's such a big deal.

109
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.540
Like we're,
when you do that,
when you detach and then you can,
you know,

110
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:53.541
you have a clear vision and a lot of times the answer or a solution to some big

111
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:56.400
problem is just so simple.
Remember that story you were telling it,

112
00:07:56.401 --> 00:07:58.090
the muster where,
you know your,

113
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.710
your guys had an injured neck so he couldn't participate but you wanted to come

114
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:04.200
along until you watch them from the outside.
And he's like,

115
00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:07.410
why don't they just step back and peel left?
Or why don't they,

116
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:10.320
why don't they get online and peel whatever the call was.

117
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.260
So the story is there was a guy that actually,

118
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.010
he was the Delta platoon commander,
Ntu Bruser.
He took over my position,

119
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:20.970
he took over as the t you bruiser commander and then I was running the training.

120
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.460
So once I was running the training,
you know,

121
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.490
now I was overall making things happen and he was going through the training,

122
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.090
a different block of training and he broke his neck,

123
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.750
broke his neck and thank God he didn't hurt his spinal cord,

124
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.370
but he broke vertebrae in his neck.

125
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.430
So we had to wear one of those big crazy neck braces and he couldn't actually do

126
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.261
the physical training.

127
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.700
It wasn't allowed to bear any weight for a certain amount of time.
But you know,

128
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.260
luckily he was able to keep his,
his job because he was very experienced.

129
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.870
And so we were going through the land warfare portion of training and I said,

130
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:03.300
hey man,
you know,
I know you can't participate but come out with me,
you know,

131
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.560
come out and check it out and you know,

132
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.060
you can see your guys and you can watch how they perform and you can,
you know,

133
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.200
teach them some stuff and learn from,
from what happens.
So cool.

134
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.630
He comes out and he's actually one of my,
one of my best friends.

135
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:17.370
So of course we just wouldn't hang out anyways.
So,
you know,

136
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.440
of course he has a chance to come out and hang out with me.

137
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.910
The desert for a few weeks is going to do it.
So we,
we get out there and,

138
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.100
and you know,
you've heard the stories about the training that I ran.

139
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:31.101
It was really hard and evil and crazy and psychotic.

140
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.110
And we're doing that.
You know,
we got,
we,
in that case,

141
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:35.910
we had these really high speed laser,

142
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.270
laser tag system and you've got guys pin down,
you got explosions going off,

143
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:41.640
you've got just total mayhem going on in.

144
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.970
His guys kind of froze up and they're all pinned down in this little sorta

145
00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:50.790
ravine valley type thing.
And I got guys,
I got my guys,
my opposing force,

146
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.660
so the seals that are pretending to be bad guys pretending to be moved,

147
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.180
they're all up in the mountains shooting down on them and killing everyone and

148
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:57.751
his guys,

149
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:00.240
his leadership is just kind of frozen and they're sitting there and not do

150
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:04.860
anything.
And you know,
he says to me,
hey,
can I help them?

151
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.060
And I,
I kind of thought about it from it.
I go,
yeah,
go ahead.
I go give him,

152
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.810
you know,
tell him what to do,
give him a prompt.
And He,
and he just,
you know,

153
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.320
goes down to the leader,
one of the leaders and says,
hey,

154
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:20.190
get online and peel left.
And so the guy looks at him.

155
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:21.450
And what does get online?

156
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.470
I mean it's an organizational movement where all your troops are pointed in all

157
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:31.260
different directions.
Yeah,
boom.
You'd say contact right online.

158
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.440
And that means everyone's going to basically facing that direction who get a

159
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:35.730
couple guys that are doing risk security.

160
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:38.610
A couple of guys that are doing flexicurity but everyone is now oriented in the

161
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:42.420
same direction.
And then the next call that comes is PLF boom.

162
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:46.020
And they're all going to start moving in a direction that's going to get them

163
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:50.850
out of this immediate threat.
So he tells,
he kinda says the guy,
hey,

164
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.290
get online,
peel left.
So the guy looks at him and he just yells out,

165
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.880
get online,
peel left,

166
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:59.640
and then everyone repeats that command and then everyone does it.

167
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.980
And within a minute they're there.

168
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.920
Homefree it literally took like one minute once I made the decision.
Yeah.

169
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.250
So and then so,
so they get out of there and he looks at me and he goes,

170
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.150
he goes,
pan,
it's so easy when you're way up here.

171
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.180
Now way up here to put it in perspective was four feet behind these guys.

172
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:21.061
That's all it was.

173
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:23.790
It wasn't like we were up on some mountain top with some incredible,
if,
you know,

174
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:24.870
we were,
we were there,

175
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:27.760
we were standing next to the guys and we are a little bit elevated cause they're

176
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.190
laying down and we're standing up.

177
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:34.080
But it's not inconceivable that you wouldn't have the same perspective if you

178
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:37.860
just step back and maybe,
you know,
shuffled over a little bit.
And he says,

179
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.090
it's so easy when,
when you're up here.
And I said,
Bro,

180
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.390
you remember when we went through training?
And he says,
yeah.
And I said,

181
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.810
it was always like this for me.
And it was,
I was,

182
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.440
I would always just put myself back just enough to be able to see what the is.

183
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.070
Yeah.
So yes,
this detachment that he's talking about,
and again,

184
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.580
in a battalion situation where you're going 75 yards and 10 in a business

185
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:03.820
situation,
you know,
I actually see people do this.
You're in a,

186
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.090
you're in a meeting and there's everyone around them around the table.

187
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:08.920
And there's some problem that can't be solved.

188
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.850
Literally step up and step away from the table and just step back.

189
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:15.430
Get away from the group because they're all mobbed up in group.

190
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:17.830
Think everyone's going down the same trail.

191
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.100
They're thinking about the same stuff and there's no new ideas because they're

192
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:24.580
all right there in this vortex.
Step away from the table.
Yeah.

193
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.220
It's same thing like step,
step away from your computer.
Yeah.

194
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.920
You get to some point where you're just,
you don't know where to go with some,

195
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.190
you're looking for some kind of a solution to a problem.
Just step back,

196
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.920
step back,
see more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And writing.

197
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.170
A lot of times they'll suggest just skip to the end.
Don't worry about this.

198
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.130
Just go to the ant.
How do you want it to end?

199
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.180
And then it'll kind of open your mind up.
It'll,

200
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.930
it'll make you sort of forget about this problem right in front of you,
you know?

201
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.260
Yeah.

202
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.850
I can give you kind of an overall view of move you towards the solution that you

203
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:56.320
know can be found.
Yeah.
Even in an argument with you wife or something like that?

204
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.350
Oh yeah.
Well for sure.
That's a big one for sure.
Cause when you,
yeah,

205
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:01.300
you definitely need to do it.
They're entrenched.

206
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.950
You don't need to get entrenched.
Don't do that.
All right,

207
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.860
and this part's been covered before on multiple occasions.

208
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.690
You know what we're gonna do.
Cover it again,

209
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.270
little piece about discipline.
I did have a routine,

210
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.980
a routine that was instilled into me by Colonel Sync at Koa.

211
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.120
Colonel Sink insisted that officer's always shave in the morning regardless of

212
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:25.990
the situation.

213
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.850
He would say you shave every morning for the troops and if you want to shave

214
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:33.250
every evening for the women,
that's up to you.

215
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.560
I followed his orders because I realized that I had to set the proper example

216
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:42.550
for the men I needed to get their attention and let them all know that I

217
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:45.940
intended to be around for awhile and that the situation was not as bad as they

218
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.320
might think.
I remembered before second battalion attacked Foy.

219
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.770
I had awakened early and shaved before I ate breakfast.

220
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.510
I later discovered that I had cut my face in multiple places.
I'm Colonel Sink,

221
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.600
came up to check on the battalion's readiness before the attack commenced.

222
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.670
He took one look at me and smiled.

223
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.960
I realized that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold morning.

224
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.490
In hindsight,

225
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.270
shaving a zero dark 30 and freezing temperatures was pretty ridiculous.

226
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.410
So you know when we talk about this all time,
got to shave,

227
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.490
got to maintain unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

228
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.140
But what's cool,
but what I,

229
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.050
the reason I wanted to go over this again is because look at what he's doing

230
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:30.670
psychologically to the troops.
He saying,
I know I had to set an example.

231
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.380
I needed to get their attention and make them realize like,
hey,

232
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.480
we're going to here for awhile and you know what?
I'm just going to go daily.

233
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:39.610
This is no big deal.
Oh,
you're worried about this stuff.

234
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.980
I'm still shaving over here.
I'm still waking up at zero 400 shaving and,

235
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.390
and you're worried about this stuff.
Nothing to worry about.
We're good to go.

236
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.000
And you need to maintain the same discipline.

237
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.540
So that leading by example clearly is a big deal right there and maintaining

238
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:58.370
that routine,
maintaining that discipline.
Now,

239
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.720
speaking of discipline back to the book,

240
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.350
regardless of how disciplined and outfit is,
too much time on your hands,

241
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:05.600
too little activity and too much alcohol,

242
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.480
make a vol tile combination.

243
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.810
So this book skips around a little bit,

244
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.620
but I put this in here because this is,

245
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.280
this is actually talking about when they were done fighting and now everyone was

246
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.920
kind of idol.
He has some idle people on their hands,

247
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.860
but it related to discipline.
So I wanted to lock it in a little bit.

248
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:27.500
Back to the book.
The battalion was no longer a combat unit,

249
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:28.790
but a garrison outfit.

250
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.480
It was more important to keep the troops gainfully employed to prevent boredom

251
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.830
and monotony.
That would lead to a breakdown in discipline.
And when that occurs,

252
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.090
soldiers get careless.
Consequently,
the first thing we organized,

253
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.130
we're calisthenics and athletic programs.
You know,
I always joke about,
you know,

254
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:50.420
when people say they have some kind of problem and I'm,
Oh,
do burpees,
hey,

255
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:53.030
you know what a good solution to all problems are.
Calisthenics,

256
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.880
just start doing calisthenics.
I liked that.
I liked that attitude.

257
00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.560
I vividly recall this is,
this is another reason why I put this in.

258
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.790
I vividly recall watching the men's strip to their waist or only wearing their

259
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:06.500
shorts as they played baseball.

260
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.180
The sight of all those scars made me conscious of the fact that only a handful

261
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.910
of men in the battalion had been lucky enough to make it through all four

262
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:18.110
campaigns without at least one scar.
Some men had two,

263
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:22.040
three or even four scars on their chest,
back,
arms or legs.

264
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.800
Keep in mind that this was after the war,

265
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.330
so I was looking only at men who will not seriously wounded.
Next,

266
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:32.030
we set up rifle ranges and sharpened our marksmanship,

267
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.240
close order drill and troop reviews.

268
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.150
We're once again back on the training schedule.

269
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.100
I also established a schedule where each of our four platoons could rotate every

270
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:47.150
72 hours to a ski lodge in the Alps for rest and relaxation.

271
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.900
The purpose of using this retreat was to let them and get away from the routine

272
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:55.760
of a military schedule.
So first of all,
when,
when I got to seal team one,

273
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.160
and actually it was,
it wasn't what I,
when I first got there,

274
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:03.161
but there was a master chief at seal team one that had showed up in 1971 or 1972

275
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.130
to seal team one and CLT in one.
You know,

276
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.940
you had 150 guys are roughly on the team at that time.

277
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.780
And they had had 34 killed in action in Vietnam at seal team one and wounded

278
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:21.770
was,
I don't know how many wounded,
but it was a lot.
But this,

279
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:24.920
this guy who was a master chief when I met him and he was telling me that when

280
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:27.950
he,
you know,
at the seal team you would,
you know,
you PT in the morning,

281
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.490
just like a sports team,
you get,
you get to work and you work out and here's the,

282
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:36.230
he's a new guy,
right?
And he's,
they PT and then they go in the shower,

283
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.870
you know,
to,
to,
to wash off.
And it's the same thing.

284
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:42.440
He's like looking at every single guys scarred up,
wounded,
you know,

285
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.590
slashes on their chest.
Bullet holes in him.

286
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.580
And he kind of was saying to himself,
damn,
you know,
this is a,

287
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:52.620
this has been trial by fire for these guys.

288
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.560
But beyond that,
what he's talking about here clearly is,

289
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.190
if you,
and I'll tell you this,
especially with,
you know,

290
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.210
18 year old,
19 year old,
20 year old males that have joined the military,

291
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.060
if you don't find something for them to do productive,

292
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.610
they're going to find something to do that's not going to be productive and

293
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:17.640
it'll be fun for him.
It'll be fun formed are gonna have a good time,

294
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:18.474
but it's not,

295
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.440
there's a chance that they could be doing something better than what you're

296
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:26.010
letting them do.
Now,
of course,
he talks about the fact that he's given him,

297
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:28.730
still giving them time to go out to the ski lodge and,

298
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.180
and break away from it a little bit.

299
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.000
But you just gotta be careful in how you do that.

300
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.000
You gotta be careful in how you do that.
It's,

301
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.930
it can backfire if you're not careful.

302
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:45.210
And the first time I was ever kind of detached from a seal platoon on a a was

303
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:49.080
when I went to training the training department at [inaudible],

304
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.120
what we used to call it training cell,
which sounds legit and it wasn't a gin.

305
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.640
So at training cell,
the first trip I went on with a platoon,

306
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:00.810
because I was always in the platoon.

307
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.020
So the first trip I went on with the platoon and I was outside of the platoon

308
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.870
and I was you,

309
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.340
you could say I was an instructor even though we weren't running around calling

310
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:15.120
ourselves instructor instructors,
we would call ourselves actually the cadre,

311
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.040
I don't know why,
it's just like,
Oh yeah,

312
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.280
cadre sound's still is an official term.
Yeah.

313
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.380
Kadri the training cadre.
So when we were at training cell,

314
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.680
because the instructors are kind of considered the buds instructors,

315
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.900
the guys are the basic training and,

316
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.690
and we didn't really want to be buds instructors.
We were the contract.

317
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.510
So,
and I'd never,
I didn't mean this is just,
this is just my own assessment.

318
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.660
I didn't pick up Kadra Eddie can call ourselves Godrej didn't make up training

319
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:44.340
sale.
I wish I would've made up all those things,

320
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:47.880
but I just flowed into him as a lucky young new guy.

321
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.110
Or actually at this point I wasn't a new guy anymore.
But it's true though.
Right?

322
00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:55.080
It's not like you just gave yourself a title that will,
no,
no,
no,
we're the car.

323
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.780
Yeah.
Oh,
training cadre.
Yeah.
Oh,
hey,

324
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.750
I need to talk to the guys in the contrary over here.
Yeah,
that's what,

325
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.520
that's what we called ourselves.
Well,
yeah,
so it's like,
you know,
like with the,

326
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.530
you open it,
you get to the gym and then you know,

327
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:07.490
you're teaching people and then you're like,
okay,
yeah,
I'm the instructor.

328
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.840
And then you think,
you know what,
I like professor.
That's better.
No,

329
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.720
it wasn't that I didn't make that.
No,
no,
no.
They called,
you know,
for years.

330
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.320
And actually I think Roger Hayden talked about it when,

331
00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:21.390
when he was on the podcast he was talking about when he was contrary,
so,
right.

332
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.570
It's been around forever.
Right.
That's why I just like professor,
it's like,

333
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:28.290
it's true you are the professor,
but it's like,
it just sounds,
it's just better.

334
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.610
You know,
it sounds better.
You want,

335
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.980
go ahead and go with that one and just go with contrary.
Yeah.
I like Nah,

336
00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:35.610
don't even know what I was talking about.
Oh,
so I was,

337
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.060
I was in the contract for the first time and we went on a trip and went to a

338
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:43.590
trip where they have good times to be had where we were.
It was a,

339
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:46.800
it was a place where there's some good training,
but there's also good times.

340
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.250
And you picked us up from Harley Flanagan,
this term bridge.

341
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.580
I hadn't really heard wilding.
Did you ever hear him say that?
He's like,

342
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:55.720
oh we were just wilding,

343
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.080
which I think is a better term than the term that we discussed,

344
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:02.410
which was partying.
Right?
Oh there's good.
Yeah,
we were partying.

345
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.540
I like wild and better cause that entails all kinds of other things that'll be a

346
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.300
little bit more wild wilding out or once they see a while,

347
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.350
and I never really heard of him.
I'd never really heard it before,

348
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.340
but when Holly sent me clearly know what it is.
Yeah.
And it's in his book too.

349
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:16.300
He talks about wilding.

350
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.250
So we went to this place with a seal platoon where there was good training and

351
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.540
good wilding to be had.
And I remember the first time that these guys,
you know,

352
00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:25.901
we get there,

353
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:29.170
we work a little bit and then they're going to go out into the town.

354
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.690
And I remember thinking myself,

355
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:36.691
they'd been in the field for a few days and they were all fired up young frogman

356
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.540
and I was thinking myself,
how is this even gonna work?
Like there's no,

357
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.060
there's no possibility of this going well.
And it did.
You know everyone fine,

358
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.940
but you just see all these guys,
they're ready.

359
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:48.770
Do you know they're ready to explode and you're going to,

360
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.890
they've been in the field,
they have dehydrated,

361
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.050
they'd been in the field for four days or five days.

362
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:55.840
They're all dehydrated and they completed their operation.

363
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.650
They feel good about it and now you're going to let them out in town.
Yeah,

364
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.290
you gotta be careful in those scenarios.
You got to put something we would,

365
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.540
you know,
sometimes you just say,
hey,
look God,
do whatever you want tonight.

366
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:11.430
But where P team tomorrow at zero 700 so then everyone knows they can,

367
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:16.300
they can wild to a point,
but they can't.
They got to put some kind of a governor,

368
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.160
some kind of a governor on the scenario.

369
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.900
And here's a cool piece where Dick winters,

370
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:29.150
you know,
he talks about it,
I've talked about this before,
but
just,

371
00:22:29.151 --> 00:22:32.830
just a piece about his view of what America was doing at the time.

372
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.110
Back to the book of the United States went to war,

373
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.850
not to conquer territory or to subject their fellow man,

374
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:45.090
but merely to liberate a conquered people from the chains if tyranny there is a

375
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:48.070
certain nobility and all that.

376
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.350
Today we are bombarded in the news media about how everyone hates America and

377
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:58.000
how this country is deployed around the world.
World War II wasn't like that.

378
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.590
And I am proud to be a part of it.
So again,

379
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:04.770
I've said this a bunch of times,
you know,

380
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.810
we went there and lost hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and in and in

381
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.390
the Pacific theater
and we took nothing.
Hmm.

382
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.690
We only gave

383
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.240
some thoughts on leadership from Dick Winters,
leadership.

384
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.450
Leadership's defining quality is honesty to honesty and fairness and

385
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.420
consistency.

386
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.980
I was able to develop a sixth sense during the war that allowed me to size up a

387
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.210
situation rapidly.

388
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.490
I could look at terrain and be able to see opportunities instead of challenges

389
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.000
by leading from the front.
I believe I achieved a high degree of success.

390
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.310
So I thought that was a very,
very interesting combination.
Honesty,

391
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.110
fairness and consistency.

392
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.160
You don't hear those a lot about being a great leader.
I mean,

393
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.190
I always talk about the number one attribute of a leaders is humility and I

394
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.210
definitely believe that humility is important,
but honesty,

395
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.190
that's clearly

396
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.810
a thought and a concept of leadership that I'd think that misses a lot of

397
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.410
people.
I think,

398
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:21.200
and we've talked about plenty of cases on the podcast here where we say,
oh,

399
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:23.450
what if this is going on?
And I say,
look,
do you want to be honest with them?

400
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.180
You know,
so I've definitely said that before,

401
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.110
but I'm going to start saying it more because I'm learning a little something

402
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:32.840
from Dick winters today.
But you know,

403
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.270
I remember we had a case where someone was saying,
Hey,

404
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:38.030
I'm going to leave this job.
I'm gonna take another job and what should I do?

405
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:41.240
Should I tell him?
Should I not?
And we kind of went around and I was like,
look,

406
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:43.850
just tell them the truth.
Just say,
look,
hey,
this is what's going on.

407
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.960
I'm going to be,
I've got a better opportunity.
I'm going to take it.
Cause,

408
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.810
and in the long run,
you're in the long run.
It's going to be,

409
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.670
you're going to be better off if you're honest with people.

410
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.530
And so I obviously to think about this quality,
it's something I've,

411
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.240
I've thought about but not as clearly as this as,
as Dick winner saying.

412
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.870
That's the defining quality.
That's obviously important.

413
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.820
Something that I will talk about more now,
definitely believed it,

414
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.450
but we'll talk about it more
now.

415
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.160
If you've seen the movie band of brothers or the series band of brothers,
they,

416
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.570
they do a good job of showing the beginning when they form up and there's a guy,

417
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.090
there's a guy in leadership position called captains.

418
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:31.091
So bell and he's not a good leader and they do a good job of portraying why he

419
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:34.280
wasn't a good leader in the series.

420
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.690
But here's what Dick winters had to say about it.
Back to the book captain.

421
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:42.140
So bell commanded through fear and intimidation.

422
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.400
That is not how a leader should conduct himself.

423
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.630
Sabelle was not just unfair,
he was mean spirited.

424
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:55.310
His attitude created a special bond with an easy company that allowed the men to

425
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:58.250
identify with their platoons more so within with the company,

426
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.150
which is more normal in most units.
Military units,

427
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.610
second lieutenants by their nature are a clannish group.

428
00:26:05.611 --> 00:26:08.120
So you've got a company commander and then he's got three,

429
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.590
usually three platoons underneath them,

430
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.330
and each one of those is run by a second lieutenant.

431
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:14.720
So the second lieutenants are the platoon commanders.
Second lieutenants,

432
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.570
by their nature are clannish group.
Some are more serious than others,

433
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:20.390
but for the most part they wander around a military post.

434
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:25.391
As General Eisenhower once said in a rather aimless search for excitement,

435
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.190
easy companies,
platoon leaders,
of which I was one,

436
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.450
did our best to take care of our soldiers to soften.
So bells,

437
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:37.070
dictatorial behavior,

438
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.650
I lost all respect for our commander the day he announced to the officers in

439
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:45.420
easy,
we will lead through fear,

440
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.540
not by example that that's just the opposite of any leadership principle that I

441
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:56.160
could ever conceive is to lead through fear instead.
Of example,

442
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.930
when you get,
well,
I don't know about your dad,
but if your dad says,

443
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.180
or if you say to your kids,
do what I say,

444
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:08.060
not what I do you know that you've heard that for sure.
For sure.
That's it.

445
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.950
And when,
if you want to put their fear onto that,
it's do what I say,

446
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:14.550
not what I do or else or else.
Yeah,

447
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:19.300
I'm going to get out the belt or the kids down south they say,
yeah,

448
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.460
I'm going to get out the switch.
Get out the switch.
Not all the time,

449
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:27.150
but you know he said that he said switch.
Where was he from?

450
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.430
That's from Brooklyn,
New York.
Then ain't got them switches in Brooklyn,
New York.

451
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.550
I'm here to tell you why they do our uncle,
why they found something wrong.

452
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.550
He made me go get my switch.
He said,
go get a switch.

453
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:41.210
I don't know what that means by the way.
At this point.
Oh,

454
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.850
because you're a little kid.
Yeah.
Go get an im from quiet.
They don't say switch.

455
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:47.490
You know?
Apparently other people say switch.

456
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.920
I didn't know which made them kind of more mad.

457
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.580
So then he had to brief you on what a switch was.
Yeah,
he didn't,

458
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.660
this is the thing I'm going to be,

459
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.850
it's kind of like digging your own grave in a way,
you know?
Very similar.

460
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.050
Very similar.
Yeah.
Back to the book,

461
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:07.770
it made such an impression on me that I recorded his words in my diary.

462
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.960
Under ordinary circumstances,

463
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:14.130
a junior company officer attempts to reflect his company commanders leadership

464
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:16.260
style,
but easy companies,

465
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:20.520
lieutenants found that they simply could not emulate the image of so bell and

466
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:21.990
still live with themselves.

467
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.670
Sabelle had no friends within the company and few within the regimen.

468
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.530
At the end of each day,

469
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.150
he went one way and we lieutenants when another hoping not to run into him at

470
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:34.410
the officer's club.

471
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.650
He lacked confidence in his own ability as an infantry commander.
He was,

472
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.180
he was completely honest,
but he couldn't read a map to save his neck.

473
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.580
His knowledge of tactics and fire maneuver was extremely poor.

474
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.910
So horrible situation.
And you know,
this is,

475
00:28:55.911 --> 00:28:59.090
this is one of those things where he's talking about how everyone,

476
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.170
no one wants to hang around with them,
right?
And,
and I've heard leaders say,

477
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.640
Oh,
good beaders not going to be liked or not going to be loved by everyone.

478
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.980
And that there's some truth to that,
right?
Of course not.

479
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.060
Not everyone's going to love you,

480
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.500
but there's also a difference when no one likes you.
You're not doing a good job.

481
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.170
You're not doing a good job at all.
And you know,

482
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.550
I hung out with all my guys all the time through the chain of command,

483
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.290
everyone to hang out.
Let's go,
let's go,
let's,
let's hang out.

484
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:29.300
It wasn't good running away from me at the end of the war to escape.

485
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.420
That's,
that's not a good sign.
Yeah.

486
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.150
Lake one guys say I'm not here to make friends.
Yeah,

487
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:38.870
that's another classic right here to make friends.
No,
but I actually,
you know,

488
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:39.704
there's,
I heard,

489
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.120
I've heard officers say that in the military you see officers I've heard say

490
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:46.900
look your,
and now they'll say like,
hey,
it's not a popularity contest,

491
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.560
which is not,

492
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.530
clearly you're going to make decisions that can be hard for people to swallow,

493
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.820
but to have people running away from you because they don't like you as a human

494
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:56.830
being,
that's not a good position to be in your,

495
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.100
you're not doing a good job as a leader.
You need to reassess what you're,

496
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:03.280
what you're,
what you're doing and how you're doing it.

497
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.100
And this is kind of reflective of what Dick winters attitude was.

498
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.800
Back to the book.
Easy Company didn't belong to me.

499
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.740
It belonged to the soldiers.

500
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.100
I was privileged to be a small part of its history.

501
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.880
Officers and commanders in particular are merely caretakers that the

502
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:33.730
paratroopers respected me is more than enough reward.

503
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.130
So there's this totally,
totally different attitude.
Right.

504
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.410
And there is something weird that happens with the military.
You'll hear a guy a,

505
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.320
it's a,
it's a contradictory stay.
There's a dichotomy.

506
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.630
You'll hear a guy say my soldiers,
right?
Or my marines.

507
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.880
And there's two ways that that can be taken.
One of them is very positive.

508
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.330
My soldiers,
I am going to take care of my soldiers.
Hey,

509
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.100
don't come down here and talk to my soldiers like that,
right?
Or Hey,
you know,

510
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:08.410
I need to make sure my soldiers have the gear that they need.

511
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.080
I need to make sure my marines have,
and that's what they mean.

512
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:12.580
That in the best possible way,

513
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:17.110
there is another side to that which is completely negative,

514
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:19.690
which is these are my marines,

515
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.710
meaning you own them.
Meaning I'll do what I want with them,
right?

516
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:28.520
And so I've seen guys on both sides of that edge and you can hear a go,

517
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.400
you can hear a good leader say my marines,

518
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.220
you can hear a good leader say my soldiers are going to a good leader,

519
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.180
say my seals.

520
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.890
And think of it in a positive way and you can have a crappy leader.
Say,

521
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.450
my soldiers,
my marines,
my seals,
and you just think,
dude,

522
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.180
no stop.
And so for,

523
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.710
and especially when you get dick winters who was universally respected in his,

524
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.820
in the military and definitely in his battalion,
in his,
in his company.

525
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.070
And he's a guy that's saying,
look,

526
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.100
it was theirs that just tells you that's where your leadership perspective

527
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:06.850
should come from.
Yeah.
I always felt that better way instead of thing.
My,

528
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.830
one of the few things as far as feelings go cause I,
I,

529
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.580
I experienced that a lot when people would be like my,
this and that,
you know,

530
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.690
and if I see what you're doing and it's like you're just the boss and the owner

531
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:21.580
of all of this kind of thing,
you know,
kind of thing.

532
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.940
But with it felt like and feels like with people like my soldiers,

533
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:31.180
you know there is a lot of room for like cause cause men,
these are my brother.

534
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:32.590
Exactly.
You know my guys.

535
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.360
But let's say they're talking about like something else,
like a big one.
Um,

536
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.930
like the bartenders I used to work with,

537
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:41.090
every once in a while you'd have one say,
well,
Hey,
I got this and you know,

538
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:43.820
my bar.
And when they talk to the customers,
you know,
they'd be like,
Hey,

539
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:47.360
what kind of,
I don't know if God could he have?
He goes,
well,
my best vodka is,

540
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.700
you know,
this.
And that had been,
they'd say my,
you know,

541
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.520
kind of like I'm the master of this whole domain here.

542
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:57.090
Everything here is mine and that I can bestow upon you kind of feeling.
Yeah.

543
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.330
Yeah.
That always kind of will.
They do do it.

544
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.000
It definitely in the military with inanimate objects,

545
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:04.490
not just soldiers and marines and sailors,

546
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.420
they do it with inanimate objects.
And you learn that in boot camp,
you know,

547
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.880
they say,
why are you on my parade deck?
Right?
Yes.

548
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.870
It gives you this feeling of like,
Dang,
this guy's really into this parade deck.

549
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.640
Meaning you know,
where you do marching,
you know,
they say,
get off my parade deck.

550
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:26.630
Yeah.
And it instills that kind of personal pride about something.
So again,

551
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:29.810
even that one can go both ways.
I guess it really,

552
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.460
you really have to understand what your intent is behind what you're saying and

553
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.810
you have to be careful.
I,
I always,

554
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.030
I feel subconscious about that and I'll give you an example.
My Gym.

555
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:45.650
Yeah.
Right.
My Gym,
we're not going to talk about victory MMA,
which,
you know,

556
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:48.200
we have partners and it's not solely my gym know,

557
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.170
but it's my gym where I change train.
Right.

558
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.650
But sometimes someone will say something and I'll feel like,
oh,

559
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:58.640
where do you train?
You know,
and,
and I could say,
I trained at my gym.

560
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.550
You know what I mean?
I feel like a real turd when I do that.
I got all victory.

561
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.380
Emma van fitness,
you know.
Oh,
D Mr. Jeff Glover.
Yeah.

562
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:09.200
That's where I trained and oh wait,
do you own that place?
Yeah,
yeah.

563
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:12.950
I'm one of the owners,
you know,
blah,
blah blah.
But yeah,
don't like that.

564
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.990
My,
Oh,
you get to sit in there for what a careful,
be careful with that too.

565
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:20.300
I always thought if you said our,
you know,

566
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:25.130
especially even in a bartender situation what we have,
it's kind of like us as a,

567
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:27.950
as an establishment,
right.
You know,
kind of thing.
I'm part of that.

568
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:31.970
When you say are your part of it,
you know,
so it kind of still puts that forward.

569
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:35.030
Like I'm kind of giving this to you or offering whatever.

570
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.600
I'm taking some ownership,
but it's like I'm not the boss of this thing.

571
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.340
It kind of feels that way.
That's what I always thought.

572
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.250
Even if you like in your situation,
if you were like,
you know,
someone say,

573
00:34:44.251 --> 00:34:46.870
hey doc already trained,
we say,
well at our gym,
you know,

574
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.840
and it's kind of ambiguous as well,
which kindness seems more humble,
you know,

575
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:53.210
where it's like,
oh yeah,
you could be just a member,

576
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:57.270
but at least you're part of that community,
you know,
kind of thing.
So yeah,

577
00:34:57.271 --> 00:35:00.860
they use are careful.
That's all I'm saying.
You gotta be careful,

578
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.050
be careful with my marines,
my soldiers.
And again,

579
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.380
sometimes that's the most positive thing he could possibly say,

580
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.930
these are my seals.
Hey,

581
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.110
don't come down here and figuring to put my seals out in the field in a bad

582
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:17.480
situation.
It's not happening.
You know what I mean?
Your protective,

583
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:21.470
they're your brothers,
you know you have ownership of them,
but it's,

584
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.650
it's in a positive way as opposed to look all deploy my seals wherever I see

585
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:30.830
fit.
Like oh put a,
put a red flag on that dude's face.

586
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.470
Right
back to the book.

587
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.020
I think of easy company every day we sustained 150% casualties between the night

588
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:47.550
that we jumped into Normandy at v e day,

589
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:53.250
150% capital.
So for those of you that are wondering how you do that,

590
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.150
how you do that is you have people getting wounded multiple times and coming

591
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:01.770
back to the front and when your replacement show up they get wounded too.

592
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.390
So you,
you know,
you've got whatever,
150 people in your,

593
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.700
in your company and over the course of time people get wounded and leave and new

594
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:13.860
people come in to take their place and they get wounded as well.

595
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:16.980
And that's how you get up.
Over a hundred percent of your people being wounded.

596
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.290
The result of sharing all the stress throughout training and combat has created

597
00:36:24.291 --> 00:36:27.410
a bond between the metal VZ company that will last forever.

598
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.600
In a sense,
I don't think I ever left company E.

599
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.340
I may never against you the type of men in this outfit,
but to me,

600
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.520
easy company will always be my company in the sense that I will always remain a

601
00:36:44.961 --> 00:36:45.800
part of it.

602
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.510
To this day they remain my second family.

603
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.680
I still look at these men with great respect,
respect.

604
00:36:54.681 --> 00:36:57.500
I can't describe in words,

605
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.990
so there he makes it.

606
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:07.120
Same thing like he feels uncomfortable saying mine.

607
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.960
He has to put a quantifier on it and explained,
Hey,
not in that sense,

608
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.540
but I'll always be a part of it.
That's why it's mine.

609
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.330
More about leadership.
Back to the book,
leadership is difficult to define.

610
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.330
They talk about leadership at West Point every day.

611
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.720
Leadership starts with honesty,
dedication,

612
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.930
and having a man who is dependable and fair.

613
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.460
If you never deviate from the standards that you established,

614
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.290
men have faith in you and you'll be out front to set the example.

615
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.570
Sergeant Talbert once told me,
sir,
I'd follow you into hell.

616
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.000
I take a great deal of pride in his remark.
So again,

617
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:53.840
we're getting this leadership starts with honesty,
dedication,

618
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.370
dependable and fair.
So important,
so important,

619
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.720
being fair.
And you know,

620
00:37:59.721 --> 00:38:02.300
you see that a lot when it comes at doling out punishment.

621
00:38:02.301 --> 00:38:05.630
When people make mistakes,
are you fair enough?
You know,

622
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:10.070
does that person really deserve to lose their pay for 90 days or go on bread and

623
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:13.850
water or whatever kind of punishment you're going to bestow on someone.

624
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.840
Is that fair?
And people know if things are fair or not.
Yeah,

625
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.150
people know what's reasonable.
Hey,
do you think that,
you know,
when people say,

626
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.310
I'm going to make an example out of somebody before,
sometimes it'd be,

627
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.460
it's for different reasons.
Maybe be like,
oh,
I've been letting people slack,

628
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:34.880
so I gotta I got to make an example out of somebody to kind of reestablish the

629
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.270
kind of thing,
or maybe you know,
as a boss or whatever,

630
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.570
you really don't like the specific violation.
Like you've just re,

631
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.120
it's just one of your things,
you know,

632
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:49.150
so you can make an example for that reason.
Do you think that that's fair?

633
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.460
It can be,
but it's also a touchy subject.
You tell me.

634
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.570
I personally think,

635
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:59.650
let's say I'd been given some slack and people been showing up a little bit
late,

636
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.610
showing up a little bit late and I'm Kinda like,
hey man,
you know,

637
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.590
we need to be a little more in time.
And then finally on a Thursday,

638
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.140
guy shows up late for the meeting and I say,
hey,
you're suspended.

639
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:14.200
You're grounded.
You're,
you know,
you're gonna have to work this weekend.

640
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:16.330
I punish them hard,
super hard.

641
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:22.540
That doesn't make sense.
Right,
right.
And it doesn't make sense.
And people say,
Oh,

642
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.940
you know,
I'm not good.

643
00:39:23.941 --> 00:39:27.010
It's not being consistent because people have been being met.
However,

644
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.440
if I was to say,
hey guys,
check it out,

645
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.310
Bill just walking in right now and I've been letting it slide and I'll tell you

646
00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:34.510
what,
this is where it's getting us.

647
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:37.240
We'd been later and later we start slacking here.

648
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.370
We're going to start slacking in other places.

649
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:40.900
We can't afford to slack right now.

650
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:44.260
Our is to important from now on if we're late,

651
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.290
if you're late showing up to this meeting or you're late to an evolution that

652
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:51.730
we're about to do,
I'm going to drop the hammer so don't be late.
Is that fair?

653
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.300
Yeah.

654
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.300
Fair warning explanation as to why that's fair in my opinion.

655
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.080
Just going off the handle and smashing someone because you want to make an

656
00:40:02.081 --> 00:40:05.170
example of them.
That doesn't make sense to me.
Yeah.
I don't like it.

657
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.210
I don't do it.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
That'd be useful.
Yes.
If someone,

658
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.770
if there's a clearly delineated expectation that's been set and it gets violated

659
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:17.320
for whatever reason and you are going to crush and destroy.

660
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:20.320
To set an example and actually we get to a point where he talks about that in

661
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:24.100
here or there is an example set and that has to send a message to everyone.

662
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:27.550
Yeah that can do that.
I've done that with my family,
you know,

663
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.510
hey here's the line.

664
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:33.511
If you cross it you will remember for a very long time that you made a bad

665
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:37.970
decision.
Yeah.
And my other kids when I've done that too,
some of them,
you know,

666
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:41.950
one of my kids that has made a bad decision,
they all remember all of them.

667
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.510
They don't want to make that mistake.
Yeah.
It seems like you cross the line.

668
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.273
No,
not at all.

669
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.430
Like how you said if you give them kind of ample warning where you kind of give

670
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.640
them the tools to make their own decision kind of thing.

671
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.550
Even if you are changing a policy or whatever,

672
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.970
you know a harsher punishment punishment's all this stuff as long as yeah.

673
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:05.620
You warn them like how you were saying that seems like fair and the huge one,

674
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.550
which I always kind of thought was if it applies to everyone,

675
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.040
you know like if if this violation,

676
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:15.020
this punishment for this violation applies to everyone.
Sure.

677
00:41:15.021 --> 00:41:17.320
It just happens to be this guy cause he just happened.
He's be the one,

678
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.830
he happens to be the one that committed the violation or whatever.

679
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.990
But this rule,
this policy applies to everybody.
Yeah.

680
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.370
And also when you,
when you explain these things,

681
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.950
you don't blame them.
If you notice,
even when I just said,
you know,
hey guys,

682
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:37.580
I bring in slack hair.
You don't say,
look,
you guys miss I can do.
I said look,

683
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:39.690
I didn't make it clear why this is important.
Yeah.

684
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.190
And therefore you guys have been,
you know,
I've been letting you slack.

685
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.740
You guys have been showing up late.
That's a problem.

686
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.940
We can't have that problem anymore.

687
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.670
So you just don't start pointing the fingers and everywhere.
Yeah.

688
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.980
And then hammering them.
Harsher punishments.
No,
not a good idea.

689
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.520
Speaking of leadership back to the book,

690
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:02.840
I believe that some men and women are born with the inherent qualities that make

691
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:06.200
them good leaders.
Writing to his son John,

692
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:11.090
who was a cadet at west point in 1943 general Eisenhower once said,

693
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.710
the one quality that can be developed by studious reflection and practice is the

694
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.950
leadership of men.
I agree with Ike.

695
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.280
Leaders are not born leaders are made and they are made by solid effort and hard

696
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:29.210
work.
So there's a little contradictory in there because he says,
look,

697
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.130
some people are born with qualities that make them a good leader,

698
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.470
but you can learn to be a good leader.
I totally agree with that.

699
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:38.450
I've always said that some people have the qualities that make them a good

700
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:40.670
leader naturally.
Are they a lot of,
some of them,
right?

701
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.230
Some of them are be really articulate.
Some of them will be very charismatic,

702
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.620
very dynamic,
loud,
have a lot of presence.

703
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:51.770
Those are all characteristics that will differentiate in different people and if

704
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:52.551
you have a lot of those,

705
00:42:52.551 --> 00:42:56.040
you'll going to have a naturally easier time being a good leader.
Now,

706
00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.790
occasionally you get people that have some of those qualities but they're idiots

707
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.670
and those are the worst cause they can get people to follow him even though they

708
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:06.320
don't know where they're going.
Those are bad situations,
but it's interesting,

709
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:10.390
hard work studying,
right?
Studying leadership.
You know,

710
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.370
today I already learned something need to increase my focus on honesty as a

711
00:43:14.371 --> 00:43:18.140
leadership quality.
But yeah,
I'm always studying,

712
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:20.210
always learning and we all need to be,

713
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.100
that's how we're going to become a better leader.

714
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.350
And a lot of the studying that I did when I was growing up in the teams was

715
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:27.860
just,

716
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.970
I was watching in thinking about why these leaders were doing what they're doing

717
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.450
well,
one is making them do this good leader.
Why is,
wow,
why does that,

718
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.340
why do we respond to that?
Well,
bad leader,

719
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.410
why don't really respond well to what he's doing?

720
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.330
I wasn't sitting there consciously thinking about it.
Actually No.

721
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:47.450
In some cases I was actually consciously thinking about it.
You know,

722
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.420
consciously thinking,
wait,
why is no one want to follow this guy?

723
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.160
How is he acting that we all want to walk away from him?

724
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.030
Why is that happening?
And then when you get a good leader,
I'd say this,

725
00:43:59.031 --> 00:44:00.890
why is this guy such a good leader?
So yeah,

726
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:05.891
I guess I did consciously do that and study not from books but from life to try

727
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:12.370
and learn and that's how you can become better.
Here's a little note to

728
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.250
and and you want to talk about holding the line.

729
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.090
If you aren't in good physical shape,
forget it.

730
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:24.230
You are not going to be a good leader.
Well,

731
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.160
certainly in a military environment.
That is true there.

732
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.800
Are there some civilian leaders that aren't in the best shape?
Yeah,
there are.

733
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.010
With those leaders be doing a better job if they were in better physical

734
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:39.480
condition.
Yes they would.
It's like that.
That thing that starting strength.

735
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.970
Coach Rippetoe says,
I post,
I'm never talked about it,
but I posted it.
You know,

736
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.940
he's talking about how physical strength is good and people that say that

737
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:52.170
physical strength aren't good.
He says,
you know,
I forget the exact quote,

738
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.550
but he's basically saying,
I,
I know physical strength is good,

739
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.200
and if you take someone that says the physical strength isn't good

740
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.470
and is an important,

741
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.820
and then you add 120 pounds to their squat and then ask them how they're doing

742
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:16.560
now,
they're going to be doing better.
They're going to be doing better.

743
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.750
The more you can dead lift,
the better you're going to feel.

744
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.760
You don't feel worse when you can deadlift more.

745
00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:23.600
You don't feel worse than when you could squat more.
You feel better.
Yeah.
Well,

746
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.990
why is that?
There's a million reasons why confidence overcoming the challenge.

747
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.340
You're actually physically stronger.
Your mental clarity goes up,
so yeah,

748
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.200
of course,
be in good shape,
be in good shape.

749
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.850
If you're worried about your health,

750
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.530
you're not going to be able to focus on being a good leader and in the military

751
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.020
or in any job where that demands physical exertion,
you have to be in good shape.

752
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.150
Otherwise people are looking at you and you're falling apart.

753
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.450
You can't be falling apart on a patrol.
You can't be falling apart during,
uh,

754
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.650
during our combat swimming operation where you,
you know,
you need to swim,

755
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.790
you need to swim far,

756
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.520
you're going to swim for four straight hours on a combat swimmer operation.

757
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.380
If you're weak and you can't do that,

758
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.470
you think your men are going to respect you.
They're not.

759
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.390
I'll go ahead and answer that question for you.

760
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.620
Does that kind of like the hockey coach who doesn't even know how to Ice Skate?

761
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:15.840
You know,

762
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.070
there are coaches that have never participated in a sport that they coach and

763
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:21.750
they're good there.
I mean,

764
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:24.210
you can look at Greg Jackson who's a great mixed martial arts coach.

765
00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:27.000
He's never been in mixed martial arts fighter.
Yeah.

766
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:29.880
But he knows how to fight though,
you know?
Yeah.
It certainly does.
Yes.

767
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.720
But he hasn't actually fought.
So how can he be a good coach?

768
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.910
What about Duke Roufus?
He's never fought MMA.
Has He?
Oh,

769
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.730
MMA he's got moved.
Yeah.
We know he's a champion.

770
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.660
Kickboxer but how can it be such a great coach at MMA?
Yeah.

771
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.230
Cause you can connect the dots and stuff like that.
And of course there's,

772
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:51.510
you know,
there's exceptions,
but generally speaking,

773
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:54.300
and plus you're talking about a little bit more of a broad thing like a leader.

774
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.170
Like who,
who are we going to follow plus some,
cause we're talking about coaches,

775
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.680
you coaches are,
are not participating anymore.
That's why they're coaching.
Yeah.

776
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.080
I guess those are really stupid examples
because,

777
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.810
because you know,
custom motto with Mike Tyson,

778
00:47:09.811 --> 00:47:12.420
obviously he wasn't getting in the ring with Mike Tyson,
right?
Yeah.

779
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.270
But he's a great coach,
a fantastic coach,
one of the most,
you know,

780
00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:17.240
one of the most respected coaches of all time.
Yeah.

781
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.640
And the results are a little bit more like,
um,
recognizable,

782
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:24.270
like they're less ambiguous,
like a leader's results quote.
And we're looking at,

783
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:25.350
we're looking at leaders in the field,

784
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.150
like leaders in the job that are leading a group to accomplish a mission.
Right.

785
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.720
That's different than a coach.
A coach is outside the group.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.

786
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.580
So we're talking about someone that's in the group.
Yeah.
You gotta be,

787
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.410
you gotta be able to maintain,

788
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.490
you gotta be able to stay with your team physically.
And you know,

789
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:43.600
it's not like you need to be the best.

790
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.540
I was never the fastest guy was never the strongest guy,

791
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.720
but I wasn't going to be fallen behind on a patrol because I wasn't in good

792
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:54.410
shape.
That wasn't going to happen and the only way,

793
00:47:54.411 --> 00:47:56.650
the way that doesn't happen is you need to stay in shape.

794
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.790
How do you stay in shape?
Got To have discipline.
Yeah.

795
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.180
These questions answer themselves at some point.
Maybe some point.
This podcast,

796
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:07.890
we'll just come on here and sit here in silence.
Yeah.

797
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.580
Speaking of now,
this is,
this is good that you,

798
00:48:11.581 --> 00:48:15.940
you were talking about this here is a heavy punishment handed out.

799
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.300
Talking about Colonel Bob Sync,
who was the leader of the,
uh,

800
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.320
five oh six parachute infantry regiment.
We go back to the book.

801
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:28.720
Colonel Bob Sync certainly was one of the best.

802
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.970
He set high standards and never compromised on those standards.

803
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:39.010
After the paratroopers of the 506 paratrooper,
paratrooper,

804
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.521
parachute,

805
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:44.440
infantry regiment earned their jump wings sync granted a 10 day furlough,

806
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.440
but caution the men to conduct themselves appropriately.

807
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:52.180
Several paratroopers reported late for duty after their furloughs expired.

808
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.840
Saint called another regimental formation and publicly humiliated one

809
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:00.970
paratrooper from each of his nine companies.

810
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:07.540
They called out the name of the last soldier to report to duty and that

811
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:12.541
paratrooper was marched in front of the formation under escort and officer

812
00:49:13.131 --> 00:49:14.860
stripped him of his unit patch,

813
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.730
forced him to unblock [inaudible] boots

814
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.600
and then escorted him from the field.

815
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.710
What sink was saying was paratroopers may be elite,

816
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.830
but they had to follow the army's rules and regulations.

817
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.900
I liked that for some reason,
sync liked me,
respected me.

818
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.860
He was always the man instrumental in getting me my next job.

819
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.200
So there's a heavy punishment.
Now
that's,

820
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.180
that's a clear message being sent,
right?
Clear message being sent.

821
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.820
And I,
I,
I bet colonel sink at that time,

822
00:49:54.821 --> 00:49:59.200
Wade mean he's got three,

823
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:02.080
nine companies.
So he's got hundreds and hundreds of guys,

824
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.600
hundreds and hundreds of guys,

825
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.590
and he's going to make an example out of nine of them and he's going to be a

826
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:12.100
real clear example and that's going to leave an impression on a thousand guys

827
00:50:12.101 --> 00:50:12.934
are,
you know,

828
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:18.060
close to a thousand guys that might be worth it and he probably judged that it

829
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:22.570
was worth,
yeah.
So interesting perspective.
Yeah.

830
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.370
I think if the question is,
is that fair?

831
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.880
I would say I would say to the guys that got booted from the regiment,

832
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.000
I'd say their thoughts were that it was unfair.

833
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.980
I would say for the guys that remained in the regiment that realized that they

834
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:44.030
had to maintain the standard that realize there was going to be no slack and

835
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:48.140
that worked hard to make sure they maintain that and therefore we're more

836
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:51.890
prepared for combat.
Let's say it was real fair,
right,

837
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.210
so bigger picture kind of thing.
They were kind of the martyr.
Yeah.

838
00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:00.670
That gets a real big picture thing and who knows what kind of behind the scenes,

839
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:03.710
and we would have to get some details if we were really going to cast judgment

840
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:04.850
on that.
Like uh,
you know,

841
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:08.900
maybe some of those guys were kind of slackers anyways and the company commander

842
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:11.240
was like,
hey dude,
yeah,
we don't want this guy.
You know,

843
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:12.830
let's get rid of this guy or whatever.
You know.

844
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.180
And he only took certain members of the people that miss their furlough.
He,

845
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:18.380
so he didn't even say that's not fair.

846
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.690
He only took certain members or certain people that that missed their furlough.

847
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.420
Didn't take all of them.
Yeah,
just the last one to report.
We don't,

848
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.900
we don't take that around here.
It's an interesting dynamic.

849
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.470
It's an interesting dynamic,
but it's definitely showing.

850
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:38.980
I don't know that I necessarily would have done that.
I can I,
my assumption,

851
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:43.070
my,
my assessment I probably wouldn't have.
Yeah.
Not,

852
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:47.990
not one guy from each company.
Maybe like the two guys that grossly violated it.

853
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.510
I don't think I would need to do nine.
You know?
Guess what?
Conal sink Dan.

854
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.600
Don't mess with Colonel Sink and that's a good thing.

855
00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.640
Little little kind of image for you to have like don't mess with Colonel Sink.

856
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.440
Don't mess around in the battalion in the regimen we don't play.

857
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.550
Another leader that he talks about here is Mcauliffe.
Back to the book,

858
00:52:13.551 --> 00:52:17.900
what we liked about Mcauliffe was that he allowed us to do our jobs.

859
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.950
You didn't have a lot of interference from Mcauliffe,

860
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.740
but with Taylor and command,
this is another person.

861
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.480
He told you what you needed to do here.
He had to run everything.

862
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:33.770
You can't do a good job if you don't have the chance to use your imagination and

863
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:36.260
creativity.
In my mind,

864
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:39.770
Taylor was more interested in impressing his superiors.

865
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.270
Then watching out for his men.

866
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:45.980
Taylor was such a contrast with British General Montgomery,

867
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.380
so he talks a little bit.
Oh,
okay.
So first of all,
clearly decentralized command.

868
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:55.370
Don't give people the clear specifics on how to do every little thing.

869
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:58.550
Let them get creative.
Let them come up with a solution.
Perfect.
Boom.

870
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.890
We hear that over and over again.
Why do we hear it over and over again?

871
00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:04.820
Because it's right because it's right.
That's why we hear it over and over again.

872
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.840
Now he talks about the famous British General Montgomery Monty,

873
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:14.170
who always gets portrayed a little bit stiff and a little bit British.

874
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:19.970
Right,
and he says in here that the writers don't,
didn't know him,

875
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.520
didn't see him on the battlefield,
didn't see what he was like,

876
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:26.760
and here's what he says.
Here's what Dick Winter said about Montgomery.

877
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.400
Back to the book of Montgomery was the real deal.

878
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.840
I saw him on a number of occasions and he always impressed me as a commander who

879
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:38.160
lived the lifestyle that was beyond reproach for his staff to follow.

880
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.620
He set the example.

881
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.120
He addressed every division that was scheduled to participate in the invasion.

882
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:50.300
He called us together and had every soldier take off his helmet so he could see

883
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:56.180
the troops better.
Yeah,
props to Monte,

884
00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.900
right?
Going around and and talking to every,

885
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:04.940
every single division
and then said,
hey boys,
take off your helmets.

886
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.500
I want to see your faces before you roll.
It's legit props.

887
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:15.710
There's,
you know,
this book,
a lot of this book is about self discipline.

888
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.590
Even this part right here,
back to the book.

889
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:22.460
Self-Disciplined keeps you doing your job.
Without it,

890
00:54:22.461 --> 00:54:26.630
you lose your pride and forget the importance of self respect and the eyes of

891
00:54:26.631 --> 00:54:30.710
your fellow men.
Pride keeps you going on.

892
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:36.200
This is what I feared.
I would lose the loss of the will to measure up to my men.

893
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:39.650
So once you say,
you know what,
I don't care what my guys think anymore.

894
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.440
You've asked it right?
If I say,
look,
I don't care what the guys think of me,

895
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.100
think of what a driving force it is to have your team looking at you and saying,

896
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:53.090
I'm going to make sure these guys respect me and I'm proud of what I'm doing

897
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.640
compared to I don't care what anyone thinks to me anymore.

898
00:54:55.641 --> 00:54:58.370
And you can see whether you can see what,
when this happens to people,

899
00:54:58.371 --> 00:55:02.990
not just in the military or a business organization,
but in life,
in the life.

900
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.990
At a certain point,
you see a bomb in the street.

901
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.690
At a certain point that bum said,
you know what?

902
00:55:08.691 --> 00:55:10.130
I don't care what anyone thinks of me anymore.

903
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.420
I don't care what my family thinks me,

904
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:14.360
I don't care what the society thinks of me.

905
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.520
Of course I'm not talking about every single bum.
But a lot of them,
yeah.
They,

906
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.720
I don't care generally to the thing.
And as soon as you see that,

907
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:28.170
you can imagine that that's just like a life thing,
right?
Yeah.

908
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.710
If you go through life and you said,
don't care what anyone else thinks,

909
00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.920
which is a contradiction for me,
right?
Because I'll say all the time,

910
00:55:33.921 --> 00:55:36.230
like I don't care what people think.
Yeah.
But that's too,

911
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:40.460
just to a degree like you and it's obvious and just put a little bit of thought

912
00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:42.800
into.
You don't care about what people think.
Well as it appears.

913
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.170
You don't care what people think on a superficial level,
you know,

914
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.940
on a profound level.
You do you,
that's why you're,
you know,

915
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.720
that's what part of your morality is like,
you know,
fairness,

916
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:57.710
doing the right thing,
all this discipline stuff.
It's for you.

917
00:55:57.711 --> 00:56:01.850
But in regards to social cues and all these things,

918
00:56:01.851 --> 00:56:05.960
like that's beneficial to your success to function in a society.

919
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:07.190
And I've said this before,

920
00:56:07.191 --> 00:56:10.700
like about the seal teams and me being in the seal teams and I had this

921
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:15.050
completely had this attitude.
I don't care.
Like for instance,

922
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.750
I don't care what happens,
like I don't care if I get fired,

923
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.360
I'm going to do the right thing.
I don't care.
I don't care what they think of me.

924
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.640
And at the same thing,
at the same time,

925
00:56:22.641 --> 00:56:26.140
there's nothing that was more important than to me than my reputation in the

926
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:28.210
seal teams.
I don't want,
you know,
if,

927
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.560
if something was going to give you a bad reputation,

928
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.443
like what we just talked about,

929
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.570
if you fall out of a patrol as a leader or as anyone,

930
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.340
like if you fall out of patrol,
you're going to you.

931
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.340
No one's ever gonna Forget it.
In the seal teams,

932
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:40.840
if you're too weak to do something,

933
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.600
you're going to be remembered by that forever and that,

934
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:47.680
I didn't want that ever to be like,
oh,
Jocko did this.

935
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.500
Jocko couldn't finish patrol.
Jocko was a bad leader.
Jocko,

936
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.060
I didn't want that to be the reality.
And so therefore you work hard,

937
00:56:55.061 --> 00:57:00.040
you stay in shape,
you do your best all the time.
Yeah.
And that drives you.

938
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.550
Yeah.
But at the same time I wasn't saying,
Oh,
I,
I,

939
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.530
I'm concerned what my boss thinks of me,
so I'm going to act a certain way.
No,

940
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:12.370
I was trying to do the right thing for the teams right away.

941
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.820
See what I'm saying though?
Like these are the,
these are all tubes.

942
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:19.120
Those are all fundamental things.
Yeah.
It's weird.

943
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:23.800
It's a weird balance though to say,
look,
I don't care if I get promoted,

944
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.120
but I care more than anything about my job.
You know what I mean?

945
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.980
And that definitely was my attitude.

946
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.640
That definitely was my attitude my whole time.
I was in the military.
Look,
I'm,

947
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.580
I'm going to do the best job I can.
I'm not doing it to get promoted.

948
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:41.050
I'm not doing it for that reason,
but I am part of it.
Absolutely.

949
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:45.730
Doing it to have the respect of my peers and my bros and the teams.

950
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.310
Right.
You wouldn't be in a reputation.
You hear that all the time.

951
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:50.620
Your reputation is everything in the seal teams because it's a small group of

952
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:54.370
people,
you know you have an accidental discharge with your weapon.

953
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.570
Everybody knows about it and they're gonna know about it forever.
A few,

954
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:58.630
if you remain on the teams for whatever reason,

955
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.610
after you have an accidental discharge,

956
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:05.560
everyone's going to know it from there on out and it's not fun.

957
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.203
That's where we got Matt,

958
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:10.930
Jim Jacked up nicknames in the seal teams because you're going to get nicknamed

959
00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:12.850
African your lowest point in your life.

960
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.650
The biggest mistake is what you're going to get nicknamed or your biggest.
Yeah,

961
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:22.960
like there was a guy and his nickname was Bush and he's a great dude.

962
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.550
His nickname was Bush,
had nothing to do his last name,
but anyways,

963
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:32.440
long story short,
when he was a new guy,
and I knew this is 15 years later,

964
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.900
I found this out,
he said he'd been in the seal teams for 15 years.

965
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.520
I'd known him as Bush the whole time and he was parachuting.

966
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.900
Brand new guy,
showed up to the team.
They're like,
hey,
you're going jumping today.

967
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.650
Okay.
It gets into aircraft jumps and he,

968
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:49.930
he lands through no fault.
You can't even steer these brown parachutes.

969
00:58:49.931 --> 00:58:53.740
You can't barely stay him.
He lands in a Bush with like forums and you're right.

970
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:57.820
And I guess it looks pretty funny.
And from there on,
is it,
what's his name?
Bush.

971
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.000
Yeah.
So you're going to get a name like that.
But that's a,

972
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.860
that's a really easy example because everybody knows,
hey,
that's just funny.

973
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.060
It was more of a funny thing.
If something funny happens to you,

974
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:12.940
you might get that nickname too.
Like if you get pepper sprayed by the cops,

975
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.380
you might have the nickname pepper.

976
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.110
I like the direct it is.
Yeah.
There's no sense in playing around.

977
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.000
What else are you going call someone that gets pepper sprayed by the cops were

978
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:27.260
there new guy.
You're gonna call them pepper.
You call him when I or something I,

979
00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.890
cause I just get all water.
You have to not,

980
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:31.170
you're not gonna be in charge of nature.

981
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:37.300
Remember your guide that you thought to name was his name was Al Big Al 50 cal.

982
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.350
Not even his name or his name.
Big outfit.
The Cow.
Yeah.

983
00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.740
Morphed is awesome,

984
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:51.490
so that's why you have this weird dichotomy that's pulling at you is just to,

985
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:57.920
you're looking at your,
your friends,
your peers in this,
in a leadership position.

986
00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.140
It's your men.
You're looking at your men saying,
Hey,

987
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:04.810
I don't want to let these guys down.
I don't want them to view me as weak weeks.

988
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:08.750
Bad word,
but actually I guess it's the word I'm looking for.
Not that I,

989
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.050
not that I want to maintain the image of strength because part of maintaining

990
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.680
the image of strength is by showing weakness and being like,

991
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:17.630
I say this all the time,
hey,
I don't know how to do this.
Hey,

992
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.260
can you give me a suggestion?
I'm not talking about that type of thing.

993
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.580
I'm talking about

994
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.690
physical weakness,

995
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:31.580
physical and mental toughness or physical and mental weakness.
Right?

996
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:34.380
That's a lot different than,
hey,
I don't understand how to do something or,

997
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:37.790
or it's a lot different than humility.
You can,
you can want to show,

998
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:42.350
you can want to maintain strength but still have humility for sure.

999
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.000
No,
I know all kinds of,
I mean,

1000
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:48.890
I know tons of guys that are completely humble,

1001
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.250
but they're the toughest bastard you'd ever want to know mentally and
physically,

1002
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:56.330
so I'm not talking about I need to be strong,
stronger than everyone.
No,

1003
01:00:56.331 --> 01:00:57.350
I'm not talking about that at all.

1004
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.810
I'm talking about your physical and mental toughness you have to have,

1005
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:03.130
and if you don't have him as a leader,
could be problematic.
Yeah,

1006
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.333
watch out for it.

1007
01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:09.361
Back to the book,

1008
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:13.050
the big thing I derived from combat was the necessity of maintaining discipline,

1009
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:13.721
discipline,

1010
01:01:13.721 --> 01:01:17.910
and our troops was discipline in our troops and getting the job done in combat.

1011
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.750
So clearly discipline's a big part of what we're talking about here.

1012
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.190
Gee,
I wonder why now this is

1013
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:32.010
talking to another little aspect that you know,
I don't talk about this a lot.

1014
01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:36.240
I think it's inherent in a lot of things that I say,
but it's not something that,

1015
01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:39.240
I don't use this word a lot,
and again,
I think I need to use it more.

1016
01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:40.074
Back to the book.

1017
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:45.140
Character rose revolves around doing the right thing all the time.

1018
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.950
Character implies daily choices of right over wrong.

1019
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.120
The cadet prayer at westpoint says,

1020
01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:59.890
cadet strive to choose the harder right instead of the easier,

1021
01:01:59.891 --> 01:02:04.891
wrong and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be one that

1022
01:02:07.511 --> 01:02:09.340
gets to the heart of character.

1023
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:14.670
I would add that it is easier to do the right thing when everyone is looking.

1024
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:20.400
It is more difficult to do what you should do when you are alone.

1025
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.500
I like to think of character as every other virtue at the breaking point.

1026
01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.830
So character,
doing the right thing,
doing the right thing at all times,

1027
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.320
doing the right thing when you're alone.

1028
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.480
Back to the book.
A war doesn't alter character wore,

1029
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:49.920
merely brings out the best that an individual has to offer.

1030
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:56.130
Unfortunately,
it also brings forth the worst in some men.

1031
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.310
If anything,
war exposes the best and worst of those who are called to fight.

1032
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:08.690
I know of no man who lacked character and peace and then discovered character in

1033
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:09.924
combat.

1034
01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:17.470
So I've said this same type of thing before,
especially,
I mean war.

1035
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.371
You know,

1036
01:03:18.371 --> 01:03:23.260
what we'd see on deployment is as pressure starts to build on people,

1037
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.390
you start seeing people go in two directions,

1038
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.420
then that's what we'd see their character would start to reveal itself.

1039
01:03:28.421 --> 01:03:30.580
They either get very,

1040
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.460
they'd rise to the occasion or they would not,

1041
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.840
and they'd go in the other direction and become worse.

1042
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.140
Their character would become worse or their character would become better.

1043
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.020
That's what I've seen.
And the same thing,
you know,

1044
01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:45.610
when we talk about people that have

1045
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.900
maybe have a hard time dealing with war,

1046
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:54.930
a lot of times there's some preexisting issues that the war in flames,

1047
01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.380
right?
And then if you take someone that has,

1048
01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.390
that doesn't have preexisting issues or maybe has a positive spin on things and

1049
01:04:04.391 --> 01:04:06.670
that becomes more positive.
So it's very,

1050
01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:07.960
and then there's a bunch of people in the middle,

1051
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.630
but some of the guys that I knew that really had a hard time,

1052
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.150
they had issues going in,
you know,
they had problems,

1053
01:04:16.151 --> 01:04:19.180
some issues going in to the situation going into war.

1054
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:24.160
And those problems get exacerbated by the pressure and the stress of combat.

1055
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.360
So we need to watch out for that one.
I think.

1056
01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.320
I think war is more of an amplifier that a creator,

1057
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.740
I think it amplifies good character.
I think it amplifies bad character.

1058
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:40.870
I think it amplifies issues and in either direction.

1059
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.770
So it's,
it's a,
it's a,

1060
01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.380
it's a powerful element to add into people's lives.

1061
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:54.610
This,
this big intense piece.

1062
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.130
Now,
one of the things that this let this book captures is these letters.

1063
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.690
He kind of had a pen pal,
a female pen pal when he was at war.

1064
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.100
Her name is Deanna almonds.

1065
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.740
And one of the things that he,
he,

1066
01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:17.070
so he,
so they capture these letters and some of the letters,
parts,

1067
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.240
some of the letters are published in here.
Here's one of them.

1068
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:21.430
Back to the book first and most important,

1069
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:25.960
I've got my own conscience to answer to next,
my parents.

1070
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.610
And then I am an officer in the U s army.
I am damn proud of it.

1071
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.160
And with the rank and position I hold,

1072
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:38.350
I wouldn't think of doing anything to bring discredit to my outfit,

1073
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:41.020
my paratrooper boots,
wings,

1074
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:43.810
the airborne patch or the U s army.

1075
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.020
Good morale within an outfit is usually reflected by good conduct away from it.

1076
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.110
That sounds like an idealistic high school kid.
I know,
but that's it.

1077
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.120
That's how I feel.

1078
01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.660
So he took that stuff very,
very seriously.
And I remember,

1079
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.660
I remember the dirt prewar I was in my third platoon and the the new guys who

1080
01:06:19.981 --> 01:06:22.380
are all my bros now,
I mean these are just mugs,

1081
01:06:22.381 --> 01:06:25.110
but they were new guys and we were the senior older guys,
right.

1082
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:30.410
Because we'd been in the teams for like a couple of years and something happened

1083
01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.150
and we gave like a,
like a like,
hey guys,

1084
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.340
don't,
don't ever make the platoon look bad.
Like no matter what,

1085
01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:43.230
you don't make the platoon look bad.
That's not allowed.

1086
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.750
But we'll tune is comes first above everything.

1087
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.300
And this one I just remember saying,
but then one guy made,

1088
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:55.950
the platoon looked bad and he had to pay for it.
But that's the attitude.

1089
01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:58.620
The attitude was like,
look,
you don't make the platoon to look bad.

1090
01:06:58.621 --> 01:07:00.870
You don't make the teams look bad.
We didn't really,

1091
01:07:00.871 --> 01:07:02.760
we weren't too concerned with the navy back then.

1092
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.300
We didn't really even feel like when I was that young and the seal teams that we

1093
01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:09.750
weren't even thinking about the big navy.
We barely even recognized it.

1094
01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.940
We were in the teams.
It's more,

1095
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:17.120
it's as as as the teams became bigger and more prevalent,

1096
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.190
we connected more with the big navy,
but when I was a new guy in the suit,

1097
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:25.560
when I was in the seal teams as a young guy in the 90s we were pretty much on

1098
01:07:25.561 --> 01:07:28.320
her own,
so I wasn't,
I basically,
I wasn't like sitting there and thinking handy.

1099
01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:29.880
You protect the reputation of the navy.
I didn't care.

1100
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.040
I would now as I got older I did,
but back in the day it was like,
Hey,

1101
01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:39.870
the platoon and I was at team one at the time and team one you'll make team one

1102
01:07:39.871 --> 01:07:42.600
look bad.
What are you doing?
Don't make this book tune.
Look bad.

1103
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.060
You just did that.
Yeah.
Now you have to pay for that.
Punishment

1104
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:53.970
will be delivered at this time and it was,
that's a,

1105
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.300
that's a unfortunate situation and know these things just happen from time to

1106
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:02.620
time.
So are we not going into what the punishment was that day?
The punishment,

1107
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.720
the punishment was,
I'll tell you what the punishment was,
Jocko punishment,

1108
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.620
the punishment was I am going to strike you two times in the face with an open

1109
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:19.070
hand.
That's punishment or we're going to fight which one do you want.

1110
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.720
That was the punishment he in and this guy was like,
I'll take the two.

1111
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.100
And I was like Roger that and there was a little bit more tension than that,

1112
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.660
you know,
cause he was kind of like boat up a little bit.
Yeah.
And I was like,
Oh,

1113
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:36.380
if you want to get it on we'll get it on.
And then,
and you know,

1114
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:40.010
it's funny because these guys,
this group of guys who was,
they were,

1115
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.400
they were all guys just trying to get after it and be good team guys.

1116
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.430
But we were just crazy,
you know,
at this point.

1117
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.250
And the teams was literally everything in my life.

1118
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.400
So when I was like mad about disrespecting or making the platoon look bad,

1119
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:56.300
it need like hurt me.

1120
01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.250
I was that crazy that I just didn't want the platoon to look bad.
Yeah.

1121
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:03.980
You know,
when you did something that made the platoon the pad,
yeah.

1122
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:07.580
It bothered me.
It really,
truly bothered me.

1123
01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:11.060
You made something that made team on look,
I mean,
I'd been there,
you know,

1124
01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:15.440
since I was a kid and it was everything to me.
And so when you didn't,

1125
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:19.760
when you made us look bad,
I wasn't happy and not just,

1126
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.480
I wasn't happy because I was a jerk or I wasn't because I was being a jerk at

1127
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:27.110
the time.
But talking to these guys,
you know,
years later we talked to these guys.

1128
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:30.380
They're like,
yeah,
that guy in particular,
he's like,
I hated going to work.

1129
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:34.660
I hated you guys.
And I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
I'm sorry.
You know?
And,

1130
01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.200
and then there'll be like,

1131
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:39.890
but I'm glad it was like that because everybody has that feeling.

1132
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.010
It was the old school.
It was like with the old breed,
you know,
hey,

1133
01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:46.630
this is the way it is.
This,
we hold the line.
We don't make the platoon look bad.

1134
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.040
We make the two look good.
We work hard.
That's what we do.

1135
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:53.330
It was like a little gang.
Yeah.
That's all it was.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1136
01:09:53.331 --> 01:09:54.830
Those two choices,
cause they're like,

1137
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.970
they're just different because some people would rather go do the fight because

1138
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.990
you know,
at least the kind of go down,
swinging and kind of attitude.

1139
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.940
But the potential for damage is way more than enough.

1140
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.760
Like you know what I'm saying?
But,

1141
01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:11.960
and then I agree with you and you could see where you could make a case for both

1142
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.450
of those selections.
But there's also something called,
it's like,

1143
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.730
I'll take two hits to the face,
open hand.
Cool.
I'm a man.
I screwed up that.

1144
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.300
I think that's the,
the reason I respected it was because it wasn't.
It was like,

1145
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:27.200
yeah,
I did screw up.
Right.
So I'll just,
and I'll take it.
I deserve punishment.

1146
01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.790
Give it to me.
Yeah.
And that was that.
Yeah.
Well then we move on.
No factor.

1147
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:32.390
Yeah.

1148
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:37.250
Technically the two to the face or is way easier because it's way quicker.

1149
01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:41.480
You,
you know,
you know what to expect.
I mean,
unless you're scared of like,
oh,

1150
01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:43.760
hitting your head.
And dying or something,
you know,

1151
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.260
some off they were opening though.
They were open hand.
Yeah.
See,
so clear.

1152
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:50.930
Not going to knock anybody out with a open hand.
Yeah.
Well usually you're not,

1153
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:54.290
you know,
maybe I could,
I'm just kidding.
But um,
yeah,

1154
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:58.070
so a lot of that is that how you say you were kind of building some tension with

1155
01:10:58.071 --> 01:11:00.320
it.
It's like that's a big part of the punishment as well.

1156
01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:02.060
That's psychological torture.

1157
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.580
And this also reveals my own personal immaturity,
right?
These are like,

1158
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:11.660
seriously,
this is what I'm thinking about it.
This is just an immature,
you know,

1159
01:11:11.661 --> 01:11:16.020
I was probably 22 years old,
maybe 23 years old,

1160
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:20.730
but you know,
young and immature and not getting the best guidance,

1161
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:22.230
not understanding things,

1162
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:25.890
not understanding that I wasn't helping build a cohesive unit,

1163
01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.500
not understanding that this guy's probably thinking,
oh,
I don't want to help him.

1164
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:30.600
You know what I mean?
It wasn't smart.
I'm not,

1165
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.300
I'm not trying to say that this stuff was smart.
I'm telling you,

1166
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:37.530
the reality of the way it was and the way it was in my head was,
hey,

1167
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:42.780
this is my life,
this seal platoon.
I know it's,
it's,
it sounds crazy.

1168
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.400
This seal platoon that we're in is my whole life and I actually don't care about

1169
01:11:47.401 --> 01:11:50.790
anything else.
Mind you,
this is in the 90s there's no war going on.

1170
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:55.920
I'm just a young,
crazy kid.
And the only thing I know,

1171
01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:58.890
and the only thing I care about is the seal teams and that,
you know,

1172
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:00.780
you make the to look bad.

1173
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:06.120
This platoon is my life and you just made us look bad.
And I can't stand that.

1174
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:10.770
And I don't want it to be that way.
So young,
immature me,

1175
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:14.760
what do I do?
Hey this,
there's gotta be a punishment,
you know?

1176
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:17.160
And that's kind of the attitude we had.
And

1177
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.920
there are some benefits to it,
but you know,
it's our wave.

1178
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:26.010
I would love to go back and be a better mentor and be like,
Hey man,

1179
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.200
this is the mistake you made.
You know,
we need to make,
you know,

1180
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:32.220
I would love to do that.
But you can't,
you're a dumb,
I was a young,

1181
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:36.450
dumb kid that was raised that way by the way as well.

1182
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.710
That's how we were raised and there are some benefits to it.
And like I said,

1183
01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:44.940
even those guys that did platoons with me when I was quote unquote an old guy,

1184
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:48.180
even though we were nothing,
we'd never been to combat,
we were meaningless,

1185
01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:50.340
but we had a couple more years in the seal teams.

1186
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:54.060
So therefore you're an old guy and the new guys or anyone with,

1187
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.860
with no deployments,

1188
01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.600
which is actually pathetic in its own right because the term in the seal teams

1189
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.801
being,
Oh,

1190
01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:06.690
you're a new guy that was from guys that were in Vietnam that you hadn't been in

1191
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:10.830
combat.
Yes.
Or you're a newborn.
You're cherry boy.
So guess what?

1192
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:15.000
I was a cherry boy for 13 years because I never shot my weapon at the end.

1193
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:17.490
I mean,
I hadn't been in combat until I went to my first deployment to Iraq.

1194
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:20.070
So there's actually,
from that perspective,

1195
01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:24.000
it's embarrassing because here I was big.
I'm an old guy.
It was an old guy.

1196
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:28.370
I never been in combat before.
What am I talking about?
Yeah,
but you,
you,

1197
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.370
you take what you had at the time,
which was this organization,
the seal teams.

1198
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.890
My platoon,
and again,
you can't,

1199
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.480
I can't describe really how important the seal platoon was to me it was,

1200
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.230
well,
let me put it this way.
It was my whole life and you go,

1201
01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.380
what I do when I woke up in the morning,
went in,
went into work,

1202
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:50.040
worked out with my seal platoon mates.
What do we do then we worked all day.

1203
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.680
What do we do for lunch?
We ate together.
What do we do at night?

1204
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.320
We went and got dinner.
What do we do after that?
We went and had drinks.

1205
01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:58.350
What do we do after that?
We hung out all night.
What do we do after that?

1206
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.270
We went to sleep,
woke up and did the same thing that day after day.

1207
01:14:00.271 --> 01:14:03.570
That was my family.
And you just have this,

1208
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.350
this passion for your family and you,

1209
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:10.440
it just meant it was the most important thing in the world to be for my whole

1210
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.950
adult life.
But when you take that and you put that on a,
you know,
young kid.

1211
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:19.900
Yeah.
And you know everyone's like,
oh yeah.
Jockos he reads a big reader.

1212
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:23.650
I wasn't reading anything back then.
I was reading the fourtune tune handbook.

1213
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:28.390
Right.
I wasn't reading,
I wasn't reading Shakespeare.

1214
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.420
Sure.
Yeah.
I,
what was I doing in high school?

1215
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.480
I wasn't paying attention during high school.
I was wanting to be a commando.

1216
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:37.660
I was running through the woods pretending I had a machine gun.

1217
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.740
So you take that kid and you put them in a situation where the thing that he

1218
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:48.730
cares about the most has been scorn,

1219
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:53.260
violated,
or score.
He's going to try and handle it to the best of his abilities.

1220
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:57.790
Start slapping,
not proud of it,
but occasionally some people that slapped around.

1221
01:14:58.190 --> 01:15:02.650
Yeah.
That's how though,
you know,
you know when your basic young,
basic guy,

1222
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:06.290
you can handle things in a young,
basic kind of way.
Yeah.
Whatever.

1223
01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.360
It's it's caveman.
Yes.
Caveman scenario.
There you go.
And,
and,

1224
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:11.680
and the other thing is,
and,
and you know,

1225
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:15.160
those guys that were in those early platoons when I was like,

1226
01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:19.240
I said up quote unquote old Lear's later,
they're like,
yeah,
that was awesome.

1227
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.650
So glad I got raised that way.
They're proud of it,
you know?
But at the same time,

1228
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.750
you,
uh,
you,

1229
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:34.210
when I look back on it,
I know I was not a good leader right.
By any stretch.
Yeah.

1230
01:15:34.211 --> 01:15:37.820
That's kind of like when I look at my old videos at the time,
I'm like,
yeah,

1231
01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.440
they were dope.
You know,
but,
and you're like me,
you just know better ways now.

1232
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:42.280
You know,
you're just,

1233
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.140
you just better know hindsight 2021 and the other thing you've got to be careful

1234
01:15:47.141 --> 01:15:49.720
of is setting the bar.

1235
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:53.260
Like let's say I was in a seal platoon right now and now I'm going to set the

1236
01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:58.240
bar so high that I lose track of lose vision of the fact that like,
Hey,

1237
01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:01.110
the guy that I'm trying to convince right now as a 23 year old thing and the

1238
01:16:01.111 --> 01:16:03.400
most important thing in his world is,
this is funny.

1239
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:06.070
Like I was talking to someone the other day and was like,

1240
01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:07.690
I couldn't remember what singable tune,

1241
01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:11.740
what the phonetic letter of a certain seal platoon I was in at a certain time.

1242
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.730
I was like,
I forget what platoon that was.
Yeah.

1243
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:18.430
And to me at the time when we were in those seal platoons,

1244
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:23.230
that letter of that phonetic alphabet,
we were an Alpha platoon.
That was it.

1245
01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.920
And now I look back and it's like,
oh yeah,
what platoon was that?

1246
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:30.430
Because as I matured and as I saw the rest of the world,

1247
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:33.010
I realized that even though a seal platoon is very important,
and it certainly,

1248
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:34.330
it's the most important thing when you're in it,

1249
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:39.010
when you're in a task unit or you're overseas and there's multiple people

1250
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:43.670
running around and there's huge missions going,
ew,
ew,
ew,
ope,

1251
01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:47.550
your mind gets opened up.
Yeah.
And you see more and the,

1252
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:52.750
the little thing that you used to be so engulfed in your head becomes becomes

1253
01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:57.550
less.
That's all there is to it.
Now I'm telling you guys in the seal platoons,

1254
01:16:57.650 --> 01:17:00.610
there's no better job.
Like it's the best thing in the world.
And I'm sure,

1255
01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:04.420
you know,
I had never served in the marine corps,
infantry platoon or in a,

1256
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:08.980
you know,
army,
US Army infantry,
but I saw them,
I saw,

1257
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:13.030
they were like,
and they have that same bond that,

1258
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:16.010
that you get from being in those tough units.

1259
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.430
So there's something very cool about that,

1260
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:24.140
about being a grunt,
which is what you are in the seal teams.

1261
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:27.880
You might think Alma special operations or whatever.
You're a grunt,
you're,

1262
01:17:27.881 --> 01:17:31.820
you carry a machine gun.
Yeah.
And you do hard things.

1263
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.010
That's what being a grunt is.
You're doing hard things.

1264
01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:35.330
You're carrying a bunch of weight around

1265
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:43.790
those days.
Love those days.
Yeah.
All right.

1266
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:51.440
So I just wanted to be back in a sealed so bad.
Yeah.

1267
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.480
And it's so fun.
So awesome.
So awesome.
So meaningful.

1268
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:59.650
I would have fought you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What happened?

1269
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.340
You know,
what would have happened?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Bailey,

1270
01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.480
that was one of the good things about knowing a little tiny bit of Jujitsu,

1271
01:18:10.481 --> 01:18:13.720
which I actually knew a little bit.
Yeah,
that was enough.
Yeah.

1272
01:18:13.721 --> 01:18:17.200
You got guys with Co,
what's the offer to fight them?

1273
01:18:17.201 --> 01:18:20.380
And they kick your ass or you're like,
Dang,
that backfired.
And here's the thing,

1274
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.050
they didn't know any better.
All they thought was they didn't,

1275
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:27.010
I don't think I ever said like,
I know Jujitsu and you don't,
but it was just,

1276
01:18:27.011 --> 01:18:28.540
I was so confident like,
oh,

1277
01:18:28.541 --> 01:18:32.080
I actually know this and I know that I can choke this dude that they just said,

1278
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:34.300
you know what?
This guy's probably gonna kick my ass.

1279
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:36.730
And the weird thing is there's probably guys along the way that could've kicked

1280
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:41.590
ass.
You know,
some kid that wrestled in high school,
we all double leg,
boom,

1281
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.160
and now I'm slammed on the ground and getting punched in the head.
I don't,

1282
01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:47.920
I can't,
you know,
it's less than not learned.
Yeah.
Less than not learned.

1283
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:50.370
I'm lucky that never happened.
You know?

1284
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:54.820
So check.
All right,

1285
01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:01.150
here we're talking about,
so I just was talking about,
this is interesting.

1286
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:05.380
So I was just talking about mental strength and physical strength.
Well,

1287
01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:07.480
here we go back to the book moral courage.

1288
01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.960
Courage is a far rarer commodity than physical courage.

1289
01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.390
In that I agree with patent.

1290
01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:16.240
I have known many officers who were physically brave,

1291
01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:20.860
but who did not have the intestinal fortitude to organize the chaos around them.

1292
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:26.240
Those officers who were the most vocal about what they were going to do to the

1293
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:31.160
enemy often were the first to fall apart when the chips were down.

1294
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:34.010
Fear is not only debilitating,

1295
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:38.060
but its existence also destroys the cohesion of a command.

1296
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:42.860
It is the responsibility of a commander to identify the limits of courage,

1297
01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.660
break the paralysis of fear,

1298
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:49.640
and motivate his soldiers to continue with the mission.
Courage conquers fear.

1299
01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.430
I liked just that,
that part,
and I don't think I did this.

1300
01:19:56.431 --> 01:19:57.390
And Helmet for my pillow,

1301
01:19:57.391 --> 01:20:00.330
doors a and helmet for my pillow that I pulled out when I was talking to one of

1302
01:20:00.331 --> 01:20:02.910
my seal buddies and I was cause he listened to it.
He said,
yeah,
yeah.

1303
01:20:02.911 --> 01:20:06.510
And I was telling him this one part that I didn't put in the podcast and I sent

1304
01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:09.150
him a picture of from the book,
this little paragraph,

1305
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:11.400
but it's basically one of the instructors.

1306
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:15.990
One of the drill instructors was all yelling about orbit to kill and Blah Blah

1307
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:20.260
Blah.
And then he says,
yeah,
the next time I saw him we were in,
you know,

1308
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.860
on island in the fight.

1309
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.220
And he was getting taken away of br after breaking down.
Okay.

1310
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.870
So this is what he's saying here.

1311
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:30.840
A lot of guys that are the loudest about what they're going to do to the enemy.

1312
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.190
Yeah.
Okay.
You're talking a big game,
you know,

1313
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.500
but what's really good that happened.
You know what else that happens?
UFC

1314
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:42.210
MMA,
it happens.
Yeah.
I'm going to kick off with a crush.

1315
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:44.610
That guy and the other guy's sitting there going,
okay,
bring it.

1316
01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.960
Or He's in the locker room,
like explaining,
tell his teammates,
yeah,
I'll just,

1317
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.830
I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that.
And it's almost like,
yeah,

1318
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.380
it's weird trying to,
they're trying to convince them cause that's some solid.

1319
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.320
So that's what,
that's what's going on here.
Same thing,
right.

1320
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:00.750
Somebody who's trying to convince themselves they're not confident in
themselves.

1321
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.030
Back to the book.

1322
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:07.050
I suspect every soldier at one time or another experiences a degree of fear.

1323
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.050
Courage is not the absence of fear,

1324
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:15.140
but rather the willingness to rise above fear and do the things you know need to

1325
01:21:15.151 --> 01:21:16.080
be accomplished.

1326
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:22.010
All soldiers hope that they will measure up the first time they get into a

1327
01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:24.450
fight.
I certainly was no exception,

1328
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.500
but I believe I had prepared myself very well that once I came under fire,

1329
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.740
I knew instinctively what needed to be done.

1330
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:38.040
I think I was more apprehensive,
particularly before d day.
Then I was afraid.

1331
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:42.780
Maybe apprehension is the first stage of fear.
I'm not really sure.

1332
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:48.510
You have to remember that easy company was needly unit as we're all
paratroopers.

1333
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.080
We had trained for nearly two years before we jumped into Normandy.

1334
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.440
I think I saw far more excitement in the eyes of my men than I did fear after

1335
01:21:58.801 --> 01:21:59.634
break court.

1336
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:05.210
We felt as if we were seasoned veterans even though we knew worst days were

1337
01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:10.100
ahead.
Yeah,

1338
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:14.990
that apprehension and definitely my first deployment to Iraq.

1339
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:19.280
When you had all these guys,
Bro,

1340
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:22.020
the guys were so fired up to get it,

1341
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:27.070
to do real missions and get after it that I think it was much more excitement

1342
01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:30.770
that it was fear,
especially in the beginning and it'd be getting,
you know,

1343
01:22:30.771 --> 01:22:32.510
there wasn't a lot of casualties going on.

1344
01:22:32.511 --> 01:22:37.090
We are kind of dominating and you know,
even showing up to Ramadi,

1345
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:40.460
same thing.
Guys were like,
sign me up,
what mission I'm going.

1346
01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.880
And the more you spend time in that,

1347
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:46.820
the more you realize what the threat is and you start losing.

1348
01:22:46.821 --> 01:22:49.700
Guys are having guys getting wounded.
That's when you start saying,
okay,

1349
01:22:49.701 --> 01:22:53.510
wait a second.
I'm not sure I want to die today.

1350
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:56.450
And then guys got to overcome that.
And on a daily basis,

1351
01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:03.560
speaking of fierce,
Steve Ambross,
who's a military historian,

1352
01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:06.070
rent bunch of books including band of brothers,
Steve,

1353
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.670
Steve Ambrose says that heavy artillery bombardment will make even the most

1354
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:14.290
seasoned veteran eventually break.
I disagree.

1355
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.720
A leader has to overcome fear,
convince himself that every enemy,

1356
01:23:19.721 --> 01:23:22.150
shell or bullet is not targeting him.

1357
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.560
The same is true in a company or a battalion leaders.

1358
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:30.010
Must ensure that strengthened cohesion is a stronger force than fear.

1359
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.750
This is especially true in men who have been scarred by prolonged combat.

1360
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:39.640
Ambrose was correct when he titled the Chapter Band of Br in band of brothers

1361
01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:44.350
breaking point as he describes the horrendous artillery barrage that inflicted

1362
01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:49.351
so many casualties on easy company in the boy's shocks company strength was

1363
01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:54.631
below 50% and many of the noncommissioned officers were killed or wounded

1364
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:58.570
without direct supervision by leaders.

1365
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.800
Easy company as well as the remainder of the battalion could have easily been

1366
01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:07.510
dipped,
debilitated by an increased sense of morality and fear.

1367
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:13.120
That is precisely why I made it a point to visit the front lines as often as

1368
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:13.780
possible.

1369
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.780
Soldiers need to sense need a sense that their leaders and commanders are in the

1370
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:20.920
game with them.

1371
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.780
Leadership by example is even more important in these situations.

1372
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:35.060
I noticed that when men are at the edge of their physical endurance,

1373
01:24:35.061 --> 01:24:39.050
you tend to develop that 1000 yard stare that you always read about.

1374
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:42.980
Tired soldiers will often take off their helmet and run their fingers through

1375
01:24:42.981 --> 01:24:47.060
their hair.
We talked about that before and I talk about that quite often now.

1376
01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.450
At times they literally dropped their helmets on the ground.

1377
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:55.160
This soldier is already losing his self respect.

1378
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:58.510
The battle is half lost.

1379
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:01.900
That's assigned for the commander to take immediate action.

1380
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:05.170
I didn't wait for the trooper to reach that stage.

1381
01:25:05.171 --> 01:25:09.310
I proactively looked for these signs.
Every soldier wants to do the right thing.

1382
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.050
You always know the proper thing to do,
but doing it is sometimes more difficult.

1383
01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:18.430
I never wanted a man to lose his self respect.

1384
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.760
That's what I was talking about earlier,
this thing of self,

1385
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:24.960
this idea of self respect when you don't care because you,

1386
01:25:24.961 --> 01:25:27.070
you know you could supposed to keep your gear on all the time.

1387
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:29.850
That's like just the code,
right?

1388
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.990
And keep your gear with you all the time to keep your gear and all the time.

1389
01:25:31.991 --> 01:25:36.400
The minute you take that off is where you start.
Hey,

1390
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:37.870
I don't care what these guys think anymore.

1391
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.500
Something has happened that has made you say,
you know what?

1392
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.280
I don't care what these guys think anymore and that's not good.
Yeah.
And again,

1393
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:46.690
this is such a contradiction because you know,

1394
01:25:46.691 --> 01:25:48.880
we can sit here and talk about like,
Hey,
I don't care what people think.

1395
01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:52.450
And I mean that.
I mean that you shouldn't care what people think,

1396
01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.160
but at the same time it should be extremely important to you what people think

1397
01:25:57.161 --> 01:26:00.160
and what your comrades think.
And that's such a weird dichotomy.

1398
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.590
I don't think I've fully wrapped my hands around how to describe yet and what

1399
01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:06.800
that means.
I'll get there eventually,
hopefully.
Sure.
But,

1400
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.720
but that is a very important thing and I've always felt like I don't care what

1401
01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:12.554
people think,

1402
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:17.590
but at the same time I deeply care what my peers think and my,

1403
01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:23.420
my men think weird dichotomy.
I think that's a core value thing.

1404
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:26.270
It's like you have these core values and that's what you care about.

1405
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.400
You know what you think about it when everyone else thinks about it.

1406
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:30.800
And then anything beyond that is just superficial fluff.

1407
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.250
Like if you don't match your socks,
I,

1408
01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.620
I think what the key principle here are the,

1409
01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:40.130
the part that may help bring this together for me is I want to be doing the

1410
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:45.080
right thing.
Yeah.
Right.
And so if I'm doing the right thing and people say,
Oh,

1411
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.010
Jack was,
you know,
that's,
that's,
that's,
that's stupid what Jack was doing.

1412
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:52.940
Or he shouldn't be doing that.
But I know in my heart I'm doing the right thing.

1413
01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:55.690
Yeah.
I'm going to continue to do and I don't care what you think.
Yeah.

1414
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.800
There you go.
But at the same time,

1415
01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:02.630
if I know I'm doing the right thing and other people are,
are judging me,

1416
01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:05.390
that's going to keep me in line.
If I,
let me,
let me rephrase that.

1417
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.180
If I feel like I'm going to do the wrong thing,

1418
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:12.860
I do care what people think and I don't want them to think all Jockos getting

1419
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.580
weak,
getting soft,
getting,
you know,
whatever he's doing the wrong thing.

1420
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:21.470
He's making the wrong move.
Very strange.
That's the,

1421
01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:24.380
that's the dichotomy of leadership,
right?
Or one of them actually,

1422
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:26.600
it's not really the dichotomy of leadership.
That's just a,

1423
01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.680
that's just the dichotomy in life life.
Yeah.

1424
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:34.543
Now there's a,

1425
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:41.140
a guy named lieutenant Compton who kind of breaks a little bit and they show it

1426
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:47.240
in the,
in the band of brothers movie and they,
he,

1427
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:52.640
Dick winters talks about it here.
Back to the book.
Before you go on,

1428
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.990
I know you think I'm too hard on lieutenant comp and for walking off the line of

1429
01:27:56.991 --> 01:28:00.530
Bastogne.
My may explain myself buck.

1430
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.660
That's the tenant competent was nicknamed buck and he walked,

1431
01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.450
walked off the line.
Buck was a great combat leader.

1432
01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:10.070
He was a superb platoon leader in Normandy and Holland.

1433
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:14.210
In fact,
I would say he was one of the best at Bastogne.

1434
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:18.350
He broke after some of his friends were seriously wounded in the constant

1435
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:19.760
artillery barrages.

1436
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:25.750
There is a danger of getting too close to the men and buck cross that line.

1437
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:32.030
When you see your friends getting maimed,
it makes it more difficult to go on.

1438
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:37.040
That's why I always maintained a certain detachment from the paratroopers and

1439
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:41.180
easy company.
Am I too harsh on buck?
Maybe,

1440
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:43.730
but of leader needs to rise above fear.

1441
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.510
The easiest thing to do is quit

1442
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.650
and then the author asks her,

1443
01:28:51.651 --> 01:28:56.600
why didn't you crack and Dick winters responses.
Um,
Pennsylvania,

1444
01:28:56.601 --> 01:29:00.260
Dutch,
I don't quit.
I made a commitment.

1445
01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.810
Moral courage is based on physical fitness.

1446
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.770
Courage is a combination of willpower and determination and determination.

1447
01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:14.730
I was an excellent physical shape.
I don't think there was a man in the hour,

1448
01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.640
that outfit who's in better shape than I was and it showed I had trained hard in

1449
01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:24.440
England.
After we finished training.
I would run at night blackout conditions,

1450
01:29:24.441 --> 01:29:29.060
but I would run.
Then I'd come in and go to bed.
I was in maximum shape.

1451
01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.980
That was the physical side of things.

1452
01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.710
But there is a mental aspect of stamina as well.

1453
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.930
I've always prided myself that I do my own thinking.
I have my own philosophy.

1454
01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:44.170
I have my own answers to the reasons things have turned out in my life by taking

1455
01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:47.660
full accountability,
accountability for my life,

1456
01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.660
I've been able to meet the standards that I set for myself.

1457
01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:53.570
I don't know any other way of saying it.

1458
01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:56.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1459
01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:59.570
<v 0>Every commander must take full accountability for his actions.</v>

1460
01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.660
Stand up and be counted as a commander.

1461
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:07.340
You are accountable for everything that your outfit does or fails to do.

1462
01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.970
Don't worry about who receives credit when things go well.

1463
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:14.420
Don't play the blame game.
In my case,

1464
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.800
the mantle of command provided me with the courage to succeed.

1465
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.313
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.860
<v 0>extreme ownership.
That's what he's talking about,
you know,</v>

1467
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:26.850
personal accountability.

1468
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:31.110
That's what he's talking about being in great physical condition.

1469
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.810
That's what he's talking about.
That's discipline.
You know,

1470
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:39.330
I guess as we read this,
and I and I,
you know I didn't read this book until

1471
01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:45.430
a week ago,
a week ago.
I read this book,

1472
01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.100
so it's not like I read this book and said,
Hey,

1473
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:51.760
personal accountability is the most important thing about,
you know,

1474
01:30:51.761 --> 01:30:52.840
being a leader.
No,

1475
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:57.330
this is guy came to the same conclusion in World War II that I came to and

1476
01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.160
conclusion and my experience in the military.

1477
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:04.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.680
<v 0>Now he starts talking a little bit about combat fatigue.</v>

1479
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.000
How much combat fatigue there was enormous.
I witnessed lots of stress,

1480
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.930
some in Holland,

1481
01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:17.430
much more in Bastogne due to the intense cold lack of sleep and inadequate

1482
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:22.170
clothing.
In Belgium.
Combat Fatigue reached astronomical proportions.

1483
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:27.510
We'd spent 70 days in the front lines in Holland and didn't have time to recover

1484
01:31:27.511 --> 01:31:32.340
before we boarded the trucks to take us to Bastogne.
On reflection,

1485
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:34.530
I realized what was happening.
What happened.

1486
01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:37.110
By the time the command arrived at Bastogne,

1487
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:42.660
the men had been on the front lines.
Since Normandy,
men were exhausted,

1488
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.900
no hot food,
little sleep,
no rest,

1489
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:49.110
constant tension and intense pressure from combat.

1490
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.600
They were physically exhausted.

1491
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:56.580
Inclement weather and constant rain and snow made matters even worse.

1492
01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:00.670
Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion,

1493
01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:04.000
which in turn causes men to lose discipline.

1494
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.770
The loss of self discipline produces combat fatigue

1495
01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:15.180
over and over again.
Over and over again.
We hear that.

1496
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:18.750
How important is discipline?
It is the most important thing.

1497
01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:20.893
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1498
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:24.750
<v 0>and if,
if discipline is what gets people through these situations,</v>

1499
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.640
through combat stress,
through tension,
through bombs,
through artillery,

1500
01:32:29.641 --> 01:32:31.950
through freezing cold,
lack of food,
lack of sleep.

1501
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:35.060
Imagine what discipline can do in like a normal person's life.
Yeah.

1502
01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.071
Back to the book.

1503
01:32:41.071 --> 01:32:44.670
How can you possibly compare a man who's been under just one concentrated

1504
01:32:44.671 --> 01:32:48.960
artillery bombardment for five minutes to a place like Bastogne where he could

1505
01:32:48.961 --> 01:32:53.961
be in the line for weeks or months in one of Ambrose books,

1506
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:57.940
he states that prolonged artillery bombardment will break any soldier.

1507
01:32:58.770 --> 01:32:59.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1508
01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:00.140
<v 0>In civilian life,</v>

1509
01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:04.640
of course we refer to combat fatigue as a mental breakdown.

1510
01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.810
That is exactly the way it is in combat.
It's a mental breakdown,

1511
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:13.730
the intensity,
it becomes a problem for me to express my feelings here,

1512
01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.200
but I'd like to share it with you.

1513
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:19.010
The intensity of a fire or a heavy concentration.
To be a leader,

1514
01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.480
you have to be able to concentrate on that fire and move just as soon as it

1515
01:33:23.481 --> 01:33:27.260
stops or the last rounds hit move,
get up,

1516
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:31.610
start circulating among your men.
Is everybody okay?
Let's get up,
let's move.

1517
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:35.210
Keep your eye open for an attack,
get their attention,

1518
01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.350
move among your med as quickly as possible and moving among them.

1519
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.040
The fact that they see you and they're talking to you,

1520
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:47.030
they know that you are there and you are talking to them and it makes all the

1521
01:33:47.031 --> 01:33:50.960
difference in the world to know that you are not in this thing by yourself,

1522
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:52.190
<v 1>okay?</v>

1523
01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:56.480
<v 0>That's what officers must do.
Break the cycle of fear,</v>

1524
01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:57.580
<v 1>okay?</v>

1525
01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:02.560
<v 0>If a soldier is concentrating on his own feelings and on his own fear and he</v>

1526
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:06.430
sees you moving around,
he realizes that you're sharing the burden with him,

1527
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:07.810
<v 1>okay?</v>

1528
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.180
<v 0>That's why he can then move.</v>

1529
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:15.490
So that's a very important and that's,
you know,
again,
that can apply to combat.

1530
01:34:15.491 --> 01:34:17.920
That could bought a business.
People are going to start panicking.

1531
01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.420
What are they going to do when they start panicking?

1532
01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:22.900
You and the leader as the leader need to step up.
Get out there,
talk to people,

1533
01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:25.720
find out what's going on.
Tell him that we're going to move.
You do.

1534
01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.420
Show them that you're not afraid and that you are afraid,

1535
01:34:28.421 --> 01:34:32.620
but you're still functioning.
Lead by example.
Plain and simple.

1536
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.730
Back to the book.
Courage will be spent.

1537
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:43.470
If you relax your standards and undisciplined soldier feels isolated and alone.

1538
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:50.950
Maintain the standards.
Don't compromise your integrity,
never get up.

1539
01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:54.700
Give Up.
Don't ever give up.
I love this right here.

1540
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.760
There is always one more that a leader can do to improve his situation and that

1541
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.090
of his command.

1542
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:08.410
I always felt that a leader's physical presence was indispensable to unit

1543
01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:12.220
cohesion and morale.
This is why I've captain,

1544
01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.040
so bell failed so miserably.

1545
01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:17.490
Leadership by example always trumps leadership by fear.

1546
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:25.910
There's always one more thing that a leader can do to improve his situation and

1547
01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:28.580
that of his command is always one more thing you can do,

1548
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:34.010
and an undisciplined soldier feels isolated and alone.

1549
01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.280
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1550
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.200
<v 0>They know they've given up that self respect.</v>

1551
01:35:37.201 --> 01:35:38.100
How are you going to give it back to him?

1552
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:39.183
<v 1>Hmm?</v>

1553
01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:46.090
<v 0>When your men are dying and you do not,
you feel ashamed.</v>

1554
01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:52.460
I don't know any other way of saying it.
Soldiers in war,

1555
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:57.550
certainly in world war two and I suspect in every war are generally young men in

1556
01:35:58.251 --> 01:35:59.084
their prime.

1557
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:04.470
They meet death daily and in every form

1558
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.860
they fully realize the hazards of their profession.

1559
01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.480
They take chances because no young man expects to die before middle age.

1560
01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:17.440
When the first soldier dies,

1561
01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:21.230
that belief in immortality is shattered.

1562
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:26.810
As casualties mount and the core of the unit grows fewer.

1563
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:29.540
The remaining soldiers grow even stronger,

1564
01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:31.910
often shutting off replacement soldiers.

1565
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.080
They don't want to know the replacements because they are often the first to
die.

1566
01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:40.803
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1567
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:43.520
<v 0>When I saw one of my men wounded,</v>

1568
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:46.610
I was happy that he had a ticket home,

1569
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:51.350
a soldier killed in battle.
Was it peace?

1570
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:56.800
He had lived his life among men whom he had loved.

1571
01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.980
I took a degree of constellation and knowing that my men had lived rather than

1572
01:37:02.981 --> 01:37:06.040
regretting that they had died,

1573
01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:11.260
uh,
soldiers,
real fear is not losing his life in combat,

1574
01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.300
but placing his comrades in jeopardy.

1575
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:20.070
That's why ordinary men were performing in extraordinary ways to ensure that

1576
01:37:20.741 --> 01:37:22.360
their buddies survive.

1577
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.943
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1578
01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:30.820
<v 0>So this is another level of</v>

1579
01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.410
war when you're actually,

1580
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:39.970
and I'd never was at this point by any stretch where you're looking at men that

1581
01:37:39.971 --> 01:37:42.700
get wounded in St Oh,
lucky him.
He's got to take it home.

1582
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:48.330
We just weren't under that neath that kind of casualty level

1583
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:55.500
at all.
So when guys were getting wounded,
it was,
you know,

1584
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:59.070
it was hard.
It was,
you didn't feel like cook all about lucky him.

1585
01:37:59.071 --> 01:38:01.560
He's got to take it home because there wasn't enough guys getting wounded to

1586
01:38:01.561 --> 01:38:04.080
make you think that way and not enough guys getting killed to make you think

1587
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:06.210
that way.
Small percentage.

1588
01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:08.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1589
01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:13.420
<v 0>That's as reaching a whole new level
back to the book.</v>

1590
01:38:13.421 --> 01:38:17.800
If you've selected the right personnel,
then a leader must instill discipline.

1591
01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:21.250
I mean,
perfect discipline as patent once said,

1592
01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:23.290
discipline is the soul of the army.

1593
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:24.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1594
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:28.250
<v 0>General Washington said the same thing when he described the continental army in</v>

1595
01:38:28.251 --> 01:38:33.251
1776 discipline is manifested in how well a soldier keeps his uniform.

1596
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1597
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:39.100
<v 0>How frequently he cleans his weapon and the pride he has in his unit.</v>

1598
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:47.890
Joe Hogan of easy company speaks for all of us on the subject of pride in

1599
01:38:48.171 --> 01:38:53.171
company e during an argument with a soldier from another company about whose

1600
01:38:53.451 --> 01:38:56.000
company was better.
Joe Said,
my company,

1601
01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:01.060
he will lick your company in 15 minutes and if you wait until the guys who are

1602
01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:03.860
AWOL come back,
we'll do it in five minutes.

1603
01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:10.290
And this is important.
Unit pride leads to unit discipline.

1604
01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.440
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1605
01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.221
<v 0>so again,</v>

1606
01:39:13.221 --> 01:39:16.820
now we're going back to the feelings that I had when I was a young kid in the

1607
01:39:16.821 --> 01:39:21.800
seal teams.
I get it.
Pride in Michael Tune.
And this is funny cause you just say,

1608
01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.840
I'm like,
look,
the guys that are gone right now,

1609
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:25.910
they're a Walter absent without leave.

1610
01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:27.680
If they give you wait for them to come back,

1611
01:39:27.681 --> 01:39:31.640
we'll be getting this done in five minutes.
But you know,
I feel like this,

1612
01:39:31.641 --> 01:39:36.470
this unit pride and unit discipline,
how they go together.
It's like a gang.

1613
01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:39.620
I don't know why I think of it this way and I talked about this,
the monster.

1614
01:39:39.650 --> 01:39:43.150
It's like a gang mentality when you start policing yourself up,
right?
Yeah.

1615
01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:48.320
When we,
when I was in a school platoon we,
it wasn't our bosses that were,

1616
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:51.680
we're trying to keep us in line.
We kept ourselves in line.

1617
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:53.240
You didn't want to get out of the side.

1618
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.350
You didn't want to do something wrong because we you're going to get policed up

1619
01:39:57.351 --> 01:40:00.740
by the boys.
The e five mafia is what we work,

1620
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:03.770
so the e five mafia,
that's a real thing by the way,

1621
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:05.900
the e five mafia in a seal platoon,

1622
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.800
you got the senior guys who's like the the platoon,
the platoon chief,

1623
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:12.770
the leading petty officer.
Those are,

1624
01:40:12.771 --> 01:40:15.860
those are like [inaudible] seven and you've got the assistant platoon commander.

1625
01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:17.630
Those,
those are like the,
they call them the top four.

1626
01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:21.170
Those are the guys that kind of run the actual leadership and then you got the

1627
01:40:21.171 --> 01:40:25.490
nugs and then in the middle of the pack right there you've got the [inaudible].

1628
01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:28.200
They're the guys that are actually running things and making things happen and

1629
01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:32.270
the e five mafia is what we call them and then in a is [inaudible] e five mafia

1630
01:40:32.271 --> 01:40:37.190
and all works together to make things happen.
But with the e five mafia,

1631
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:40.160
if you've got a good unit,
that e five mafia,

1632
01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:42.890
they're policing up everything and you don't need to,
as a leader,

1633
01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.910
you just need to make sure that they don't take it too far is the only thing you

1634
01:40:46.911 --> 01:40:48.450
need to make sure,
but they're going to,

1635
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.010
they're going to make sure guys are doing the right thing.

1636
01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:51.320
They're going to make sure that they're performing well,

1637
01:40:51.321 --> 01:40:52.500
they're gonna make sure that they're in good shape,

1638
01:40:52.501 --> 01:40:53.910
they're going to make sure I'm all those things.
Hmm.

1639
01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.320
And this was an interesting quote.
What you tolerate,
you can dome,

1640
01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:10.860
so again,
extreme ownership written by myself and Lafe,

1641
01:41:10.861 --> 01:41:13.650
Bab and wildlife,
Bab and wrote a line in there.
It says,
it's not what you preach,

1642
01:41:13.651 --> 01:41:17.700
it's what you tolerate and he hadn't read this book and here it is.

1643
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:22.630
What you tolerate.
You can donate to saying the exact same thing.
If you knew,

1644
01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.500
let standards start to slide you.
That's what you're done.

1645
01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:26.730
That's the new standard.
Yeah,

1646
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.533
<v 1>of course.</v>

1647
01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:36.690
<v 0>There's a little bit more to leadership than what we've talked about so far.</v>

1648
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:37.650
Back to the book.

1649
01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.680
Leading in battle is the art of dealing with human nature and the human

1650
01:41:43.621 --> 01:41:47.580
condition.
I can't speak of higher command,

1651
01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:50.640
but I know a few things about leadership.
At the small unit level.

1652
01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:55.620
Leadership at all levels wins wars,
but soldiers at the platoon,

1653
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:58.290
company and battalion levels when battles,

1654
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:02.760
I think this is particularly true in the national army were soldiers need to

1655
01:42:02.761 --> 01:42:06.150
understand the reasons behind the officer's orders.

1656
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:11.380
We have to know why we're doing what we're doing.
Would I have succeeded?

1657
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:13.930
Had I been promoted beyond battalion?
I don't know.

1658
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.120
I do know that I felt comfortable at the small unit level.

1659
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.110
This is one reason why easy company holds such a tender place in my heart.

1660
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:26.920
I knew the strengths and weaknesses of every paratrooper.

1661
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:31.750
I could rapidly ascertain what I wanted to do and felt confident that I could

1662
01:42:31.751 --> 01:42:36.640
convince the men to do it.
After commanding easy company in Normandy and Holland,

1663
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:41.230
I know that the men felt comfortable and trusting their lives to my care.

1664
01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:42.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1665
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.440
<v 0>I'm not bragging because it's not my nature to do so.</v>

1666
01:42:45.441 --> 01:42:50.441
I'm stating fact knowing that I would never ask them to do anything that I

1667
01:42:50.511 --> 01:42:55.490
wouldn't do myself.
Led to easy companies,
confidence in me as a leader.

1668
01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:57.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1669
01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:01.800
<v 0>They knew that I would never quit and then I would do everything within my power</v>

1670
01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:03.570
to bring them home after the war.

1671
01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.990
I'm proud when I hear a paratrooper from easy company,

1672
01:43:08.991 --> 01:43:12.490
your second battalion remark about my courage under fire and my willingness to

1673
01:43:12.491 --> 01:43:13.810
share their hardships.

1674
01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.080
I told you once that wars do not make great men.

1675
01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:19.820
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1676
01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.060
<v 0>but war sometimes bring out the greatness in good men,</v>

1677
01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.630
human nature.
That's what it is.

1678
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:37.140
And you know that's sorta how I described this podcast.
Now,

1679
01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:42.150
an exploration of human nature and if you want to see human nature reveal itself

1680
01:43:42.151 --> 01:43:43.560
and its most clearest form,

1681
01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.160
you have to go to war to look at that or others.

1682
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.400
Very strenuous situations,
harsh situations

1683
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.550
upon returning from the war.

1684
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.260
Here's what major winters had to say back to the book.
The war changed me.

1685
01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.720
I returned to the states bitter.

1686
01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:07.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1687
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:12.800
<v 0>A different man than the young man who had enlisted in the army in 1941 I was</v>

1688
01:44:13.501 --> 01:44:15.030
hardened when I returned.

1689
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:20.170
First impressions were more important than they had previously been.

1690
01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.110
I looked at things differently.

1691
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1692
01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.160
<v 0>When you returned from a wartime environment,
you have to adjust to society,</v>

1693
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:32.180
the life that you are going to be sharing with others just to make a living.

1694
01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.670
Though I was comfortable in a combat environment,

1695
01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:39.600
I wondered if I would feel at home among civilized people who wouldn't be able

1696
01:44:39.601 --> 01:44:42.270
to understand how a soldier thinks and feels.

1697
01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:48.390
I came to understand that I would have to make changes to be accepted into life

1698
01:44:48.391 --> 01:44:49.224
at home.

1699
01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.680
This takes time and it's never easy.

1700
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.180
While we're on the front lines and prolonged combat.

1701
01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:01.000
I often wondered about my friends back in the states,

1702
01:45:01.001 --> 01:45:06.001
old friends I had grown up with some of whom had avoided coming over either by

1703
01:45:06.011 --> 01:45:10.930
becoming conscience as objectors or working in Warren Leight related factories

1704
01:45:10.931 --> 01:45:13.360
that the federal government had declared essential.

1705
01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:15.850
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1706
01:45:15.850 --> 01:45:16.631
<v 0>I understand.</v>

1707
01:45:16.631 --> 01:45:20.650
Everyone doesn't have to share my belief that military service is the only form

1708
01:45:20.651 --> 01:45:21.890
of service in war time,

1709
01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:25.270
but I took immense pride in my contribution to the war effort.

1710
01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:30.430
We who fought the war were part of something noble.

1711
01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:31.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1712
01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.510
<v 0>Military service is an honor.
A privilege.</v>

1713
01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:38.950
Funny thing is that when I finally returned home,

1714
01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:42.970
I had no desire to pick up with those friends who managed to skip the whole

1715
01:45:42.971 --> 01:45:43.804
thing.

1716
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:45.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1717
01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:46.420
<v 0>I completely shut them out.</v>

1718
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1719
01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.920
<v 0>I wouldn't come downstairs when they knocked on the door.</v>

1720
01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:56.800
Even today,
when I look at a man or a woman,
I can't help but judge them.

1721
01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:58.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1722
01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.120
<v 0>Does he have leadership capabilities?
Would she be good in combat?</v>

1723
01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:07.540
Does he or she have what it takes?

1724
01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1725
01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.530
<v 0>And I think you know clearly</v>

1726
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:16.693
<v 1>right</v>

1727
01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.970
<v 0>when you come home,
those are things I think everybody goes through of,</v>

1728
01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:22.960
you're looking at people,
you're kind of judging people.

1729
01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.270
It certainly will leave a mark.
I,
I'll tell you,

1730
01:46:28.271 --> 01:46:31.150
I don't think there's enough veterans now.
You know,

1731
01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.890
you're not gonna be able to just hang around with veterans.

1732
01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.120
It's not going to happen.
You got to,

1733
01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:37.600
you got to understand and accept the fact that not everyone served the way you

1734
01:46:37.601 --> 01:46:42.210
served.
That's just the way it is and
I don't,

1735
01:46:42.450 --> 01:46:47.450
I try to make sure that I eat don't outwardly hold people to a higher

1736
01:46:47.821 --> 01:46:51.390
expectation.
Any other thing is,

1737
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.580
I think you have to walk a fine line and you got to make sure you're not looking

1738
01:46:56.581 --> 01:47:00.960
down on people because they didn't choose the path that you chose.

1739
01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:05.961
Now World War II was different cause or at least appears to be different because

1740
01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:10.890
it was so easy.
So many people went on the path of,
okay,
you know,

1741
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:15.210
December 7th happened,
I'm going to sign up tomorrow,
today,
whatever.

1742
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.700
And I think that the way these wars that we've been fighting have gone down,

1743
01:47:20.701 --> 01:47:24.270
it hasn't been the same.
It's been different and I think we,

1744
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:28.680
veterans right now have to use some caution before just shutting out everyone

1745
01:47:28.681 --> 01:47:31.200
else at that didn't serve the way we did.

1746
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:35.190
We'd be shutting out basically.

1747
01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:37.800
You probably be shutting out most of the people in your lives.
Most,

1748
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:41.550
most of my friends outside the seal teams there,
you know Jujitsu.

1749
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:44.430
I've got a bunch of friends from Jujitsu,
none of them served.

1750
01:47:45.330 --> 01:47:46.650
I can't just shut them all out,

1751
01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:52.520
so I think we have to be careful about that as as veterans to make sure we

1752
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:57.800
you're going to have those feelings.
Understood.

1753
01:47:59.690 --> 01:48:02.970
Understand that there's more than that and you got to,

1754
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:07.250
you got to accept other things going on in the world besides a what we did

1755
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.710
another letter that

1756
01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.950
Dick Winters wrote to d Allman.
Going back to the book,
when you're an officer,

1757
01:48:21.951 --> 01:48:24.770
you are responsible for the lives of soldiers in your command.

1758
01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.900
You think about kids like this one pair of trooper.

1759
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:32.960
I knew well and you soon become old beyond your years.

1760
01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.450
In the three years since I had entered the army,
I aged a great deal.

1761
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.290
<v 0>It seems as if college days and days of civilian life when I did as I pleased</v>

1763
01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:48.970
are long past,
I must've been,
it must have been a dream,

1764
01:48:49.210 --> 01:48:54.190
a small and short,
but beautiful part of my life.
Now,

1765
01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:58.060
all I do is work,
work to improve myself as an officer,

1766
01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:01.060
work to improve them as fighters,
as men,

1767
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:03.910
make them work to improve themselves.

1768
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:10.110
The result is I am old before my time,
not physically old,

1769
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:13.710
but hardened to the point where I can make the rest of them look like

1770
01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:18.711
undeveloped high school boys old to the extent where I can keep going after my

1771
01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:22.230
men fall over and sleep from exhaustion.

1772
01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:24.520
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1773
01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:25.450
<v 0>I can keep going.</v>

1774
01:49:25.451 --> 01:49:30.451
As a mother who works after her sick child and exhausted child has fallen asleep

1775
01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:34.720
old to the extent where if it's a decision or advice needed,

1776
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:38.350
my decisions are taken as if the wisdom behind them was infallible.

1777
01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.160
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1778
01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.220
<v 0>Yes.
I feel old and tired from training these men to the point where they are</v>

1779
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:48.040
efficient fighters.
I hope it means

1780
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.130
<v 1>that some will return to those girls back home.</v>

1781
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:59.300
<v 0>And again,
the reason I put that in there is because there's,</v>

1782
01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:02.300
that's pressure,
right?

1783
01:50:02.301 --> 01:50:05.600
That's the certain amount of pressure that a person that's been in the military

1784
01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.630
has felt and

1785
01:50:11.370 --> 01:50:13.530
it's real.
That pressure

1786
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:22.960
and his wife said,
Dick fights the battle of the bulge of virtually every night.

1787
01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.050
He had recurring nightmares.

1788
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:31.420
So even dick winters,
you know,

1789
01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.480
a very thoughtful and squared away guy was still living those nightmares

1790
01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.640
virtually every night.
His wife said,

1791
01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:47.510
Dick also said back to the book,

1792
01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.950
I know I did everything within my power to ensure as many soldiers made it home

1793
01:50:51.951 --> 01:50:53.240
from the war as possible.

1794
01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:59.000
But when you survive and your soldiers don't,

1795
01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:00.920
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1796
01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.850
<v 0>you feel guilty.</v>

1797
01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.380
It haunts me to this day that I lived and so many of my paratroopers died

1798
01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:14.520
as the veterans of easy company pass on.

1799
01:51:14.850 --> 01:51:18.210
I reminded of those who never returned from the war.

1800
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:23.270
I see their faces.

1801
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.530
I can almost hear them calling me

1802
01:51:39.450 --> 01:51:42.020
good again.
I think that everybody that's served

1803
01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:47.560
and survived when your friends and your brothers didn't,

1804
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:51.550
you're always going to have that.

1805
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:57.190
It's not going to go away.

1806
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.190
And Dick Winters,

1807
01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:20.210
Major Dick winters died January 2nd,

1808
01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:21.413
2011

1809
01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.970
obviously they had a memorial service,

1810
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:30.510
the big memorial service for him back to the book.

1811
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:34.200
Those who remained alive voiced their sympathy,

1812
01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:40.640
said former platoon sergeant William Gardner who had lost a leg outside Bastogne

1813
01:52:43.730 --> 01:52:45.770
Dick always said,
hang tough.
Follow me

1814
01:52:47.610 --> 01:52:50.400
when he said let's go.
He was right in the front.

1815
01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:51.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1816
01:52:51.690 --> 01:52:54.450
<v 0>He was never in the back.
A leader personified.</v>

1817
01:52:55.650 --> 01:52:57.600
He was the best commander we ever had.

1818
01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:58.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1819
01:52:58.950 --> 01:53:00.210
<v 0>We'd have followed him anywhere.</v>

1820
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:06.890
Edward Babe Heffernan who served alongside winners at Bastogne and who helped

1821
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:10.670
liberate Hitler's Eagle's nest added.
He was one hell of a guy,

1822
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:15.690
one of the greatest soldiers I ever was under.
He was a wonderful officer,

1823
01:53:15.810 --> 01:53:20.160
a wonderful leader.
He had what you needed.
Guts and brains.

1824
01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:21.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:24.490
<v 0>He took care of his men.
That's very important.</v>

1826
01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:31.030
Pop by when added,
it seemed as if you always made the right decision.

1827
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:35.630
He was a real soldier.
He was one of the best.

1828
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1829
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:39.170
<v 0>It started with him doing the right thing.</v>

1830
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:44.940
I don't know how he survived the war,
but he did

1831
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:51.500
another easy company veteran concurred noting every one of us.

1832
01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:52.970
We'd follow him to hell.

1833
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:57.600
That's the type of guy he was.

1834
01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.840
And also speaking at that ceremony was a guy by the name of Eric jury gendered

1835
01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:15.760
person who is the screenwriter or one of the screenwriters for band of brothers.

1836
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:18.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1837
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:23.290
<v 0>And he was trying to get the screenplay and the series to be as accurate as</v>

1838
01:54:26.601 --> 01:54:27.231
possible.

1839
01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:30.410
And so he spent a lot of time with Dick winters and he got to know him very well

1840
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:35.480
and I found what he said about Dick winters to be very important.

1841
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:36.800
Here we go back to the book,

1842
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:41.630
Dick Winters made it his personal quest to excel,

1843
01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:47.790
whether it was executing the perfect pushup or training himself to run three

1844
01:54:47.791 --> 01:54:50.220
miles up and down Kerr he mountain.

1845
01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:54.690
This pursuit was his private tool is solution.

1846
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.610
And it was that solo effort,

1847
01:54:58.790 --> 01:55:03.790
that obsessive clarity and pure determined self contained purpose that is met,

1848
01:55:05.901 --> 01:55:09.650
observed and that caused them to follow.
When he said,

1849
01:55:09.651 --> 01:55:11.120
simply follow me.

1850
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:12.730
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1851
01:55:12.730 --> 01:55:17.440
<v 0>not just through that hedge row in Normandy and across that field and Holland</v>

1852
01:55:17.441 --> 01:55:21.780
under enemy fire,
but follow my example,

1853
01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.370
follow my commitment

1854
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.880
and we'll get through this.

1855
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:30.290
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1856
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:31.670
<v 0>then we will succeed.</v>

1857
01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:42.040
Dick winters was laid to rest in his family plot

1858
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.640
in the Evangelical Lutheran cemetery in the Frat up Pennsylvania,

1859
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.100
the Saturday following his death.

1860
01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:59.530
It his gravestone,
read simply

1861
01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.420
Richard Di Winters,

1862
01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:09.040
World War 201st airborne

1863
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.880
1918 to 2011

1864
01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:31.470
and Dick winters before he died said,

1865
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:35.190
I am the man I am today because of easy company,

1866
01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:41.740
easy company made me as I reflect upon my life since the war.

1867
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:45.750
I can honestly say that it has been a lifetime search for men.

1868
01:56:45.751 --> 01:56:47.760
Like those I knew an easy company.

1869
01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:51.370
I haven't found too many,

1870
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:56.610
I don't think I know brave or soldiers than Joe Toy.

1871
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:59.010
They'll go onto your fluid.
Talbert.

1872
01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:02.470
I live with these guys every day.

1873
01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:08.780
I mourn when they pass Carwood lipped and died in December,

1874
01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:12.940
2001 his death struck me particularly hard.

1875
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:15.830
So did bull ramble mints.

1876
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:22.170
Lipton didn't live to see the acclaim easy company received when the mini series

1877
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:23.010
was released.

1878
01:57:25.670 --> 01:57:27.800
I try not to think of the bad times anymore.

1879
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:30.800
I think mostly of the good times,

1880
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:35.630
the emotion will always be there

1881
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:55.873
<v 1>and</v>

1882
01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:03.300
<v 0>no Dick Winters said that war brings out greatness and men</v>

1883
01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:10.770
and he also realized that war makes you appreciate

1884
01:58:12.570 --> 01:58:13.403
your country.

1885
01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:24.650
The major winners before he died said,
well,
it probably sounds strange to you,

1886
01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:30.460
but when I brought easy company to Utah Beach so we could board the lst to

1887
01:58:30.481 --> 01:58:33.510
return to England on July 11th,

1888
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:38.070
1944 I saw that beach for the first time with that vast armada of ships as far

1889
01:58:38.071 --> 01:58:39.810
as the eye could see in every direction.

1890
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:46.440
Seeing the American flag fluttering over that beach,

1891
01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:49.950
I felt weak in the knees and tears filled my eyes.

1892
01:58:51.930 --> 01:58:56.930
Suddenly that flag meant something different than it ever had before.

1893
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:04.000
I've never looked at our flag since without that memory in mind.

1894
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.580
Now I'm an old man,
but that feeling has never left me

1895
01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.070
and finally

1896
01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:29.980
then I always say

1897
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:35.650
that war is awful

1898
01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.200
in war is a nightmare,

1899
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.660
but war does certainly make you appreciate life

1900
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:02.670
and Dick winters certainly appreciated the rest of his life.

1901
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.560
Then he said this,

1902
02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:16.600
I sit here in this house and I gaze out the window.

1903
02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:18.810
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1904
02:00:18.810 --> 02:00:21.330
<v 0>I see flowers and the birds</v>

1905
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:25.720
I'd be hold the wonder of nature,

1906
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:31.150
everything seems okay.

1907
02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:33.313
<v 1>So beautiful.</v>

1908
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:51.780
<v 0>That wraps up that book.</v>

1909
02:00:56.330 --> 02:01:00.590
Everything seems so beautiful.

1910
02:01:00.591 --> 02:01:03.440
And you know,
over the past couple of weeks

1911
02:01:05.090 --> 02:01:09.140
I've been traveling a bunch and meeting a lot of different people.

1912
02:01:09.141 --> 02:01:13.460
Business people,
workers,

1913
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:15.410
<v 1>okay.</v>

1914
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:20.260
<v 0>Police and firefighters and active duty military and veterans,</v>

1915
02:01:20.630 --> 02:01:21.463
just people.

1916
02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:26.270
And we,

1917
02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.120
we get caught up in all kinds of chaos and mayhem

1918
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.370
may him from the past.
We get caught up in that about what we should have done

1919
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.690
or what we should have left undone.

1920
02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.830
And we feel this pressure about the future,

1921
02:01:49.831 --> 02:01:54.060
about what we should do or what we shouldn't do or where we're going and how we

1922
02:01:54.061 --> 02:01:55.710
should get there.
And I get that.

1923
02:01:59.490 --> 02:02:02.130
I get that,
I understand it.
I feel it too.

1924
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:06.890
The life is hard.

1925
02:02:09.670 --> 02:02:13.330
Life is hard.
And if you weren't careful,

1926
02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:15.490
it will grind you down.

1927
02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:20.423
And you know,

1928
02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.760
I talk about detachment a lot from a leadership perspective and we talked about

1929
02:02:26.490 --> 02:02:30.990
today and it's certainly important,
but it's also a tool

1930
02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:37.340
for your mind
and for your sanity.

1931
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:38.420
Step back,

1932
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:44.620
step back and look around

1933
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:52.530
not just to see what your next move is and where to head next and what to focus

1934
02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:55.410
on,
but to step back,
to look around and,

1935
02:02:57.730 --> 02:02:58.630
and sea life.

1936
02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:04.490
This life,
your life,

1937
02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.640
not surrounded by the pressure and the war and the failures and the violence and

1938
02:03:09.861 --> 02:03:14.000
the nightmares and the mistakes and the grind.
Not that life,

1939
02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:21.030
but life as it is

1940
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:26.460
as it is without our intervention,

1941
02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.293
a blessing,

1942
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:37.970
a journey,

1943
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:43.330
a short little bit of time on an incredibly fast moving sphere of amazement.

1944
02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.230
Where if you can detach

1945
02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:58.260
and step back and look for a moment,

1946
02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.193
you'll see

1947
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:07.930
that like Dick Winterset,

1948
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.200
everything seems
so beautiful.

1949
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:25.550
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1950
02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:30.260
So Echo Charles.
Yeah,

1951
02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.340
some lessons.
Yeah,

1952
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:39.810
very impactful

1953
02:04:41.610 --> 02:04:45.900
for me in a big reminder for me,
we,

1954
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:50.990
we worked heavily with the first of the five oh six band of brothers in the

1955
02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:53.610
battle of Ramadi.
We had,
uh,

1956
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:58.470
the Delta platoon commander and a group of his guys spent the whole time over

1957
02:04:58.471 --> 02:05:01.320
there and what an incredible bunch of soldiers.

1958
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.510
They were just incredible.
The impact that they had on the battlefield,

1959
02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:08.790
the leadership I saw at every level level.

1960
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.690
And whenever I think of the band of brothers,

1961
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:17.040
my first thoughts when I think in the band of brothers isn't about Dick Winters.

1962
02:05:17.041 --> 02:05:20.340
It isn't about the series,
it isn't about the books.

1963
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:23.190
My first thought of the band of brothers is the first of the five Oh six

1964
02:05:23.191 --> 02:05:28.191
battalion that we were honored to work with in the battle Ramadi and one of my

1965
02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:34.620
platoons worked intensely with the entire time.

1966
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:39.360
And so for their service and sacrifice,

1967
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:44.910
we w I am eternally thankful for what they did and what they taught us.

1968
02:05:44.911 --> 02:05:49.770
And for us,
being alongside them was a real humbling,

1969
02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:52.440
real humbling.
Yeah.

1970
02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:58.980
You mentioned how,

1971
02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:01.250
how like

1972
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:06.140
<v 2>in all these books and all these lessons that discipline is like so important</v>

1973
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:11.890
and there was time you mentioned like imagine or imagine how important it is or

1974
02:06:13.131 --> 02:06:17.000
how beneficial,
whatever it could be just in everyday life.
I remember that.
Yeah,

1975
02:06:17.150 --> 02:06:21.830
that's,
that's crazy.
In the more books like this that we go over,

1976
02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:26.600
whatever that message like becomes more and more clear because you know how like

1977
02:06:26.601 --> 02:06:28.910
you get 'em like creative guys,
you know,

1978
02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:30.800
but they don't have discipline kind of thing.

1979
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:33.960
Or you get super disciplined guys but they don't have creativity or you know,

1980
02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.070
kind of.
But every once in a while you'll get,

1981
02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:40.280
you'll find a person or you'll notice a person who does bring them together,

1982
02:06:40.281 --> 02:06:41.870
you know,
and you see the results.

1983
02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:45.170
Like you see what kind of productivity or you just,

1984
02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.330
you just see the results in one way or another.
You know,

1985
02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:52.130
like these get like fighters or,
you know,
I don't know,
author like anyone.
Anyone.

1986
02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.530
Absolutely.
So,
uh,
man,
it's crazy how,

1987
02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:01.120
because even if you're like naturally gifted or whatever at something you in a

1988
02:07:01.221 --> 02:07:04.970
way that's really cool.
I don't know what that's like,

1989
02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:08.870
but I mean it,
let's say you notice someone and you see it in,

1990
02:07:08.871 --> 02:07:11.360
in all these different fields as well,
or where,
oh,

1991
02:07:11.361 --> 02:07:14.180
someone that's got a lot of natural talent.
Yeah.
But then don't,

1992
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:17.150
they don't have to because essentially through upbringing or whatever,

1993
02:07:17.151 --> 02:07:20.150
that just their environment,
they don't need it really.
You know,

1994
02:07:20.151 --> 02:07:21.890
they don't need it.
Like just get away with it.

1995
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:24.050
Cause that's just one of their talent.
They get away with it.
Yes,

1996
02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:24.910
exactly what I mean,
I mean

1997
02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.390
<v 0>I think we hear that a lot.
This idea that,
you know,
talent,</v>

1998
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:32.380
it doesn't mean anything if you don't have the discipline to make things happen.

1999
02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:35.920
And I'm a person that's highly disciplined,
will outperform

2000
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.530
<v 2>someone that might be more talented all day long,
all day long.
Yeah.</v>

2001
02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.660
It was all day long.
Too strong as you had in the beginning,
in the beginning.

2002
02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:46.820
And I think,
yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
I feel like eventually,
um,

2003
02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:50.560
the discipline is the thing that's just going to carry you through.
So,

2004
02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:54.310
and I thought,
I just thought that was super important where you were like,

2005
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:55.090
imagine if this,

2006
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:58.870
if you apply this to everyday life because everyday life essentially for us

2007
02:07:58.871 --> 02:08:01.900
anyway,
it's like a straight up luxury.
Yeah,
it is.

2008
02:08:01.930 --> 02:08:05.080
And here's what's important about what you're saying is,

2009
02:08:05.170 --> 02:08:10.170
is this fact that the reason that these guys had to have discipline was cause if

2010
02:08:11.111 --> 02:08:14.560
they didn't have discipline,
they would die.
Yeah.
If they didn't have discipline,

2011
02:08:14.561 --> 02:08:16.770
they would be overrun.
If they didn't have discipline,
they would get,

2012
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.090
they would starve.
They would just die.
They would die.

2013
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:20.860
So they have to have discipline.

2014
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:26.070
And your point is in this world and this life in 2017 living in the first world,

2015
02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:32.170
you don't have to have discipline at all and you'll still survive and you might

2016
02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:35.500
even do okay.
Yeah,
sure.
I mean just imagine,

2017
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:41.370
just imagine if you applied the discipline to your life where you'll end up and

2018
02:08:41.591 --> 02:08:46.591
how much better off you'll be and how much more you can do with your life.

2019
02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:51.430
The OneLife you have,
by the way,
how much the more you can do with that life,

2020
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.760
if you just have the discipline and work hard and get after it and you see it in

2021
02:08:57.071 --> 02:09:01.630
little pockets to like,
remember when you're a kid and you're like,

2022
02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:05.450
I'm going to save,
save my money for this.
I Dunno.
Comic Book,
I duNNo,

2023
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:08.200
I'm gonna Save my money.
You don't even have an income by the way,

2024
02:09:08.201 --> 02:09:11.020
but somehow you save all your money.

2025
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:14.710
Like that little corridor that you find that's an old,
you know,

2026
02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.140
I'm going to save that.
I'm going to save that because you have this kind of,

2027
02:09:17.141 --> 02:09:21.100
and in a way like the discipline kind of forms itself around that goal.

2028
02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.550
So you know what it is like,
you know what that means,
you know?

2029
02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.420
So it's real.
Like that's a real thing.
You shouldn't,

2030
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:32.840
you shouldn't be regarded as some ambiguous thing.
That other fancy,

2031
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:37.470
crazy thing at all.
Yeah.
It's a real straightforward,
yeah.
I think,

2032
02:09:37.471 --> 02:09:39.340
I think that was one of the first podcast,

2033
02:09:39.370 --> 02:09:41.140
if we did where I said something along the lines of like,

2034
02:09:41.170 --> 02:09:44.740
you know what you need to do.
Yeah.
The look we all know do it should be doing,

2035
02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:45.611
I think that one of the first,

2036
02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:47.290
there's not too many people that are lost that are going on.

2037
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:49.090
I'm just not sure how to do this.
No.

2038
02:09:49.091 --> 02:09:51.970
They know exactly what we know exactly what do I know exactly what I should be

2039
02:09:51.971 --> 02:09:56.290
doing.
Tell you what it is.
Distractions.
It's too many.

2040
02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:59.380
Distractions and distractions are literally everything.

2041
02:09:59.430 --> 02:10:02.260
There's industries of just distractions.

2042
02:10:02.290 --> 02:10:06.640
That's the whole industry like TV,
TV,
history of distract.
Huge.

2043
02:10:06.641 --> 02:10:11.050
And the in the defense of TV,
TV can be edgy.
Yeah,

2044
02:10:11.130 --> 02:10:15.010
you can cause there's educational stuff on TV.
Um,
defendant,

2045
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.960
I'm just saying like Cedar Point,

2046
02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:21.990
the entertainment industry and I'm not saying these industries have distractions

2047
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:22.751
are bad things.

2048
02:10:22.751 --> 02:10:26.470
I'm not saying that I'm just saying distractions or what gets in the way of,

2049
02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:31.780
I don't know,
for lack of a better term.
Like your your goal.
Yeah.
And

2050
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.480
well we're talking about the very fact of some of your discipline can be used to

2051
02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:41.140
create things that are actually distracting.
I mean if you want,

2052
02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:45.050
if your goal is to create some artistic piece,
whether it's a movie,

2053
02:10:45.051 --> 02:10:48.940
whether it's music,
whether it's whatever.
Yeah.
That,

2054
02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:50.720
that's a distracting thing.
But that's not,

2055
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:53.540
that doesn't mean that it's negative that you want to make that happen because

2056
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:55.220
there's people that'll find something.

2057
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:59.480
I mean the reason you want to create something is I guess you create it for

2058
02:10:59.481 --> 02:11:03.340
yourself.
But then the reward is when other people say,
yes,
I get something out.

2059
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:07.820
Recognition from your peers.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
and when I say distractions,

2060
02:11:07.821 --> 02:11:10.760
I W W in regards to goal,
it's a relative thing.

2061
02:11:10.761 --> 02:11:14.060
Meaning like you're distracted from your path of the goal.
I agree with you.
Yeah.

2062
02:11:14.061 --> 02:11:17.390
But there's also just just mentally,
just just weakness.

2063
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:20.080
Just the easy path I should say.
The discipline plans is hard.

2064
02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:24.050
The the the easy path that anyone wants to jump on when your alarm clock goes

2065
02:11:24.051 --> 02:11:25.100
off,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.

2066
02:11:25.101 --> 02:11:27.710
I've talked about these things a million times.
That's what the problem is.

2067
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:29.030
The problem isn't even a distraction.

2068
02:11:29.031 --> 02:11:31.760
The problem is just the lack of will to do what you need to do.
Right.

2069
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:34.190
It's a distraction.
Can add to that.
That's a,
that's a part of it.

2070
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:35.900
What we do is we take,

2071
02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:41.140
we take are the path of least resistance and then we throw distraction on top of

2072
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:42.710
that.
For instance,

2073
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:45.920
when you open up your computer cause you've got to write a book and instead of

2074
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:47.430
opening the word process you call,

2075
02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.510
I'm just going to check the interwebs real quick.
Distracted.
Yeah,

2076
02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:54.500
you're distracted.
There goes 45 minutes,
you have a taser.

2077
02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:57.580
See flooding the Internet is the Internet is a mind,
a time warp.

2078
02:11:57.630 --> 02:11:59.360
Oh at and time just disappears in the Internet.

2079
02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:01.370
There's a lot of distractions on there for sure.

2080
02:12:01.371 --> 02:12:05.750
And really what I mean by destruction is you have this longterm goal,
right?

2081
02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:07.680
Your goal is your payoff,
your longterm payoff though.

2082
02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:11.270
So the distractions really are these little short term payoff that drag you,

2083
02:12:11.271 --> 02:12:15.840
that dis track you.
So that's what gets us through the destruction.

2084
02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:20.930
And you broke that out for me plus cause you off the track.
Exactly right.

2085
02:12:20.931 --> 02:12:25.370
So the weakness will let those distractions kind of take hold for sure.

2086
02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:28.640
But so yeah they work hand in hand for sure.

2087
02:12:28.641 --> 02:12:33.470
So so if you can see,
cause again that saving money for comic books thing.

2088
02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:34.700
So consider that as the goal.

2089
02:12:34.701 --> 02:12:37.520
So the distractions are going to be the candy that you want to buy or the,

2090
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:39.850
you know,
I don't know.
You play dice with your for,
I dunno,

2091
02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.100
whatever the distractions is in regards to that specific pack.

2092
02:12:43.130 --> 02:12:46.730
I like echoes world right now.
Playing dice with your friends.

2093
02:12:46.731 --> 02:12:50.960
Saving for comic books.
It's like 1956 I like it.

2094
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:56.840
But either way,
like the distraction there are relative.
So when I say,

2095
02:12:56.930 --> 02:13:00.650
okay,
the distractions are there.
When I say there's industries of distractions,

2096
02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:03.380
again,
I'm not saying those are bad things.
They are bad things.

2097
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:07.470
If they're distracting you from your goal so you get out.
It's true.

2098
02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.210
Think about it.
Sometimes you just need to let your mind take a rest.
Yeah,

2099
02:13:11.250 --> 02:13:13.650
filling the need.
One of the game,

2100
02:13:14.090 --> 02:13:18.620
I just flew home from like I've been on the road,
we're all over the world.

2101
02:13:19.010 --> 02:13:21.650
Did the monster,
did a bunch of speeches,

2102
02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:25.880
did some consulting and it was all over the place on a plane the whole time.

2103
02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:30.020
And I flew home from the east coast.

2104
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:32.910
When was that set?
A couple of days ago.

2105
02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:37.290
<v 0>And when I haven't done this in forever.
I flew home,
I watched a movie.</v>

2106
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:42.540
I just did a total distraction cause I said,
you know what?
I can't,
I'm not,
I,

2107
02:13:42.541 --> 02:13:44.730
I'm not,
I'm not in the game right now.
Like I need,

2108
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:49.050
my brain just needs to shut off and do something,
which I don't like to do,

2109
02:13:49.051 --> 02:13:51.630
which is you can either do two things.
I look at it,

2110
02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:56.160
you can either consume or you can produce,
right?
I want to be producing,

2111
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.460
I want to be putting together,
I want to be writing,
I want to be thinking,

2112
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:02.010
I want to be writing,
reading for the podcast,
prepping.

2113
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:03.000
That's what I want to be doing.

2114
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.810
Only producing something consuming is I'm just absorbing what someone else made.

2115
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:09.480
Right?
I'm just going to absorb this,
absorb this,
absorb this.

2116
02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:12.810
A lot of times it is garbage.
So I,
but I flew home,

2117
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:15.450
had a long flight and I was like,
you know what?
I need to check out.

2118
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:19.410
I need to check out right now and just do nothing.
So I watched two movies,

2119
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:21.900
dig it to move.
You got to go.

2120
02:14:23.210 --> 02:14:27.840
The two movies I watched.
The first one was

2121
02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:32.190
not heartbreak ridge.

2122
02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:35.910
It's the new movie that just came out

2123
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:41.370
about dos that Mel Gibson directed,
what's it called?
I Dunno.

2124
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:46.320
There's a big successful movie conscious objector,
World War II.

2125
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:50.130
He wins the medal of honor or he's awarded the Medal of honor.

2126
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:54.270
So that was a good movie.
And you know it's a World War II movie.
I liked it.

2127
02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.250
It's not in my opinion five star.
But it was good.
It was entertaining.
Sure.

2128
02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:04.260
It told the story.
And then after that I watched

2129
02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:10.350
<v 2>zoo lander.
That was what I was going into a full decompression mode.</v>

2130
02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.480
Good [inaudible] lender because it's a hilarious movie.

2131
02:15:14.570 --> 02:15:18.710
I have a buddy in the teams that we nicknamed Moo.
Got To sure.
Yeah.

2132
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:20.300
Cause you know he would go crazy.

2133
02:15:20.630 --> 02:15:24.770
So we had to call [inaudible] and yeah,
that was just a funny,

2134
02:15:24.771 --> 02:15:27.590
where we had just decompressed and I don't do that very often.

2135
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:31.680
<v 0>The grind is always happening.
I just had to take a little detachment.</v>

2136
02:15:31.681 --> 02:15:33.630
What was the name of that movie with?

2137
02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.530
There's not a famous actors,

2138
02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:41.400
I guess there's one who's a really funny guy anyways.

2139
02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:44.640
<v 2>It's a good movie.
Yeah.
So techno what the,
so the question is,</v>

2140
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:48.330
is that really a distraction?
So you know,

2141
02:15:48.331 --> 02:15:51.170
like a football game or a movie or something that,

2142
02:15:51.210 --> 02:15:56.210
that you're not doing to put you more forward on your path or whatever.

2143
02:15:56.790 --> 02:16:00.240
But if you're taking your,
if you're taking a break,
is that a distraction?

2144
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.350
Like if I'm lifting,

2145
02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:05.330
I do a workout and then I go recover from that word or recipes that a district,

2146
02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.700
it wasn't a distraction.
Right.
I should have grinded though.
No,
I'm just kidding.

2147
02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:14.880
I was done.
So tapped out.
So distraction is more of an idea,
more of the concept,

2148
02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:15.420
you know,

2149
02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:17.820
so like it's definitely things that are just like how you said when you open

2150
02:16:17.821 --> 02:16:21.420
your computer and the whole Internet is there to distract him one way or
another.

2151
02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:26.340
That's a distraction.
You know,
where you can eat.
Like,
even if I have a book,

2152
02:16:26.341 --> 02:16:29.260
if my goal is to finish some video,

2153
02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:32.890
but meanwhile I have this book that's really informative and you know something

2154
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:34.990
and I'm like,
you know,
oh,
that book seems real.

2155
02:16:34.991 --> 02:16:36.760
I'm real in the mood to read that book.

2156
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:38.950
That's a distraction even though it's a good thing,
you know?

2157
02:16:38.951 --> 02:16:43.330
So the distraction is like the idea.
So you know,
what are the common goals?

2158
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:45.820
I want to get in shape.
I want to,
um,
you know,

2159
02:16:45.821 --> 02:16:49.960
be a better husband or wife or I want to do better at work on a learn more.

2160
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:52.750
I want to read all this stuff.
You're better at Jujitsu,
get better at digital,

2161
02:16:52.751 --> 02:16:56.920
all this stuff.
You can get distracted by these other things.
You know,

2162
02:16:56.921 --> 02:17:01.390
before I,
I don't know,
read,
I'm going to surf Instagram or something like that.

2163
02:17:01.391 --> 02:17:04.150
That's a distraction,
you know?
And now,

2164
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:08.110
which was my original point is the reason,

2165
02:17:08.111 --> 02:17:12.580
or one of the reasons that we don't apply this extreme discipline as it's

2166
02:17:12.581 --> 02:17:17.080
outlined in these books here is B is one of the reasons is because we have

2167
02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:22.420
literally infinite amount of distraction.
No,
there's also no consequence,

2168
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:26.110
or I shouldn't say that.
The consequence isn't visible consequences.

2169
02:17:26.111 --> 02:17:29.500
You don't say,
you don't say,
Hey,
if I would have had discipline,

2170
02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:31.720
I would reach this ultimate potential.

2171
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:35.200
You just okay with not reaching that ultimate potential and you're okay with

2172
02:17:35.201 --> 02:17:40.190
just like turning up,
putting microwaveable popcorn in and watching a movie.
Dude,

2173
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.270
you've been doing it the whole time.
I'm still here.
Hey,
I'm still here.
I'm good.

2174
02:17:43.570 --> 02:17:46.020
And you know what?
There was a good movie and a popcorn tastes good.

2175
02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:48.010
They all know what I mean.
That's the wrong answer.

2176
02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:50.230
You don't recognize what your potential is,

2177
02:17:50.350 --> 02:17:54.520
and so you're just okay with this kind of half potential.

2178
02:17:54.550 --> 02:17:58.990
You don't reach your potential and since you don't know it and the other thing,

2179
02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:01.600
it's hard to see.
It's hard to see how that long term affects you.
You know,
like,

2180
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:04.390
Oh yes,
just one bag of popcorn is just one movie.

2181
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:08.080
But he did that three times this week.
Yeah.
You know,
that's,
that's not good.

2182
02:18:08.081 --> 02:18:12.640
You 30 times,
you know,
in the,
in the past 10 weeks you could write 30,000 words.

2183
02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.400
No more than that.
You're going to have about thousand words an hour.

2184
02:18:15.610 --> 02:18:19.030
A good way to look at it.
And I think I might've said this where

2185
02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.520
it's not like a moment to moment looking to the future kind of thing.

2186
02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:27.520
You should look at it,
but um,
in the way of,

2187
02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:30.250
in the sense of looking at it in the past.

2188
02:18:30.251 --> 02:18:34.240
So let's say you consider the last one year or two years,
right?

2189
02:18:34.690 --> 02:18:39.220
And let's say I want it to play better guitar,
something good goal.
Yeah,

2190
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:41.590
I have that goal.
I always fail at it.
There you go.

2191
02:18:41.591 --> 02:18:45.850
So you look at it in this way where you don't say,
okay,
if I spend an hour a day,

2192
02:18:46.170 --> 02:18:50.470
um,
you know,
practicing guitar and you know,
in a year I'll be better.

2193
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:51.970
You don't necessarily look like that.
You can't.

2194
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
But a good way to look at it or helpful with is if you look at it last year,

2195
02:18:58.750 --> 02:19:02.470
where,
Dang,
if I,
if I would have played in an hour a day right now,
I would,

2196
02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:06.130
right now as I'm sitting here with you right now,
I'd be,
that'd be dope.

2197
02:19:06.131 --> 02:19:09.260
It Guitar,
you know,
kind of like that.
So you kind of get the ball.

2198
02:19:09.350 --> 02:19:13.630
In my experience,
I've kind of got this feeling of like wasted time,
you know,

2199
02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.250
you know that feeling where it's like,
Dang,
I got to,

2200
02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:17.860
I got to play catch up now that's a little bit more compelling.

2201
02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:21.100
I think sometimes it can be.
So He's thinking about it that way too.

2202
02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:25.900
I think that helps.
I don't know,
maybe,
maybe not.
Speaking of help,

2203
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:30.890
speaking of help and potential,
oh both nicely done.

2204
02:19:30.891 --> 02:19:32.810
Double Gravitational.

2205
02:19:34.630 --> 02:19:39.380
You need help by with supplementation if you're working out.

2206
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:43.670
So man,
how you said you can't not work out.

2207
02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:48.700
I think especially nowadays like you because your life to probability wise is,

2208
02:19:49.211 --> 02:19:53.720
is,
is cruising.
You're cruising physically where you know,

2209
02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:58.070
you go to office because really that's what is physically easy,
right?

2210
02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:03.080
Easier and gets easier and easier.
Even if it's not easy right now,
next year,

2211
02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.510
generally speaking,
it's going to be easier.
You know,

2212
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:11.230
like even like I'm brushing my teeth like I do every week or whatever and it's a

2213
02:20:11.781 --> 02:20:12.950
week whether or not.

2214
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:17.810
And so I have the regular toothbrush,
you know,

2215
02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:20.900
I'm sure there's all kinds of little micro technologies in the toothbrush,

2216
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:24.890
but I started to think,
man,
this there ha,
you know,
this is a old school thing.

2217
02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:26.930
There's automatic toothbrushes.

2218
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:30.170
Actually my brother told me about this to split do this automatic,
you know,

2219
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:33.320
electric toothbrush to hell.
It's like super dope.
And I highly recommended it.

2220
02:20:33.321 --> 02:20:36.500
It was like $89 all this stuff.
And I'm thinking,
Dang,

2221
02:20:36.501 --> 02:20:40.730
something as basic as brushing your teeth is way easier now.
Way Easier.

2222
02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:42.260
I've got a machine to do it.
That's,

2223
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:47.290
that's really the whole narrative with everything point being physically pushed

2224
02:20:50.061 --> 02:20:52.530
yourself cause you're not going to have to push it.
You got to reiterate it.

2225
02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:55.130
Push you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It,
your environment is,

2226
02:20:55.131 --> 02:20:58.650
is starting to work more and more against you in regards to physical activity.

2227
02:20:58.651 --> 02:21:00.260
So my point being,

2228
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:05.690
you got to work out how I was going to say that's a real straight forward thing.

2229
02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:09.670
Workout.
Yeah.
But I feel like it's,
I mean it's easy for you,
you know,

2230
02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:13.130
to to be like,
yeah,
it seems obvious.
You know,

2231
02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:15.470
they call that the curse of knowledge.
You know how when you're,

2232
02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:19.580
you're like so advanced in this one thing that you forget how it is to not be

2233
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.414
advanced.

2234
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:24.260
The Chris have forgotten what it's like to not be advanced in terms of trying to

2235
02:21:24.261 --> 02:21:25.250
explain to people why they would,

2236
02:21:25.251 --> 02:21:27.950
but I think it's pretty self evident to anybody why you'd work out.
No,

2237
02:21:27.951 --> 02:21:30.800
you're wrong.
Yeah.
Okay.
Think about this.
And I think,

2238
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:34.460
and I thought about this one.
Okay.
You don't,
when you go into a Jujitsu gym,

2239
02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:38.660
you're different.
So you may very well not even understand this.

2240
02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:41.900
This might not compute with you,
but if you walk into did you to the gym,

2241
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:44.030
and this applies to even a regular 24 hour fitness gym.

2242
02:21:44.031 --> 02:21:46.640
If you've never been in there before,
it never worked out.

2243
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:50.810
That's a really intimidating thing.
You come in,
everyone's looking at me.

2244
02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:53.330
I don't know how to use the machines.
I don't know how to work out.

2245
02:21:53.331 --> 02:21:56.060
Like everyone's looking at me judging me.
I'm dumb.
It is not my element.

2246
02:21:56.061 --> 02:21:57.780
All this stuff,
it's intimidating,
you know?

2247
02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:02.300
But it's real.
It's what I'm saying.

2248
02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:05.000
You know how you say it like you probably don't know about that because you

2249
02:22:05.001 --> 02:22:08.210
don't have the curse of knowledge in regards to like physical activity working

2250
02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:12.050
out,
you know all that stuff and then the pain that comes with it.
I man,
I dig it.

2251
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:15.890
I understand,
but that's even more of a reason to work out

2252
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:21.510
physical condition anyway.
You'll be glad you did.
If you don't work out,

2253
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:23.330
just jump in there.
Jump in,

2254
02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:27.030
go to the gym last year if you would have started working out,

2255
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:28.650
you know how dope you'd be right now.

2256
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:33.720
Way doper than you are if in the event you didn't start less last year.

2257
02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:38.310
See what I'm saying?
Anyway,
while you work out,
your joints might be kind of sore.

2258
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:42.330
I know this from experience.
Take Krill oil.

2259
02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:44.910
My father in law turned me onto it.

2260
02:22:44.911 --> 02:22:47.620
Actually technically didn't successfully lead.
Turn me onto it.

2261
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:49.110
The total he tried,

2262
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:53.970
he tried and you know I didn't see the light until Jocko turned me on to it.

2263
02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:55.890
So now I'm turning everyone else onto it.

2264
02:22:56.430 --> 02:22:59.640
Hopefully successfully a Krill oil is,

2265
02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:03.480
I'm not going to go into a whole deep thing here,
but it's for your joint,

2266
02:23:03.481 --> 02:23:05.370
so if you get joint pain,
we just,

2267
02:23:05.371 --> 02:23:07.660
with degeneration over time you get older it dig it.

2268
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:12.000
It's Krill oil bring you back.
They'll function.
It's Kinda like your joint joint.

2269
02:23:12.001 --> 02:23:15.360
Certain like always warm now.
Not like to the touch warm,

2270
02:23:15.361 --> 02:23:19.620
but like I'm like ready for action.
You see what I'm saying?
Anyway,
Krill oil.

2271
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:22.890
I ain't even say by who.
Huh?
If you don't know on it.

2272
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.800
That's the whole company and they had,
they don't have just krill oil.

2273
02:23:25.801 --> 02:23:30.240
They have other stuff to duck.
Yeah,
performance stuff.
Sharon deck.

2274
02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:33.000
I recommend shroom tech by the way.
Big Time.
Especially if you're,

2275
02:23:33.001 --> 02:23:35.220
if you're going for performance.
Yeah.

2276
02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:40.050
If you're going to go train Jujitsu with Andy Taylor,

2277
02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.440
Dean Craig Baker,
Greg,

2278
02:23:43.441 --> 02:23:47.730
train echo.
Charles just take,
take the shrimp.

2279
02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:52.630
They know what sport shroom tech sport.
Take three of them.
Oh,
is that the front?

2280
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:55.740
That's the recommended.
I didn't know that and then I read it.

2281
02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:59.130
I'm like one day I just read the instructions for no reason.
I was like,

2282
02:23:59.131 --> 02:24:01.830
I wonder if I take 12 of these things if I'm been into more tech.

2283
02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:06.300
But I did say three because I had been taken to a fro.
Sorry.
It took three.

2284
02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:11.190
It felt a little bit and legit.
Yeah.
I always take three and never let down.

2285
02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:13.830
And again,
that's for the performance.
So if I'm just cruising,

2286
02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:17.820
if I'm just taking a walk around the block or or two,
I take the shroom tech,

2287
02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:21.930
I'm not going to feel it as much as if I jump in.
Did you do three rounds?

2288
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:23.580
You know?
Yeah.

2289
02:24:23.581 --> 02:24:28.581
No I take it when I have to perform a situation.

2290
02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:29.970
Yeah.
Big Time.
Me Too.

2291
02:24:30.810 --> 02:24:34.620
You take shroom tech immune not to be confused with and I've taken shroom tech

2292
02:24:34.621 --> 02:24:36.480
immune when I go massive travel,

2293
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:39.510
just getting all these planes and all these people.
Everyone's sick,
coughing,

2294
02:24:39.511 --> 02:24:42.100
sneezing.
It's all nasty on,

2295
02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:45.360
you know what I do just go ahead and take some shroom tech immune.

2296
02:24:46.090 --> 02:24:50.250
It's something different cause it's yellowish.
The lady,
the labels green too.

2297
02:24:50.251 --> 02:24:54.940
So the um,
the whatever you're eating is more yellow.
Yeah,

2298
02:24:54.941 --> 02:24:57.700
I think the ingredients,
we'll just say the ingredients there.
You know,

2299
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:02.370
I take vitamin C's,
a big travel,
vitamin C,
Trintech Tech Immune.

2300
02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:04.440
Here's zinc is a good one too.
This is what I hear.

2301
02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:07.920
I've taken zinc before to try and overcome a cold,

2302
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:12.480
but I wasn't very uh,
you know,
convinced.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2303
02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:14.820
I can power our power some vitamin C though,

2304
02:25:14.821 --> 02:25:18.950
if I feel like some kind of a disease coming on power the vitamin C and that's

2305
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:23.130
kind of the good thing where you take this,
um,
shroom tech immune.
Yeah.

2306
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:27.430
Like you know,
you know that they were like,
okay,
does vitamin C help?
Okay.

2307
02:25:27.431 --> 02:25:29.740
Check it.
Does zinc in,
I don't know.

2308
02:25:29.741 --> 02:25:33.160
I didn't read the ingredients like you were about to or whatever,

2309
02:25:33.161 --> 02:25:35.910
but I read the effects.
Yeah.
Okay.
Got You.

2310
02:25:35.930 --> 02:25:39.910
Raise my immune system going to need that plane.
A bunch of dirty people.
Not all,

2311
02:25:40.330 --> 02:25:45.130
but many of you men sneezing,
sneezing on everyone,
coughing on everyone.

2312
02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:48.310
And,
and by the way,
cause I'm going to go talk to people.

2313
02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.570
I can't be going Jocko.
Yeah.
Can't do that.

2314
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:55.750
I have to actually be able to talk.
Yeah.
Coffee and seen,

2315
02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:59.470
excuse me for the whole time.
It's awful.
If you,

2316
02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:03.760
if you sneeze or cough when you're on a mic in front of a big group of people,

2317
02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:05.900
not cool or if you keep doing it,

2318
02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:11.950
shroom till good shoot on it.com you know the good stuff's in the Elca.
Yes.

2319
02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:16.980
On it.com you want 10% off all this stuff on it.com/jocko and here's the thing

2320
02:26:17.681 --> 02:26:20.320
we just talked about right now.
We talked about Krill oil,
shroom tech,

2321
02:26:20.321 --> 02:26:23.950
sport from tech,
immune,
alphabet,
alphabet,
bro.

2322
02:26:23.951 --> 02:26:27.820
We could go on all night with this because of all the good stuff.

2323
02:26:27.821 --> 02:26:29.200
This is what I'm saying today.
I did.

2324
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.340
You watched me actually while I have Alpha brand today and I was thinking you

2325
02:26:33.341 --> 02:26:34.390
took it but then when you want it,

2326
02:26:34.391 --> 02:26:37.180
not long story about something and I was sort of wondering,

2327
02:26:37.181 --> 02:26:39.130
maybe he didn't take his Alpha brain today.
Oh Ben.

2328
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:43.480
Then when I wrapped it up you were like,
oh,
here's all that alphabet.

2329
02:26:43.481 --> 02:26:44.314
I didn't see it.

2330
02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.100
That statement made me think you are an alphabet today just cause you were able

2331
02:26:48.101 --> 02:26:50.300
to complete your whole deal right there.
I'm going to get it to you.

2332
02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:54.100
I'll put it back,
listen to echo story and then when it comes to the closure,

2333
02:26:54.101 --> 02:26:55.600
you go get some of that.

2334
02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:02.110
C eight could take lead.
Take my lead example.
You understand what I'm saying?

2335
02:27:02.350 --> 02:27:03.940
The so Alpha brain,
if you don't know,

2336
02:27:03.941 --> 02:27:08.941
cause we haven't talked about it as much as I feel like as far as its role in

2337
02:27:09.070 --> 02:27:13.270
our lives,
my life,
you know,
I'm speaking for myself.
Where you take,
it's neutral.

2338
02:27:13.271 --> 02:27:16.270
It's called nootropic.
It's basically brain food,

2339
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:20.630
brain food supplements,
you know,
like to,
to make your brain,

2340
02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:24.460
you know what I'm going to come together to,
cause I've been taking mostly on it,

2341
02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:28.480
uh,
mostly Alpha brain in the past in the powder because it tastes good.
Yeah.

2342
02:27:28.570 --> 02:27:32.270
The peach and the spice spice.
I've been taking it in that more than a,

2343
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:37.140
I'm going to go and I actually ran out of the pills.
The capsules.
Wait,

2344
02:27:37.141 --> 02:27:39.700
so you,
you'd prefer the capsules,
you're saying?
Well,

2345
02:27:39.701 --> 02:27:43.900
sometimes capsules a little bit more convenient,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like if I'm,

2346
02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:48.220
if I'm doing an event or I'm going to go on a podcast and I didn't,

2347
02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:51.240
I want to just be able to Bam,
it makes sense to me off of Brady in the,

2348
02:27:51.350 --> 02:27:55.600
in the brainy.
See by you're always in a hurry doing a bunch of stuff.

2349
02:27:55.601 --> 02:27:59.950
Probably mix it up a little.
You know,
like when you brew tea it's like,

2350
02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:01.750
I don't know,
it's all experience anyway.

2351
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:07.500
Either way they're both the same deal and they're called nootropics proven by

2352
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:11.290
the way.
I'm not just saying what feels good for me,
so you should take it.

2353
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:15.080
I'm not just saying that now when you,
you say that.
Yeah.

2354
02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:19.030
But to me that means more to me than,
I dunno why,
but like when you say,
oh,

2355
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:22.130
it's been double,
triple blind,
placebo ball ball ball control.
But

2356
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:25.820
<v 0>yeah,
I would rather have like someone that I know say,
Bro,
I'm telling you,</v>

2357
02:28:25.821 --> 02:28:29.080
take this stuff like I did with Krill oil to you.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2358
02:28:29.090 --> 02:28:32.990
It was more important than reading a bunch of facts about it and that takes

2359
02:28:32.991 --> 02:28:36.770
someone that you know and they're saying,
look man,
give it a little crack.

2360
02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:38.300
Trust me on this one.

2361
02:28:38.490 --> 02:28:41.250
<v 2>And I think most people have that in one way or another.
Not with everything,</v>

2362
02:28:41.251 --> 02:28:44.460
but yeah,
like if you recommend a movie or something like that.

2363
02:28:44.461 --> 02:28:48.210
And then meanwhile I look at the review,
three reviews are like super good,

2364
02:28:48.330 --> 02:28:51.830
but then you're like,
eh,
it was junk because of this.
Because of that.
It's,

2365
02:28:54.730 --> 02:28:58.670
<v 0>yeah.
Went right to the classic ninety's con.
It's said nineties comedy.</v>

2366
02:28:58.671 --> 02:29:01.510
What kind of mood is Jocko in when I go to the nineties called,

2367
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:06.140
that's just ridiculous.
That's just ridiculous.

2368
02:29:06.141 --> 02:29:11.030
But I like his own Wilson in that movie.
No,
the other one.
Oh Yeah,
sorry,

2369
02:29:11.031 --> 02:29:14.600
I'm picking Ben.
So like,
I like that Guy Owen Wilson.
He's funny.

2370
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:16.730
I liked him because he comes across as very

2371
02:29:18.350 --> 02:29:22.070
truthful in the way he says.
Almost naive.
Yeah.
He's just like,

2372
02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:22.970
seems like a good dude.

2373
02:29:25.090 --> 02:29:26.440
<v 2>Keep fog to hang out with,</v>

2374
02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:31.750
but he's kind of got this air about them that's pretty Aramide.
Yeah,
yeah,

2375
02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:34.870
yeah.
It's interesting nonetheless,
back to the elephant brain.

2376
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:38.050
I think that when they prove it,
I think certain people,

2377
02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:41.680
certain types of mindsets or whatever kind of more gravitate towards that.

2378
02:29:41.681 --> 02:29:43.390
Like they're like,
okay,
that's cool that it worked for you.

2379
02:29:43.391 --> 02:29:45.160
But that could have been placebo.
That could have been this.

2380
02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:46.960
That could have been your mood that day or whatever.

2381
02:29:47.050 --> 02:29:51.030
If I'm going to commit to this,
I want some on some hard facts.
Some people,

2382
02:29:51.031 --> 02:29:53.230
well this all,
so boom,

2383
02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:57.100
you got the hard facts as well as a legitimate recommendation because I was

2384
02:29:57.101 --> 02:29:59.890
taking this even before you know,
the podcast and stuff,

2385
02:30:01.450 --> 02:30:04.870
so I was into it.
Nonetheless.
I'll brain.
That's a good one.

2386
02:30:04.970 --> 02:30:07.490
A bunch of other cool stuff.
If you're into protein powder,

2387
02:30:07.491 --> 02:30:12.160
the good clean protein powder on there.
All the workout stuff too.
By the way,

2388
02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:16.770
I got a bunch of kettle bells.
They're a primal bells legend belt,

2389
02:30:16.771 --> 02:30:21.100
the artistic one.
They're dope.
Look on my Instagram.
There's some on there.

2390
02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:25.090
Anyway,
that is a good way to support yourself,

2391
02:30:25.330 --> 02:30:29.380
help yourself maintain the workouts,

2392
02:30:29.381 --> 02:30:33.910
physical activity,
all that stuff.
Uh,
so you can be successful in that way.

2393
02:30:34.390 --> 02:30:36.880
I don't think there's any excuse anymore.
I for real,
don't.

2394
02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:41.290
Also good way to support really good way to support Amazon.

2395
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:45.700
Click through when you go and get the book

2396
02:30:47.470 --> 02:30:49.780
conversations with Major Dick Winters,

2397
02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:55.600
go to the website to listed there and click through there.
Boom,

2398
02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:58.330
so basically it's to Amazon.
Click through you,
bite through Amazon,
Amazon,

2399
02:30:58.331 --> 02:31:00.910
click through you before you do your shopping.
Click through the website.

2400
02:31:00.970 --> 02:31:05.800
Amazon boom supports the podcast.
Small action,

2401
02:31:05.801 --> 02:31:09.490
big reaction because the click through only takes what?

2402
02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:14.830
30 seconds.
I think we've determined maximum really,
so you know Kim,
some leeway,

2403
02:31:14.831 --> 02:31:19.831
so we'll say three section second and then the reaction is massive support for

2404
02:31:22.021 --> 02:31:24.420
this podcast.
That's a good way.
Amazon,
click through through the website,

2405
02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:27.990
[inaudible] dot com or I think it's [inaudible] dot com as well,

2406
02:31:27.991 --> 02:31:29.400
but just good to Jocko podcast.com.

2407
02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:32.130
Click through before you do your Amazon shopping.

2408
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:37.140
Also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.
If you haven't already,

2409
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:41.190
stitcher,
Google,
play all these other podcasting,

2410
02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:45.240
providing platforms also on Youtube.

2411
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:49.710
If you don't mind the WII video version of this podcast,
go to youtube,

2412
02:31:49.711 --> 02:31:54.630
watch it there.
It's kind of cool and adds that other layer of experience.
Yeah.

2413
02:31:54.631 --> 02:31:57.120
Everyone seems to do that when there's a guest.
Yeah.

2414
02:31:57.390 --> 02:31:59.610
Cause they don't know who that person is.
They know what you look like.

2415
02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:02.910
They know what I look like most most.
Yeah.
Most people will,

2416
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:05.580
if they're listening to the podcast,
eventually they know what you look like,

2417
02:32:05.581 --> 02:32:09.660
they know what I look like.
And so there's no reason sometimes,

2418
02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:13.860
although sometimes you can see like when certain subjects come up and there's

2419
02:32:13.861 --> 02:32:17.340
maybe some intensity in the podcast,
more people watch it.

2420
02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:20.730
But if it's a pretty mellow podcast and we're just talking about whatever we're

2421
02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:24.870
talking about,
maybe not everyone feels the need to go to youtube,

2422
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:27.720
but when the guest comes on,
people want to see what that person looks like.

2423
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:32.640
And there's usually some more animated interactions.
Yes,
true.
Yeah.
Big Time.

2424
02:32:33.390 --> 02:32:35.250
Yeah man.
So if you're into that you don't want,

2425
02:32:35.310 --> 02:32:40.310
it'd be cool if you made a little clip of when Tim Kennedy was on and I read a

2426
02:32:41.311 --> 02:32:44.490
question from the audience was something along the lines of,
I said,
I said,

2427
02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:47.100
you know,
hey,
you know,

2428
02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:51.380
they took away bayonet training boot camp and Tim Kenny just goes,

2429
02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:52.980
God damn it.

2430
02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:58.390
That's one of my favorite parts of ancient podcast ever.
We need,
in that case,

2431
02:32:58.830 --> 02:33:01.260
I would really appreciate it if you'd make that clip.

2432
02:33:01.290 --> 02:33:06.150
Even if it was like 12 seconds long.
Just the part.
Yeah,
just 12 seconds long.

2433
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:09.510
It would be worth having on there because everyone should know that.

2434
02:33:09.511 --> 02:33:13.920
That's a travesty that they stopped doing data at courses.
Then army bootcamp,

2435
02:33:14.250 --> 02:33:15.720
you got it.
Some people,

2436
02:33:15.721 --> 02:33:18.510
if they don't hear this exact part that me kind of confused,
but hey,

2437
02:33:18.570 --> 02:33:21.480
I think they'll appreciate it.
I think so.
Oh,
they'll hear it.

2438
02:33:22.050 --> 02:33:26.850
They'll dig it fully,
but there's good animation.
Yeah,
no,
he's getting crazy,

2439
02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:30.990
which is fun and really in general,
just the youtube,
that's an added,
like I said,

2440
02:33:30.991 --> 02:33:34.230
in that added visual layer,
you know,
if you're down for it.
Sometimes people,

2441
02:33:34.231 --> 02:33:37.260
you know,
you put it on your tea,
it,
let's say in your Gra you know,

2442
02:33:37.261 --> 02:33:39.630
you're working out or you know,
it's on the TV.

2443
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:42.420
It's kind of like you're in the conversation a little bit more.
It feels like it.

2444
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:46.050
And also if people subscribe to the Youtube Channel,

2445
02:33:46.290 --> 02:33:51.290
then when they can sign up where if you make an excerpt right,

2446
02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:52.770
then they can get that.
Cause that's cool.

2447
02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:56.370
That's good thing is as much easier to share an excerpt from the podcast than it

2448
02:33:56.371 --> 02:34:00.630
is to share an audio.
I don't even know how to share an audio piece of a podcast.

2449
02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.540
How you know how to do that.
It probably can't be done.

2450
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:09.120
Probably that's why we have the youtube.
So yeah,
go ahead.
Subscribe to that one.

2451
02:34:09.121 --> 02:34:11.580
And speaking of the knee,
you mentioned the excerpts.
Yeah.

2452
02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:13.260
You put some excerpts you can't,

2453
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:16.650
you don't want to share or you anticipate that this person not gonna listen to

2454
02:34:16.651 --> 02:34:19.150
two and half hours of a podcast.
When you share it,

2455
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:22.870
you just get the little lesson,
you know,
that you want to share and be like,
hey,

2456
02:34:22.871 --> 02:34:27.660
how did you approach college?
You know what,
everyone,
yeah,
that's a popular,
um,

2457
02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:31.360
because everybody that went to college already wishes they had that when they

2458
02:34:31.361 --> 02:34:32.990
went to college.
So when they,
you know,

2459
02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:35.440
when they encounter someone who's going to,
you know,
go to college,

2460
02:34:35.441 --> 02:34:38.530
their kids are nephew,
neighbor,
whatever,
boom.

2461
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:43.420
They have some advice directly from Jocko.
Anyway,
so yeah,
you can,
you share that,

2462
02:34:43.421 --> 02:34:44.890
subscribe to the Youtube.
That's the point there.

2463
02:34:44.891 --> 02:34:48.640
Subscribe to the Youtube if you want.
And if you want to support and you know,

2464
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:52.030
if you want,
you can sign up for a little alert.
When I upload something on there,

2465
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:54.510
I got those alerts.
You can get out.

2466
02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:58.870
Pretty stoked when I see something coming through.
It's like a little present,

2467
02:34:59.290 --> 02:35:02.830
you know?
Yeah.
It's on youtube.
Good one.
Um,
also chuck was the store,

2468
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:06.500
it's called Jocko store Jocko store.com.
You know,

2469
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:09.040
if you want to tee shirts and whatnot,
discipline equals freedom.

2470
02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:14.290
The one that simply says get after it on the front.

2471
02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:19.300
That seemed to have gone over pretty well.
I'd say.
Well,

2472
02:35:19.570 --> 02:35:24.570
and also it seems worth noting that we now offer the victory MMA shirt to the

2473
02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:34.750
Jocko uniform that I wear all the time.
I wear it when I record the podcasts,

2474
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:38.920
I wear it all the time.
We,
you know,
obviously because we have our gym.
Yeah.

2475
02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:42.670
We have a lot of tee shirts are Jim's name on it.

2476
02:35:42.730 --> 02:35:46.810
And so I wear that tee shirt a lot.
Yeah.
And I always have.
Yeah.

2477
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.710
And then I didn't intentionally do it on the podcast in the beginning.

2478
02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.280
I just happened to be wearing it two or three times.
And then someone said,

2479
02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:58.180
is that the only shirt Jocko where's,
and at that point I said,
why?

2480
02:35:58.181 --> 02:36:02.080
Yes it is no man.
You're like the guy on the fly.

2481
02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:05.940
I remember the movie the fly and the Lady's like,
oh,
what was her,

2482
02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:07.270
I forget her name.
She's like,
Hey,

2483
02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:09.610
that you're only set of clothes or something like that.

2484
02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:12.700
And she sees in his closet that they're all the same.
Oh yeah.
That is me.

2485
02:36:13.930 --> 02:36:18.190
I like to have the things that are the same,
but people would come and ask me,

2486
02:36:18.191 --> 02:36:20.050
hey,
where can I get the teacher?
Where can I get the t shirt?

2487
02:36:20.051 --> 02:36:22.510
So now we put it on the Jocko store.

2488
02:36:22.570 --> 02:36:24.840
Strangely they didn't even have them at victory.

2489
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:28.360
I know would come in and be like,
hey,
we want to the original score.

2490
02:36:28.361 --> 02:36:29.530
This is an original,

2491
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:34.620
this is the original victory MMA tee shirt and we had to re produce it.

2492
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:40.960
It's a reissue and all that,
which just opened its own respect,
right?
Yeah,
it is.

2493
02:36:40.961 --> 02:36:43.890
So I'm trying to think like is that enough?

2494
02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:46.120
It's not because it's the exact same design.

2495
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:51.370
It's literally the exact same.
The same file,
right?
Yeah.

2496
02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:54.130
Boom.
So you didn't get that one if you want it.
Yeah,

2497
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:57.400
you can represent present big time.
It's good.

2498
02:36:57.401 --> 02:36:59.140
It's interesting because yours are like old school,

2499
02:36:59.141 --> 02:37:02.390
so they kind of have like a fade to them.
You know,
you get the known,

2500
02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:07.210
they're like Whoa.
Leeming beaming.
I'm clean minute.
Grab a couple of those too,

2501
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:08.044
by the way.
All right,

2502
02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:12.190
well just cause I was running low and I would hate to have other things in my,

2503
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:16.180
what's that called when you have clothes I wardrobe.
Yeah.

2504
02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:22.970
Good thinking Jocko.
Anyway,
Jocko,
store.com check those out.
Some other new stuff,

2505
02:37:22.971 --> 02:37:27.260
stuff,
things,
items on there.
Let me talk about this mug.

2506
02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:29.150
I'm going to take too much time because we've been,

2507
02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:32.150
you know we've been going at it.
So this,
this travel mug right here.

2508
02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:36.350
So you know how you know at home,
you know you have your cup.

2509
02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:39.960
You see what I'm saying?
You know what I'm talking about?

2510
02:37:39.961 --> 02:37:44.170
It's the one I have actually my wife wants,

2511
02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:48.560
she searched forever to get me a cup that I like and she found it and then she

2512
02:37:48.561 --> 02:37:51.480
went to target and bought,
you know a does nothing.

2513
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:55.310
There's big giant plastic,
but feel like glass,
whatever that is.

2514
02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:58.420
Acrylic or something can't break but you can,
but they,

2515
02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.620
they feel good in your hands.
So I have a bunch of those,

2516
02:38:00.621 --> 02:38:04.910
but apparently it's getting replaced.
Yes.
So strangely I had the same thing.
Well,

2517
02:38:04.911 --> 02:38:08.480
I was on the same search,
so I had this one.
What I arrived at,

2518
02:38:08.481 --> 02:38:12.590
my favorite cup was pink because they didn't have any other colors.
It was pink,

2519
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:17.390
but it was big.
It was like maybe like 24 ounce,
like big cup.

2520
02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:20.390
That's what it used for.
Everything it pink,
whatever.
That meant.

2521
02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:22.400
Nothing compared to do their manhood.

2522
02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:26.260
Yemen competitive compared to the functionality of the pink was nothing.
Um,

2523
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:28.970
but here's the thing,
he could barely fit in my cup holder.

2524
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:31.520
You know the kind of like you put it in,
but it was like kind of stuck.

2525
02:38:31.521 --> 02:38:34.670
You'd have to fine.
But that was the cop.
That was the best one.

2526
02:38:34.671 --> 02:38:37.680
You use any other copy?
You just,
I dunno,
how are you doing now?

2527
02:38:38.930 --> 02:38:41.210
I'm going to get to that.
So,
but you know what I mean though,

2528
02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:44.300
so you know exactly what I mean.
Where you know,
you have your cup.
I don't,

2529
02:38:44.301 --> 02:38:47.360
where's my,
it could be dirty.
There can be cups every week.
All available.

2530
02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:49.410
You're like,
no,
I'm going to go and wash this,
you know,

2531
02:38:49.490 --> 02:38:52.700
and I'm going to use a cup.
That's it.
This one?
Okay,
we'll talk about this,

2532
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.270
this mug.
It's a technically what it travel tumbler,
right.

2533
02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:59.300
Been hurting or whatever,
you know,
come to the top,
all that stuff.

2534
02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:03.730
But you take all the top boom,
that's a cup to ergonomically uh,

2535
02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:06.700
conducive to just using it as a Co.
You know Holly,

2536
02:39:06.701 --> 02:39:11.140
if you have like threads in there to screw on a top thread this thick.

2537
02:39:11.390 --> 02:39:13.100
Yeah,
it's like a thing anyway.

2538
02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:17.910
And that's not to mention the look black on black with a call it murdered out.

2539
02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:21.440
Ever heard that expression murdered out?
No trick.
Google,
if you have time,

2540
02:39:21.441 --> 02:39:25.820
Google murdered out Cadillac was tar what it is,
it's a flat matte.

2541
02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:30.490
Okay.
Painting with black wheels.
So it's like basically all black tinted.

2542
02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:33.850
Linda's all black.
So that's this thing is murdered out technically.
Um,

2543
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:38.750
flat black matte with like the logo,

2544
02:39:38.751 --> 02:39:42.950
the four 34 and the discipline equals treatments like shiny black on black.

2545
02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:48.020
Very nice.
Very nice.
So,
and that's just the design.
So function wise,

2546
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.980
perfect.
30 Ounces,
not 24 30,
straight up

2547
02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:58.400
and it,
what is it?
BPA free.
All of it.
So you don't get poisoned over time.

2548
02:39:58.610 --> 02:40:02.840
Come on Bro.
That's a big thing.
And also,
okay,
and here's the impressive part.

2549
02:40:02.841 --> 02:40:05.570
When I ultimately was like Dang,
like impressed.

2550
02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:08.360
I guess it's like a technology that's kind of been around but I didn't know

2551
02:40:08.361 --> 02:40:12.590
cause I had that Plastic Cup,
you know,
whatever this it'll keep,

2552
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:17.160
it'll separate the temperatures from inside and outside so the inside

2553
02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:18.780
temperature won't leak to the outside.

2554
02:40:18.781 --> 02:40:21.420
Meaning it keeps like if you have ice and cold stuff in here,

2555
02:40:21.421 --> 02:40:25.680
bro means it's insulated.
It'll,
yeah,
but it's insulated in a special,

2556
02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:27.880
crazy way.
If you,

2557
02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:32.190
and this is with no top on by the way you fill it up with ixe your ice water,

2558
02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:32.670
you know,

2559
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:35.830
this is what I did one time I finished like it was maybe three quarters of,

2560
02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:38.670
it's still some water in there and I just,
I kind of left it,

2561
02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.760
went to bed the next day I looked at it and the ice was still in there and yeah,

2562
02:40:47.491 --> 02:40:48.990
sure.
That doesn't mean that much.

2563
02:40:48.991 --> 02:40:53.190
But as far as proving how it keeps the temperature,
wow,
that's a lot straight up.

2564
02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:56.780
Also.
It doesn't like sweat.
You know how when you have a cold drink,

2565
02:40:56.781 --> 02:41:00.180
come on on a on it yet.
If it's on your desk isn't working.
Yeah,

2566
02:41:00.310 --> 02:41:03.750
screw some stuff up.
Hot Day,
whatever.
Humid.
It's like,
yeah,

2567
02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:05.820
it doesn't even do that.
It doesn't do that at all.

2568
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:11.630
One time I was outside the pool,
whatever,
cruising I swabbed her.

2569
02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:15.030
Actually it was Jocko white tea.
Boom.
Oh well we'll get to that too,

2570
02:41:15.031 --> 02:41:20.031
but so you know I leave it there and it's in the sun and I grab it and I'm like,

2571
02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.850
ah,
this is going to be totally melted because I'm feeling it.

2572
02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:28.920
The the cup physically feeling the outside of the cup and it's straight up hot.

2573
02:41:29.010 --> 02:41:32.700
The Sun is beaming on it's hot.
If I look inside ice,

2574
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.900
still the full on ice,
not even melted at all.
Well,

2575
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:38.810
I'm telling you when they replaced her cup,

2576
02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:42.450
I'm telling you right now when you replace this cup,

2577
02:41:42.451 --> 02:41:47.451
you're going to find all these benefits to it above and beyond just the dope and

2578
02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:52.560
size and it fits in your cup holder straight up.
See how it's like the shape.

2579
02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:57.480
Cool.
All right,
next.
Next thing.
I feel like we could talk about this.

2580
02:41:57.481 --> 02:42:01.710
We're a little bit more,
I'm just like it.
I'm glad you liked it.
I like it too.

2581
02:42:02.470 --> 02:42:06.090
I'm utilizing it.
Actually.
I'm impressed my teeth.

2582
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.160
I see us still icy rubbing,
getting down with this Cup mug for a long time.

2583
02:42:11.161 --> 02:42:14.430
Then thoroughly impressed.
Anyway,
so yeah,
we got some,

2584
02:42:14.490 --> 02:42:18.450
we got that on the jungle store,
Jacqueline,
store.com we've got it on there all.

2585
02:42:18.451 --> 02:42:23.370
So should we talk about the warrior kid shirts?

2586
02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:27.870
You can talk about that all right there on there to where your kids shirts,

2587
02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:32.670
youth sizes for your kids.
Boom.
There it is.

2588
02:42:32.671 --> 02:42:35.640
Very,
very cool for your kids out there.

2589
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:39.180
There's some layers and now and two that I just found out by the way.

2590
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:45.030
Your contribution,
the colors and whatnot.
Yeah.
Yes.
Don't worry about that book.

2591
02:42:45.060 --> 02:42:45.840
Check it out again.

2592
02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:48.420
[inaudible] dot com there's some rash guards on their new rash guards out.

2593
02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:54.840
Maybe they're out.
Hoodies.
What kind of getting into like a spring.

2594
02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:58.770
I mean maybe some are pretty soon,
so hoodies might not be as applicable.

2595
02:42:58.800 --> 02:42:59.920
Either way.
They're on there.

2596
02:42:59.921 --> 02:43:03.210
We need to start prepping the winter hoodies that I'm going to be more in charge

2597
02:43:03.211 --> 02:43:06.600
of this time to that they're heavier and more powerful.
Yeah.

2598
02:43:06.601 --> 02:43:10.070
Cause you're thinking New England winter.
I'm fan collide.

2599
02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:13.690
Chicago and Minnesota and Iowa.

2600
02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:17.800
I'm not thinking of Hawaii over here.
If wasn't quite what?
He wears a shirt,

2601
02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.750
sweatshirt.
That was my whole point.
You're like hoodies probably.
What is that?

2602
02:43:22.810 --> 02:43:25.870
Yeah.
You know what it was actually my wife knows what do these are,

2603
02:43:25.871 --> 02:43:27.610
so I just consulted with her nonetheless.

2604
02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:31.180
[inaudible] dot com that's some cool stuff on their travel mugs.
Shirts,

2605
02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.720
cool shirts support that way and you know you get a little,
I eat them.

2606
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:37.510
Represent in the wild.
Boom.

2607
02:43:38.650 --> 02:43:42.940
Also support yourself with this one.
Psychological warfare.

2608
02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:46.030
If you didn't know what that is,
which I know you already do,
but if you don't,

2609
02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:49.990
it's an album with tracks.
No music jock on there.

2610
02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:53.280
And these tracks are useful.
These are utility.
What do you call them?

2611
02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:58.290
Functional tactical tracks to help you stay on the path.

2612
02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:00.730
You know,
we talked about getting distracted.

2613
02:44:00.731 --> 02:44:04.840
Some people they'll get distracted by comfort,
you know,
like the path.

2614
02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:10.240
The Path isn't code is riddled with discomfort riddled and sometimes after

2615
02:44:10.241 --> 02:44:13.360
awhile that that discomfort can get to certain people at certain times.

2616
02:44:13.361 --> 02:44:18.361
So what this psychological warfare album does is it keeps you on the path.

2617
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:24.250
So for example,
you want to wake up every day early,

2618
02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:30.050
they that one day you're distracted by the comfort of hitting the snooze button,

2619
02:44:30.641 --> 02:44:35.110
getting 10 more,
20 more minutes of sleep.
That's bad.

2620
02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:37.660
That's a distraction.
That's a deviation from the path.

2621
02:44:38.170 --> 02:44:42.790
Listen to psychological warfare.
Uh,
what's the number?
Number one,

2622
02:44:42.791 --> 02:44:45.460
I think do it up and get after it.
Get up and get a listen to that.

2623
02:44:45.461 --> 02:44:49.150
Put it as your alarm.
I dare you to hit snooze.
Dare you.

2624
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:53.860
Jock will just tell you practically in a practical,

2625
02:44:53.861 --> 02:44:58.360
pragmatic way why you should not hit the snooze.
Boom.
Um,

2626
02:44:58.390 --> 02:45:03.010
I would say with 100% certainty that you will not hit the snooze and you will

2627
02:45:03.011 --> 02:45:06.610
stay on the path.
And that goes for all these other things.
Deviating from diet,

2628
02:45:06.850 --> 02:45:09.580
deviating from pushing yourself in a workout,

2629
02:45:09.581 --> 02:45:13.720
deviating from going to the gym in the first place.
Going exactly right.

2630
02:45:13.721 --> 02:45:17.650
Or if you have like this procrastination situation,
man,
that's,

2631
02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.820
that's the main one that you don't like.
How you're always like,
hey,

2632
02:45:21.821 --> 02:45:25.480
I should I need to do this.
I should do this.
Just stop doing it.
Yeah,

2633
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:28.870
procrastination is pretty much the thing that's going to keep you from doing it.

2634
02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:31.180
And then the last thing,
if you procrastinate this,

2635
02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:34.930
they got a little solution for you too.
Anyway,
psychological warfare,

2636
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:39.640
Jocko Willink,
look for it on iTunes or Amazon music by the way.

2637
02:45:40.390 --> 02:45:44.380
It's a good one.
That's pretty cool.
Also,
while you're on Amazon,

2638
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:46.600
you can get this book that we just covered today.

2639
02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:48.610
Conversations with major dick winters,

2640
02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:54.490
Jocko white tea is also available on Amazon.

2641
02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.440
If you don't want to drink sodas,

2642
02:46:00.910 --> 02:46:05.460
which no one should be drinking sodas at all,
you don't need them.

2643
02:46:05.650 --> 02:46:07.570
They're there actually horrible for you.

2644
02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:10.190
But remember when we were eating Sushi in New York and a busted

2645
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:15.110
<v 0>out the coke I was,
I was going to actually just,
I was surprised.</v>

2646
02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:18.650
I thought that you weren't going to be my friend anymore,
but like real,

2647
02:46:18.651 --> 02:46:22.700
I couldn't believe it.
So anyways,
echo has this tradition,

2648
02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:25.280
which to me sounds like a sugar coated.

2649
02:46:25.281 --> 02:46:30.281
The lie then when he eats Sushi has bought glass bottle of coke so that um,

2650
02:46:30.890 --> 02:46:34.640
I overcame my hatred for him the best I could.

2651
02:46:34.641 --> 02:46:36.830
It's Kinda like when I was talking today about like,
Hey,
if you're a vet,

2652
02:46:36.831 --> 02:46:41.690
you can't look at everyone.
Like,
Hey,
this person I had to be,
I had to be like,

2653
02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:45.530
okay that goes not a bad person.
It's just mentally weak right now.

2654
02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:49.400
We'll just deal with it.
Don't drink that drink Jocko white tea,

2655
02:46:49.401 --> 02:46:53.570
which actually tastes better than coke.
There's no doubt.

2656
02:46:53.571 --> 02:46:56.450
But it tastes better than coke.
That's subjective.
But sure.

2657
02:46:56.810 --> 02:46:57.860
Are you serious right now?

2658
02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:02.360
I'm saying better as a subject then everyone agrees with in the world.

2659
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:07.010
Put It side by side.
Taste test.
There you go.
We'll go.
Boom.

2660
02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:11.270
Guarantee everybody cares.
Gimme that gimme that gimme the Jocko white tea,

2661
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:14.630
they don't want that.
It's syrup.
Sugar.

2662
02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:19.070
I think you might be 147% correct.
Absolutely.

2663
02:47:19.071 --> 02:47:21.770
We'll do a taste test only you can taste the coke cause I'm not,

2664
02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:24.800
I'm not touching my lips to that stuff.
Nasty.

2665
02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.100
One time they had a wheat,
we have a PT situation,
we call it a monster mash.

2666
02:47:31.170 --> 02:47:31.480
Sure.

2667
02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:34.650
And it's you just do a bunch of crazy events or pull ups and rope climbs and

2668
02:47:34.651 --> 02:47:38.050
carry boats around and swim.
And we were doing it when I was,
uh,

2669
02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:42.890
the officer in charge of trade debt.
And so yeah.
Oh,
I see a trade it.

2670
02:47:42.891 --> 02:47:47.891
So I brought my son with me and they had did this monster mash and one of the

2671
02:47:47.931 --> 02:47:51.110
things you had to do in the monster mash and this thing is being timed in

2672
02:47:51.111 --> 02:47:55.160
surveys and all that stuff.
You had to drink a full coca cola through a straw.

2673
02:47:56.250 --> 02:47:59.690
My son's doing the monster mash and he's probably seven or something like that.

2674
02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:04.350
And he'd never even had a coke before we burned his mouth probably.
Yeah.
And he,

2675
02:48:04.351 --> 02:48:08.120
he just hated it.
It was so nasty to him.
Yeah,

2676
02:48:08.121 --> 02:48:12.440
that's how I looked at you the other day.
I was like,
dude,
you're making me sick.

2677
02:48:12.441 --> 02:48:17.060
So Jocko white tea,
you know,
go on there,
read the reviews as well.
You know,

2678
02:48:17.061 --> 02:48:18.650
you'll see things like this excellent to you.

2679
02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:21.200
When I need to crush and power through the work,

2680
02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:25.340
I brought me some Jocko white tea.
If I need a little extra kick to crush it,

2681
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.943
that's what I do.

2682
02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:33.160
I'd be going working fewer hours at the office as my productivity has risen 900%

2683
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:37.880
that's pretty legit numbers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2684
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:42.050
And obviously that's 100% accurate because it came from an Amazon review.

2685
02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:46.970
So and,
and actually there's a warning as well.

2686
02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:49.310
Caution regarding this product.

2687
02:48:49.350 --> 02:48:53.480
Leaving your supply of Jocko white tea out in the open will require Overwatch.

2688
02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.460
I now have non tea drinkers hitting my reserves almost as badly as dedicated tea

2689
02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:03.230
drinkers.
No double blind study required.
Right.
That's,

2690
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:06.230
this is the thing.
It doesn't taste like tea,
right?

2691
02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:10.950
It doesn't like tea in my opinion.
It tastes like it tastes like victory,

2692
02:49:11.850 --> 02:49:15.480
but it doesn't taste like to you.
So that's that Jocko white tea,

2693
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:17.970
you can get it on amazon.com way the warrior kid,

2694
02:49:18.810 --> 02:49:22.470
the book is out as you know.
Thank you for getting it.

2695
02:49:23.210 --> 02:49:25.170
Kids have been crushing it.
It's awesome.

2696
02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:30.200
That's one of my favorite things that has happened to me in the past several

2697
02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.480
years is people started posting pictures of their kids reading way.

2698
02:49:35.851 --> 02:49:37.110
The warrior kid.
Yeah.

2699
02:49:37.350 --> 02:49:42.350
And that was awesome for me to see and I'll tell you why it was awesome.

2700
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:45.180
Cause I know,

2701
02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:50.810
I know those kids are reading that book and they're thinking that they're going

2702
02:49:50.861 --> 02:49:53.520
to get a little bit better and a little bit stronger and a little bit faster and

2703
02:49:53.521 --> 02:49:55.200
a little bit smarter and they're going to,

2704
02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:57.780
and people are sending me pictures of kids doing pushups and kids doing,

2705
02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:02.430
a guy sent me
a video of his kid.

2706
02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.580
You know how you have little uh,
night vision in your kid's room too?

2707
02:50:06.581 --> 02:50:08.700
You can monitor them.
Oh like on the little monitor,

2708
02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:12.210
a little monitor thing who sent me a picture,
a video of the Monitor,

2709
02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:16.770
the kids in the room after nighttime,
after bedtime with the kids doing it.

2710
02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:21.630
Plus you up.
He's doing pushups.
Why?
He wants to get stronger,
wants to get better.

2711
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:26.700
So yeah,
you get that.
If you've got kids,
get it from.
If you're an adult,

2712
02:50:26.701 --> 02:50:30.390
that's cool.
Get it.
Anyways.
I'll,
adults have a lot to learn from uncle Jake,

2713
02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:33.780
myself included,
so run out,

2714
02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:38.220
go to your local bookstore
and grab copies.

2715
02:50:38.221 --> 02:50:39.930
If they don't have it in your local bookstore,

2716
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:45.510
tell them to get it so that other kids can see it and get it.

2717
02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:48.420
Let's make people better.
Also,

2718
02:50:48.421 --> 02:50:52.110
you can preorder discipline equals freedom field manual.
Again,

2719
02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:56.340
you can find it in the get after it section of any bookstore or online

2720
02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:59.010
bookseller.
It is the only book in that section.

2721
02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:01.590
If your bookstore doesn't have that section,

2722
02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.860
which it probably won't tell them to get after it and make one and then put

2723
02:51:07.861 --> 02:51:10.530
discipline equals freedom there and get a copy of it for yourself.

2724
02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:16.320
Extreme ownership.
Yes.
The fundamental principles of combat leadership,

2725
02:51:16.770 --> 02:51:20.820
they will help you win in any capacity on the battlefield.

2726
02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:22.980
On the beat in business in life.

2727
02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:24.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2728
02:51:24.890 --> 02:51:27.740
<v 0>Extreme ownership written by myself and my brother Leif Babin.</v>

2729
02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.640
You can get that book as well if you need more than the podcast and the book,

2730
02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:37.930
that's fine.
It's okay.

2732
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:46.340
Now the monster,
the monster,

2733
02:51:46.370 --> 02:51:49.790
we just got done with musters zero zero two in New York City.

2734
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:54.840
What's your assessment?
Echo Charles.
My assessment was that it,

2735
02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:56.630
it was an upgrade.
It is.

2736
02:51:56.660 --> 02:52:00.620
It was an upgrade from the first one in that scene a lot because at first one

2737
02:52:00.621 --> 02:52:03.560
was good.
I was like,
Dang,
that was really impactful to the kind of where,

2738
02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:06.100
and I don't really say,
well this event was

2739
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:09.700
<v 2>impactful.
I don't use that word.
Not because I'm above it or nothing like that,</v>

2740
02:52:09.701 --> 02:52:14.110
but I'm just saying to say it,
it gotta be frugal.
So that first one was Dallas,

2741
02:52:14.111 --> 02:52:16.060
like Dang this,
this is really good

2742
02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:22.720
from top to bottom.
Like even k,
the material booms,
like all usable material,

2743
02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:25.630
all of it.
And then like always saying,

2744
02:52:25.631 --> 02:52:29.050
I think people overlook this part a lot of time,
like just the social element.

2745
02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:32.710
It's so easy to make friends with everyone because they all kind of have the

2746
02:52:32.711 --> 02:52:35.200
same kind of interesting goals in one way or another.

2747
02:52:35.201 --> 02:52:38.470
There's going to be some overlap there.
And then she just took part was fun too.

2748
02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:42.700
You know,
it's like it's just this great event,
you know?
And then the second one,

2749
02:52:42.730 --> 02:52:44.440
and I wasn't,
I'm be honest with you,

2750
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:46.990
I wasn't as fired up cause it was in New York.

2751
02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:51.340
It's like outside of the comfort zone,
the first one here,
San Diego,
I was like,

2752
02:52:51.380 --> 02:52:55.900
oh sweet this like it was even better.
That's that this past one was better.

2753
02:52:56.260 --> 02:53:00.880
It was getting great feedback.
Awesome.
And like you said,
I think the important,

2754
02:53:00.881 --> 02:53:04.150
well one of the most important things that you just said is it's very pragmatic.

2755
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:07.060
It's not like,
it's not like,
hey,

2756
02:53:07.061 --> 02:53:09.820
you're going to learn some stuff but it's not going to be really applicable.
No,

2757
02:53:09.821 --> 02:53:11.200
no,
no.
It's going to be applicable.

2758
02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:15.640
And you walk out when you finish that section and we get done talking about it,

2759
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:19.180
boom.
You can,
you can implement that immediately.
Yeah.
It's interesting,

2760
02:53:19.181 --> 02:53:22.780
you guys have like a lot of military stories and examples,
you know,
and then,

2761
02:53:22.781 --> 02:53:24.190
but when you go to the Q and a,

2762
02:53:24.310 --> 02:53:27.250
like all the people with their questions and not one of them is military.

2763
02:53:27.370 --> 02:53:30.760
It's all work.
Maybe relationship may be here and there,

2764
02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:33.820
but it's like at work you don't like,
what do I do?
And exactly.

2765
02:53:33.821 --> 02:53:35.760
And every one of those situations we answered them.

2766
02:53:35.770 --> 02:53:39.520
I'd say we answered them with both business examples that we've experienced and

2767
02:53:39.521 --> 02:53:43.330
military examples.
But yeah,
you,
you absolutely.
We've seen,

2768
02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:45.760
this is the thing we've seen it happened before.

2769
02:53:45.761 --> 02:53:49.540
Whatever that little issue is that you've,
you're having seen it before.
You know,

2770
02:53:49.541 --> 02:53:53.170
I've seen it before.
I've seen something like it will be able to find an answer,

2771
02:53:53.230 --> 02:53:55.780
come to a conclusion and move forward with the techniques,

2772
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:57.640
the principles that we talk about extreme ownership.

2773
02:53:57.880 --> 02:54:00.460
But it's like this extreme ownership.

2774
02:54:00.490 --> 02:54:03.760
The book is an awesome way to get the fundamental principles,

2775
02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:07.120
but when you come to the event now,

2776
02:54:07.121 --> 02:54:10.870
you can really personalize it.
You know,
you can really make sense of it.

2777
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:14.470
It's just like learning Jujitsu.
Like it's cool.
Yeah.
Watch the youtube videos.

2778
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:16.930
Yeah.
Also go to class.
Also go to the seminar,

2779
02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:20.470
learn it from as many different angles as you can because the more angles you

2780
02:54:20.471 --> 02:54:22.240
learn it from the battle you,

2781
02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:26.500
the more proficient you'll be at applying them to your world.
Yeah.
And the,
yeah,

2782
02:54:26.501 --> 02:54:30.760
and that's not,
you know,
you talk about Jujitsu,
another cool part about it is,

2783
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:32.830
you know,
when we teach the Jujitsu in the last day,

2784
02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:37.990
like you can come and actually like well try to choke Jocko,

2785
02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:42.100
come and bring it.
You think that's going to cause,

2786
02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:46.450
think about it most times like if you go to like a,
you know,
oh yeah,

2787
02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:50.140
you can't go try to choke the guy at the end of it.
You know,
you can't say like,

2788
02:54:50.141 --> 02:54:50.771
um,
Hey,

2789
02:54:50.771 --> 02:54:53.260
I'm going to go see this concert and then afterwards I'm going to pick up a

2790
02:54:53.261 --> 02:54:57.730
guitar.
Him Play,
you know the Solos with Eric Clapton.

2791
02:54:57.990 --> 02:55:01.300
Yeah,
exactly.
Right.
That doesn't happen.
And that's through camp.
Yeah.

2792
02:55:01.301 --> 02:55:04.430
And this is like,
like actually choking up the person,

2793
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:06.980
<v 0>you know.
So that's like an added element,
you know.
I mean,</v>

2794
02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:10.130
I got to roll with that.
Plenty of the guys,
man.
It's just so cool to be like,

2795
02:55:10.131 --> 02:55:13.630
oh yeah,
you know,
we talk and we talk about this and then get it off afterwards,

2796
02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:16.910
you know?
And so anyways,
if you didn't make it to New York City,

2797
02:55:16.911 --> 02:55:21.110
which was Awesome Times Square,
we had a great time.
The next one,

2798
02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:24.740
we're having July 13th and 14th in Austin,
Texas,

2799
02:55:24.741 --> 02:55:27.350
the Omni Barton creek resort and spa.

2800
02:55:27.470 --> 02:55:32.210
Now this is one thing that it just is what it is.
In New York,

2801
02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:32.600
we,

2802
02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:37.430
we were planning to do like 350 people and then we sold that out.

2803
02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:41.300
We opened it up for another 50 and we and we,

2804
02:55:41.420 --> 02:55:46.340
and we had to expand our room to get that and then that sold out.
And so then we,

2805
02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:50.090
we rearranged the,
or the,
the situation in there to get more people in there.

2806
02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.260
It looks like an Austin.
We're capped.

2807
02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:54.770
We can't get any bigger than the room that we've got.

2808
02:55:55.490 --> 02:56:00.490
And so it's three 50 so if you want to come sign up quick before it gets sold

2809
02:56:01.011 --> 02:56:03.860
out cause there's no way we can expand it into more people.

2810
02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.480
So just be aware of that.

2811
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:10.640
If you can't make that for 13th and 14th of July 13th and 14th in Austin,
Texas,

2812
02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:12.140
San Diego,
California,

2813
02:56:12.141 --> 02:56:16.310
September 14th and 15th we're back in San Diego for follow on operations.

2814
02:56:16.311 --> 02:56:20.330
So come and get it
while you're waiting for the monster.

2815
02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:26.080
If you need to pass communications to myself or Echo Charles,

2816
02:56:26.670 --> 02:56:30.060
we can be found on the interwebs.

2817
02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:35.660

supporting the podcast.
We really do appreciate it.

2822
02:56:53.910 --> 02:56:58.910
Thanks to military personnel out there that are protecting our freedoms overseas

2823
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:03.710
and also the law enforcement,
the firefighters,

2824
02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:08.060
EMT first responders that keep us safe here at home.

2825
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:09.620
Thanks to you all

2826
02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:13.633
<v 1>and</v>

2827
02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:15.993
<v 0>to everyone.</v>

2828
02:57:16.370 --> 02:57:16.780
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2829
02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:19.240
<v 0>whatever your mission might be.</v>

2830
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:24.400
Let's think about Dick Winters.
Personal quest,

2831
02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:28.480
very simple to excel in everything.
He did

2832
02:57:31.890 --> 02:57:34.230
excel in everything he did.

2833
02:57:34.650 --> 02:57:39.480
We should do the same excel in everything we do

2834
02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.820
from working to working out,

2835
02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:49.340
from the way we treat people.

2836
02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:51.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2837
02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:53.180
<v 0>To the way we treat ourselves.</v>

2838
02:57:55.890 --> 02:57:56.723
Excel

2839
02:57:59.170 --> 02:58:04.170
put forth your effort in everything you do from a small,

2840
02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:08.070
seemingly meaningless tasks to the big goals.

2841
02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:10.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2842
02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:14.670
<v 0>As you attack those goals,
or as those goals start to grind you down,</v>

2843
02:58:15.270 --> 02:58:19.620
remember the obsessive,
pure,

2844
02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:22.170
determined effort

2845
02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:26.790
that Dick winters taught us all.

2846
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2847
02:58:28.970 --> 02:58:32.730
<v 0>And go out there,
then get after it.</v>

2848
02:58:36.130 --> 02:58:37.810
So until next time,

2849
02:58:38.950 --> 02:58:43.270
this is echo and Jocko
out.
