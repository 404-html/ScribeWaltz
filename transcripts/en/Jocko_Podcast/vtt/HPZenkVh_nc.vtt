00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.370
This is Jocko podcast number one 43 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.830
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840
War is never what we think it is.

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
It is butchery,
stupidity and hate.

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.603
<v 1>Hm.</v>

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.290
<v 0>It is 90% boredom.</v>

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.260
It can be horrible beyond anything you've ever imagined.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It can also be ludicrous and absurd and technologically refined.

9
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.230
Tragically.

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.570
It's lessons are always forgotten only to be rethought on still another

11
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:47.404
battlefield.

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.340
The Vietnam War was our first real media war spanning the globe in outraged

13
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.500
unreality,

14
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.690
bringing videotaped death and destruction into countless homes,

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.950
fermenting protests,
and political justifications

16
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300
affecting the world's generation.

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.960
It shattered our dreams of abstract morality and in horrible reality re-educated

18
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:23.771
our youth to a third world of suffering they had never known and had now felt

19
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.070
deep within their own countries worldwide.

20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.940
<v 0>Vietnam was a symbol of the times.</v>

22
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.140
The best of hopes turned inside out of fear of no return.

23
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.340
But for me and many others,

24
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.250
the Vietnam War was much more,

25
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.190
it was in a moment our survival and death

26
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.300
in primitive sophistication,
our destruction

27
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.590
and rebirth.
It was in short,

28
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.860
a long imprisoned cry of what we all were not.

29
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.440
<v 0>This is a diary I kept while I was in Vietnam.</v>

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.430
Katie is for the most part unstructured,

32
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.450
as many of us were,
but all of it is true

33
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.443
history.

34
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
Someone once said is trying to tell the truth through the most acceptable lie.

35
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.530
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.210
<v 0>but this book is not about history.</v>

37
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.660
<v 1>Okay?</v>

38
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
<v 0>It only tells the truth as far as one person felt it,</v>

39
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.640
a frozen spark of time and bracing one American soldier in a Southeast Asian war

40
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.663
and

41
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.970
that right there is the of a book.
It's,

42
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.971
it's a diary and it's written by a guy by the name of Peter Nash Swisher,

43
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.380
a man that was born in Oxford,
England.

44
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.790
His Dad was actually in the Second World War and was killed coming home after

45
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:24.751
the war and his mom eventually moved to Canada and then remarried to an American

46
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.790
and Peter was adopted by that American father and grew up in Fort Atkinson,

47
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.780
Wisconsin and Louisville,
Kentucky.
That's where he grew up.

48
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.720
That's where he graduated high school and then he got his degree in American

49
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.721
history in 1966 from Amherst college and then he got his masters from Stanford

50
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:53.410
in 1967
and in 1968

51
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.800
he was drafted into the army.
He went to ocs November of that same year

52
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.800
and by 1969 he was doing his tour

53
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 1>in Vietnam
and yeah,</v>

54
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.220
<v 0>he definitely has a gift for writing and luckily he left a little bit of that</v>

55
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.420
gift to be shared with us in this book of his,

56
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.560
which is called a Vietnam diary.

57
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 1>And
let's go to the book.</v>

58
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.930
<v 0>He starts off with a little prologue.</v>

59
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.140
He's got some quotes in there and I pulled out one of the quotes from the

60
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:44.240
prologue.
It says,

61
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:49.241
the ultimate explanation of Vietnam must come from those involved there and

62
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:50.744
observer,

63
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.730
even when blood splatters his clothes remains outside.

64
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.990
The basic experience of Vietnam is to be bound to stay in that war for a year or

65
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.080
until wounded or killed.

66
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.650
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.040
<v 0>no reporter can impose this shackle on himself.</v>

68
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.490
He is like a doctor in an asylum.

69
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.120
He can report with compassion and empathy.

70
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.370
He can understand a great deal.

71
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.520
But the final truth remains with those who must exist in madness or in the

72
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:28.470
combat of their war.

73
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.380
<v 0>And that's actually a quote that he pulled from a guy named Arthur t Hadley,</v>

75
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:36.930
who was a war correspondent.
And that's very accurate.

76
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.650
There's a huge difference between someone that's reporting the war,

77
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:41.341
even though they're there.

78
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.000
And you've seen the war reporters that are right next to the infantry men.

79
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.950
They sometimes they're even carrying weapons,

80
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.750
but there's a key component that is that those guys can leave if they want to.

81
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.930
And those soldiers cannot,
they're there.

82
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:57.800
They're going to have to do their year and the way it works.

83
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.160
And that's a huge difference.
Psychological,
huge difference.

84
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.670
<v 0>And uh,
and a real difference of reality.
And so the,</v>

86
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.050
the diary starts off November 20th,
1967,

87
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:15.020
he's going through basic training in Fort Dix,
New Jersey.

88
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.000
Pulled a little,
couple little section out of that.

89
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.730
What's the spirit of the bay and net to kill?

90
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.330
What's the spirit of the band net to kill sergeant h and he refers everyone here

91
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:32.180
just by the,
the first letter of their last name.

92
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.040
Sergeant h was our third instructor,
another airborne veteran,

93
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.090
and one of the two survivors in his Vietnam company who came back alive once

94
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.280
when his weapon jammed in combat.

95
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.450
He had killed two Vietcong with his bayonet and his rifle bet,
but

96
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.570
sometimes we heard him screaming in his sleep.
You see this Poncho,

97
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.370
you see it,
smell it.

98
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.860
It's got the same musty odor of the jungle smell the fungus,
smell it.

99
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.010
I wrapped up a lot of bodies in these ponchos.
You goddamn stupid trainees.

100
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.470
You'll see you'll all be over there.

101
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.770
Yeah,

102
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.770
I mean this is 19 1967 so you're starting to get trained by guys that are coming

103
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:28.191
back from the war and they're going to have a little bit of a different attitude

104
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:32.390
than if they were a peacetime guys.
Although this is,
you know,

105
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.880
the Korean War was just shortly before this and the World War II.

106
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.000
So you have a lot of veterans in the war at this time.
When I came in,

107
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.820
when I was going through seal training,
there was not a lot of combat veterans.

108
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.250
There was,
there was some Vietnam guys for sure,

109
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.670
but you know I was going through in 1991 so most of the Vietnam guys we're

110
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.610
getting towards the end of their career mean the Vietnam War for,
for the teams,

111
00:07:56.611 --> 00:07:59.310
what is it,
72 maybe the last platoons tunes went over there.

112
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.260
So they were at the end of their 20 year mark.

113
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:05.010
You know some of the guys that stuck around for 30 years.
Yeah,
sure.
Roger,
Aiden.

114
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.280
Yeah,
for sure.
There's just some of those old master chiefs.
Absolutely.

115
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.770
But those weren't your primary instructors.

116
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.620
Your primary instructors were guys that had been in for five years and never

117
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:18.360
seen combat.
So that all change.
Now of course with the current wars going on

118
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.370
back to the book,
February 13th,
1969 orders,

119
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.150
it's not very pleasant to get orders overseas.

120
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.820
The initial shock honestly scares you a lot.

121
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.720
You think maybe I'll die,

122
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.940
but lead or the endless reams of paperwork show you dying is not that simple.

123
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.650
Take your plague.
Flu,
typhus and cholera shots.
For example,

124
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.490
one medical Sargent is Mack the knife,
especially if you're on orders.

125
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.430
Then there's rvn training and m 16 rifle qualification and press orientation and

126
00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:54.990
a multitude of sign out sheets.

127
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.970
Do you have any overdue books at the Post Library you think?
Yes,

128
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.440
I do have an overdue book.

129
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.610
Will they still send me to Vietnam if I keep it hidden under my laundry bag?

130
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.630
<v 0>June 1st,
1969 the last night before the plane leaves from Travis,</v>

132
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.660
you are together for the last time,
stoic and brave.

133
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.380
At least that's how it is in the movies.
In reality,

134
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.010
you are sick at heart in the mind and belly.

135
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.860
You talk of the past pretending,
but knowing what each suffers silently,

136
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.760
it isn't very pleasant or romantic at all.

137
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.880
<v 0>Why are we such stupid people?
She sobs tears on sweat,</v>

139
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:44.270
body close.
You love her fiercely.

140
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.230
Your country is another question entirely

141
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:53.991
as usual.

142
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:58.991
I am skipping through portions of this book to make it short enough to cover on

143
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.300
the podcast and actually I don't even know if this book is in publication

144
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:05.661
anymore.

145
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:10.220
I had a pdf file from back in the day and I don't even know where I got it from.

146
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.240
Yeah.
Um,
I googled it.
There's some pdf files floating around,

147
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.430
but get it and read whole thing.
June 3rd,

148
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.520
1969 h hour war should be dramatic like the movies,

149
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.110
sweating and landing in a craft,
hating the beach under fire.

150
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.860
Who'd believe I went to war in a pink,

151
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:35.510
orange Braniff international airplane with a stewardess and purple leotards

152
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:38.060
wishing us a good trip on behalf of the captain and the crew

153
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.250
going to war for Christ's sake in a pink orange airplane.

154
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.410
I used to think war was somewhat serious and this is again,
this is a Vata.

155
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:50.540
People don't realize this.
They use contract air.

156
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.600
They still do that sometimes and you'll fly over in a civilian plane.

157
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.503
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

158
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.820
<v 0>July 6th,
1969 airborne</v>

159
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.530
clouding dust betrays a lonely convoy.
Dirt smothered,

160
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:07.490
embraced in jungle vines and Baron Hill's,
Solon crags and silence.

161
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.900
A flash of light below two more exploding lines.

162
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.970
We see toy trucks crawling,
clawing,
spitting,
snake like steel.

163
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.850
<v 0>Too small for life sized war,
too far away for death.</v>

165
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.220
So he's the first visions of combat and he's looking down at it doesn't really,

166
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.100
it's he's admitting he's like too far away.
It's not real for him.

167
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.270
<v 1>That changes.</v>

168
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.490
<v 0>July 17th,
1969 my first body,</v>

169
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.610
I saw my first body line west of plight,

170
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.330
who stretched out on a Poncho waiting to be airlifted back to the coast.

171
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.210
He was gray,
white,
and very dead.

172
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.030
Even today I can see his gaping bloody mouth gasping for air.

173
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.380
A young kid who couldn't have been more than 20 years old

174
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.010
and I thought,
Christ,
he's really,

175
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.093
really dead.

176
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.080
<v 0>I remembered some James Bond and John Wayne sequels and those TV melodramas</v>

178
00:12:21.081 --> 00:12:23.930
where the American love for violence is only make believe

179
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.660
where the movie and TV casualties can always get up and go home.

180
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:31.160
Probably in time for supper,

181
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.760
but this kid would not.

182
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.860
You would make Walter Cronkite's CBS News report as just another figure

183
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.790
changing 229 American battle deaths reported this week to 230 instead

184
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:57.060
and then everyone including the president were turned to watch the Monday night

185
00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:59.160
football game on channel five.

186
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.130
Then here was my first body.

187
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.650
I should have been trained for this sort of thing a long time ago playing cops

188
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:14.460
and robbers,
cowboys and Indians,
Bang,
Bang,
you're dead.

189
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.533
<v 0>And he was,</v>

191
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.490
<v 1>he really was</v>

192
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.280
<v 0>July 25th,
1969 remembrance to</v>

193
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.830
this is how I was when I saw you last.

194
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.980
I was stagnant,

195
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.900
going no place and searching desperately for something I had lost long ago in

196
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:44.734
the barracks.

197
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.590
And so we escaped to the Gray New England coast and the Boston fog and a warm

198
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:53.460
Downey bed to greet the night.

199
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.190
And I began to live again and laugh.

200
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.010
I love you.
Still forgiving me that month.

201
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.490
<v 0>And forgiving yourself without promise.</v>

203
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.860
<v 1>August 11th,
1969</v>

204
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.820
<v 0>news item,</v>

205
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.620
it was President Nixon's first visit to Vietnam as president.

206
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.490
He insisted on going to Saigon rather than camera on bay.

207
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.030
The huge supply base camera on Bay doesn't count.

208
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.780
He said that isn't Vietnam Time magazine.

209
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.150
August 8th,
1969

210
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.803
dear sir,

211
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.880
in light of a Viet Cong sapper attack on Cam Ron Hospital,

212
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.220
I questioned the source of those people who believe camera on Bay isn't Vietnam.

213
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.570
<v 0>I think the 98 men who were casualties and the parents of those who were killed</v>

215
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.890
would agree that Cameron Bay isn't exactly Disneyland.

216
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.490
<v 1>You bastard.</v>

217
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.970
<v 0>September 1st,
1969
Rodriguez.</v>

218
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.723
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.860
<v 0>Jim Rodriguez,
who was killed last week.</v>

220
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

221
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.870
<v 0>After only 12 days in country.</v>

222
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.030
I remember as an upperclassmen how we locked his heels together and taught him

223
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.790
the ocs version of military discipline.

224
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.230
It was double time,
four times around the field.
Booney runs attitude,

225
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:51.800
Jack's harassment and constant pressure physically and mentally.

226
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.140
Rodriguez never broke.
A matter of fact,

227
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.580
he met our challenge one better and went on to airborne trainee training briefly

228
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:03.620
serving later as an airborne instructor.

229
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.180
I wonder how much we really influenced Rodriguez.

230
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.050
We showed him how to play soldier.

231
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

232
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.440
<v 0>But no one ever taught him how to play war.</v>

233
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.290
It's hard to play games with dead men.

234
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

235
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Like I said,
this,
this,</v>

236
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.770
this style of writing,
this just straight forward style of writing.

237
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.990
It's,
it's different.
It's different.
Either something,

238
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.420
there's something very guttural about it.

239
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.950
There's something very visceral about it and it seems,

240
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.910
I mean,
it seems like he's writing this with,
when he wrote this,

241
00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:53.490
he had no intention whatsoever of ever sharing it with anyone.

242
00:16:53.491 --> 00:16:56.380
That's kind of what it seems,
especially,
you know,
he's talking about the,
the,
the,

243
00:16:56.381 --> 00:17:00.570
the woman that he loved back home and you can see his attitude.
It,

244
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.693
<v 1>it,</v>

245
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.120
<v 0>it goes kind of all over the place sometimes.
And so there's,
there's,</v>

246
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.630
there's a certain level of just reality in this that,
I don't know,

247
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.540
it's the really,
um,

248
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.630
it hits in a different way than many of the books.
Many of the books.

249
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.803
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

250
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.500
<v 0>September 10th,
1969 combat engineers,</v>

251
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.030
bronze backs bent to bridges,
culverts,

252
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:34.180
picks and timber trestles sweat in grime and death by hidden mines and snipers

253
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.970
construction repair.
And when will you fix my air conditioner?

254
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.290
Ask headquarters.

255
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.770
<v 0>Again,
you know,
I,
I know I've talked about the engineers that work with us or,</v>

257
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.970
and what the,
how,

258
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.350
how incredibly hard and dangerous that job was.

259
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:57.030
Those guys were heroes.

260
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:01.070
Like you couldn't even believe what these guys were doing and this is the,

261
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.990
just the same exact sentiment there.
You know,
they call,

262
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.720
I just said engineers and he's his combat engineers.
That's exactly right.

263
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.690
It's combat engineers.
100%

264
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.110
September 11th,
1969 artillery,
cannon crashes eastward,

265
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.960
magnificent,
terrible funder.

266
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.200
Bright flash night bordered,

267
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.130
a surging mass explodes and thunder pageants of fire again,

268
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.380
again in savage.
Aw,

269
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.820
we celebrate the festival of death.

270
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

271
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:44.170
<v 0>September 20th,
1969 a heavy load on the way back from queen non.</v>

272
00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:47.920
Yesterday we stopped our jeep to help an old man with a heavy load,

273
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.290
which had fallen by the side of the road.

274
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.020
The old man was carrying home the remains of his youngest son who had died

275
00:18:56.021 --> 00:18:58.780
during recent fighting along the Cambodian border.

276
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.240
The Saigon government,

277
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:06.241
he said had provided a free coffin and transportation back to his village,

278
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.060
but the truck had lost an axle five kilometers down the road.

279
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.000
This wasn't his first tragedy.

280
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.800
He told us that his eldest son had died two years older,

281
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.010
earlier in the assault on way,

282
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.020
but he never saw that son's body since he was a Viet Cong.

283
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.130
He was an old man.
He said heartbroken and ignorant.

284
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.063
<v 1>Okay?</v>

285
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.240
<v 0>He had lost two sons drafted to fight on different sides of the war.</v>

286
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

287
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.720
<v 0>And even now,
he didn't really know what they had died for sure.</v>

288
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.611
Yeah.

289
00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:52.730
We hear that about the civil war in America that you'd have brothers fighting

290
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:56.210
against brothers and I mean clearly this happened in Vietnam,

291
00:19:56.211 --> 00:20:00.110
but you don't think of a guy that's given up one son to each side and they're

292
00:20:00.111 --> 00:20:00.944
both dead.

293
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.460
September 24th,
1969 a night.

294
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.330
The heavens lie beyond us.
Void yet filled with substance,

295
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.730
light and form.
Infinity

296
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.760
from nothing all exists as billions age our world.

297
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:23.911
Not yet.

298
00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:28.830
A grain of sand in mighty are the universe endures

299
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:36.070
mortal
week and woman born.

300
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.750
Look beyond the sky,

301
00:20:37.751 --> 00:20:41.740
some clear and clove and night by lands and meet this sea.

302
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.660
Embraced the stars in infinite conceit.

303
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.780
Deny from nothing all you feel

304
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.900
and celebrate the over mind.
Original Prime,
oval force,

305
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.660
the birth of all that is.

306
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.433
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

307
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.870
<v 0>October 2nd,
1969 the convoy</v>

308
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:15.440
two hours before the Dawn,
our convoy groups quietly,
efficiently trailers,

309
00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:20.441
tanks and armored trucks with plated steel alert rows of limitless inhuman war

310
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.140
machines assembled in Detroit from America's great arsenal of doubt.

311
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:28.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

312
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.560
<v 0>Giant tinker toys of war.
The mission always comes before the welfare of the man.</v>

313
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.060
The all pervading mission that no one ever knows the men comes second rows of

314
00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:44.540
tired army ants and dusty olive drab,
no longer young,

315
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.890
grim and grimy.

316
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.780
Keep their faith and faded photographs of home of virgin hope of things to come

317
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.870
or some in beads.

318
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.860
An Albatross of peace medallions hanging from their tarnish neck,

319
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.380
a human cry and muted rage to say at War I am.

320
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.460
I am.

321
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.953
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

322
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.270
<v 0>the soon forgotten symbols of a never caring world,</v>

323
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.870
it's time to move a hundred muffled coughs and snarls of steel and iron trucks.

324
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.560
The schedule must be met.
We can't be late for war.

325
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.800
The dawn is rising as we rumble passed our first awaken village here,

326
00:22:27.801 --> 00:22:32.801
people move to fold and field a farmer even now to toil behind his beast and

327
00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:36.680
plow the sacred soil his father wants endured

328
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.290
his desecrated tome
of craters,

329
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.130
mines and shells across the ridge and down the dusty roads.

330
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.670
<v 1>Okay,</v>

331
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.540
<v 0>but it will pass.
It always has.</v>

332
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.170
The land endures all things.

333
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.590
Very true statement.
Very true statement.

334
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.440
Especially.
Hear me.
You can imagine.
It was so,
what did I say?
19 says this,

335
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.790
1969 yeah,
no,

336
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.600
1969 and he's looking at these farmers and this war is going on all around them

337
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.010
and guess what they're doing?

338
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.470
They're doing what they've been doing for thousands of years.

339
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.730
They're plowing those fields in.

340
00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:23.670
This war is going to come and it's going to go and they're still gonna be there

341
00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:27.690
doing what they do.
The soil it's going to endure.
The land is going to endure.

342
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.340
October 9th,
1969 the sporting life,

343
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.440
I met a Huey gunship pilot and Quinan who had just extended his tour of duty

344
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.180
down in the Mekong Delta.

345
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.050
<v 0>Most pilots did the job they had to do and then went,</v>

347
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.310
but not this one.
He actually enjoyed his work.

348
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.100
He bragged to a group of us one night that during a dull day where there was a

349
00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:55.280
little action in the delta,

350
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.990
he kept in practice by shooting at numerous water buffalo in rice patties and

351
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:01.790
sniping at frightened farmers.

352
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.580
In one case he said he'd played cat and mouse with an old Papasan on a bicycle

353
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.960
weaving frantically down the road.

354
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.670
I scared the hell out of him for awhile.
He said.

355
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.860
Then I got him good with a beautiful long burst,
no chance.
Hale,

356
00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:22.740
he was in a free fire zone,
probably VC.
Anyways,

357
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.080
all the slopes down their VC.

358
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:31.290
We looked at him incredulously and then left his table,

359
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.930
leaving him alone,
gloating to himself.

360
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.210
Even at war,
he remained a leper within some strange,

361
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.500
unwritten code.

362
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.430
October 10th,
1969 how will beach at night?

363
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:04.130
I wish you were here right now so I could hold you very close and tell you

364
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:07.880
things.
There are no words for

365
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.570
October 14th,
1969 home one,

366
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.540
we cling to something close at home,
a girl or shadow on the wall,

367
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.170
Friesen a ragged hopes,
so precious and return

368
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.310
if lost,
we too are lost.

369
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.720
Not Finding hate as soldiers seldom hate but bitter,

370
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:40.270
stale in passion.
Dead.

371
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.360
We lose our need to love

372
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:51.190
home too.
I love you as gentle dawn.

373
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.190
Spread out against the savage sky.
A part of life.

374
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.140
So very far away,

375
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.700
<v 1>right?</v>

376
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.370
<v 0>Yeah.
It's um,
again,</v>

377
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.540
important to point out as I always try to,
that

378
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.430
these men that went to war war,

379
00:26:14.431 --> 00:26:19.430
not just soldiers and not just marines and not just sailors,
not just airman,

380
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.950
but they were,
they were men with hopes and dreams.

381
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.000
They were men in love with that girl back home and they couldn't stop thinking

382
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:27.834
about her.

383
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.710
October 23rd,
1969

384
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.873
<v 1>may,</v>

385
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.880
<v 0>I was talking to may today a pretty Vietnamese who works in headquarters,</v>

386
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:49.881
detachment as a secretary may speaks English very well and often we joke and

387
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:54.060
talk about a lot of trivial things,
but today the conversation was more serious.

388
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

389
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.313
<v 0>What would happen?</v>

390
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.180
I asked her if the Viet Cong and north Vietnamese take over the south one day.

391
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.750
<v 0>May's face remained impassive.</v>

393
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

394
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.080
<v 0>I work for the Americans.
So they would shoot me,</v>

395
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.600
then they would kill my family.

396
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.540
And that is the reality.

397
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.380
And that's the reality that you don't,

398
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.340
when Isis came into Ramadi after we had left about seven years after we had left

399
00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:34.210
and after Ramadi had been peaceful for about seven years in an isis came in and

400
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:36.790
took it over.
So one of the first things that they did was they,

401
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.140
anyone that they knew had worked with coalition forces at all.

402
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.030
They got murdered and their families got murdered.
And from what I,

403
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.290
the information that I received from my contacts over there was about 500

404
00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:53.020
families were murdered.
All of them.

405
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.270
So yeah,
when,

406
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.310
if you're going to go into a country or you're going to work there and you're

407
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:03.420
going to support some of the people,

408
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:05.400
make sure you stay there until the job is done.

409
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.980
November 2nd,
1969 slopes and dinks.

410
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

411
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.920
<v 0>He was a young buck sergeant from Alabama,</v>

412
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.500
proud of his artillery days at Fort Sill,

413
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:24.501
Oklahoma and proud to defend America from worldwide communist aggression.

414
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

415
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.730
<v 0>The Vietnamese communist in his eyes were subhumans.</v>

416
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.680
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

418
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.680
slopes and dinks who fell no human emotion and therefore who could be eradicated

419
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:39.600
as swiftly as possible without regret.

420
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.980
He saw this enemy,

421
00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:47.981
he told me for the first time during the Tet offensive in 1969 when for days and

422
00:28:48.081 --> 00:28:48.950
nights on end,

423
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.540
his battery kept mowing down human wave enemy assaults by lowering the Howard

424
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:57.410
sirs to tree trunk level and firing bumblebee canisters,

425
00:28:57.411 --> 00:29:01.400
which sprayed thousands of anti-personnel darts into the enemy troops.

426
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

427
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.460
<v 0>but still they kept on coming.</v>

428
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.230
<v 0>One wave after another on the night after the last attack,</v>

430
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.770
he went out with a small patrol to survey the damage and found hundreds and

431
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.550
thousands of the enemy dead.

432
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.570
But he also found frightened young boys and young men who had died clutching one

433
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:31.740
another in terror or who had died trying to bandage each other's wounds.

434
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.480
And the young sergeant told me that he knew then that they must also have

435
00:29:38.481 --> 00:29:42.100
mothers,
sisters,
and wives at home,
like his men.

436
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:43.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.690
<v 0>And that they had been terrified during the battle,
just like his men.</v>

438
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

439
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.260
<v 0>And that they bled and felt pain and cried just like his men.</v>

440
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

441
00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.020
<v 0>And he never called them slopes are dinks ever again.</v>

442
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.040
November 21st,
1969 to Sydney,
Australia

443
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.840
after six months at war,
a 10 day miracle,

444
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.020
a beautiful heavenly city on the bay.
The frontier spirit with arise,

445
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.770
sense of Aussie humor,
drinking a schooner of swan lager with new friends,

446
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.180
invited everywhere.

447
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:38.380
A genuine Australian openness upfront and honest.

448
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.160
The Bay and the Opera House,
Bondi beach riding the waves,

449
00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:44.590
the restaurants and nightlife.
Incredibly beautiful,

450
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:47.920
Tall Australian girls disarming and very real,

451
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.660
not afraid to be themselves,
to disagree,
outgoing and direct,

452
00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:57.470
deep and beautiful like their city,
Sydney,
Australia,

453
00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.030
the reality of heaven.

454
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:03.260
Treating us as people again and true friends making us feel more at home than

455
00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:04.280
home itself.

456
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.290
Our last night was spent in a seafood restaurant.
Mrs. Murphy,

457
00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:13.130
the restaurant older told us if you'd come earlier,
boys,

458
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.970
we'd have had some find dates for you tonight.
Unfortunately,

459
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:21.971
no wine was sold after 9:00 PM with dinner and older couple approached our table

460
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.480
here.
Boys take our bottle.

461
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.890
Your father's really helped us during the last war and we know how you feel

462
00:31:27.891 --> 00:31:28.724
about this one.

463
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.730
<v 0>God bless you and take care of boys.
Take care.</v>

465
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.450
Sydney,
Australia,
a beautiful lasting friendship,

466
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:44.010
a love affair with life that back in Vietnam had all too soon.

467
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:49.011
The unfamiliar face that precious things take on when our heart is left behind.

468
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.143
Yeah,
I can't even,

469
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.800
I've been to Australia and it's awesome and I can't even imagine what it would

470
00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:08.540
be like going from the Vietnam War into Australia for 10 days of leave and to

471
00:32:08.541 --> 00:32:13.220
have the Australian people just be awesome.
So

472
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.110
to the Aussies out there,
thanks for the support.

473
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.300
December 19th,
1969 incoming adult fid,

474
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.360
muffled clothes growing fearful fid followed twice.

475
00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:36.140
Another crash.
Christ body,
feet,
flailing hands and sweat,
waiting,

476
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.200
waiting,
crash.
God,
oh Jesus.

477
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.690
Reseeding thud waiting.
Still waiting.
Not You.

478
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:49.250
Thank God.
Move your head.
Not you move your arm.

479
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.013
Not this time.

480
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.890
So there you go.
That's incoming.
That's,
that's,
that's waiting for,

481
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.880
that's when you hear,
when you hear it get launched and you know it's coming.

482
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:07.050
That's what it is.
When he say not you,
that's like he's checking.
Dang.

483
00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:10.920
Is that Yup.
Moving your head hit.
Nope,
not you.
Move your arm.
Not this time.

484
00:33:10.921 --> 00:33:14.300
We're good.
Yeah.

485
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

486
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.950
<v 0>January 22nd,</v>

487
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.460
1970 dispatch at 19 1145 hours,

488
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.550
10 kilometers northwest of Hoy.

489
00:33:26.551 --> 00:33:31.551
Non a 16 year old youth from a nearby hamlet entered fond queet hamlet and

Vietnamese children and 15 wounded in action,

494
00:33:45.931 --> 00:33:49.500
11 Vietnamese children and for United States Marine Corps.

495
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.820
The youth who threw the grenades escaped.

496
00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.320
That's just,

497
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:04.360
I mean just that snapshot of what you're dealing with.

498
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.860
There you are in a civic action platoon out there trying to help out at a 16

499
00:34:08.861 --> 00:34:11.500
year old kid comes in hawks,

500
00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:13.930
two grenades and wounds,

501
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.710
11 of the little kids you're trying to help and four of your men,

502
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.200
if that's what your life is.

503
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.810
February 4th,
1970

504
00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:35.460
small and pleading eyes are combat medic with all his tubes and bottles could

505
00:34:35.681 --> 00:34:40.120
never heal that gaping wound nor still you're fearful cry.

506
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.510
Jesus.
God,

507
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.780
what a petty careless war when armies clash and hate to disembowel a child.

508
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.450
February 15th,

509
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.630
1970 a green baret in Nha Trang,

510
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.710
one can never generalize about individual divisions,

511
00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:12.510
regiments or any particular unit.

512
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.260
It's hard enough generalizing about particular people,

513
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.210
but in not trying,

514
00:35:18.211 --> 00:35:22.860
I did meet a green baret who as one individual was at least honest about his

515
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:27.720
motivation.
I was sharing his battle of Jack Daniels and ice.

516
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.670
I joined the green brace for excitement.

517
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:33.930
I guess on one hand we're living with the yards,
raising crops,

518
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:38.110
growing pigs,
and hunting.
Charlie,
on the other hand,
you

519
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.700
kill and drink,
smoke and whore.
Every minute may be your last,

520
00:35:42.701 --> 00:35:47.500
you know what I mean?
Man,
if I were back in the states doing this sort of thing,

521
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.140
I'd either be dead or sitting on death row by now,

522
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.890
but over here we've got a free license.
You know what I mean?

523
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:55.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

524
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.160
<v 0>You said he was thinking of settling down after the war,</v>

525
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.210
getting into a business trainee program when he got back to the states or maybe

526
00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:03.980
into some branch of law enforcement.

527
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.410
<v 0>Yeah.
War is suited to some people for sure.</v>

529
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.280
<v 0>March 1st,
1970 interlude.
I saw a movie tonight that made me think of you.</v>

531
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.410
It's bad thinking.
You know,

532
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.220
yesterday I thought of Lee who was killed last month in one core.

533
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.620
The movie was one of the few we saw together last year.

534
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:39.460
How different seeing it again alone,
sitting in the sand,
out war.

535
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.230
<v 0>It made me think of our own interlude,</v>

537
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.080
why we could never accept less than we had

538
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.000
and would never have again.

539
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.430
I don't know if you want to think about that sentence too much.

540
00:37:00.431 --> 00:37:01.690
It's a little bit heavy.

541
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.900
Why we could never accept less than we had and would never have again.

542
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.720
March 4th remembrance three

543
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.340
when you smiled at me,
I knew you were different.

544
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.540
You had no snide remark from my uniform or unhindered a look of mock pity,

545
00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:29.120
which seem to say,
look everybody,
it's one of them again.

546
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.570
And you didn't approach me with a fashionable overriding concern or preached me

547
00:37:35.571 --> 00:37:39.770
from a preassembled dreadnought of morality.
No,

548
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.930
and you didn't stare away from me or at me or through me.
All you said was hello.

549
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:46.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.050
<v 0>What?
Through that one simple ward.
I was no longer alone.</v>

551
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.440
Observation Flower pedal pushing through the crusted earth,

552
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.510
embraces light and dies.

553
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.220
The ugly root endures,

554
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.680
but never booms.

555
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.910
March 14th,

556
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:25.380
1970 the provost marshal jeep stealing in Vietnam was a national pastime.

557
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:29.760
The Vietnamese nationals had acquired chain Carter's and became very adept at

558
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:34.700
western auto mechanics with special emphasis in jumpstarting the engines and

559
00:38:34.701 --> 00:38:38.200
removing cereal or identification markings with lightening speed.

560
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:43.190
<v 0>Even the shore bound navy installations took great delight in their midnight</v>

562
00:38:43.191 --> 00:38:47.900
requisitions of army material and the green berets from Nha Trang had on one

563
00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:52.901
occasion brought in of Ch 47 sling helicopter and airlifted away a brand new

564
00:38:53.001 --> 00:38:56.810
vehicle that was apparently impossible to obtain through ordinary supply

565
00:38:56.811 --> 00:38:57.644
channels.

566
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:58.623
<v 1>Well,</v>

567
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.690
<v 0>yes,
the new provost marshal at camera on Bay decided to do something about these</v>

568
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:08.230
thefts and implemented a stern directive from the military police to all

569
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:10.420
personnel who had their vehicles stolen.

570
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.690
They would now have to write an extensive report in triplicate to the provost

571
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:17.290
marshal explaining the surrounding circumstances and further appear before a

572
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:22.090
board of inquiry remaining liable to possible article 15 or cart martial

573
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.630
proceedings for negligently allowing these thefts to occur.

574
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

575
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.110
<v 0>These orders were to have take fast to take effect by the Provost Marshal's</v>

576
00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:35.490
directive on March 11th that would really take care of the problem.

577
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:40.500
The provost marshal promised the general by the sternest measures and prompt

578
00:39:40.501 --> 00:39:44.040
prosecution of any negligent offenders.

579
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:50.710
On the morning of March 13th the Provost Marshal was seen walking to work.

580
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.040
Someone had stolen his jeep.

581
00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.440
Yeah,
I like that.
Good little story.

582
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:04.670
There's that stuff definitely happens.
My CBS,

583
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.350
we're quite good at that.

584
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.060
So in task unit bruiser we had CBS that,

585
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.380
that the construction battalion,
their navy guys that do construction,

586
00:40:15.381 --> 00:40:19.550
but they also have combat skills.
So their,
their motto is we build,

587
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.600
we fight and they should have another model that's like,

588
00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:25.040
we get things if you need them.

589
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.780
So my guys were awesome at that and they were also awesome at everything else

590
00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:30.081
they did.

591
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:34.700
But it was nice that when I needed something they would find a way to acquire
it.

592
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.500
Mm hmm.
Thanks there too.
You bruiser CBS.
All right.

593
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.260
March 15th,
1970 graffiti and he's just got a list of graffiti here.

594
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.600
Um,
lifer,
986 days in a wake up.

595
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.810
Next buffer.
I came in the army.
This is all Ms. Bell.

596
00:40:56.811 --> 00:41:00.890
Before I came in the army,
I couldn't spell engineer now or one.

597
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.583
<v 1>Okay,</v>

598
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.840
<v 0>here's a good one.
The U S Army,
184 years of tradition.</v>

599
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:13.400
Unhampered by progress.
The army's like a rubber.

600
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.450
It gives you that false sense of security while you're getting screwed.

601
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.050
It's not a real war yet.

602
00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.740
We're just 550,000 military advisers

603
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.250
fighting for pieces like screwing for chastity.

604
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.540
Share in the fright with freedom.
Go home with a friend.

605
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.860
<v 0>Next.
Gimme your hearts and minds and I'll burn your fucking hot.</v>

607
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.160
Next war is hell,
but a year without a woman is a real bitch.

608
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:48.410
<v 1>Okay,</v>

609
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.800
<v 0>next.
How can we can get to the moon,
but I can't get a home.</v>

610
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:58.430
Next,
those personnel with short stacks and low Mona manifold pressure,

611
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.770
please taxi closer to the urinal

612
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.150
next to a Syrian lives.

613
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:10.151
That's a little shout out to catch 22 the book next with the last American

614
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:14.600
soldier leaving Vietnam.
Please turn out the light at the end of the tunnel.

615
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.090
Think that's in reference to the fact that the higher ups kept saying that they

616
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:21.940
could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I ain't,
you know,
we're coming.

617
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.200
We're getting there.
Yeah.
You start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

618
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.343
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

619
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.960
<v 0>March 19th,
1970 love l UV.</v>

620
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.210
We once had a little puppy called love.
She was the company Mascot and Doug,

621
00:42:36.211 --> 00:42:37.080
just about everyone.

622
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.940
She was one of those beautiful little creatures who hadn't ever learned to hate

623
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.990
or fear.
She trusted everyone love,

624
00:42:45.991 --> 00:42:49.680
trusted the sergeant to even though the sergeant wanted her wasted as a damn

625
00:42:49.681 --> 00:42:53.040
nuisance.
So loved never came home with us,

626
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.560
but neither did the sergeant.

627
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:01.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

628
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.640
<v 0>Better halves,
truck convoys and Mecca.</v>

629
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.420
Mechanized patrols often wed many men to their vehicles during most of their

630
00:43:08.421 --> 00:43:09.500
Vietnam tour.

631
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.240
The names of such better halves included.
Here's,

632
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:17.570
so this is just the names of a bunch of different vehicles battling Bob

633
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.140
psychedelic flower,
old faithful,
roadrunner acid,

634
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:25.610
rock hell for certain puzzle palace.
Push your man,
grim reaper,

635
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:30.140
iron butterfly,
grasp,
bender,
artful dodger moratorium.

636
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:34.780
And Malfunction junction
and uh,

637
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.650
my first deployment to Iraq are,
are you,
you might appreciate the Sdi,

638
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:41.750
I think I've said this before,
but our vehicles,

639
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:43.580
my first deployment we're named after,

640
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.430
after the movie King Pin,

641
00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.870
so bigger and bigger and was one of them for sure.
Yeah.
That was all.

642
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.220
And then Lafe I think it was primarily layoffs idea.

643
00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.680
He knew he wanted to name and did name.

644
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:03.470
They named all the vehicles after Gi Joe Characters,

645
00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:07.790
like Cobra commander and stuff like that.
Cobra commander.
So there you go.

646
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.200
Get some,
you know,
it's,

647
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.710
it's one of those things like,
like is that just always going to happen?

648
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.000
That's what else in 300 years if you have a warrant or some kind of vehicle,

649
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:23.270
do you just name them whatever kind of cool names you can give them?

650
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.180
I think it's cause it's a little point of control that you have even as a,

651
00:44:26.181 --> 00:44:31.010
as a front line guy.
Yeah.
Like that you can do and it's cool.
Yeah.

652
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.080
It's like kind of do little gives your wore little character.
Yeah.

653
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:36.780
Like it's a little fun thing you can add.
Like,
you know,

654
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:40.310
how the patches situation or,

655
00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:44.290
or you know just all that stuff or seal house BTF you know,

656
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.010
kind of to kind of deviate from the war homos in,

657
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.580
in your own little group allows us for a little creativity.
Little creativity.

658
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.453
Yes.
Yes.

659
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.720
It's funny cause well naming vehicles was good and I remember so they,

660
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:03.900
we used a number of the vehicles.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven or one,
two,

661
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.700
three,
four,
five,
six or whatever.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five.

662
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.700
There's a problem with it though.
Cause the,

663
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.780
the vehicles aren't always where they're supposed to be getting.
Yeah.

664
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.810
So you go,
oh wait a second.
So you'd go out and get it a number third vehicle,

665
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.240
which was number three but you weren't supposed to be in that vehicle is number

666
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:19.950
three vehicles number six in position right now.

667
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:22.410
Cause they got scrambled up while they were maneuvering.
Yeah.

668
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.040
So that's why we ended up,
I,
I told the guys name the vehicles,
no numbers.

669
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.140
They did named them and they named him after King Pin.
Nope.

670
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.950
I think there might be a picture of there.
There's definitely some pictures of,

671
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:37.830
uh,
of my first deployment in the dichotomy of,

672
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.110
in the dichotomy of leadership book.

673
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:45.350
But I want to see if you can see any of the vehicle names written on the side.

674
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.910
Zev,
with one of the ones that I saw.
Big Zev.
Yeah.
Not In the book,

675
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:55.110
but one of the pictures.
That's that's,
yeah,
that's from,
that's from Ramadi.

676
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:59.240
That was big.
Zahav I think that was actually our big giant war.

677
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.420
I was like,
there was a,
I think it was the marine corps had a big six by truck.

678
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.960
That was,
they had war pig.
That was a war pig.
I was like that one.

679
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.690
I mean that's kind of a given that you're going to have it and I was no names on

680
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:11.760
that vehicle check.

681
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.830
Next March 20th,
1970 the two fronts.

682
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.560
The kid was caught out in the open by a stray mortar round.

683
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.250
They don't make coffee the way they used to.
The businessman said,

684
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.010
and those kids with long hair,
Jesus,

685
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.630
the impact cut off his arm,

686
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:39.940
the lower half of his right leg and blew off half his head oozing red,

687
00:46:39.941 --> 00:46:44.860
black blood into the sand.
He was 19 years old and from Ohio.

688
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.690
Well,
the president must know what he's doing.
He has my full support.

689
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.220
Where the hell is the waitress?

690
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.420
The kid only had two weeks left in Vietnam three days before he'd already framed

691
00:46:57.421 --> 00:46:58.800
a copy of his orders home.

692
00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.840
April 2nd,
1970 a bond of friendship.
It was hot.

693
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.040
The ambush had been effective out there in the brush.

694
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.690
There was little protection from site or hail of gunfire.

695
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:21.070
The soldier caught sight of his buddy.
Seriously wounded,
sir,

696
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.210
please let me get him please.
The officer,

697
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:29.290
well aware of their deep friendship hesitated and then said,
go,

698
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.370
but it's not worth it.

699
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.090
Your friend is probably dead and you may get killed trying,

700
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.250
but the soldier went.
Miraculously,

701
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.910
he hoisted his friend onto his shoulders and under heavy fire.

702
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.400
The two of them stumbled back into the trench.

703
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.710
The officer looked tenderly at the Woodby rescuer.

704
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.260
I told you it wouldn't be worth it.
Your buddy is dead and you are badly wounded.

705
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

706
00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:01.310
<v 0>I know sir.
The soldier replied,
but you're wrong.
It was worth it.</v>

707
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:02.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

708
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.810
<v 0>Because just before he died,
he looked at me and said,
I knew you'd come.</v>

709
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:09.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

710
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.750
<v 0>It didn't matter that day that one man was white and the other black.</v>

711
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:14.260
<v 1>Okay,</v>

712
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.093
<v 0>thank you God.</v>

713
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.280
That out of a hellish war we can still learn the meaning of true Brotherhood

714
00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.610
Chaplain Donald J.
Robinson from the hundred first airborne division.

715
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.660
It's where he took that story from

716
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.090
when you were kind of jumping back and forth till like,
oh,

717
00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:42.630
coffee isn't made with these two is that,
was he like just comparing,

718
00:48:42.631 --> 00:48:45.420
he had more why I should have described a little bit better.

719
00:48:45.421 --> 00:48:49.470
He had one set of the stuff that was taking place in the civilian world back in

720
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:51.090
the states.
He had in parentheses.
Yeah.

721
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:55.920
So while this kid is getting ripped apart by a mortar round back in American

722
00:48:55.921 --> 00:49:00.530
parentheses,
it just says,
um,
you know,
oh hey,
where's the weight?
Yes.

723
00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.120
And you can imagine how,
you know,
that's Wah.
You know,

724
00:49:06.121 --> 00:49:09.560
I think even during World War II,
during World War II,

725
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.150
the guys were over fighting,
but at home,

726
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:16.260
like everyone was focused on the war effort and they were rationing and they

727
00:49:16.261 --> 00:49:17.160
were building,
I mean,

728
00:49:17.161 --> 00:49:21.270
they changed factories to start building planes instead of like civilian cars.

729
00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:23.610
They built war planes,
they build bombs and they build ammunition.

730
00:49:23.611 --> 00:49:27.510
They built guns.
Like the whole country was focused on it.
In Vietnam,

731
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.990
that wasn't really happening.
You know,
it wasn't really that same situation.

732
00:49:30.991 --> 00:49:34.470
If you got drafted,
your whole world freaking went upside down.

733
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.460
But if you didn't get drafted,

734
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.330
you were going to live your normal life and go work your job and live normal and

735
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.240
go to the restaurant and ask where the hell the waitresses.
Yeah,

736
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.840
that's similar to what it's like now.
I mean actually that is what it's like now,

737
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:52.690
and I've talked about that a bunch of times,
talked about it with Sam Harris.

738
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:57.190
You know what we,
the,
the war,
the wars that we have right now,

739
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.950
there's a vast majority of the population of America.

740
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:03.880
It doesn't affect them at all.
It literally doesn't affect them at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.

741
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.870
Cause it has had no impact on the food that you eat.
The gas that you use,

742
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:12.760
zero impact,
the,
even the way you travel,
like okay.
You could say,
well you know,

743
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:13.594
we used to be able to,

744
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.900
and I don't know how much you traveled before nine 11 I traveled a lot before

745
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:21.280
nine 11 and you know,
it was a lot easier to travel.

746
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:23.960
It was a lot quicker and there was to flights always seem to be happening.

747
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.040
It's just an easier deal.
Yeah.
But now TSA is in enough,

748
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:31.220
when you get used to the program and whatever,
it's not that big of a deal.

749
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:34.250
It's not like you're freaking life is,
it's not a big deal.
Yeah.

750
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.390
So really the wars that we're going through right now for people that are

751
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:40.710
detached from him.
So I mean obviously you've got military,

752
00:50:40.711 --> 00:50:45.470
you've got the families in the military,
but once you step outside,

753
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.810
you know,
you step one or two degrees away from that,

754
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.420
you could be living your life.
And if you didn't see it on the news,

755
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:53.960
you would never ever know that there was a war going on.
Yeah.
And that's,

756
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:55.670
and what from,

757
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.850
I think the reason that he wrote that was cause that's talking about now from

758
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:00.590
the perspective of like when you're in the war,

759
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:02.560
you're thinking about those people that are,
they're not even this,

760
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.510
not even effecting them.
Occasionally watched the news and go,
oh,

761
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:08.510
there was someone else killed.
Okay,
can I get,
can you pass the mayonnaise?

762
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.200
<v 2>Yeah.
And even how like if you're not engaged in it,
it's like,
you know,</v>

763
00:51:13.201 --> 00:51:15.810
just how you say when you only,
when you watching the news,

764
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.470
that's when you see it.
And even now,
like when you watched the news,
you're like,

765
00:51:19.471 --> 00:51:22.050
oh wow.
You know,
that's,
that's too bad that that's happening.

766
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.020
Literally the moment the news goes off and I'm not talking about the worst off,

767
00:51:25.021 --> 00:51:28.160
I'm talking about everything on the news really.
Because you know,
I don't know,

768
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.270
car accident or something.

769
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:32.880
<v 0>So it's getting so ridiculous right now in the new cycle is completely</v>

770
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:33.840
ridiculous right now.

771
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:38.870
And it's no big surprise that why people listen to this podcast,

772
00:51:39.391 --> 00:51:41.460
why people are listening to all podcasts,

773
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.180
why people are watching youtube videos that are two and three and four hours

774
00:51:45.181 --> 00:51:46.650
long.
Why is that?

775
00:51:46.651 --> 00:51:49.560
Because they want to have a little bit more depth of what they're hearing.

776
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.380
I was on the airplane,
I got done,
you know,

777
00:51:52.381 --> 00:51:57.381
they make you put away your computer and so I turned on the news because it had

778
00:51:58.231 --> 00:52:02.970
streaming cable news and I turn it on and I mean I'm going,

779
00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.120
when did they turn on?
When do they make you put away your computer?
20 minutes.

780
00:52:06.121 --> 00:52:11.121
I had 20 minutes left and in that 20 minutes there was like three or two

781
00:52:11.251 --> 00:52:12.420
sections of commercials.

782
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.000
Actually there might've been three sections of commercials that are all like

783
00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:18.360
four minutes long.
I was getting so mad.
I'm thinking to myself,

784
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.950
I'm thinking myself,
Bro,

785
00:52:19.951 --> 00:52:22.230
I just want to know what's happening and you've got to show me another

786
00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:25.820
commercial about some mattress company or what I mean,
just just,
just,

787
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:29.640
just trying to sell me stuff and then it goes back to the coverage.
Right.

788
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.120
He goes back to the coverage and the coverage is people yelling at each other.

789
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.960
There's no conversations happening and it's,
it's,
it's,
and I've done,
you know,

790
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.030
I've done plenty of news bits,
bites,
whatever it's called,

791
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:47.130
and you compared to a podcast,
it's a joke.
It's a joke.

792
00:52:47.131 --> 00:52:49.800
That's totally nothing.
That's why,
that's why,
you know,

793
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.490
Ilan mosque going on a Joe Rogan and talking for three hours,
you know,

794
00:52:53.491 --> 00:52:57.450
that's a whole different story.
That's a whole different thing.

795
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.500
And I kind of think that's the beginning.
That's the,
that's sort of,

796
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:06.130
it's the beginning of the end and the slums.
Yeah.

797
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.440
At the end of some stuff and the starting of some other stuff.
But that when you,

798
00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:12.870
when you just can s turn on the news and it's,

799
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.310
and it's over that quickly and it doesn't bring you anything other than

800
00:53:17.311 --> 00:53:20.070
literally the headline.
It's just the headline,

801
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:25.050
which a lot of times is misleading,
which is,
yeah.
Which is clickbait often.

802
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.680
Yeah.
Right.
It's clickbait and your cell phone killing you.

803
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.690
They're not saying this though.
Your cell phone's killing you,

804
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:34.630
but is it kind of thing.
But now I got to know and I got to click on that.

805
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.090
Yeah.
So nowadays that's even,

806
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.690
you could say that's probably even worse because there's so many good.
And plus,

807
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:46.230
not to mention back then if you were going to watch,
you know,

808
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:51.231
my dad was telling me this the other day that back in the going to do they,

809
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.160
they had,
uh,
you know,
everyone watched,
like he just mentioned,

810
00:53:56.161 --> 00:53:59.850
he mentioned Walter Cronkite in this.
And like my dad was a kid,

811
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:01.110
everyone watched Walter Cronkite.

812
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:04.950
So everyone had a base common theme of discussion.

813
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.340
So when you went to work on Thursday,

814
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.970
everyone had watched the news on Wednesday and everyone saw the same news.

815
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:17.640
And nowadays,
so if you wanted to watch TV,
you were to watch that.

816
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:21.720
I mean,
I remember Walter Cronkite,
you know,
that's,
that was my dad.

817
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.720
That's what was on at night.
You Watch Walter Cronkite.
That was just,

818
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:25.770
that was just how,

819
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:31.470
and now you can go home and never watched the news.

820
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:35.100
So you can be completely,
you know,
not only,
you know,
it's one thing to say,
hey,

821
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:38.190
the news is over about the war in 30 seconds and I don't think about anymore.

822
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.660
You can just never even watch it.

823
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:44.310
You can just watch the Instagram videos of car crashes or,

824
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:49.170
or what other dumb stuff do you watch on on Instagram?
The Trump grille fail.

825
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.680
Drunk girl fails.
Yeah,
let's watch 30 we'll,
I've got,
you know,

826
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:53.491
an extra half an hour,

827
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:57.240
I'll watch a half an hour worth of drunk girls fails and they're,

828
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.270
and they're funny and they're entertaining and they,

829
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:03.000
what part of the mind do they stimulate?

830
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.500
Cause they must stimulate some part of your brain because when you watch car

831
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:11.430
crashes,
you know,
and how I was going to throw street fights in there,

832
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.730
but when I watch street fights,
I'm actually picking them apart.
Right.

833
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:19.350
I'm actually trying to learn something.
Yeah.
And,
but you know,
drunk girls,

834
00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:22.230
Fay drunk or fellows,
those you don't learn a lot from.

835
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:28.490
I shone my daughter's drunk girl fails like when they were 1314 years old and be

836
00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:32.210
like,
oh this is what alcohol,
we'll get you.
Yeah.

837
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.960
And the other thing for a while they were showing binge drinking in England and

838
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:43.620
you know it was a,
it was actually in the news a little bit and it would just be,

839
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.200
you know,
men and women.
But I'd show my daughters,

840
00:55:46.201 --> 00:55:51.201
the women of just girls just completely passed out drunk skirt hanging open.

841
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:56.430
I mean just puke all over themselves.
And I'm like,
Hey,
this is drinking,

842
00:55:56.431 --> 00:55:58.050
this is alcohol,
this is,

843
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:01.290
this is what your little friends are getting all excited about and think is so

844
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:06.240
cool.
This is it.
This is what it gets you.

845
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:12.390
So good.
Good tool.
So you can totally avoid,

846
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.350
you can basically customize your information,

847
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:19.710
flow into your brain to whatever you want.

848
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.640
And I'll go one step further and tell you that the algorithms that youtube is

849
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:26.530
putting ahead of you in front of you.

850
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.800
So when you get done watching one youtube video of a drunk girl fail,

851
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:34.360
what pops up?
Nine more drunk girl fails that are ready for you to watch.

852
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:38.740
So they've got an algorithm that's actually going to just lead you to stupidity.

853
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:42.220
Yeah.
Right.
They should put,
instead of putting advertisements,

854
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:46.720
they should be like,
okay,
for every four really dumb youtube video you watch,

855
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:51.870
you should have to watch at least one quarter of that compiled time into

856
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:54.430
something that's going to teach you something about being a better human being.

857
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:56.590
Yeah.
Well,
yeah.

858
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.110
<v 2>I don't know how good of a business model that would be,
but you know,
uh,
it's,</v>

859
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.470
it's a good idea kind of in theory,

860
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.520
I guess you got to get beyond just thinking about money Echo Charles.
Yeah,

861
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.620
I dig it,
man.
I'm not saying they shouldn't,

862
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:11.250
I'm just saying that that's why they won't,
but yeah,
yeah,

863
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.690
<v 0>yeah.
It's like right now because right now in this,
in the,</v>

864
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.970
they're trying to put these limits on time or I think the social media people

865
00:57:17.971 --> 00:57:18.990
are saying,
hey,

866
00:57:18.991 --> 00:57:21.990
we're going to help you monitor your time that you spend on social media.

867
00:57:21.991 --> 00:57:24.000
So there'll be like a little thing that pops in z.

868
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.980
You've spent 40 minutes on social media today because you're right.

869
00:57:28.981 --> 00:57:31.680
You know what,
they're not going to say you reached your limit.
You're done.

870
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.500
They're not going to say that they're not,
and they're not going to say,
hey,

871
00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:36.360
you watched nine stupid videos.

872
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.060
Now you're going to watch three educational ones that make you smarter.

873
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:45.390
<v 2>Maybe they're going to show you the time of your consumption right next to the</v>

874
00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:50.500
next video that they,
that they made and laid it on what you'd like to watch.

875
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:53.440
You know,
they all,
it's completely irresistible to,
yeah,

876
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:57.040
that's what they think that you got to watch a drunk girl fail and you can see

877
00:57:57.041 --> 00:58:00.680
her and she's like standing on the edge of whatever and you know,

878
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.070
it's got to be a good one.
Yeah.

879
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:05.600
Traced in like ray with exclamation mark or pointing,

880
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.790
you know how they do that or it's like,
oh,
it's so exciting.

881
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:12.430
So excited to see what you're doing.
But yeah,
so you can be completely,

882
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.190
the point there is you can be completely disconnected,

883
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.530
especially now completely disconnected with the reality of it.
The world.

884
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.680
<v 0>All right.
April 4th,
1970 colonel s</v>

885
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.300
many officers in NCO is in Vietnam.
No their business,

886
00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.890
even though they hate the war,
a war not of their own making,

887
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:38.360
they really take care of their men and don't give a damn about frontline

888
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.870
formalities.
All they want is to get as many of their men back alive as they can.

889
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.370
The men deeply respect these officer's NTO is and justifiably so.

890
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.940
So there you go.
A little bit,
little bit of leadership here,

891
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:52.883
taking care of your men.

892
00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:57.630
Other back of the book of other officers are little people with rank and

893
00:58:57.631 --> 00:58:59.580
authority and little else.

894
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:05.580
They cannot command respect by their actions.
So they must command by their risk,

895
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.930
disrespect verbally and for petty offenses,
for haircuts,

896
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.390
polished boots and frontline salutes.

897
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.570
Colonel s was one of these men,

898
00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.940
a little puffy hamster man who would not hesitate to lick the boots on any

899
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:23.114
occasion.

900
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:27.710
And he had the audacity on numerous occasions to lambaste various troops for

901
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:30.380
their sloppy haircuts and uniforms at the base px.

902
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.490
Such troops had just come in from the field or from a long exhausting convoy and

903
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:37.640
it not seeing the likes of a shower,
much less a barber and a number of weeks.

904
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:43.610
They're always looked at the kernel in total disbelief and then comprehending in

905
00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:49.281
a long imprisoned raged for this antiseptic staff toady.

906
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:51.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

907
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:55.930
<v 0>Colonel S is written directives were likewise in comprehensible,
unnecessary,</v>

908
00:59:55.931 --> 00:59:58.600
wasteful,
and in a word unbelievably stupid.

909
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.780
Many of us thought that the Joseph Heller's catch 22 was an unreal parody about

910
01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:07.510
war until we met Colonel S.
Okay.

911
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:11.510
One night some Vietcong sappers blew up our petroleum storage dump and it was

912
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:15.640
incredible.
It was an incredible blaze for three days and nights.
Anyway,

913
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:19.160
after the immediate attack,
colonel s jumped out of his jeep,

914
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:23.150
grabbed his 45 caliber pistol and went chasing after the VC,

915
01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:27.830
hellbent for hell bent for musty leather,
stumbling over the sand dunes,

916
01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:31.160
like a long retired prop man and a John Wayne war movie,

917
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:34.790
attempting a few tile and embarrassing come back.

918
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:36.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

919
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.730
<v 0>We all sort of hope that the Viet Cong would follow the logical rules of</v>

920
01:00:40.731 --> 01:00:44.240
guerrilla warfare and leave one sniper back to cover their escape,

921
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:49.100
waiting for the much beloved staff colonel,
right to come panting over the hill.

922
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.680
But no such luck.

923
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.350
Apparently the VC knew all about the kernel and wanted to leave him right where

924
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:01.850
he was and who could blame them.
So there you go.

925
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.280
There's those type of people.
They exist now.

926
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.870
They are going to exist in the future.

927
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:08.630
If you're one of those people that started listening to podcasts and joined the

928
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:12.020
military,
I didn't know.
There's a lot of,
you get some,
that's awesome.

929
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:15.640
Um,
when you don't,

930
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:20.740
don't think that every office or you meet is going to be one of these guys that

931
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.110
takes care of their men and doesn't give a damn about frontline formalities and

932
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.260
deeply respected.
That's,
that's not a majority.
Hmm.

933
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:32.870
Now this other knucklehead,
the guy that's licking the boots of the general,

934
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:36.620
that's not a majority either,
but they exist.

935
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.990
They're there
April 9th,
1970 waiting,

936
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.710
waiting is 90% of the game in Vietnam.
You keep busy,

937
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.350
you do your job 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

938
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.720
Occasionally there's a half day off,

939
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:54.530
a stand down or 10 days of our and our outside of Vietnam,

940
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.570
but the rest of the time you wait seven days a week,

941
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:02.120
24 hours a day until things happen.

942
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.200
You wait and then when it happens,
you're right in the middle of it.

943
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.500
When you're not working or sleeping,
you're still waiting

944
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.230
and time can play some horrible tricks on you.

945
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.560
Vietnam may be a one year tour for most soldiers,

946
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.860
but they have actually spent many more years than they care to.

947
01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:24.861
Talk about time in Vietnam slows down almost to a stop every minute of every

948
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:30.360
day.
The Vietnamese have lived with this phenomenon for century,

949
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.710
but the Western soldier cannot.
Your last two weeks in Vietnam,

950
01:02:34.711 --> 01:02:38.400
like your first two weeks are measured in months and you're especially paranoid

951
01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:41.670
about getting hit during these last two weeks and you wait,

952
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:43.600
<v 1>okay,</v>

953
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.021
<v 0>you're off.</v>

954
01:02:44.021 --> 01:02:49.021
Duty Time is short lived and very precious with a 24 hour day in the 72 day a

955
01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:52.870
week is the only time you have to blow off your stress and anxiety,

956
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.860
your loneliness,
fear and frustration.
Sometimes you can almost

957
01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:57.960
<v 1>okay,</v>

958
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.930
<v 0>but only almost forget the war.</v>

959
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:05.040
During this time we grew together with our friends.

960
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:09.930
We shared each other's hurt and pain are love and hate for home and war.

961
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:11.020
<v 1>Okay?</v>

962
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.360
<v 0>We got to know each other in a very deep sense,</v>

963
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:16.510
maybe better than our wives or girlfriends ever would.

964
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

965
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:23.140
<v 0>We talked philosophy and we talk nonsense.
We laughed and we cried.</v>

966
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:25.000
We learned to live and grow.

967
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:26.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

968
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:29.570
<v 0>We looked back and we looked ahead.</v>

969
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

970
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.450
<v 0>We talked about changes,</v>

971
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:38.030
gay nos and in America we committed ourselves to both.

972
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:40.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

973
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:44.500
<v 0>Without these friends,
Vietnam would have been much worse than it already was.</v>

974
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.750
Our friends made this waiting

975
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.983
<v 1>bearable.</v>

976
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.720
<v 0>April 11th,
1970 medicine men,</v>

977
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.420
many doctors assigned to the medical corps in Vietnam devote much of,

978
01:04:05.421 --> 01:04:08.750
they're very limited and precious off time duty.

979
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.060
Working with Vietnamese civilians.

980
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.240
Most medical assistance from the other side is gratefully appreciated,

981
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:19.880
but there are exceptions.
My brother Charles,

982
01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:24.080
who was assigned to the six convalescent center in southern to core work with

983
01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:29.081
the many Vietnamese civilians in camera on village and my car village among

984
01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:33.290
others.
But three weeks after he ended his tour of duty in Vietnam,

985
01:04:33.291 --> 01:04:38.291
a small group of Viet Cong sappers blew up his hospital killing and wounding 98

986
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:39.890
bedridden patients.

987
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:45.070
Another army doctor working in a small village not far from camera on Bay,

988
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.940
successfully saved the life of a young girl,
12 years old,

989
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:51.820
who had both of her hands blown off by a grenade.

990
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.870
The little girl's grandmother was also injured in the blast.

991
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.360
A short while later,

992
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:03.760
the doctor learned that the young girls injuries occurred while she and her

993
01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:08.230
grandmother had been attempting to booby trap the doctor's own jeep with this

994
01:05:08.231 --> 01:05:11.740
same grenade hoping to kill him when he started his engine.

995
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.033
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

996
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:19.810
<v 0>a third unarmed American spent much of his free time in a similar village</v>

997
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.590
attempting to fight an outbreak of cholera and typhoid.

998
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:28.780
One young Vietnamese boy was too sick to be saved when the medic arrived in the

999
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:33.310
village,
but rumors circulated throughout the hamlet that the American medic was

1000
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:36.790
responsible for killing the boy with his poisonous medicine.

1001
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:38.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1002
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.600
<v 0>Consequently,</v>

1003
01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.830
the village allowed to Viet Cong snipers to ambush and kill the young medic.

1004
01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:47.760
When he drove back into the village a few days later with another shipment of

1005
01:05:47.761 --> 01:05:49.050
lifesaving drugs,

1006
01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.520
few medical personnel dared to enter this village after the episode and half the

1007
01:05:55.771 --> 01:05:59.640
villagers later died as a result of cholera epidemic.

1008
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.270
<v 1>Yeah.
This is,</v>

1009
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.720
<v 0>you know,
I was reading last night,
I was actually reading</v>

1010
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.450
an interview with David Hackworth that I've read it before,

1011
01:06:18.451 --> 01:06:21.480
but I was reading it again and one of the things he said was that

1012
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.760
the goal,
because we dropped,
he was going through the numbers and we'll do this,

1013
01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:30.360
we'll do this interview on the podcast.
I'll bring it in and,
but he was saying,

1014
01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:32.910
he's talking about how much bombs we dropped on Vietnam.

1015
01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:37.911
So Vietnam is about the size of California and we dropped more bombs in Vietnam,

1016
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:44.570
then got dropped in all of Europe during World War Two on both sides.

1017
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.860
So both the allies and the axis,

1018
01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:53.520
all bombs put together during all of World War II.

1019
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:59.280
In all that area,
there was more dropped into just Vietnam.

1020
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.410
And what,
what someone said was,
you know,
he's quoting a general that said,
hey,

1021
01:07:04.411 --> 01:07:06.120
we're going to bomb them back into the stone age.

1022
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.620
And what he didn't realize is that they were already wearing the stone age.

1023
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:13.320
These people are living,
they're farmers,
they're,
they're working.

1024
01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:16.560
They're basically in the stone age.
And so that's,

1025
01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:20.970
that's my point is that they're not going to understand this medical treatment.

1026
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.060
And if someone comes in and starts manipulating their brains and saying,
oh,
that,

1027
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.210
that you're,
that kid was killed by this poisonous medicine.

1028
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.190
April 15th,
1970 a short,
short story.

1029
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:41.610
Once upon a time there was a politician who all by himself blustered and stormed

1030
01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:45.820
and committed half a million young men to risk their lives in war.

1031
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.730
Some fat asked power,

1032
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:53.731
hungry politician who in all his potato face ugliness had the gall to consider

1033
01:07:53.871 --> 01:07:56.570
himself a statesman and a man of decision.

1034
01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:01.220
The American sheep went Baja,

1035
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:06.370
Baja and the young boys died and bulb knows lived happily ever after.

1036
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:14.590
<v 1>Kirchmeier Lee cautherin daily</v>

1037
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:21.980
<v 0>Rodriguez
just names.</v>

1038
01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.810
Just figures.

1039
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1040
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:34.980
<v 0>April 19th,
1970 officers and men,</v>

1041
01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:41.070
American soldiers in Vietnam came from all walks of life and so did the
officers.

1042
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:45.870
Most of the officers I worked with in Vietnam,
in Saigon,
Kam,

1043
01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:50.871
Ron not trading were citizen soldiers like I was graduates of ROTC or ocs.

1044
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:58.910
Only colonel s major tea and Captain d were west point graduates.

1045
01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:03.470
Colonel s is discussed elsewhere in this book.
Book.

1046
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:07.770
Captain d didn't like going along with anyone and major [inaudible] was a good

1047
01:09:07.771 --> 01:09:10.380
officer,
well liked and much respected.

1048
01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.960
One out of three ain't bad,

1049
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

1050
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.381
<v 0>For six months,</v>

1051
01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:20.381
my superior officer was made your p from the hundred 73rd airborne and I

1052
01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:23.120
couldn't have worked for a better man in route of the army.

1053
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:29.030
He treated us all like human beings no matter what our rank was and we were all

1054
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:32.030
fiercely loyal in return.
Hey,

1055
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:34.970
there's a new novel idea that's a novel idea.

1056
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:38.040
All of these people that ask me like,
Oh,
I'm taking over leadership position.

1057
01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.740
What should I do?
Here's step one.

1058
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.420
Treat your people like human beings no matter what their rank are,
and look,

1059
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.340
he says that people were fiercely loyal and return

1060
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.790
when major [inaudible] left.
However,

1061
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:53.750
we became expendable to the greater glories of someone else.
The army,

1062
01:09:53.751 --> 01:09:58.340
like any civilian counterpart has its equal share of the good,
the bad,

1063
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.583
and the ugly.

1064
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:06.800
One of my closest friends in Vietnam was none of the above.

1065
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:10.400
He was a stevedore officer,
a Pentecostal ministers son,

1066
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:12.500
and Zorba the Greek.

1067
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.320
He treated his men as individuals,
rank lists and unique.

1068
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:21.890
They did their job with a minimum of hassle and they loved him.

1069
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:26.300
He was their counselor,
their friend,
and they're equal.

1070
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.560
When he was about to leave Vietnam,

1071
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:33.730
his men gave him a symbolic Christening and beer and throw them in the ocean.

1072
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:40.110
He told them to treat each other just like you'd want the other dude to treat

1073
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:41.043
you.

1074
01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:47.130
The golden rule in a tub full of beer and inner light forever branching outward

1075
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.521
in Vietnam,

1076
01:10:51.521 --> 01:10:55.810
when most of us were plodding through the absurd in human procedures of the war,

1077
01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:58.870
he alone remained a man of substance.

1078
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.690
So again,
it's like treat your people well.

1079
01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1080
01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:10.210
<v 0>April 27th,
1970 a highway accident.</v>

1081
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:16.470
Yesterday we saw the of what happens when a small lambretta scooter bus filled

1082
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:22.491
with 12 Vietnamese civilians hits a Viet cong mind buried along the side of a

1083
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:23.670
main highway.

1084
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:25.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1085
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.320
<v 0>The mine was primarily an anti-personnel device used as the military abstractly</v>

1086
01:11:31.001 --> 01:11:35.140
explains it,
the harass,
the civilian population.

1087
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.800
There were a lot of mangled bodies lying there until they were policed up

1088
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:45.270
primarily older people,
women and children.

1089
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.890
The elder sons and husbands had already been conscripted to take their chances

1090
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.050
on the conventional battlefield.

1091
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:54.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1092
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.913
<v 0>In America,</v>

1093
01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.040
a big highway accident or related disaster usually draws a huge morbid crowd to

1094
01:12:00.051 --> 01:12:01.640
stare and Gawk.

1095
01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.210
Yesterday in Vietnam,
no one seemed to notice

1096
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:15.020
April 30th,
1970 the Koreans,

1097
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:21.230
the Koreans fielded an excessive to crack divisions during the Vietnam War.

1098
01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.120
The Rock that's Republic of Korea.

1099
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:27.650
The Rock troops were greatly feared and respected by the Viet Cong and north

1100
01:12:27.651 --> 01:12:32.651
Vietnamese are like they asked for and gave little corridor to the communists

1101
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:39.550
once when one of their troops was ambushed outside a small village in northern

1102
01:12:39.861 --> 01:12:44.120
to core,
the Koreans haunted the sniper down,
brought him back to the village,

1103
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.240
strung him up on a tree and skinned him alive.

1104
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:49.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1105
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.730
<v 0>The Koreans bravery,</v>

1106
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:55.110
devotion and ferocity as a fighting force was legendary in Vietnam.

1107
01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:56.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:01.730
<v 0>During the Tet offensive of 1968 every major allied headquarters and military</v>

1109
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:08.001
compound in all of Vietnam was attacked by the communists except one.

1110
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:09.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1111
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.480
<v 0>The VC and the north Vietnamese gave wide berth to the Koreans.</v>

1112
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:16.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1113
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:20.940
<v 0>I did not know that,
but that's,
that's legit.
They said,</v>

1114
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:25.410
ah,
yeah,
we're not going to attack the Korean compound.

1115
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.200
Wouldn't leave it alone.
Yeah,

1116
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:32.730
so there is a,
that speaks volumes.

1117
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.550
That speaks volumes.
That's why,

1118
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.420
yeah.
You got to carry a big stick.

1119
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.220
Got to carry a big stick.
Perhaps the Koreans.

1120
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:50.700
Here's a little poem in memory of a friend killed in action.

1121
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.590
Is it weakness for a strong man to be moved by inner touch?

1122
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1123
01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:04.980
<v 0>Mosty spurn a lonely blade of grass and damn the oceans,
roar</v>

1124
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.321
or musty,

1125
01:14:07.321 --> 01:14:12.321
look at sentimental beauty as a crutch and choose to play the game of pride by

1126
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:17.650
calling life a whore.
No,

1127
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:23.350
I have seen the strongest man defend a withered rose

1128
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.080
then fall from grace because the people didn't understand.

1129
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:33.210
They thought it was his weakness.
They exploited I suppose,

1130
01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:38.610
and killing him and ignorance.
They trembled in his hand.

1131
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.850
May 25th,
1970 Kent state

1132
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:51.060
in the futility and rage over President Nixon's Cambodian invasion,

1133
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:56.750
the killing of four student demonstrators at Kent State University by the Ohio

1134
01:14:56.821 --> 01:14:59.970
National Guard,
mystified many Gis and Vietnam.

1135
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.010
We felt this outrage too,

1136
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.420
but we had a hard time comprehending how the press and the nation could make so

1137
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:14.431
much of an issue out of these four student deaths when we were losing friends

1138
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:19.150
and comrades and an average of 250 men killed each and every week.

1139
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:26.430
It made us feel as unwilling participants that we were a sub human species

1140
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:32.310
neglected and alone forgotten pawns in a confused and God forsaken war

1141
01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.580
and we were
on both sides of the ocean.

1142
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1143
01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:49.780
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean
obviously grown up and you,
you,</v>

1144
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.300
you actually study,

1145
01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.560
like when I went to history class in high school,

1146
01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:59.580
like we specifically learned about the Kent State massacre,

1147
01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:03.480
which obviously is horrible,
but can you imagine a,

1148
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:05.280
so for the students get killed,

1149
01:16:05.281 --> 01:16:07.740
the student protesters obviously never should have happened,

1150
01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:14.330
but can you imagine being in Vietnam and the whole country of America is up in

1151
01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:17.370
arms about these four students being killed,

1152
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.730
but every week there's 250 of your friends getting killed.

1153
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:25.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1154
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:29.370
<v 0>May 26th,
1970 the real heroes,</v>

1155
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.520
the medics and med EVAC personnel and Vietnam almost to a man were beautiful and

1156
01:16:34.561 --> 01:16:39.540
very dedicated people braving the fiercest fire and most Horowitz odds to

1157
01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:44.460
comfort and evacuate the wounded and dying military and civilian alike often

1158
01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:46.830
from both sides.
From the heat of battle.

1159
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:49.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1160
01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.720
<v 0>In any war.</v>

1161
01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.900
The real heroes are those who tried to maintain basic humanity time and time

1162
01:16:56.151 --> 01:16:59.300
again risking their own lives so that others might live

1163
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:06.550
in Vietnam.
The medics and Med evac people were such men.

1164
01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1165
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.590
<v 0>May 28th,
1970 antiwar protesters.</v>

1166
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:21.190
There were various reactions by Vietnam Gis to the antiwar protesters back home.

1167
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.880
The bulk of the infantry were high school graduates who knew that college

1168
01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:30.881
deferments kept most of the more affluent anti war protestors out of the draft

1169
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:35.570
and thus out of the war
to these gis,

1170
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.860
Vietnam was viewed in terms of a deep go deep gut reaction.
Uh,

1171
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:42.140
sort of misery loves company affair.

1172
01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.890
I wish those God damn protesters could be over here for one week and see what

1173
01:17:47.891 --> 01:17:51.700
the VC did to my buddy.
It changed their goddamn minds real quick.

1174
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.210
That was,
he had that in quotes.
That wasn't him.
He lived,
he,
that was him.

1175
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:04.830
That was him explaining what the faults of the average infantry GI was.

1176
01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:08.381
Back to the book.

1177
01:18:08.381 --> 01:18:11.860
Some of our contemporaries had chosen jail or Canada and Sweden.

1178
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:14.650
We had chosen Vietnam.

1179
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:18.910
At least the antiwar protestor could show the world that we were all not

1180
01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:21.730
supporting the president's actions even at war.

1181
01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:24.250
On the other hand,

1182
01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:29.340
we had to survive this war since the VC and the north Vietnamese had designs for

1183
01:18:29.531 --> 01:18:31.930
killing us and we had designs on them.

1184
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.760
We were both defacto enemies.
Nevertheless,

1185
01:18:36.761 --> 01:18:41.761
most Vietnam Gis and the antiwar protesters back home had something in common.

1186
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:45.160
I love this.
This right here is awesome.

1187
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:51.030
The frontline troops hated the war and they hated the safer combat support

1188
01:18:51.911 --> 01:18:52.744
personnel.

1189
01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:57.850
The combat support personnel hated the war and they hated the organizational

1190
01:18:57.851 --> 01:18:58.990
general staff.

1191
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:03.700
The staff personnel hated the war and they hated the troops back in Europe and

1192
01:19:03.701 --> 01:19:04.870
the troops back home.

1193
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:09.790
The troops back home hated the war and they hated the placid,

1194
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.100
non-caring American civilians.

1195
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.700
The American civilians supported the war at the time and they hated the antiwar

1196
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.400
protesters and the anti war protesters hated the war and they hated the

1197
01:19:24.281 --> 01:19:26.560
government.
Therefore,

1198
01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.510
the protesters and the soldiers at like a like had one important thing in
common.

1199
01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:35.320
We both hated the war.
That's a,

1200
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:40.210
that's a crazy thing to think about.
That whole thing is just like,
it's uh,

1201
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:41.730
it's the,
you could,

1202
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:46.330
you could play those kinds of circular games with our political system all day

1203
01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:48.640
long right now.
Oh yeah.
Ridiculous.

1204
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.930
This overall feeling perhaps can only be described by a related story as the

1205
01:19:56.931 --> 01:20:00.440
American troop withdrawals and Vietnam began and armored outfit,

1206
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:04.580
the two one cab pulled into camera on bay for its long awaited departure home

1207
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:06.200
over four years.

1208
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:11.290
The two one had performed a combat and combat support role in and around Phan

1209
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:14.303
Rang and fans.

1210
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:19.290
Yet they had eaten Dustin mod been shot at mortared and booby trap throughout

1211
01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:24.240
their tour and now they were going home to honor these brave and gallant men.

1212
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.830
General d of The camera on support command decided to give them a fitting

1213
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:32.220
welcome home amid banners,
bands and flags.

1214
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:35.160
General d himself was on the reviewing stand

1215
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:42.270
adjust just as the overly tired men of the two one cab rumbled by in their tanks

1216
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:45.840
and armored personnel carriers.
The general proudly saluted them.

1217
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:47.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1218
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.110
<v 0>The first man and the lead tank.</v>

1219
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:54.150
Not knowing it was a general saluting him or just not caring return.

1220
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:57.420
The general snappy salute and the only way possible.

1221
01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:58.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1222
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.000
<v 0>He gave him the finger</v>

1223
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.730
June 6th,
1970 coming home.

1224
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1225
01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.860
<v 0>Coming home,
we had to go through American customs,</v>

1226
01:21:12.010 --> 01:21:16.120
sort of like weary tourists back from a year long overseas jaunt to the

1227
01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:20.020
enchanted east.
Did we have anything to declare?
Not much.

1228
01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.890
Most of our prize to px positions,
possessions were shipped home,

1229
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.500
some having been ripped off by certain civilian stevedores but along the coast,

1230
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.980
so now he is,
he's home.

1231
01:21:32.981 --> 01:21:36.010
June 7th,
1970 Fort Lewis,
Washington,

1232
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:41.980
a big monster idiot tube welcomed us back to the world.

1233
01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.480
A third rate TV comedy in the sweaty lounge with grotesque,

1234
01:21:46.481 --> 01:21:51.190
absurd commercials screaming and clawing at their days to viewers with a never

1235
01:21:51.191 --> 01:21:53.020
ending by me fervor.

1236
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1237
01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.030
<v 0>I'm sorry.
I said as I turned the monster off,</v>

1238
01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.340
I'm just not ready for all this yet.
I know what you mean.

1239
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:03.360
Another voice said,

1240
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.220
spending a whole year overseas fighting to defend all this crap.

1241
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.560
So there you go.
The TV,
the TV,

1242
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:18.910
the monster clawing,
yet it's viewers

1243
01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:25.570
by me.
By
May 5th,

1244
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.130
1971 a march in San Francisco.

1245
01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:32.980
There was a huge antiwar protest march in San Francisco this week.

1246
01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:37.981
Over 700,000 people walked down Geary Street and in memory of some friends,

1247
01:22:37.991 --> 01:22:39.730
we found ourselves in front of a long,

1248
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.740
large contingent of old timers from the Lincoln Brigade and directly behind a

1249
01:22:44.741 --> 01:22:47.170
large group of businessmen against the war.

1250
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:52.700
There were students and veterans,
housewives with baby prams,
Burley's,

1251
01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:56.230
stevedores and electricians,
grandmothers and grandchildren,

1252
01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.140
policemen and hippies,
minorities and majorities,

1253
01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:02.830
all Americans peacefully asserting their constitutional right of free speech and

1254
01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:07.120
assembly.
After the speeches in golden gate park,

1255
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:12.100
one badly crippled veteran in a wheelchair had just enough strength to hurl some

1256
01:23:12.101 --> 01:23:14.950
hardware,
one combat metals into the field,

1257
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:18.070
a bronze star medal and two purple hearts.

1258
01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:23.780
Nobody cared about us when they sent us over there,
he said,

1259
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.200
and nobody cares about us now.

1260
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.133
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1261
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:34.980
<v 0>and that</v>

1262
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:40.560
kind of closes out the,
the portion of the book

1263
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.141
that I wanted to cover,

1264
01:23:43.141 --> 01:23:48.141
although I do want to actually finish it with what he finishes or how he

1265
01:23:48.751 --> 01:23:52.290
finishes the book and He,
and he finishes the book.

1266
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.180
Peter End Swisher finishes the book with a,

1267
01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.680
with a quote from someone else
and

1268
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:05.880
that's how he finishes the book.
So I want to read that

1269
01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:12.180
and it says
to close out the book,

1270
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.210
it's called another time,
another place

1271
01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:18.443
this morning,

1272
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:23.930
January 21st another picture of war was the worst I've ever seen.

1273
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It is just east of where the engineers have established a ferry crossing across

1274
01:24:34.281 --> 01:24:38.120
the river at a point where the river first bends toward the road

1275
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:43.410
until there were,
they were buried there,

1276
01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:47.460
lay what was left of eight or 10 British soldiers,

1277
01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.920
perhaps one of their mortars was hit as some were burned and there had been a

1278
01:24:54.621 --> 01:24:58.970
heavy explosion,
but no shell crater was seen nearby

1279
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.300
of two men,
only the lower half's remained.

1280
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1281
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:08.430
<v 0>Another two were each lacking ahead.</v>

1282
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:10.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1283
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.060
<v 0>And another had a leg off at the hip.</v>

1284
01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1285
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:17.390
<v 0>All had been horribly injured.</v>

1286
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:23.890
A Christmas card lay on the ground,

1287
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.860
baring the words in a child's handwriting

1288
01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.380
to the best daddy in the world.

1289
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:38.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1290
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.480
<v 0>And those words were written by somebody by the name of Captain George Nash,</v>

1291
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.960
Royal Artillery,
Italy,
1944

1292
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.033
<v 1>and</v>

1293
01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:02.980
<v 0>if you put this together,
Peter and Swisher,
the end in his</v>

1294
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.600
stands for Nash because Captain George Nash was Peter Swishers biological father

1295
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.920
who I talked about in the beginning who was killed after the war as he came home

1296
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:23.563
from Italy.

1297
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:36.470
Oh,
another place,
another time.

1298
01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:41.413
<v 1>You know,</v>

1299
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.870
<v 0>life in,
in many ways,</v>

1300
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:54.490
in so many different ways,
we are not going to understand it.

1301
01:26:54.491 --> 01:26:56.100
It's in comprehensible.

1302
01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:01.620
I mean when you get this Christmas card laying on the ground amongst these

1303
01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.080
savagely wounded soldiers and it's Christmas card says in little kids riding to

1304
01:27:08.321 --> 01:27:09.850
the best daddy in the world.

1305
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:18.050
I don't,
I don't,
I don't understand that.

1306
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.850
I don't know
why that is,

1307
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:25.940
know why the world can be such a horrific place

1308
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:33.200
and how life can be so tragic.
But that is the way it is

1309
01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.350
in some of the things that happen in the world.

1310
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:42.840
They just happened and what we cannot control them.

1311
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:48.070
But at the same time,

1312
01:27:48.071 --> 01:27:53.050
there are so many things in the world that we do control.

1313
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:01.410
And all of us,
all of us,

1314
01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:05.640
we all can somehow in some way relieve,

1315
01:28:05.641 --> 01:28:08.970
or we can attenuate some of that tragedy.

1316
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.760
We don't need to spurn a lonely blade of grass or damn the oceans roar.

1317
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.750
We don't need to do that.

1318
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:27.920
We can make someone's life a little bit better.

1319
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:31.430
We can make ourselves a little bit better.
And in doing so,

1320
01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:35.120
we can make the world even just a small part of the world

1321
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.190
a little bit

1322
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:38.023
<v 1>better.</v>

1323
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:40.470
<v 0>And Peter Swisher,</v>

1324
01:28:40.471 --> 01:28:43.980
he'd actually did survive Vietnam and he went on to become a lawyer.

1325
01:28:43.981 --> 01:28:46.950
And then he became a professor of law at the University of Richmond.

1326
01:28:46.951 --> 01:28:50.970
And he was married for 37 years and raised a daughter and

1327
01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:53.990
<v 1>okay.</v>

1328
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:58.170
<v 0>And he died June 15th,
2016</v>

1329
01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:00.323
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1330
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:01.530
<v 0>Of a cancer</v>

1331
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.160
cancer called Multiple Myeloma,
which if you don't know what that is,

1332
01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:10.830
that's one of the forms of cancer that's connected to,

1333
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:14.240
to Agent Orange,

1334
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:19.100
which is the chemical that we used in Vietnam to kill the foliage.

1335
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.190
So the enemy couldn't hide it.

1336
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.000
And that's the cancer that killed Peter Nash a Swisher.

1337
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:36.563
But,

1338
01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:44.020
but luckily his voice and his memories live on with us through his writing and

1339
01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:48.650
through his stories.
And I think through these stories,

1340
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:56.730
you left the world a little bit of a better place.

1341
01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.250
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1342
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:07.580
So Echo,

1343
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.640
maybe you could,
uh,

1344
01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:19.180
let me decompress a little bit and maybe tell us how we can help us

1345
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:24.470
make the world a better place.
Make the world a little better place.

1346
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:29.010
That sounds like a big deal.
It sounds like a big deal,
but yeah.

1347
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:33.420
Is it really that big of a deal?
Well,
I'm not talking about you personally.

1348
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:36.110
You got to individually go out and change the whole world.
Right.

1349
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.650
In a way that everyone can see right now.
I had a conversation with,

1350
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:44.300
who was I talking to?
Someone was asking me,
it might've been Pete,

1351
01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.960
it might've been Pete up in origin,
but I mean Peter Roberts,

1352
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:53.240
it might've been him,
but somebody was asking me,
you know,
about,

1353
01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.070
you know,
coming up in the seal teams and when I decided to become an officer,

1354
01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:03.730
and I might've said this before on here,
I don't know,
but you know,

1355
01:31:03.731 --> 01:31:06.770
I had a platoon commander that was a prior list guy and he was awesome and we

1356
01:31:06.771 --> 01:31:10.220
all loved him.
And when you're in a sealable and that's the whole world,

1357
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:14.210
that's the whole world is a seal platoon,
that's the whole world.

1358
01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:19.370
And we had this awesome officer and this is the time when we had a mutiny and

1359
01:31:19.371 --> 01:31:19.731
all that.

1360
01:31:19.731 --> 01:31:22.100
And so we got rid of our bad officer and we got this good officer came in and it

1361
01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:24.710
just made our,
our lives awesome.
Our lives were awesome.

1362
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.240
And so I said to myself,
the back of my mind,

1363
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.300
subconsciously kind of remotely conscious,
I dunno,

1364
01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.870
but I realized that this guy made our lives awesome.
You made our world awesome.

1365
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:38.890
And I said to myself,
somewhere in the back,

1366
01:31:38.891 --> 01:31:43.250
the little barely formed human brain of mine.

1367
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:45.080
I said to myself,
you know what,

1368
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.500
someday this guy has made the our lives for us.

1369
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:52.860
16 guys in this seal platoon,

1370
01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:57.940
our lives are awesome now and someday I'm going to try and make life good for 16

1371
01:31:58.161 --> 01:32:00.130
guys in a seal.
That was my goal.

1372
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:05.020
<v 2>Hmm.
Yeah.
And for that world,
so,
so when I say,</v>

1373
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:07.490
hey,
make the world a better place,
but what can you,

1374
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.430
who could you make the world a better place for it?
Because you actually can't.

1375
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:15.670
You actually can't tell you whether it's some kid down the street,

1376
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:20.440
whether it's somebody that needs help out there,
whether it's your own kid,

1377
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:22.580
how can you make the world a better place?
Because you can't.

1378
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:27.460
What can you do to make it a little bit better starts?
You know what?

1379
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:30.310
It starts with making yourself a little bit better.
Get yourself stable.

1380
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:31.570
I'll tell you that.
You know,

1381
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:34.410
it's like the oxygen mask that dropped down in the aircraft.

1382
01:32:34.411 --> 01:32:38.260
You got to get yourself squared away first.
Once you get yourself squared away,

1383
01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:43.150
add them.
Somebody asked me the other day like,
I'm bored,
what should I do?

1384
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.060
And I was like,
Oh,
if you're board,
that means you got room,
you've got capacity,

1385
01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:47.410
you can go help people.

1386
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.360
And you know how they say like helping others is like the ultimate like reward

1387
01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:55.931
people.

1388
01:32:55.931 --> 01:33:00.790
They say that I think even before you square yourself away,

1389
01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:04.360
eat,
eat.
It's harder to make that connection I think.
Yes.

1390
01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:06.360
Because you're still struggling yourself.
Yeah.

1391
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.380
It was Kinda like us when you plant the seed,

1392
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:13.020
it's like the seed got to grow into a thing about ground first then yeah,
sorta,

1393
01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:17.980
sorry kind of way.
But the more squared away like you get,

1394
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.150
not only the more capable you are of helping others more effectively,

1395
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:24.490
but the more you can make that connection like,
oh,

1396
01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:28.890
this reward is like way better than when I achieved the mice thing.
Right.

1397
01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:33.040
You know?
That's why a lot of people like if they really love what they do,

1398
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:35.230
I'm not saying everybody,
but a lot of people want,
they love what they do,

1399
01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:39.370
but they're kind of like out of the the game,
they'll teach others how to do it.

1400
01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.970
It's just like a natural progression.
That is a natural progression.
That's true.

1401
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.250
Look at Jujitsu.
Yeah.
You become a,
you become a world champion in Jujitsu.

1402
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.093
That's great.

1403
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:53.380
But then eventually a lot of those guys become instructors and they have teams

1404
01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:57.290
and that's what they want to do is spread the word and like you,

1405
01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.920
you'd see these guys who had like big,

1406
01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:03.850
big temp careers and stuff on a high level and they're teaching.

1407
01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:07.000
You see how happy they are teaching others like Blake,
Bob Ballou,

1408
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:10.890
I don't seem like a random example,
but he popped in my head cause I,

1409
01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:14.470
I've been to his class and he's teaching the kids everything men.
I'm like,

1410
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.980
this guy's like really engaged with this.
You know,
I,
I'll tell you right now,

1411
01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:18.700
my last,

1412
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.050
and I knew I was like my last few years in the navy where I was running the

1413
01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:27.940
training and I was really teaching all the time.
Like that was so good for me.

1414
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:31.870
I mean,
um,
oh gosh.
It was so gratifying.
Yeah.
That's it.

1415
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:33.820
Can I get to see the light?
I get to see people learn.

1416
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:37.900
I get to see people to make,
make the world good for someone.

1417
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.950
You know,
these,
these three guys that figured something out,
it's like,
yeah man,

1418
01:34:41.951 --> 01:34:46.120
you're,
you're a leader.
You and that's,
that's good stuff.
So yeah,

1419
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:49.280
when I talk about that sounds so a trite,

1420
01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:55.210
you make the world a better place.
Yeah.
So how could I say that better?
Hey Man,

1421
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:58.700
fix something.
Helps.
Just pick something around you.

1422
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.710
Make your world a better place.
That's what I should say.

1423
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:04.160
Make your world or make someone else's world.
Just make it a little bit better.

1424
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:07.070
Yeah.
You can have that capability to believe it or not.

1425
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.950
And regardless of who that someone,

1426
01:35:09.951 --> 01:35:13.760
is that someone that someone is you too,
by the way,

1427
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:18.350
actually you first or it could just be you.
Because if you make your,

1428
01:35:18.351 --> 01:35:20.800
it's like if you have a neighborhood right,
and the neighborhood,
I,

1429
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:21.220
you know how they,

1430
01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.450
you know how hot your lawn and you clean up your thing and you're get that

1431
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:26.180
squared away at south and everyone,

1432
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:29.900
let's say there's 10 houses in a neighborhood,
small neighborhood,
whatever,

1433
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.800
10 houses,
you cut your lawn,
you do your hedges,
you paint your house,

1434
01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:37.130
make sure there's no trash in the yard or whatever.

1435
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.900
You've improved that whole neighborhood by one 10th alone,

1436
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.930
let alone everybody else.
Don't even think about it.

1437
01:35:43.931 --> 01:35:48.530
Anybody that's one 10th it's a lot insane.
So play that concept.
There you go.

1438
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.270
That's what you do.
Boom.
There you go.
And I like it.

1439
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:56.030
So staying on the path that is help us,
help us.

1440
01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.110
That's what I said.
Actually I help us.
Can you tell us how to,

1441
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:04.130
can you help us?
Help us?
Yes,
I do.

1442
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:07.430
So yes,
be happy to.

1443
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:10.250
So first thing obviously we were talking about you just do not obviously,

1444
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:11.650
but we're going to talk about Jujitsu.

1445
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.480
I think it is actually obvious at this point.
Yes it is.

1446
01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:19.310
How many people tweet me a day or messaged me that they took their first Jujitsu

1447
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:20.960
class,
helped me a lot.

1448
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.760
I didn't know how for you people means like three sometimes.
Yeah,

1449
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:28.710
sometimes you're like,
well people have been asking for whatever.
Sure.

1450
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:32.120
But sometimes that really means three people from,
no,
I'm talking on a daily,

1451
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:35.720
daily basis.
Daily basis,
sir.
I would say,

1452
01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.700
I dunno,
I dunno.
Maybe three to five people a day.
A day.
Daily.
That's a lot.

1453
01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:45.770
Yeah.
Maybe it's over exaggerated in my head though.
You know what?

1454
01:36:45.771 --> 01:36:49.430
I don't think so because every single time I go on Twitter,

1455
01:36:49.431 --> 01:36:52.310
which is pretty much every day pretty much,

1456
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.750
there's at least one person in,
you know the,
the alerts,
right?

1457
01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:03.390
That I'm like copied in or whatever and it'll say got my first Jujitsu class or

1458
01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:08.870
got beat up and in this is every single time.
Like I literally cannot remember.

1459
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:13.880
People are getting on the Jujitsu train.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yes.

1460
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:17.300
So let's talk about kind of obvious that we're going to talk about Jujitsu a

1461
01:37:17.301 --> 01:37:19.070
little bit.
You know what else is good?

1462
01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:24.080
Very few people say I tried.
You did too.

1463
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:27.500
I just don't like it.
Yeah,
it's not for me.
That's very,
I've actually,

1464
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:29.330
I can only think of off the top of my head.

1465
01:37:29.331 --> 01:37:34.130
One individual out of all those people that like went back and forth with me and

1466
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:37.550
it was just like,
look,
I do not like this.
I think this is the guy that I said,

1467
01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:41.090
look,
you need to train until you submit someone.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1468
01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.990
Then you can stop.

1469
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.420
If you can submit someone and you're like okay I don't like this.

1470
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.480
It's pretty hard to understand.

1471
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:51.450
It's truly not actually tapped someone out.
Yeah.

1472
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:56.400
Then yeah.
Yeah.
But it's not for you.

1473
01:37:56.550 --> 01:38:00.290
But I bet you even that person,
once they got that our block,
they were like

1474
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:07.230
yeah I would that my money would be on that scenario.

1475
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:09.720
Talked a little bit of Claustrophobia,
right.

1476
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:13.380
And I know you're over it could,
could,

1477
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:16.830
could that alone stop someone from wanting to train Jiu Jitsu.

1478
01:38:16.831 --> 01:38:21.450
Cause I had one guy in a seal platoon with me that he would get so acoustic

1479
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.650
train with everyone and when I would train with him he would get so freaked out.

1480
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:29.720
Like he would start like,
like getting actually mad at me,
you know,

1481
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:34.110
you know that.
And of course what did I do?

1482
01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:39.170
Yeah.
I would just side control.

1483
01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:43.530
Just smashed close as I could squeeze,

1484
01:38:43.531 --> 01:38:46.590
just smash try.
And you know what though?

1485
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:49.860
It's trying to help us try to make this world a better place by getting him over

1486
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:54.330
that fear exposure or their exposure situation.
Yes.
The answer's yes.

1487
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.550
I think that because claustrophobia is like,
like for real claustrophobia,

1488
01:38:58.570 --> 01:38:59.281
not just like,

1489
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:02.580
well I'm uncomfortable if you have a for real costs of will it be in,

1490
01:39:02.581 --> 01:39:06.270
it's a spectrum.
Some people have it worse than others,
but yeah,

1491
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:10.410
if they have maybe somebody on the hardcore claustrophobia spectrum and then

1492
01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:15.390
they got introduced to it early on and someone that was like a Smasher,

1493
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:17.570
right?
Yeah.
Because you wouldn't feel claustrophobic.

1494
01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:22.820
You if you were going with someone that's got like an open butterfly slash lasso

1495
01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.450
guard.
Yes.

1496
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:29.130
You're not feeling very claustrophobic and con that triangle then all sudden you

1497
01:39:29.131 --> 01:39:32.670
freaking out and then you tap and you're out the place where you really feel

1498
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:35.750
claustrophobic.
It's cross side or mount mount or,
yeah.
So,

1499
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.220
and it's not even necessarily a smasher per se,
cause Jujitsu,

1500
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:43.590
you can be mounted just normal mountain,
not smashing pressure,
whatever.

1501
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:47.400
Just normal mount because it's not like it's cause claustrophobia psychological.

1502
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:49.860
It's not like a physical thing.
Primary.

1503
01:39:49.861 --> 01:39:53.550
I mean there's physical elements for sure.
Of course it has to be.
But um,

1504
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:58.350
if you just feel like you can't get out or you can't breathe or,
you know,

1505
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:01.590
it's like that's the feeling.
But so like a lot of times,

1506
01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:05.340
even even when I was working through mine and you'd be like smashing me all hard

1507
01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:06.690
and be like bright,
you're wasting your energy.

1508
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:09.990
The smashing doesn't do it when we're rolling and it's quiet.

1509
01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:12.360
Especially when you're like,
oh,
I,
when I know you're doing it on purpose,

1510
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:15.720
it helps.
It helps me because it seems like a game.

1511
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.050
Like you're just messing with me now.
So it's like,
but if it's seriously,

1512
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:20.760
if we're just rolling,
we're not saying anything.

1513
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.930
And it's like now I'm faced with either staying in this position right now

1514
01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:27.960
forever cause I can't get out.
I can't get out of your sight control right now.

1515
01:40:27.961 --> 01:40:32.730
Like history has proven to be kind of thing in my brain.
He's still either I,

1516
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:36.780
I suck it up indefinitely or I tap out.

1517
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.950
Both of those to me are death like to tap out because you're tired or

1518
01:40:40.951 --> 01:40:44.190
claustrophobia.
Like that's worse than tapping out from a submission.

1519
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:48.690
So that's why a lot of the times you would claustrophobia me into giving me,

1520
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.690
giving you my arm or something like that.
And then I'd have to tap it.

1521
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:53.850
That's how it went.
And then,
so,
which is,
I think you,

1522
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.490
I think you tapped two times from just straight claustrophobia because you

1523
01:40:57.491 --> 01:41:01.150
didn't freaking take,
it's a mission.
I was giving that and that's terrible.

1524
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:05.140
And I remember like I was about to be let down at myself as you were saying all

1525
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:07.900
this,
I was kind of disappointed in myself that I did identify that,

1526
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:11.950
that there was a further torture.
I could've been doing to you,

1527
01:41:11.951 --> 01:41:16.410
but it looks like sometimes I did figure it out.
Yeah.
So you know,
you did,

1528
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:18.491
I remember hearing,

1529
01:41:18.491 --> 01:41:22.090
I remember one time not to go too deep into this because I want to tell you a

1530
01:41:22.091 --> 01:41:22.924
lot about origin.

1531
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:27.930
So there's this one time where I forget if I rolled with you like that day or

1532
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:31.990
the day it was really recently a ruled with you and I was feeling claustrophobia

1533
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:36.370
and you know I gave you my arm and then you took it.
And I was like,
yes.

1534
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.850
Like I was happy that he tapped me out in letting me out of there.

1535
01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.460
Cause it's like,
it's really bad when you,
when you feel that.

1536
01:41:42.461 --> 01:41:47.461
So the next day I see you rolling with Dean and dean gets you in double snowing.

1537
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:51.280
Right?
And you guys were rolling hard for a long time and I'm like,
Dang,

1538
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:53.820
these guys are going hard.
I W I would be,
and I'm kind of empathy,

1539
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:56.560
not empathizing,
you know,
when you put yourself in the other person's situation.

1540
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.170
So I'm like,
Hey,
I'm thinking to myself,
man,

1541
01:41:59.171 --> 01:42:02.050
these guys are quite hard for a long time.
I would be guessing right now.

1542
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.860
And then dean was like,
he,
he got,

1543
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:06.310
he was getting kind of getting the better you got mountain.
I was,
I'd be like,

1544
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.000
I'm,
I'm feeling for docker right now cause I've,

1545
01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:11.500
I've been in that scenario where it's like we're going hard and then I wind up

1546
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:13.750
in Mount,
I'd be like,
man,
I'm feeling like,

1547
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.610
like Brian like breaths just by watching and then he gets you in double snow

1548
01:42:18.611 --> 01:42:19.660
angel.
I'm like,
I,

1549
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.010
I was getting like micro anxiety on the double snow angel that Dean is doing on

1550
01:42:24.011 --> 01:42:28.150
you cause that's claustrophobia right there like this.
You can do it,

1551
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:31.740
you can't move.
What was my reaction?
She just powered through it.

1552
01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:33.190
Like you didn't even,

1553
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:36.820
I don't think even tapped but he will use it like that for like a long time.

1554
01:42:36.821 --> 01:42:38.890
And I was like,
I was like this guys are different.

1555
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.600
Another level savage and I'm not saying necessarily with the grappling,

1556
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:45.730
I mean that was sort of like it,
you know,
that was a side thing.

1557
01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:49.110
Just the fact that you can endure what I just witnessed you endure and compare

1558
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.400
it to my own shit.
I was like,
man,

1559
01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.110
nonetheless answers what happened the next day?
What do you mean?

1560
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:59.290
Was there a follow on where I rolled with you again or is that the story?

1561
01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.600
What I was comparing it to,

1562
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:04.840
what was helping me really get into your shoes is because I was remembering,

1563
01:43:04.841 --> 01:43:09.100
it could have been that same day that we rolled and I just gave into the classic

1564
01:43:09.101 --> 01:43:12.190
phobia.
Like it was like I had an issue,
I was like in terrible shape.

1565
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:17.110
I would go train like twice a week maybe,
you know,

1566
01:43:17.111 --> 01:43:21.400
and not,
it was bad.
It was just a bad scenario.
But nonetheless,
yes,

1567
01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.840
the answer's yes.
If someone gets into Jujitsu and they um,

1568
01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:29.880
they have a claustrophobic preexisting conditions thing and then they get into

1569
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:33.580
claustrophobia situation early on,
like the first or second day or something.

1570
01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:37.940
Yeah,
I could see how they wouldn't want to go back.
I don't know.

1571
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.880
But here's the good thing about that.

1572
01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.350
If you do Jujitsu and reap the payoffs of Jujitsu and then you,

1573
01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.540
then you get into claustrophobia situation,

1574
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:50.980
you're more worried about like how can I overcome the claustrophobia more.
So,

1575
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:54.050
Hey,
Jujitsu produces too much claustrophobia for me.
You know what I mean?

1576
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:56.360
Because you know the benefits and fuel,

1577
01:43:56.361 --> 01:44:01.361
like the payoff of the Jujitsu way more than you care about or fear cost of

1578
01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:05.960
phobia.
That's my,
that's my analysis anyway.
So speaking of Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,
yeah,

1579
01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:08.870
you're going to need a geek so you get an origin g that's it.
Straight up there.

1580
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:12.230
It is answered your question because plenty people,

1581
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:16.640
plenty people still ask me what gate again?
Origin,
gay boy.

1582
01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:20.780
You know why it's because people start at podcast one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I dig it.

1583
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:25.700
And so there while they get them by podcasts,
you know,
I as asking people at,

1584
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:26.563
at the camp,

1585
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:32.110
I was asking people what broke you like cause cause people get meaning,

1586
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:34.710
they're listening to the podcast and they're like,
wow,
they're talking about to,

1587
01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.130
and now while they're talking about,
but then there'll be like,

1588
01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.030
there'll be argued you when you were talking on podcast 23,
you were like,

1589
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:43.240
there's nothing else I can,
I was like,
okay,
I'm going to try it.

1590
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:46.130
So there's certain podcasts that people go,
all right,
screw it.

1591
01:44:46.131 --> 01:44:47.060
I'm just going to do this.

1592
01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:53.110
And I think you posted something on social media the other day that said that

1593
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.910
you're,
if you're a white belt,

1594
01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.940
you already have achieved more than 99% of people in the world because how many

1595
01:45:01.281 --> 01:45:04.970
people actually less than 1% of the people in the world do Jujitsu for sure.

1596
01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.680
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Fully.
And um,
uh,
yeah,
I repost it.

1597
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:12.320
I retweeted it from Joey Silvester.
Uh,
he,

1598
01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.250
and I think he even retweet it from somebody because it's so true.
Like,

1599
01:45:16.570 --> 01:45:20.480
and the reason I re posted it is of course for new new people,
you know,

1600
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:22.340
coming in.
But that's a good reminder.

1601
01:45:22.341 --> 01:45:25.220
It was a good reminder for me for every cause.
I think it's a good room for,

1602
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:28.760
for everybody because you know that feeling like you don't want,
people are like,

1603
01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:32.050
man I ain't for everybody in everything.
Not just Jujitsu.
Yeah.

1604
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:35.990
Cause there's other stuff that you should be doing that you might not be doing

1605
01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.070
because you're like,

1606
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:40.010
oh well I don't want us to cross the line or I don't want to take the first
step.

1607
01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.750
Yeah.
You know,
they don't want to take the first step.

1608
01:45:41.751 --> 01:45:44.780
Taking the first step is always big.
Wrote about that.

1609
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:49.400
But even like taking,
so yeah,
again,
there's two,
two elements to that.

1610
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:50.181
Taking the first step.

1611
01:45:50.181 --> 01:45:53.030
Meaning if you're not in Jujitsu and you take that first step to go to Jujitsu,

1612
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.920
right.
There's that.
And then

1613
01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:00.410
to me it was like when you get your ass kicked,
you know,
like even even you,

1614
01:46:00.411 --> 01:46:04.970
how you say like sometimes I'll just get my ass kicked.
Some people,

1615
01:46:04.971 --> 01:46:07.280
no matter what level they're,
or they'll be like,
oh man,
you know,
they'll say,

1616
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:09.230
oh man,
I got my ass kicked but I'm ready.
You know what?

1617
01:46:09.231 --> 01:46:11.360
I'm coming back and I liked it and all this stuff.
And the,

1618
01:46:11.361 --> 01:46:13.670
and then they'll ask when,
when do,

1619
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.990
when do I not feel so awkward and when do I not feel like I don't know what I'm

1620
01:46:17.991 --> 01:46:21.290
doing?
I'm like,
well do it all.
You always feel like that.

1621
01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:24.500
You just feel like that little bit less every,
every year,
whatever.

1622
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.480
And so,

1623
01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.870
and sometimes you can be at a high level and feel like that more often than not

1624
01:46:29.871 --> 01:46:32.990
still,
you know,
cause it just depends on the training partners,
all that stuff.

1625
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:36.620
So I thought that that was a really good reminder.
It's like being there.

1626
01:46:36.621 --> 01:46:41.300
It's like super important.
Yeah.
And it's like really beneficial and also as the,

1627
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:43.130
to take the first step,
if you're out there,

1628
01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.420
let this be the podcast number one 43 that you said,
you know what man,

1629
01:46:47.421 --> 01:46:50.730
I've heard enough talk about this.
I'm going to go some.
Yeah.
Today's the day.

1630
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:51.600
Today's the day.

1631
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.950
There's plenty of Jujitsu schools out there and most of them are good.
You know,

1632
01:46:55.951 --> 01:46:58.950
which one makes or not,
which one,
but when,

1633
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:03.480
this is what makes me like want to just go train right now is anytime you go

1634
01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:07.710
into one of your spiels about how it's a superpower,
it's absolutely true.

1635
01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:10.250
That's why.
Yeah.
I was telling call it like when were,

1636
01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:13.560
we were waiting earlier today,
my cousin called he um,

1637
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:15.960
how when you start Jujitsu,

1638
01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:20.730
like you could do Jujitsu for one year and right then at that point you can,

1639
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:24.420
you can beat up everyone else who doesn't play.
It doesn't do Jujitsu like in a,

1640
01:47:24.421 --> 01:47:28.400
just in a general way.
It's teaching,
you know,
like that.
Yeah.

1641
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:31.560
Roughly speaking there and there are exceptions for sure.
But you know,

1642
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:35.100
like there's not many things in the world that are like,
that are like that,

1643
01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.060
you know?
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's a superpower.
Yeah.

1644
01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.030
So every time I listened to you say that kind of thing and do your little

1645
01:47:42.031 --> 01:47:44.790
explanation,
that's like,
yeah,
man,
that's true.

1646
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:48.960
Cause it Kinda puts it into people bring their kids in here.
I tell them,

1647
01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.970
I was telling this family this the other day.
I said,
I said,
I,

1648
01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:56.970
I truly believe that Jujitsu is the best thing you can give your kid,

1649
01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.010
including love

1650
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:06.300
that part out too.
So yeah,
I think it's very important.

1651
01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.000
All right,
so you can get your geese from origin,

1652
01:48:09.001 --> 01:48:12.450
main.com [inaudible] dot com made in Maine.

1653
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.720
That's why its origin main.com and they're made there and they're made

1654
01:48:18.181 --> 01:48:22.500
specifically for Jujitsu.
The weave is for Jujitsu.

1655
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.640
The fabric is for Jujitsu.
The cut is for Jujitsu.

1656
01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:31.780
Know made by people that do Jujitsu by black belts in Jiu Jitsu designed by

1657
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:39.000
people that train.
Yeah.
People that are black belts.
Dead Deco.

1658
01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:39.930
Yup.

1659
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:44.930
Peter Roberts in there with scissors cutting these.

1660
01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.610
Yeah,
sure.
Scissors.
Yeah.
I haven't really seen any scissors,

1661
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:53.440
but you know,
I've seen those little,
what do you call them?
The little soft thing.

1662
01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:56.400
You know when you make the original patterns you've got to use scissors.

1663
01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:00.080
Brah I don't know that kinds of do that kind of stuff.
I know now though.

1664
01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:03.390
I know not and that's good.
So yeah,
scissors a saw,
all that stuff.

1665
01:49:03.391 --> 01:49:07.290
All made in America.
If you're trained to Nogi rash,
the rash guards,

1666
01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:12.540
it's 100% and they're also made here in America,
in America,

1667
01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:13.440
which is a big deal.

1668
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:18.030
And if you're doing other exercise outside of Jujitsu,

1669
01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.170
got joggers,

1670
01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:22.530
if you're jogging or if you're just cruising whatever and hoodies and you know,

1671
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:27.360
shirts,
whatnot,
apparel,
apparel,
origin,
main.com.
All made in America,
by the way.

1672
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:31.890
Also supplements,
Jocko supplements.
Yeah.
Joint Warfare.

1673
01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.340
Now people have been asking me joint warfare or Krill oil.
Yeah,

1674
01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:42.390
good question.
By the way,
it's a good question.
Um,
I think Brian,

1675
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:45.600
I asked him the same question because I have a hard time answering it.

1676
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:48.010
The reason I have a hard time answering this because I do both all the

1677
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.010
<v 0>time and I'm not stopping anyone from as an experiment.
I'm not doing that.</v>

1678
01:49:51.130 --> 01:49:54.460
It's not worth it.
It's not worth it to be,
there's no logical reason for it.

1679
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:56.980
But what he said,
and I kind of agree with this,

1680
01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:02.440
it makes sense if you are doing preventative Krill oil,

1681
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.480
if you're doing,
he'll joint warfare.
Yeah.

1682
01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.210
Good way to put it.
You know,

1683
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.920
my recommendation kind of as like a dual both take them both,
but um,

1684
01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.300
that sounds like a good idea.
So if you have,

1685
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:21.090
if your joints are like just started bothering you or you got the elbows

1686
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.720
bothering you,
your shoulder's bothering you.

1687
01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:26.780
I think shoulders for me is the one that I always notice.
Um,
yeah.

1688
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:31.990
Then if it's hurt,
get on,
get on some joint warfare.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's a good,

1689
01:50:31.991 --> 01:50:36.640
and I say both because it's,
the way I would see it in put it in,

1690
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:40.600
this is just kind of the way I see it,
where it's like a 80,
20,
you know,

1691
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:44.130
it's not like,
oh,
joint warfare is 100% for healing up and recovery.

1692
01:50:44.150 --> 01:50:48.910
And I actually don't think that at all.
But yeah,
I just,

1693
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:52.360
and the other,
oh wow.
I Dunno.
Yeah,
that's what Brian said.

1694
01:50:52.361 --> 01:50:57.280
I'm putting it out there.
I'm not,
I would,
yeah.
I,
I obviously recommend both,

1695
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:58.150
but you know,

1696
01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:00.340
somebody speak that costs a lot of money and some of some people are like,

1697
01:51:00.341 --> 01:51:02.170
you know what,
I can only afford one.
Cool.

1698
01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:07.120
I take Krill oil because that's all encompassing health,

1699
01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:10.420
right?
Yeah.
Whereas joints like,
yeah.

1700
01:51:10.421 --> 01:51:13.900
When your joints start getting jacked up a little bit.
Yeah.
Which by the way,

1701
01:51:13.901 --> 01:51:16.630
if you're doing Jujitsu,
you're going to feel it.
You're going to feel Jujitsu.

1702
01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:21.330
Jujitsu is not a sport that you don't feel you,

1703
01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:24.040
you will feel who feel it.
Yeah,
that's true.

1704
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:28.600
But they're both good hundred percent and then you got milk milk.

1705
01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.710
So I'm,
I'm,
I'm envisioning a world one day,

1706
01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:37.630
cause I was in the traveling yesterday.
Horrible.
And Man,

1707
01:51:37.631 --> 01:51:39.940
I got like a chocolate milk,
like a regular chocolate milk,

1708
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:44.350
which is just awful crap.
And it doesn't even taste as good.
It doesn't taste,

1709
01:51:44.351 --> 01:51:46.150
you get used to the milk.
That's what it was.

1710
01:51:46.210 --> 01:51:51.210
But still objectively it does not taste as good and it's unhealthy.

1711
01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.040
Yeah.
So one day,

1712
01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.340
one day in this world,

1713
01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:02.080
you'll be able to go to the little shop in the airport,

1714
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.960
the seven 11 and you'll just be able to walk in.

1715
01:52:04.961 --> 01:52:07.960
They'll have a little counter from Olc,
they'll have a little moke situation.

1716
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:13.060
They will cause,
how can they not do that?
I mean eventually,
right?
No,

1717
01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:14.200
I mean eventually you fast forward,

1718
01:52:14.201 --> 01:52:15.820
I don't know if it's going to take two years or four years,

1719
01:52:15.821 --> 01:52:19.210
but eventually so many people are going to demand it.
Yup.

1720
01:52:20.110 --> 01:52:22.900
Oh yeah.
There's going to be more restaurants.

1721
01:52:22.930 --> 01:52:25.090
There just can be different flavors.
It was just going to go,

1722
01:52:25.130 --> 01:52:28.480
they're like little mock bars,
bars,
but they won't even have food.

1723
01:52:28.481 --> 01:52:29.730
They'll just have multiple Malkia.

1724
01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:33.030
You know how they have tequila bars right though the same thing.

1725
01:52:33.090 --> 01:52:37.780
But moke Moke on tap.
Yeah.
That sounds like a good idea.
Um,
you know,

1726
01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:41.230
I have that dream too,
you know,
and um,
until then,
yeah,

1727
01:52:41.231 --> 01:52:44.650
you can get it at [inaudible] dot com but also discipline too,

1728
01:52:44.651 --> 01:52:45.980
if you want to get your mind right.

1729
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.610
<v 2>You know that expression get your mind right.
Not to say your mind is not right.</v>

1730
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:50.270
I'm saying no,

1731
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:53.360
don't give any of the most fired up I've ever heard a guy tell me about getting

1732
01:52:53.361 --> 01:52:57.470
his mind right.
I was up at Yosemite and this guy,

1733
01:52:57.471 --> 01:53:01.250
I was coming out from a hike from a pretty good high couple of days out in the,

1734
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:06.290
and there was a guy and he was,
he was in the middle of the river,

1735
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.970
like sitting on a rock just to calm river,
not like know.

1736
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:12.260
He's sitting on the rock and we stopped there.

1737
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:17.240
I think we jumped in and you know,
he saw me and he was all,
he immediately,

1738
01:53:17.241 --> 01:53:21.200
you know,
I could tell he was in the game and he comes over and he was like,

1739
01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:23.830
I said,
hey man,
you know,
he said,
Oh man,
I list your podcast role.

1740
01:53:23.890 --> 01:53:24.681
We were listening to all the way,

1741
01:53:24.681 --> 01:53:26.900
he was with one of his buddies and we would listen to all the way up here.

1742
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:30.050
We just drove six hours to get up here to just listen to whatever it was,

1743
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.650
48 and 49 back to back.
I was like,

1744
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:37.320
Oh man,
that's awesome.
He said,
what are you doing up here?

1745
01:53:37.321 --> 01:53:40.160
Do you climb it and you guys are going to go hiking?
He goes,
no man.

1746
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.970
I just came up here to get my mind right and I was like,

1747
01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.900
I don't even know what that means.
I guess I do know what it means.
Again,

1748
01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.650
I kind of go up there and get your mind right.
Do you get,

1749
01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:54.830
and if you want supplementation for doing that discipline,
boom,

1750
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:58.980
pretty mission mine,
your mind literally will get your mind right?
Yeah.

1751
01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.790
Pretty mission kits.
Your,
that's a positive thing,
right?
Yeah.

1752
01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.860
That's the origin main.com.
Yeah.
That's where you get it.

1753
01:54:07.210 --> 01:54:11.120
Also support yourself.
You want to represent Jaquis store.

1754
01:54:11.121 --> 01:54:12.410
It's called Jocko stores.

1755
01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:16.950
You go to Jocko store.com so he can represent huge time.
Huge name,

1756
01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.640
represent a lot of people representing and this is one of those things.

1757
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:24.770
So basically this is where you get shirts and hoodies and hats,
rash guards,

1758
01:54:25.190 --> 01:54:27.550
trucker hats.
By the way,
I don't have to get flex.

1759
01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.090
You don't have if you don't want to,

1760
01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:33.500
if you prefer keeping it old school like we used to do it.

1761
01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:40.070
I'm trying,
I think I've worn trucker hats before on a regular basis.

1762
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.200
I never saw him on hat until like three minutes ago.

1763
01:54:42.201 --> 01:54:45.950
When you put one on momentarily and I looked up and I though Scott disturbed.

1764
01:54:45.951 --> 01:54:46.311
Yeah,

1765
01:54:46.311 --> 01:54:51.311
well it's been literally like like 15 years before since I've,

1766
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:53.660
and your head doesn't get a beat down by the sun.

1767
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.400
Well I'm very brown and I'm from quiet so I think I'm used to that one.

1768
01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:00.950
Actually.
No,
to answer your question,
yes.

1769
01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:03.080
Sometimes if I hang in the sun for a long time,

1770
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:05.720
did you want to hat you don't pull it off.
Maybe Straw hat,

1771
01:55:06.210 --> 01:55:09.290
something coconut,
coconut leaf

1772
01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:15.500
nonetheless when you're representing Jocko shirts,

1773
01:55:15.501 --> 01:55:19.280
when I see people representing in the wild who made that up in the wild with

1774
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:21.290
that?
You said that or something you think someone else said that?

1775
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.510
I don't know but I definitely,

1776
01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:25.580
I think I might've said it cause I think the first,

1777
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:30.080
no I did say it because I remember I hadn't seen one in the wild and that's

1778
01:55:30.081 --> 01:55:32.570
something I'd be like,
I never saw a trooper in the wild.

1779
01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:36.290
And then eventually I did and now then I was in the airport yesterday I saw like

1780
01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:38.240
seven people.
They weren't wearing shirts,

1781
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:42.890
but they were all coming up and being like,
Hey,
what's up?
So people were fired,

1782
01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:47.670
you know?
Yeah.
But yeah,
it's good.
Go there,
get something.
Uh,
you know,

1783
01:55:47.671 --> 01:55:50.970
if you want to represent and represent in the wild,
boom,

1784
01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:53.700
plenty equals freedom as where,
as that anyway.
Yeah.

1785
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:57.010
Jocko store adopting a new discipline equals freedom shirts.
Yes.
It's,

1786
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:59.340
it's a little bit cooler in my opinion.

1787
01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.890
Might be biased because I sort of had some influence.
I influenced that.
Well,

1788
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:09.570
no one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was good.
You're good design you when you,

1789
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:13.180
when I told you,
hey,
make equals smaller.
Yeah.

1790
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.270
And I could see in your mind you were thinking is off balance,
off balance,

1791
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:19.830
physically,
physically,

1792
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.960
letters and then I gave you the idea of hey,

1793
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.030
no,
you put two lines.
It's an equal sign.
There's layers and here you got all ex,

1794
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:34.710
it was like a done deal and your mind nirvana had been achieved with some new t

1795
01:56:34.711 --> 01:56:38.760
shirts.
It did click because,

1796
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:42.890
and I saw why you wanted the equals small.
Yeah,
because that's the main thing.

1797
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:47.880
The main thing
nonetheless.
Anyway,
Jocko,

1798
01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:51.310
store.com if you want to referee games,
the main thing to represent.
Yeah,

1799
01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:56.160
not the equals equals this.
It's,
it's all equal,
but it's not the main thing.

1800
01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:59.850
Yeah.
All right.
There you go.
So Chuck,
we'll solve that problem.

1801
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:04.290
Not that it was a problem,
but you know,
he,
he,
he influenced with his improvement.

1802
01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:08.790
Yeah.
Somebody out there,
it's like,
no,
I liked the equal Spain.

1803
01:57:08.791 --> 01:57:11.580
Bigger echo shirt was better equality.
Boom.

1804
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:15.300
They liked the discipline.
They liked the freedom,
they liked the freedom.

1805
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:18.780
Doesn't muscle as a discipline and vice versa.
It was kind of the deal.

1806
01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.040
That's the deal.
And I dig it.

1807
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:23.250
They're gonna have to keep with their old school shirt.
Represent,

1808
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:26.130
get another way.
Yeah,
whatever man.
All good.
All good.

1809
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.590
Also good way to stay on the path.

1810
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:33.030
The current path is to subscribe to this podcast if you have not already.

1811
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:37.980
That includes a youtube.
So that's the video version.
So yeah,

1812
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:41.550
if you're on the podcast platforms,
apps,
whatever,

1813
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:43.920
where you've listened to your podcasts meant subscribe,

1814
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:45.180
leave a review if you feel like,

1815
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:47.940
and also don't forget about the warrior kid podcast,

1816
01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:53.280
which we just released 17 and 18 and 18 all at the same time.

1817
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:56.640
And I apologize that those,
uh,
took a little while to get out.

1818
01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:58.890
And My,

1819
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:04.130
when I came down from my garage gym this morning got done with some,

1820
01:58:05.590 --> 01:58:10.290
I squatted today and I haven't been able to squat heavy.
I did not,
not like,

1821
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.090
no,
not heavy.
Actually straight up not have because I have,

1822
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:20.270
I had back to back tweak knee or tweaked back and then tweak me.

1823
01:58:20.341 --> 01:58:25.170
So I just haven't been able to give him
and today I just wear a man.

1824
01:58:25.530 --> 01:58:30.030
I couldn't believe squatting is hard.
Yes.
Like if you're not used to it,

1825
01:58:30.031 --> 01:58:32.940
which I'm not right now.
Yeah.
And I,
and believe me during the,

1826
01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:36.960
even when my back was tweaked and my knee was tweaking,
I'm still doing pistols,

1827
01:58:36.961 --> 01:58:38.190
I'm still doing box jumps.

1828
01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:42.250
I'm still doing burpees and lunges and even a little candle bell,

1829
01:58:42.251 --> 01:58:44.800
like type little,
you know,
movements.

1830
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:49.510
So it's not like my legs are just sitting there atrophying on a couch.
No,

1831
01:58:49.511 --> 01:58:54.410
they're still in the game over here.
But man,
I just racked up.
I you,

1832
01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.450
you asked me what happened.
No,

1833
01:58:55.451 --> 01:58:58.630
I did two 25 I did like a few sets of two 25 and I was like,

1834
01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:03.040
and I was doing some stuff in between but still I couldn't believe that I,
yeah.

1835
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:07.330
So my point is if you can squat,
squat,
if you can squat,

1836
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:11.290
get squat,
get it on because that just makes you stronger,
tougher.

1837
01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.960
You do have that.
It might even make you smarter as far as

1838
01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:19.060
I read it.
Actually I think about it.
I'd read something about the,

1839
01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:23.020
the neuro tropic release that happens when you squat,

1840
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:24.670
your body gets better.

1841
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:28.210
Well that's exercise and resistance exercises and you don't actually,

1842
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:30.670
a lot of kind of exercise in general kind of squatting.

1843
01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.410
You're using like a lot of it does more.
It's true.
It ups your testosterone.

1844
01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:37.960
There you go.
Because,
and here's why.
Basically cause it's a huge muscle group.

1845
01:59:37.961 --> 01:59:40.570
That's why,
and it's not just one muscle group.

1846
01:59:40.571 --> 01:59:42.250
Cause when you're squatting you're actually using,

1847
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:45.800
I think when you're squatting you're using so many muscles.
Yeah,

1848
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:49.280
makes all kinds of core stabilizers and stuff like that.

1849
01:59:49.290 --> 01:59:54.040
Mentioned the biggest muscles in your body and with basically all your big

1850
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:55.330
muscles,
all of them.

1851
01:59:55.331 --> 01:59:58.330
Not just one big one and then a bunch of small ones like you know most of your

1852
01:59:58.331 --> 02:00:00.770
buddy.
That's kind of how it is.
You know you're,
you're using your,

1853
02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.800
your shoulders and then you're trying to help.

1854
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:07.000
Then you tell the other day they had one dose else.

1855
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:12.610
That's dope.
I was like Oh okay.
Yeah.

1856
02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:17.110
Everyone should have,
if you're,
if you have a hotel,
if you're a hotel owner,

1857
02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:20.530
get some condos in there,
get some condos and you don't even have to get,

1858
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:24.070
you can get,
cause they normally stop at 50s if you get,

1859
02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:29.980
let's just say 50s if you just get a set of 70s and I set a hundos we'll be

1860
02:00:29.981 --> 02:00:33.370
good.
We'll be good worldwide.
The whole world will be happy.

1861
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:36.790
You'll be especially happy cause I know you liked them.
Gumbo.
You were saying,

1862
02:00:36.791 --> 02:00:41.170
you know,
we were all fired up the other day talking about dumbbells
dumbbell.

1863
02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.620
Well it could because it's a fun exercise.

1864
02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:46.510
There's more to it than just getting under the bench for example,

1865
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:49.090
and pushing the bench.
You know,
it's,

1866
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:51.430
I mean this is what it a little bit more in a than that when you get into it.

1867
02:00:51.431 --> 02:00:53.860
But dumbbells like you got it,
okay,
you got to pick those guys up,

1868
02:00:53.890 --> 02:00:57.060
one in each hand and then you got to balance them on your knees and then you've

1869
02:00:57.061 --> 02:00:59.330
got to get him up there into position.
It's like a whole,
right.

1870
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.850
There is a whole thing.
Exactly right.

1871
02:01:00.851 --> 02:01:02.740
And that's not to mention the strength you got to have to push up.

1872
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:05.820
So you know when you get kind of good at them and you do them a lot,
it,

1873
02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:10.450
it does become kind of fun check.
There you go.
Boom.
Nonetheless.

1874
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:13.690
I Dunno how he started talking about the unbuilt.
Well Jocko was squatting,

1875
02:01:13.691 --> 02:01:18.160
his legs are sore,
all this stuff.
And then,
and then warrior kid podcast.

1876
02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:21.410
How did that lead to it?
I don't know.
But you know,
every,
that's how you,

1877
02:01:21.590 --> 02:01:24.010
because when I came home,
oh yeah.
Because,
oh,
this was going to say,

1878
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:28.150
my wife was listening to the warrior kid podcast this morning when I came down

1879
02:01:28.151 --> 02:01:33.010
from the,
from the gym and she was all smiles.
And she's like,
Oh,

1880
02:01:33.011 --> 02:01:37.030
if this story's very good darling,
cause I tell the little uncle Jake story here,

1881
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:40.700
you know,
and she starts naming the people.
She's like,
oh,
is this this person?

1882
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.620
Because the stories that Uncle Jake tells,
there's,

1883
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:49.770
they're not,
they're not,
uh,
what's there not nonfiction stories,
right?
Like,

1884
02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:54.230
but there's the basis I,
the story comes in some way.
Yes.
Yeah.

1885
02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:56.270
That's what is it based on a true story?
Well,

1886
02:01:56.271 --> 02:02:00.880
there's based and then there's inspired by,
they're probably,
well,

1887
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:03.620
which one is the less true inspired by Ge.
So I,

1888
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:07.640
they're inspired by inspired by true events,
but they're not,

1889
02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.660
they're not based on,
although the one that just came out,

1890
02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:15.140
me being out in a rowboat in the middle of a lake and the oars fall through the

1891
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:19.280
warlocks that happened,
I guess what?
I had no life jacket.
Is that smart?
No.

1892
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:22.970
So kids got to learn about that.
Be Prepared,
be prepared,
don't,

1893
02:02:22.971 --> 02:02:26.270
don't take little shortcuts.
Agree.
Anyways,

1894
02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:29.210
that's a warrior kid podcast.
Good.
You can,
you can listen to those.

1895
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:33.770
And you talked about youtube.
Yeah.
If you're on the youtube channel,

1896
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:35.570
Echo has put puts out,

1897
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:41.270
he puts out videos and their enhanced,
we'll say yeah,

1898
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:42.050
they're enhance.

1899
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:45.290
Also just the regular video version of the podcast and little excerpts that are

1900
02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:47.600
not enhanced through just chopped up for consumption.

1901
02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:51.140
I think we should have more of those too,
by the way.
I put one up today.

1902
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:57.170
We'll do that every day.
I think.
Good,
appropriate.
We'll say appropriate.

1903
02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.690
Yeah.
You might have to edit a more.
The one,

1904
02:02:59.691 --> 02:03:01.460
I think the one that was the one that you put up today,

1905
02:03:01.461 --> 02:03:04.220
like 10 minutes or 11 minutes long.
I forget.
Too Long.

1906
02:03:05.090 --> 02:03:09.920
It was how to stay in shape when you travel.
Yeah.
So it should be like this.

1907
02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:13.130
How to stay in shape when you travel,
do burpees and your hotel room gets on.

1908
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:18.980
I think people need more information on that.
Also.

1909
02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:21.310
Hey Warrior kids speaking to where your kids get the uh,

1910
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:25.820
go to Irish oaks ranch.com we got young aid in the warrior kid and he's making

1911
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:29.900
soap.
You've got his own business.
He's got his own business.

1912
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:33.140
I think he just turned 13 and what a couple months ago.

1913
02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:38.240
And he's got his own business.
He's got income,
he's got expenses,

1914
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.810
he's got production,
he's got a production line.

1915
02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:46.370
And that knowledge is that very legit.
And it's not like,
Hey,
I dig it man.

1916
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:48.950
When you sell lemonade,
we used to sell bananas when I was little.

1917
02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:53.420
We would go in the backyard
and we go on the side of her.
We stop every car.

1918
02:03:53.421 --> 02:03:56.190
It's a small road.
It's not the freeway or nothing.
We stop every car with eight.

1919
02:03:56.191 --> 02:03:59.060
We got Bananas.
$1 for one banana,
which I know is kind of expensive,

1920
02:03:59.061 --> 02:04:02.360
but $1 for one banana or $5 for a banana,

1921
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:05.690
a bag of bananas for,
I think there's like,
I don't know,

1922
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.790
eight or 10 bananas in there.
So you know the whole deal.
Yeah,

1923
02:04:08.110 --> 02:04:10.940
we'll make some money.
I dig it,
but let's face it,

1924
02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:14.840
you can give bananas literally on the side of the road anyway.
So they're like,

1925
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:18.290
all right,
well by just being cool.
Yeah,
they're being cool.

1926
02:04:18.291 --> 02:04:19.760
But my little daughter,

1927
02:04:19.761 --> 02:04:22.460
she'd be out in front of my house selling a piece of rock selling.

1928
02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:26.870
Know she had to sound all kind of people buy it.
She cute,
she's cute.
And they go,

1929
02:04:26.871 --> 02:04:27.704
Oh yeah,
here you go.

1930
02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:33.400
Would you like to buy a rock star to come from over there in the dirt?

1931
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:37.020
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
We'll give you $3 for it.
The young lady.
Thank you.
Exactly.

1932
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:40.260
So that's what you pulled with the bananas.
Yeah.
More or less.
I mean,

1933
02:04:40.261 --> 02:04:43.170
maybe a little bit more value than a rock,
but it's still,
yes,

1934
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.340
you go over here,
Irish oaks ranch.
This soap is like legit.
So yeah.
Yeah,

1935
02:04:50.341 --> 02:04:52.350
for sure.
I'd say it's not like a novelty.

1936
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:57.180
So it's like for real soap that you used.
Yeah,

1937
02:04:57.450 --> 02:05:01.380
for sure.
And it's a kid making it.
Yeah,
that's it.
That's the impressive part.

1938
02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:04.080
These and he's making it from goat milk,

1939
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.450
so it's not like he's making these pouring like some,
he's milking a goat,
right?

1940
02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:12.070
Smoking smokiness,
goat milk to make the soap.
This is the whole thing.
Yeah.

1941
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:15.700
It's not like it was going on the Internet to the Maaco soap.com and then they

1942
02:05:15.730 --> 02:05:18.330
go in and they send you the ingredients and then you pour them into a thing and

1943
02:05:18.331 --> 02:05:22.460
you got soap.
No,
he's milking it.
By the way,
he's raising the goat.

1944
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:27.440
The goat.
The goat doesn't just like,
there's not alive.

1945
02:05:27.450 --> 02:05:28.890
It's not them mechanical goat.

1946
02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:33.510
It's a living code at an Asian America made in America to have absolutely made

1947
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:36.400
it,
so yeah,
it goes deep man ranch,

1948
02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:40.710
the.com stay clean.
He also got psychological warfare.

1949
02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.850
If you need a little little get some.
Yeah,
you can throw that.

1950
02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:47.970
You get it free your alarm clock if you need it for your alarm clock if you need

1951
02:05:47.971 --> 02:05:50.130
it.
If you have a little trouble getting up out of bed in the morning,

1952
02:05:50.230 --> 02:05:54.240
use it for your long comp,
but give your significant other,
most likely your wife.

1953
02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:57.480
Give her a heads up that there's going to be a random dude in the bedroom in the

1954
02:05:57.481 --> 02:06:01.590
morning talking to you so doesn't surprise her and scare her and make her hate

1955
02:06:01.591 --> 02:06:04.980
you.
That's psychological warfare.
Itunes,
Google play,

1956
02:06:04.981 --> 02:06:06.480
and we're coming out with a second one.
We're going to try.

1957
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:07.920
I'm going to try and get that done by Christmas.

1958
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:11.100
Can we've done by Christmas you think?
I think so,
yeah.
Okay,
cool.

1959
02:06:11.610 --> 02:06:15.420
We're doing shopping,
shopping,
compulsive shopping.

1960
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:20.760
Somebody wants smoking and how many people we can do it.
Yes,
yes.

1961
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.970
Okay.
I'll try smoke.
I'll think about smoking.
I don't,

1962
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:27.340
I've never smoked so it's a little hard for me to relate to.
Right,
right.

1963
02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:30.710
But I may do just a straight up addiction addiction.
Yeah.

1964
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.990
What are you addicted to?
Because everybody is addicted to something.
You know,

1965
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:38.100
some people are addicted to cocaine,
some people are addicted to alcohol,

1966
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:42.480
some people are addicted to sugar,
some people are addicted to drama.

1967
02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:46.290
That's what I was going to say.
Yeah.
People are addicted to drama,

1968
02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:48.990
so maybe we'll do one about that.
But yeah,

1969
02:06:48.991 --> 02:06:52.560
that's psychological warfare and can get on iTunes,

1970
02:06:52.990 --> 02:06:57.360
Google play and all that stuff.
What is psychological warfare?
No.
Well,

1971
02:06:57.361 --> 02:06:58.680
if he hit a moment of weakness,

1972
02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.980
boldness into psychological warfare and get you past it,
that's what it is.
Boom.

1973
02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:06.810
Also speaking of weakness and your workouts,
workout weakness,
real weakness,

1974
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:10.830
physical weakness,
whatever.
Anyway,
you hit a plateau in your workout.

1975
02:07:10.831 --> 02:07:13.050
Get some new equipment.
That's what I did.
I got written,

1976
02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:17.310
get it from on it on it.com/jocko I got rings and Kettlebells.

1977
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.780
Actually that was a long time ago.
Got The kettlebells,
but I'm glad I did.
Um,

1978
02:07:21.150 --> 02:07:24.140
again,
the rings,
battle ropes,
like stuff,
you can vary it,

1979
02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:28.350
vary it up and create little challenges for yourself within the workout.

1980
02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:29.820
I know that's what kind of what it worked out is,

1981
02:07:29.821 --> 02:07:33.690
but you don't want it gets mundane
ETF.
Actually,

1982
02:07:33.691 --> 02:07:37.130
I think you do know when it gets because for you it is mundane.
You just,
yeah,

1983
02:07:37.131 --> 02:07:40.740
I think that's part of your challenge.
I think that's your challenge.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1984
02:07:40.741 --> 02:07:44.320
You exercise workouts a lot more than you think.
I do.
Yeah.

1985
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:48.460
Sometimes I do squats and then sometimes I do front squats.

1986
02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:54.790
Well,
there you go.
You heard it here first folks,
like I said,

1987
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:57.460
[inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible] and then you get some tea.

1988
02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:01.360
A lot of people been asking where to get the cans,

1989
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:03.580
the ready to drink RTD.

1990
02:08:03.581 --> 02:08:07.120
That's a thing that you start learning when you like get into this kind of
thing.

1991
02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:10.180
What to like the industry terminology.

1992
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:12.580
Rtd ready to drink.

1993
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:17.650
So if you want Jocko white tea in a can,
this is another thing.

1994
02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.580
One day in the world it's going to be like,
Hey,
I'm driving out of a long drive.

1995
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:24.370
I'm going to stop at this seven 11 here.
I'm going to go in there.

1996
02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:29.371
They're going to have job instead of having to get a horrible chemical filled,

1997
02:08:29.471 --> 02:08:34.471
crappy sugar psycho drink and I'm going to get something that is literally good

1998
02:08:35.051 --> 02:08:38.120
for me.
Yup.
Jocko white tea.
Huh?

1999
02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:43.030
And then that's what's going to happen.
But until then it's on Amazon.

2000
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:47.530
It's on Amazon prime.
Why is that?
Because freaking it weighs a lot.

2001
02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.650
So to save money for you on the shipping,

2002
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:54.310
you can get the Amazon prime and it just comes to your house and it's awesome.

2003
02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:58.720
And the obvious benefit and everyone you know,
knows already,

2004
02:08:58.721 --> 02:09:00.310
is that once you drink Jocko white tea,

2005
02:09:00.311 --> 02:09:02.800
you can dead lift a minimum of 8,000 pounds,

2006
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:07.810
including Jordan Peterson who overcame his plateau of 7,000 pounds.

2007
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:12.770
That's good.
I'm self right up there to 8,000 pounds.
Got Some books too.

2008
02:09:13.330 --> 02:09:16.060
Books where the word kid can't marks mission Mark's mission.

2009
02:09:16.061 --> 02:09:20.170
Did the second one and then weigh the word kid.
Mark's mission.

2010
02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:23.560
I told you I read this to my daughter every night,
right?
Yes.

2011
02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.510
Now will every he was being,

2012
02:09:25.511 --> 02:09:28.060
when I said it right every night it's like pretty much every night.

2013
02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:30.040
See what I'm saying?
We do other quizzes and stuff,

2014
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:34.660
but now she's in kindergarten now and now there's a thing where they require,

2015
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.310
they don't require but certainly recommend per night.
So I did,

2016
02:09:39.311 --> 02:09:43.030
I just do one chapter a night,
boom,
boom,
boom.
And she got so into,

2017
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:44.830
she's into this second one a lot.

2018
02:09:44.831 --> 02:09:48.440
A lot more because I mean not that she wasn't because the first one,

2019
02:09:48.441 --> 02:09:50.950
that's kind of the ethos now cause I read it more than once to her.

2020
02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.500
So maybe that has a lot to do.
Yeah,
you might go.

2021
02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.420
Yeah she's into the new one because it's new.

2022
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:58.840
At some point you're gonna go back to the original one and she's going to start

2023
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:00.310
me.

2024
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:03.910
Even like me when I read like I was reading about face the other night for the

2025
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.410
47000th time and you're like you just get more stuff out of it.

2026
02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:13.720
And I think those books,
those warrior could books.
That's what's going to happen.

2027
02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:16.030
Like when she turns six she's gonna read it again.

2028
02:10:16.031 --> 02:10:17.320
When she turned seven she's going to be like,

2029
02:10:17.321 --> 02:10:19.390
Oh yeah I'm going to get discipline equals freedom.

2030
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:20.620
I just know what that means right now.

2031
02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:25.600
But when she's eight she's going to figure that out.
Yeah.
Nathan James.

2032
02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:29.250
Yeah.
This makes it extra funny cause I know who Nathan James Is.

2033
02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.160
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

2034
02:10:30.161 --> 02:10:35.161
I know that they are funny where she really like anytime he comes up,

2035
02:10:35.781 --> 02:10:37.850
cause you know how it kind of each chapter it goes back and forth.

2036
02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:40.310
One is like him at camp and what happened then the other one is like him

2037
02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:43.220
starting business and went back to camp and doing so it's like that.
Right?

2038
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:46.550
So every time we go back to Nathan James,
she perks up like what's over there.

2039
02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:51.080
And so we're at the part where uh,
you know how he's doing recon,
right?

2040
02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:55.040
It's finding out finding out about Nathan James and she's finding out that part

2041
02:10:55.041 --> 02:10:55.970
and then like she's really,

2042
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:58.070
cause we tell her that we used to tell her that all the time.

2043
02:10:58.071 --> 02:11:00.380
Not Everybody has a TV in their room.

2044
02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:03.260
Not everybody has like all this Xyz good stuff and whatever.

2045
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:04.790
So she really like it.

2046
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:08.570
It was like she was familiar with the concept so she really just attached to it.

2047
02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:09.801
But yeah,

2048
02:11:09.801 --> 02:11:12.650
for some reason I don't know because I make my voice like how you make your

2049
02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:15.080
voice on there for when I make Nathan James the wayside.

2050
02:11:15.090 --> 02:11:19.790
I think that's part of it to do.
I do Nathan,
James and the audio.
No,
but no,
no,
no,

2051
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:23.380
no,
no.
When you,
you know how you make your voice when you imitate some,

2052
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:27.860
some Dork or whatever,
you know.
No,
I know,

2053
02:11:27.861 --> 02:11:30.230
but I make my voice like Nathan James.
Good.

2054
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.340
I tried to make him sound annoying because he's annoying what I'm saying.
Okay.

2055
02:11:34.610 --> 02:11:39.500
But yeah.
Anyway,
it's a very dealt with both of James on the podcast.

2056
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:45.110
Can't wait,
fired up.
He was down here.
But um,

2057
02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.890
I was like,
Hey,
are we going to do this?
And he was just busy and he goes,
well,

2058
02:11:47.891 --> 02:11:52.550
let's wait until I get this thing taken care of and then we'll do it.
And I said,

2059
02:11:52.551 --> 02:11:54.270
cool man.
So we're going to do it.

2060
02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.400
Nathan James also discipline equals freedom field manual best kind of manual

2061
02:12:00.711 --> 02:12:05.240
there is by the way,
a field manual.
That's my opinion.
This is how to,
you know,

2062
02:12:05.241 --> 02:12:09.350
how you have a basic structure slash backbone and just how to be,
you know,
what,

2063
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:12.800
you know what word you're looking for,
what operating system.
Operating system.

2064
02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:18.140
Yup.
Perfect.
Perfect word.
Actually.
Um,
that's your,
so it's like boom.
Urien it.

2065
02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:19.490
Cool.
I've got a general thing,

2066
02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:22.910
but you can kind of have it to refer to every once in a while.

2067
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:26.730
It's pretty cool to get feedback on that book.
Yeah.

2068
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:31.990
And have people that get completely on the path from that book and then more

2069
02:12:34.941 --> 02:12:37.520
important they stay on the path from that book.

2070
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:42.080
Is it possible that a book has that much of an impact?
The answer's yes.

2071
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:43.760
And it seems weird to say that.

2072
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:46.330
I mean it does and it seems weird for me to say that,
but there's,

2073
02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.470
that is 100% true.
It's 100% true.
Yeah.
And I'll tell you what,
I mean,
do you,

2074
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.910
do you read it?
Yeah.
I mean I know.
Yes.
So I mean,
so I was going to say,

2075
02:12:55.911 --> 02:12:57.140
it may not make sense for you,

2076
02:12:57.141 --> 02:13:00.070
but it will make perfect sense to you where you know,

2077
02:13:00.071 --> 02:13:02.150
how like there's a lot of good books out there.

2078
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:04.610
He told her like good books and there,
you know,

2079
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.980
but you read them and they're kind of long and they have the,
you know,

2080
02:13:06.981 --> 02:13:10.220
they're real laid out very well and there's like they go into detail,

2081
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:12.620
which is good.
That's kind of what a good book Kinda does.
Right.

2082
02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:16.970
This one kind of violates that rule in a way cause it's super basic.

2083
02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:18.740
But that's why in my opinion,

2084
02:13:18.741 --> 02:13:21.350
like when I go back to it I can just go back to it and boom.

2085
02:13:21.351 --> 02:13:24.980
It's all like in there.
I don't have to read like 10 or 20 or 30 pages.

2086
02:13:26.090 --> 02:13:31.030
Yeah.
You know,
so it's like the fundamental first Ron in your face.
Yeah.

2087
02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:32.243
Good reminder.

2088
02:13:32.630 --> 02:13:37.630
<v 0>You got extreme ownership for combat leadership principles that you can use in</v>

2089
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:39.660
your business in life.

2090
02:13:39.661 --> 02:13:43.650
Written mud be and my brother Leif Babin and we have a followup to that book

2091
02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:48.390
coming out.
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.
You need to,

2092
02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:52.230
if you want to get first edition,
which,
which you do,
hey,

2093
02:13:52.231 --> 02:13:57.231
somebody at camp gave me a first edition of Ernie piles.

2094
02:13:58.291 --> 02:14:02.640
Book brave men first edition.

2095
02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:07.020
Yeah.
How awesome is that?
So that feeling that,
that,

2096
02:14:07.021 --> 02:14:11.190
that feeling right there of like I got the first edition of this book,

2097
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:16.350
brave men,
that's the one where he's talking about the rumbling coming in.

2098
02:14:16.351 --> 02:14:18.900
That noise is building and he doesn't know what it is and he looks up in the sky

2099
02:14:18.901 --> 02:14:23.760
and he's like,
it was that.
I have these,
probably one of my favorite quotes

2100
02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:28.890
and I have the first,
a dish of that book now.

2101
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:33.360
So dichotomy of leadership.
Of course.
What's the publisher doing?

2102
02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.080
Cutting corners.
Hey,
we can get away.
Oh yeah,
they're being considered.

2103
02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:38.730
And of course they're going to do that.

2104
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:42.000
They're going to do that because that's just what they do.
That's what they're,

2105
02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.440
they're gamblers.
They,

2106
02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:47.040
they make their little predictions and that's what they get.

2107
02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:49.890
That's what they're doing.
They'd rather,
they'd rather,

2108
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:53.220
they'd rather actually underestimate,

2109
02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:56.580
ha have a little demand for the book and have a little spike in a little buzz

2110
02:14:56.581 --> 02:14:57.860
about that.
So they,

2111
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.190
they would rather there be less first edition or rather have more people walking

2112
02:15:02.191 --> 02:15:04.980
around with the fourth edition.
That's all lame.

2113
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:10.350
So anyways,
yeah,
dichotomy,
leadership coming out.

2114
02:15:10.710 --> 02:15:13.680
September 25th if you want to get on that thing,

2115
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:16.380
you can preorder it wherever you preorder books,

2116
02:15:16.381 --> 02:15:21.381
you can preorder it and then got a leadership consulting company called Echelon

2117
02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:25.140
Front where we solve problems through leadership.

2118
02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.550
What kind of problems?
All of them.

2119
02:15:29.850 --> 02:15:32.730
Because every problem that you have inside your organization as a leadership

2120
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:35.010
problem,
I'm here to tell you straight up factually,

2121
02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:37.320
no matter what the problem is,
it's a leadership problem.

2122
02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:39.840
And I know that might hurt because guess who the leader is.

2123
02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:42.390
You're the leader or your subordinate leaders.

2124
02:15:42.391 --> 02:15:44.070
They're not doing what they're supposed to do.

2125
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:46.680
You need to get them on board with the program.

2126
02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:51.030
You're not making the the bottom line.
Guess what?

2127
02:15:51.031 --> 02:15:53.070
Guess what kind of problem that is not a money problem.

2128
02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:56.640
It's a leadership problem.
Productions not meeting its quota.

2129
02:15:58.050 --> 02:16:00.090
Is that a production problem?
It's a leadership problem.

2130
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:03.780
So no matter what problems you're having in your organization,

2131
02:16:04.110 --> 02:16:08.670
they get solved through leadership.
It's me,
it's Lafe.
It's JP,

2132
02:16:08.730 --> 02:16:11.430
Dave Flynn and Mike.

2133
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:15.060
And if you want us to come and work with your company,

2134
02:16:15.061 --> 02:16:16.800
don't call a speaking agency,

2135
02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:22.460
just go to echelon front.com and we will show up and crush,

2136
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:24.713
um,

2137
02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:29.930
muster zero zero six might be sold out by the time this gets released.

2138
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.020
<v 2>But if you want to come,</v>

2139
02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:36.580
we talk leadership intensely and granularly for two days.

2140
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:39.070
It's in San Francisco,
October 17th and 18th.

2141
02:16:39.071 --> 02:16:41.410
You can register for that extreme ownership.com

2142
02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:46.840
same with the roll call.
Yeah,

2143
02:16:47.130 --> 02:16:51.850
I think we're done talking about the roll call roll call is when this podcast

2144
02:16:51.851 --> 02:16:53.500
comes out.
I don't think there'll be any more seats.

2145
02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:57.490
So for the muster and the rule,
this is the first roll call.
So I don't know,

2146
02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.310
but for the muster,
what percentage of,

2147
02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:03.100
let's say your typical group of people that come and whatever,

2148
02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:06.370
what's the percentage of appeal wise?

2149
02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.390
What's the percentage of just so there's information perfect.
You know,

2150
02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:16.250
good guidance.
And then there's just to hang like let's,
you know,

2151
02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:18.220
like if you look at the days,

2152
02:17:18.250 --> 02:17:23.250
the days we go from eight in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon and

2153
02:17:23.261 --> 02:17:25.050
on the first day and,

2154
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:30.270
and then the second day we go eight in the morning until three o'clock in the

2155
02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:35.491
afternoon or maybe two 30 and to answer your question,

2156
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.420
we start,
we muster with everyone at four 45 in the morning.

2157
02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:42.230
So we that whole time the,

2158
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.490
and then when we get done at five we hang out until nine or 10 that nights.

2159
02:17:46.630 --> 02:17:49.480
And then the next day,
same thing for 45 in the morning.

2160
02:17:49.481 --> 02:17:52.360
And then we go to Jujitsu at night.
And so yeah,

2161
02:17:52.361 --> 02:17:56.860
I mean were there the whole time yet you will 100% hang out?
Yeah,

2162
02:17:56.861 --> 02:17:59.920
that's what I mean.
All of us.
That's your question.
Yeah.

2163
02:17:59.921 --> 02:18:04.921
A percentage of you hanging out and is 100% yeah,

2164
02:18:05.411 --> 02:18:07.870
that's part of the appeal,
right?
Because how you say,
yeah,

2165
02:18:07.871 --> 02:18:11.920
we must wait for 45 but one could think from the outside,
hey that's a workout,

2166
02:18:11.921 --> 02:18:13.780
but here's the thing.
Yeah,
it's a workout,

2167
02:18:13.781 --> 02:18:18.070
but it's kind of fun just talking trash and you know,
afterwards we kind of,

2168
02:18:18.071 --> 02:18:22.140
you know,
and it's kind of a hang until it starts at eight and then beat,

2169
02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:25.180
you know the,
the,
the breaks that you take or whatever.
It's like,
oh yeah,

2170
02:18:25.181 --> 02:18:28.660
you're kind of having ups takes a break.
Yeah.
You guys,
we don't take breaks.

2171
02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:33.790
We just answer questions to,
we talked to people,
we take pictures,

2172
02:18:33.791 --> 02:18:36.010
signed books,
whatever,
the whole time.

2173
02:18:36.011 --> 02:18:37.810
And that kind of happens throughout the whole time.

2174
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:40.570
And then after it's sorta wraps,
it's a pain in my side too.

2175
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:43.900
I've painted the whole team into a coral O'Malley.
Totally did.

2176
02:18:43.901 --> 02:18:46.660
Cause it'll be getting,
I was like,
look,
they're not going to be any green room.

2177
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:49.180
We're not going backstage.
We're going to be out there the whole time.

2178
02:18:49.181 --> 02:18:52.030
So guess what we do?
There is no green room.
There's no backstage.

2179
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:53.200
We're out there the whole time.

2180
02:18:53.470 --> 02:18:58.470
It's like two 20 hour days is what it is because four hours we get some sleep.

2181
02:18:58.810 --> 02:19:01.960
They were like,
yeah,
Oh yeah,
you don't want a green room.
Okay,
now you can't have,

2182
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.550
yeah,
exactly.
That's how it goes down
on top of that.

2183
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:09.550
I like I said roll call,
we're pretty much done with number one.

2184
02:19:10.090 --> 02:19:13.630
You can check and see if there's any openings but it's probably not looking

2185
02:19:13.631 --> 02:19:14.464
great right now.

2186
02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:19.000
Maybe we can open up a couple more seats anyways for that as well.

2187
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:23.500
register@extremeownership.com and now of course we have f Overwatch.

2188
02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.280
We're connecting
SPEC OPS and combat

2189
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.970
<v 0>aviation leaders to companies that need leaders.
People are asking,
um,</v>

2190
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:36.710
you know what,
what about guys from conventional forces,

2191
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:41.450
which the reason we started with combat aviation in Spec ops cause that's where

2192
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:42.284
we came from.

2193
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:45.890
And so that's where we have community ties now that we actually have,

2194
02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:48.710
we actually have some people coming on the team right now from conventional

2195
02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:51.080
forces that we work with alongside awesome leaders.

2196
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:55.370
And so we're looking at how we're going to open this up to the rest of the

2197
02:19:55.371 --> 02:19:59.390
military and get everyone else engaged.
Cause guess what?

2198
02:19:59.391 --> 02:20:00.920
We work the civilian sector all the time.

2199
02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.190
I just said problems get solved by leadership.
Civilian companies.

2200
02:20:04.191 --> 02:20:08.280
Guess what they need?
They need leaders and the military housing.
So that's work.

2201
02:20:08.281 --> 02:20:11.540
And if you want to enroll in that from either side,

2202
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:14.540
from either a person that wants a job or a person that's looking for leaders,

2203
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.490
go to over overwatch.com

2204
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:23.050
and until we do see you at one of these events or see you in the airport or see

2205
02:20:24.291 --> 02:20:26.570
you on the Jujitsu Mat or see you wherever,

2206
02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:30.230
if you want to interact or give us answers or give us questions,

2207
02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:34.520
you can do that on the inner webs.
We are on Twitter,

2208
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:38.270
we're on the Instagram and we're also on Facebook.
Keep both.

2209
02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:43.970
Echo is an echo.
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2210
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:49.000
And finally to those of you who like Peter Nash Swisher who served in the

2211
02:20:52.521 --> 02:20:56.510
military or you are serving in the military at this time,

2212
02:20:57.380 --> 02:20:59.900
thank you for your service.

2213
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:03.830
And for those that protect us here at home and the police and law enforcement

2214
02:21:03.831 --> 02:21:07.070
and correctional officers and firefighters and border patrol and paramedics and

2215
02:21:07.310 --> 02:21:08.930
all other first responders.

2216
02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:13.160
Thank you for what you do day in and day out and to everyone else,

2217
02:21:13.161 --> 02:21:15.620
making your way through the world,

2218
02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:20.990
working and grinding and building and creating.

2219
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:24.860
That's awesome.
And keep doing those things

2220
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:31.520
and do those things with some intent,
some good intent.

2221
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:34.940
The intent to make yourself better.

2222
02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:37.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2223
02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:41.260
<v 0>And when you've got yourself on a good path,</v>

2224
02:21:41.410 --> 02:21:45.610
then show someone else the path.
Help them off that slippery slope.

2225
02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:48.153
<v 1>Help them</v>

2226
02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.220
<v 0>cause in another time and another place.
It could be you that needs help.</v>

2227
02:21:56.750 --> 02:22:01.750
So take the world or that little part of the world that you can take it into

2228
02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:06.890
your trembling hand and help

2229
02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:12.140
help yourself become better.
Help others become better.

2230
02:22:13.310 --> 02:22:14.390
And in doing so,

2231
02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:16.653
<v 1>help this</v>

2232
02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.680
<v 0>strange and often hostile world that we live in.</v>

2233
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:26.220
Make it just a little bit better by getting out there

2234
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:31.740
and getting after it.
And until next time,

2235
02:22:32.490 --> 02:22:36.180
this is echo and Jocko out.
