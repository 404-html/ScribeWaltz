00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.050
This is Jocko podcast number one 38 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.230
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening,

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.010
sir.
The young seal whispered in a faint voice.

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.350
Come here.
Our hands were clasped in handshake,

5
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.280
not a formal handshake like two businessmen,

6
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.410
but palm to palm with thumbs wrapped around the back of the hand like an arm

7
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.100
wrestling contest.
I handshake of brotherhood.

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.990
The young seal was feeling the morphine.
I saw his eyes,

9
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.680
but he was still there.
Still conscious and aware

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.570
he was everything.
A young man should be smart,
brave,

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.230
athletic,
funny,
loyal,
and tough.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.850
<v 0>He had been shot in the leg about a half an hour before.</v>

14
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.190
<v 0>I found out later that Mikey Monsoor,</v>

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.370
a young seal machine gunner had run out into heavy enemy gunfire and drag this

17
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.600
seal out of a war torn street in the Malawi district in the city of Ramadi,

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.500
the violent heart of the insurgency in Iraq.

19
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.440
You're wounded.
Seal now,
lay on a Gurney and Charlie med,

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.940
the Camp Ramadi field hospital where u s military surgical teams worked

21
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:34.260
furiously to save the lives of gravely wounded troops almost every day.

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.553
<v 0>The bullet,</v>

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.040
a mammoth armor piercing 7.62 by 54 millimeter round with a steel core had

25
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.920
entered his leg at the lower thigh,

26
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
ripped apart flesh and bone inside his leg and exited in his upper thigh,

27
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.550
close to the groin.

28
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.770
It was hard to say if he would keep his leg

29
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.860
from the looks of the wound.
My guests was no,

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.643
he would lose it.

31
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.570
The wounded seals grip on my hand tightened and he pulled me in drawing me just

32
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.710
inches from his face.
I could tell he wanted to say something to me,

33
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
so I turned and put my ear to his next to his mouth.

34
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.350
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.790
<v 0>I wasn't sure what to expect.</v>

36
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.110
Was he scared or angry or depressed that he might lose his leg?

37
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.790
Was he nervous about what might happen next?
Was He confused?

38
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.550
He took a breath and then whispered,
sir,

39
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.110
let me stay.
Let me stay.

40
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.640
Please don't make me go home.
I'll do anything.
I'll sweep up around the camp.

41
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.280
I can heal here.
Please,
please,
please just let stay with the task unit.

42
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.490
There you go.
Not Scared,

43
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.300
not angry,
not depressed,
that he might lose his leg,

44
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.770
only concerned that he might have to leave our task unit

45
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.530
task unit bruiser our task unit,

46
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.090
our lives.

47
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.150
This seal was our first significant casualty.

48
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.230
We had had guys catch some frag on previous operations.

49
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.600
We had had some very close calls,

50
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.090
but this was the first seal wounded from task unit bruiser whose life would be

51
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.210
forever changed by a grave combat injury.

52
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.960
Even if he kept his leg,

53
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.370
the damage was so substantial that it didn't seem possible he would ever fully

54
00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:59.660
regain the extraordinary athleticism he had displayed previously

55
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.030
and yet this seal was only concerned that he would let me down,

56
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.490
that the task unit down,

57
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.420
let it debt his platoon and his team down.

58
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.290
This was a man.

59
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.770
This was a true friend,
a brother.

60
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.730
This was a hero,
young,
brave,

61
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.680
and without question,

62
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.510
more concerned for his friends than for his own life.

63
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.770
I was moved.

64
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.120
I felt tears welling up in my eyes.
I fought them back.

65
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.580
Then I swallowed the lump in my throat.

66
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.610
<v 0>This was no time to break down.</v>

68
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.430
I was supposed to be the leader

69
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.780
and he needed me to be strong.

70
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.833
<v 1>Oh.</v>

71
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.180
<v 0>And that right there is from the opening chapter of a book called the dichotomy</v>

72
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:27.450
of leadership,
which is actually a new book.

73
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.450
And it was written by me and my brother Leif Babin

74
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.630
and leaf has been on this podcast before.

75
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.060
We wrote extreme ownership together.

76
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.450
We obviously served in tasking at bruiser bruiser together

77
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.270
and he was on this podcasts.
He was the first guest.
He's the

78
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.860
been the guests most times he was on 11.

79
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:58.790
He was on 34 65 and one 14.

80
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.940
If you want to go get some background on life.

81
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.660
But I'm glad to say that he is actually vacuum.
Right.

82
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.350
<v 2>This again,
it's a Leif Babin welcome back.</v>

83
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.020
It's good to be back.
Thanks for having me.
Yeah,
right.
Oh Man.
And it's,

84
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.090
it's good to have you back because we're done writing and editing this book,

85
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.970
which feels good.
It does feel good.
It's been a lot of work,
but uh,

86
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.770
it's been awesome to it and being able to tell those kinds of stories like you

87
00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:33.390
just read.
And,
and even though I've,
I've read that now a hundred times,

88
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.620
it's just takes me immediately back to that situation.

89
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.220
And that's just a extraordinary,

90
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.720
we were able to work with some incredible,
incredible seals like,

91
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.110
like that young man.
Yup.

92
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.370
<v 0>No doubt about it.
The,
it's,</v>

93
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.940
it's weird when you're writing a book and you're,

94
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.840
and then you're rereading it and rereading and rereading it and like you said,

95
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:59.100
every time I would be reading these,
these sections,
you know,
you,

96
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.060
you just get that,
you just,
you just can't help but go back there.

97
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.730
You just can't help but go back there.
And this was definitely,
there were some,

98
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.250
there were some parts of this book that I was writing that were,
uh,

99
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.470
definitely hard to write and even hard to edit.
Um,
you know,

100
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.910
even this,
this being one of them.

101
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.980
And I'm glad that we're able to share the stories of,

102
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:24.610
of guys like that.
And that particular individual,

103
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.380
which I don't talk about this in the book,
but he,
he,
he kept his leg,
thank God.

104
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.470
And,
um,
he,

105
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.640
he kept getting after it for years and years and he kept training Jujitsu and

106
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:43.240
he's a total stud.
Maybe sometime he'll come on the podcast or who knows,

107
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420
but what a,
what a great guy.
Now you are,

108
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.670
you also kind of kicked off the book with what I thought was a,

109
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.650
was like a solid way to kick it off.
And you should,

110
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.660
you should go into that.
I know we were,

111
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.670
we were trying to pick out some good sections here,

112
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.040
but I thought the opener that you put in,

113
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.700
which you opened with a phrase that we've been using quite a bit lately,

114
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.280
but kickoff that,
that,

115
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.820
<v 2>that,
uh,
introduction to the book dichotomy leadership</v>

116
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.403
stand

117
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.340
by to get some said someone over the inner squad radio and the calm demeanor,

118
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:22.151
you might expect it,

119
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:25.960
but flight attendant telling airline passengers to stowed their tray tables for

120
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:30.961
landing the street in front of us had emptied of people like magic.

121
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.320
The local citizens at all suddenly disappeared.
And we knew what that meant.

122
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.360
Enemy attack was imminent.

123
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.820
The hair on the back of my neck stood at rigid attention after many of vicious

124
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:47.590
gunfight Ramadi standby to get some was a running joke that ease the tension

125
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:49.060
right when we knew trouble was coming.

126
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.920
The more nonchalantly it can be said under the direst of circumstances.

127
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.933
The funnier it

128
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.360
it was broad daylight is our patrol of seals and Iraqi soldiers made its way on

129
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:05.361
foot down the narrow city street bordered by high concrete walls on both sides.

130
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.980
Suddenly the world exploded.
Dozens of bullet snap to the air,

131
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.690
each with a sharp supersonic crack and smashed into the concrete wall next to me

132
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.290
with thunderous impact.
Shards of concrete flew everywhere.

133
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.910
The heavy volleys of incoming fire sounded like multiple jackhammers

134
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.630
simultaneously chewing up the street and the walls all around us.

135
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.520
We had walked right into an enemy.
Buzz saw in seargent.

136
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:35.580
Fighters hit us from multiple directions with belt fed machine guns.

137
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.120
I couldn't see them or where they were shooting from,
but the number,

138
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.720
the number of enemy bullets flying through the air around us was crazy.

139
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.460
There was no place to hide with high walls on both sides.

140
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.460
The narrow south central Amati street provided no cover.

141
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.770
The only thing between us and the enemy machine guns was a single part car on

142
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.491
the side of the road.

143
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:01.491
Some distance up the block and the typical trash stone about the patrol was in a

144
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:05.820
dual column formation.
Each column Split on opposite sides of the street.

145
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.380
How could close to the walls?

146
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.530
There was nothing to get behind the could protect us from bullets,

147
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.940
but we did have something on our side,
devastating firepower.

148
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.200
We fully expected a firefighter on every patrol and have this enemy hill

149
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:24.201
neighborhood and we rolled in heavy each squad of eight seals pack at least for

150
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.040
belt fed machine guns to suppress any enemy attack we encountered when we came

151
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:29.850
under fire.

152
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.050
Our immediate response with violent and overwhelming gunfire provided the only

153
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.000
answer cover and move.

154
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.800
Having learned to the humbling experience of months of urban combat task unit,

155
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:44.400
bruiser had had plenty of practice in this fundamental gun fighting principle

156
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.850
with a nanoseconds.
The seals with a big machine,

157
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.870
guns up front unleashed the most ruthless and lethal barrage of fire.

158
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:56.310
You could imagine despite the intensity and violence of the close urban combat,

159
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.840
I couldn't help but smile.

160
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.770
<v 0>Couldn't help with smile.
Yeah,
that's a,
we've said this before,</v>

161
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:06.230
but obviously guys that had been to a war,

162
00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:09.230
usually that's the best thing in their life and the best experiences they've had

163
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:14.170
in their lives.
And it gives you that,
that type of feeling right there of weak,

164
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.670
you can't help but smile.
And then,
you know,

165
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:18.620
as I just talked about and as we both know,

166
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:22.930
it's also the worst days of our lives are also there.
And we know that,
you know,

167
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.890
people are in the military,
all field,

168
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.480
most of them feel the same way that you have your best days and,

169
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.370
and your worst days there.

170
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.860
And it's interesting you cover and move.

171
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.790
It's just,
it always comes back to cover and move in these,

172
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.760
in these gun fights and you know,

173
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:44.710
a client we were working with recently and you know,

174
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.780
remember he switched around cover and move and made it yeah.

175
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.150
<v 2>Uh,
second</v>

176
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.630
<v 0>and put put simple first and it's like,
well,</v>

177
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:54.250
there's a reason that that exists that way.

178
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.450
Cover move is first because if you're not working together as a team,
there's no,

179
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.940
there's nothing to even keep simple that's not happening.
You just,

180
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.800
you need to start off with cover,
move.

181
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:08.190
Teamwork is critical and obviously we just read a couple of sort of a war story

182
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.000
ish type things,
but like extreme ownership.

183
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.770
This book's kind of set up the same way as extreme ownership.
I mean,
well not,

184
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.210
not kind of.
It is set up the same way as extreme ownership,

185
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.930
which is a story about combat that reveals a principal and then actually state

186
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:32.611
what the principal is and then we use a business example that shows how this

187
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:38.440
principle applies in civilian life and usually in the business world,
in fact,

188
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.050
always in the business world that's,
those are the examples that we use.

189
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.160
Although we could probably do another book that was about how these principles

190
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:50.161
apply to your under nine year old soccer team or your relationship with your

191
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:57.391
spouse or your relationship with your teenage daughters.

192
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.810
Two of them or your relationship with your teenage son,

193
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.220
one of them or your relationship with your nine year old daughter or your,

194
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.380
what do you got threes and fours,
a three.

195
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:10.950
And until you get some absolutely flies,

196
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.930
it ain't going absolutely bloody any of those situations.
I think that was,

197
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.280
that was what was amazing about extreme ownership,
um,

198
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.260
to see how people apply that in so many aspects of their lives.

199
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:24.380
And now I think w with dichotomy of leadership,
it's exactly the same thing.
Yeah.

200
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.610
It applies across all aspects of a professional and personal lives too.

201
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.040
Cause when,
when,
you know,
when I got out of the teams,
like I didn't understand,

202
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.730
I didn't understand the broad application of what we knew.
I didn't,

203
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.740
I mean when I started working with civilian companies then it's like,

204
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.940
oh well this is your problem.

205
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:41.860
You don't keep things simple enough for this is your problem.

206
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:43.030
You don't have decentralized command.

207
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.430
So you're trying to control all the decisions made.
It's,

208
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.790
but as soon as we realized,
well,
and I realized it was like,
oh,

209
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.490
it applies to this company.
Well what about this company?
And then,
okay,

210
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:53.230
what about this company?
And you just realize,
okay,

211
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.160
and that's when I started just seeing it everywhere and,
and I think,
yeah,

212
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.690
exactly right.
The dichotomy of leadership is the same way and it,

213
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.400
well,
like I said,
it's not just a book of war stories.
The,

214
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.380
the point of the book is to make people better leaders is to give them

215
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:14.290
leadership tools including me,
including you.

216
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:18.100
Like when you write stuff down you understand it better.

217
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.490
And so you know,
part of writing these books it's like,
okay,

218
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.640
how can I capture these lessons for myself?

219
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.360
And of course it's nice that other people can grab them then and look through

220
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:30.670
them.
But like I said,
it's not,

221
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:33.970
it's not just about war stories but to make people better leaders.
And I think,

222
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.360
I think we covered that pretty well in sort of in the intro of the book and just

223
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:44.440
a couple paragraphs and you should hit that part that we talked about earlier

224
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:49.020
where it just kind of gives the overall the overall view or the,

225
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.890
the high level view of the topic of the book.

226
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.630
<v 2>Every behavior or characteristic carried out by leader can be taken too far.</v>

227
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.520
Leaders can become too extreme and upset the balance required to effectively

228
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.220
lead a team.
When balances lost,

229
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.940
leadership suffers and the team's performance rapidly declines.

230
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.800
Even the fundamental principles of combat leadership and extreme ownership can

231
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:13.700
get out of balance.

232
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.260
A leader can cover and move too much and step on the toes of other leaders,

233
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.820
departments or divisions.

234
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.740
A plan can be too simple and fail to cover life that can Tennessee's a team

235
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:29.300
could go too far with prioritize and execute resulting and target fixation and

236
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:33.170
loss of situational awareness on newly emerging problems and threats.

237
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.760
Even decent advice.

238
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:39.020
Command can be taken too far when too much autonomy is given to subordinate

239
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:43.580
leaders who then don't fully understand strategic goals and how to execute and

240
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:46.730
support those goals.
And this idea continues on,

241
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:50.660
but just about everything a leader does.
Leaders must be close with their people,

242
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.880
but not too close that it becomes a problem.

243
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.500
They must hold the line with discipline,
but they must not become tyrannical.

244
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.980
A leader can even become too extreme with extreme ownership.

245
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.240
When a leader takes so much ownership of everything in his or her world,

246
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.480
that members of the team feel there's nothing left for which they can take

247
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:10.520
ownership.
When this happens,

248
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.590
team members will execute only at the boss's specific direction without any root

249
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.630
ownership or buying themselves,

250
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.280
resulting in a team far less capable of overcoming obstacles and accomplishing

251
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:27.260
the mission.
Therefore,
balance in leadership is crucial to victory.

252
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.400
<v 0>You can't say that one enough and you literally can't say that one enough.</v>

253
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.301
I was thinking,

254
00:16:33.301 --> 00:16:37.950
so when you have the same word to many time on all times on a page,

255
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.100
it's,
it's not good writing,
right?
It's not good.

256
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.570
Use the same word over and over again.

257
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.530
So I remember there was times where we would have the word balance like nine

258
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:48.870
times in a paragraph,
but there's,
it's like,
hey,

259
00:16:48.871 --> 00:16:51.300
there's no real other way to say what we're trying to say.

260
00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:53.820
You got to balance these things.
And it's interesting too,

261
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:56.040
as as as you're reading that,

262
00:16:56.041 --> 00:17:00.900
I'm just thinking of all the different situations we've been in and the last few

263
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.760
years with echelon front where we've seen every single one of these things.

264
00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:07.500
You know the person that comes up,
hey,

265
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:10.710
we want to keep this plan simple and then they don't think of any contingencies

266
00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:11.251
or hey,

267
00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:13.590
I'm just trying to cover and move and that means I'm going to go in to do their

268
00:17:13.591 --> 00:17:14.130
job for them.

269
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.470
And all of a sudden they're making everyone mad cause they're stepping on

270
00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:17.250
everyone toes.

271
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.970
I mean decentralized command where no one knows what's going on because it's

272
00:17:20.971 --> 00:17:24.930
like,
Hey,
I'm a hands off leader.
I'm using decentralized command,
but boss,

273
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.900
what in God's name do you actually want us to do?

274
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.430
So all of these things are,
are,
are,
we've lived,

275
00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:35.490
we've lived through them now and it became really evident even though we have,

276
00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:36.420
you know,
that's the last chapter.

277
00:17:36.421 --> 00:17:39.810
The last chapter in extreme ownership is the dichotomy of leadership and

278
00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:42.210
discipline equals freedom.
And you know,

279
00:17:42.211 --> 00:17:44.310
we put it in there because we knew it was important.

280
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.940
But now after working with more people over the past few years,

281
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.100
it's become so obvious that this

282
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.810
<v 3>is like such a critical,
the been able to balance,
balance,
balance,
balance.</v>

283
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.920
I you can use that word nine times in every paragraph because that's what you

284
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.780
have to do if you're a leader.
And,
and we talk about this too in the opening of,

285
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.410
in the opening of the book and the email and the opening of dichotomy
leadership,

286
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.040
we talk about how one of the problems with the book extreme ownership is the

287
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:15.140
title extreme ownership.

288
00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:18.300
Cause it made everyone just want to get extreme with everything.

289
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.630
I'm going to be super extreme.
And so that means you know what,

290
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:24.240
I'm going to do what?
Get extreme on the own.
Everything.
And we,

291
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.570
that was one of the earliest things that I started noticing was people that took

292
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.490
so much ownership.
So I'm a leader,

293
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:33.720
I'm in charge and I take so much ownership of everything that everyone below me

294
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:36.870
in the chain of command,
there's nothing left for them to own.
And,

295
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:38.220
and all of a sudden they're just feel like,
hey,

296
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:40.620
they're just along for the ride and they're just gonna do what they're told to

297
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:44.250
do and all their initiative is gone.
And they don't,
they don't even have,

298
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.060
they don't,
they don't,
it's not that they don't believe,
but they just think,
okay,

299
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:50.400
well we're just going to do what we're told so it's not their plan.

300
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.400
And so they're going to do the best of their ability,
but it's not theirs.

301
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.650
They don't own it.
So all those things that you just talked about are,
are,

302
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.920
are things that we've,
we've now seen.
And there are things that I struggle with.

303
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.840
You know,
I think there's,
there are things that you struggle.
I think we,

304
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:06.690
each of us struggle with them.
It's the hardest part about leadership.

305
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.350
And as we've seen that over and over again,
that,
that,
you know,

306
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.800
that brief introduction that we gave it in chapter 12 of extreme ownership,

307
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.960
uh,
you know,
introduce the concept,

308
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:18.760
but this dives so much deeper into those challenges.
And I,

309
00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:19.710
and I think that's what,

310
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.930
what I love about this book is it answers the questions to that,

311
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:26.240
that we get most often about,

312
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:28.930
about how to balance that because that's the hardest part.
Uh,

313
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.940
and it's so difficult to do.
And I remember at our first muster,

314
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:35.750
there was a question about,
you know,
can you take,
you know,

315
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.910
can extreme ownership go too far?
I actually answered the question.
Well,

316
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.740
I think if you're properly understanding what extreme ownership means,
no.
Uh,
but,

317
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.020
but you actually answered that as I was like,
absolutely,

318
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:47.130
you can take too much ownership.

319
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.810
And I think that's what people take that as well.
I've got to do everything.
Like,

320
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.120
no,
you,
you're responsible for everything.
That's what extreme ownership means.
Uh,

321
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.590
but certainly a,
you can,

322
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.260
you can absolutely take too much ownership where no one's doing anything.

323
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:01.850
And I think we explained that pretty well in this book and this,

324
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.430
this book was written just like extreme ownership dichotomy of leadership was

325
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:09.540
written to help leaders as a reference manual.
And if it's someone that,
you know,

326
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:13.610
if I see pages,
uh,
like we see so many copies of extreme ownership,
I mean,
I,

327
00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:16.590
I want to see pages that are underlying,
that are highlighted there,
tad that are,

328
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.380
they're utilized by leaders.
And,
uh,

329
00:20:19.381 --> 00:20:24.090
and if we've done that and this is a manual that helps a leaders lead better and

330
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:27.360
be better people and lead better teams that then this will have accomplished as

331
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:28.500
measured.
You know,
what's cool is,

332
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.250
is I think it's very similar to the fact that with extreme ownership,
right,

333
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:36.510
with that attitude where that attitude,
when you get in that mindset,

334
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.490
you start seeing it everywhere and you start,
when someone makes an excuse,
you,

335
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.950
you recognize me to go,
that's an excuse.
Like,

336
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.430
echo has given you a hard time about your,
your lack of a haircut

337
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.840
<v 0>and,
and you know,
you were,
you were saying,
but it's my fault.</v>

338
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:57.160
And we were laughing about it.
Right?
And,
and of course I was,
I was like,
well,

339
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:58.720
you know,
I should've,
I should've told you,
you know,

340
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.640
there's going to be a timeline and you need to get a haircut before.

341
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.470
But you know,
we're joking about it,

342
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.900
but in the same time that we're joking about it,

343
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.550
the fact that like you brought that echo that up is a real thing.

344
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.970
And for us to be sitting here joking about it means that we actually think about

345
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.800
it.
We actually,
every time you,
you know,
layoffs,
making it a joke and excuse like,

346
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.090
oh,
jockey,
he's,
it's like we all know and it's uh,
it's,
it's uh,

347
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.550
it sinks in and it becomes really hard for someone to make an actual excuse

348
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.410
becomes really,
really hard.

349
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.950
And I think for me that's one thing that I've benefited over the last few years.

350
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:39.550
I've seen other people what it becomes,
when you're aware of it,

351
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.480
when you're aware of it,
the balance becomes much,
much easier to see.

352
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:46.690
And that's what I think is going to be very helpful about this book is people

353
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:48.940
won't know that they're out of balance.
That's the biggest problem.

354
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:50.980
The biggest problem.
They don't know.
They're thinking,

355
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.490
my guys aren't taking any initiative.
What's wrong with them?
And it's like,
well,

356
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.550
you're micromanaging them.
You've gone too far in that direction.

357
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.040
You've gone too far and controlling everything that they do,

358
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.370
they think that they think that if you want them to do something,

359
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:05.410
that you're going to tell him to do it.
And other than that,

360
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:08.410
they're going to sit there and stand by and wait for orders.
And it's like no.

361
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.730
So W and you've,
if you don't understand that you can be out of balance,

362
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.790
then you won't recognize that.
But if you know,
hey,

363
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.690
my guys aren't taking it in any initiative,
I wonder what's wrong with them?

364
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.630
Well actually maybe it's me,

365
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.890
maybe it's me and maybe I am micromanaging them so much that I've beaten the

366
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:27.820
initiative out of them.

367
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.970
So what I need to do is back off a little bit and give them some leeway and give

368
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:36.520
them some ownership of what they're doing and let them make some decisions down

369
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.080
there.
And if,
if you do that,

370
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.320
then you start seeing it come back and you start seeing them take initiative and

371
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:42.640
you feel good.
And that's a,
you know,

372
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:45.730
one of the chapters in the book is actually that right there where I talk about

373
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.470
my first deployment to Iraq,
where I first got to Iraq my first time in combat,

374
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.030
I was just basically wanting to own everything because that was my,

375
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.680
that's my personality.
I'm going to take ownership of this.

376
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.120
And then I realized my guys might call on,
you know,

377
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.660
if they're not really taking the initiative,
I want them to take,
well,

378
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:05.680
why is that?
It's because I'm micromanaging them.
And finally,

379
00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:08.650
luckily we got overwhelmed with operations.

380
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:10.840
We had so many operations to conduct and I was like,
I can't,

381
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.470
I can't manage all these,
I can't oversee everything that's happening.

382
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.910
And I had to cut the guys loose and as soon as I caught him loose and said,
hey,

383
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:20.710
you got this and you've got that and you've got the other thing,

384
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.880
the guys just start stepping up and running everything.
Like I knew,
like,

385
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.120
like of course they could,
cause they're freaking highly capable guys.

386
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.430
And they started kicking ass and I realize like,
oh,

387
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:33.970
I don't even barely even need to be here right?
Barely even need to be here.

388
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.990
Whereas in the beginning I thought,
oh,
this is all,
if it wasn't for me,
you know,

389
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.890
and I'm only talking about a period of a few weeks of me trying to micromanage

390
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:42.280
everything.

391
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.100
So I think what's going to be beneficial about this book is that people will

392
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.340
<v 3>see how they can get out of balance and,</v>

393
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.960
and they'll also see that that balance pertains to just about everything.

394
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.940
And every trait that you have that's positive as a leader,

395
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.950
you can overdo and you can turn it into a negative trait if you go too far.

396
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.930
So you gotta watch out for that.
You definitely got to watch out for that.

397
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.520
It's easy for us to see,
you know,

398
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:14.040
we always talk about the attachment and attachment.
So important.
And for us,
what,

399
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.430
you know,
through our company asked a lot of fraud,
it's,

400
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.840
we're working with these leaders and working with these companies,
you,

401
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.350
you can see it,
you know,
it just,
it just stands out.
Uh,

402
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.740
so obvious that someone is,
you know,
they're trying to cover,

403
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.650
move I helping another department and yet they're stepping on people's toes.

404
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:30.470
And they're pissing people off and you know,
like,
why are you,
you know,

405
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:34.190
you're trying to do my job and make me look bad.
And they were like,
well,

406
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:36.800
I'm trying to cover move just like you told me.
I'm just trying to help.

407
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.010
And then you're saying,
well,
you have to be careful about that.
You'd have to,

408
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.851
you'd have to balance it.

409
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:45.210
And so once it is the absolute most common problem we see all the time,
and,

410
00:24:45.211 --> 00:24:48.650
and even for folks that have read extreme ownership,
you know,
three or four,

411
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.790
you know,
multiple times that,
that are really trying hard to be better leaders,

412
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.930
they struggle with that.
And this is a something to help them,
uh,

413
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.000
and help leaders everywhere.
And I,
you know,

414
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:01.970
and we wrote the book too so that it can be read.
Um,
it's,

415
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.140
it's a follow on certainly a sequel.
Uh,
you gave me a chance to correct that.

416
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.240
Why would you say,
what'd you say?

417
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.730
You were talking about jaws to buck has one 14 and I said it's not a sequel,

418
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:17.120
it's a standalone book,
but it absolutely is a sequel and it's a follow on book.

419
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.800
Um,
it expands on the concepts.

420
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:22.700
However we did ride it so that that it is a standalone book you can read,

421
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.400
you can read extreme emotion if you have,

422
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.470
if you can read dichotomy without having read extreme ownership,

423
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.890
you'll certainly understand it and be able to apply it.
Yeah.

424
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.470
But you understand the concepts better if you read extreme ownership first,

425
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.390
no question.
And then you jump into dichotomy,
which yeah,

426
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.640
like I said,
can you read it alone?
Sure you can.

427
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.360
I guess there's echo we need like some kind of a movie reference here.

428
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.660
She's like,
yeah,
I'm thinking term.

429
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.410
Could you see terminator two on its own right.
But you will,

430
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.330
you will get more out of it if you saw terminate or one first.
Correct.

431
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.630
Same with around.
He look at me just nailing,
nailing it.
Yeah.
So ramble.
Right.

432
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.060
First blood part too.
Same deal where you could watch just Rambo and be pretty,

433
00:26:08.061 --> 00:26:09.440
pretty happy about it.
But hold on.

434
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:14.441
Now my problem with that is we know that terminator two is equivalent in quality

435
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.440
to terminate her one.
Correct?
Correct.
Right.
Correct.
Yeah.
Right.

436
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.020
I think so too.
It was awesome.
Except for the kid.
Are we saying,

437
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.680
are we saying that a better Jambo too?

438
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.650
Which I don't even think I've seen first blood part too.
Yeah,

439
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.040
I don't is are we saying that's the same level of quality as Rambo for why you

440
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.640
gotta be careful there?
And that's what I think.
That's where I figured,
I mean,

441
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:42.410
I'm not saying it's jaws to which jaws one,
which is a masterpiece,

442
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.670
right?
Masterpiece jaws,
jaws one,
jaws time called Jasmine,

443
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.540
she's called jaws jaws.
Too problematic.
We've got issues.

444
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.750
So what I'm saying is we're more like the terminator scenario.
Gotcha.

445
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.830
Or,
or there's aliens,
aliens that you can totally watch that movie standalone.
Uh,

446
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:04.380
but obviously it gives you some more context if you watched the first one.

447
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.250
But I think the second one's actually better.
Yeah.
You feel like,

448
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.320
do you feel like dichotomies better?
I actually do.
I actually do feel,

449
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.830
I feel it's better.
I mean,
I've,

450
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.590
I'm interested to hear what readers think about it,

451
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:21.591
but I think that it's more useful and applicable to a t to leaders.

452
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.050
Uh,
I mean we,
we have three years,
uh,

453
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:30.051
additional leadership experience and not only evaluating our experiences in

454
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.700
combat and in the seal teams,
but,
uh,

455
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:35.690
but now working with hundreds of leaders and,
uh,

456
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.880
I mean really we're talking,
you know,

457
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.180
a couple of hundred plus companies that we've worked with in that time,
um,

458
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.710
easily,
you know,
between Jesse,
me and you,
probably not,

459
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.200
that's not even counting some of the other members of our team.
So,
um,
we,

460
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:50.710
we've seen this in a,

461
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.060
in a whole lot of different scenarios and I think it really addresses the,

462
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:58.220
it's a direct application to the problems that we see.
Um,
so I'm,

463
00:27:58.221 --> 00:28:01.170
I'm pretty awful and I'm looking forward to it too.
To Reader's feedback on it.

464
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.850
Was it easier for you to write?
Yes.
Yeah.
I mean,

465
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:10.050
for me it definitely was,
and I say easier just because we've,
we,
well,

466
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.700
we became better writers as we wrote extreme ownership,

467
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.190
extreme ownership.
The first version that we did,

468
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:21.990
extreme ownership was in the third person.
And I forget why we even did that,

469
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.610
but we was about these two guys named Leif and Jocko,
and it was about,

470
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.520
I don't know,
I forgot,
kind of forget.

471
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.720
I think it was a recommendation that came to us from the litter age here,

472
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.650
the publisher,
whatever.
And we know,
then we finally had to say,
yeah,

473
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:37.480
we're not doing that.
Uh,
you know,

474
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.840
that friend of yours that talks about themselves in the third person that you

475
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.470
met?
Yeah.
We're not going to do that.
Yeah.
So,

476
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.320
and it's weird because there's the book,

477
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.510
there's a couple of books I've done with the podcast,

478
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.750
clay pigeons in St Lo buy Glover Johns,

479
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.470
who's the guy that you Hackworth wrote about,
he wrote the book Clay Pigeons,

480
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.720
Clay Pigeons in St Lo,

481
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.700
and it's in the third person about a guy named major John's and it's him.

482
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.490
And he writes a thing in the beginning and says,
Hey,

483
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.250
I didn't feel comfortable talking about myself.
So I did it,
wrote it this way.

484
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.790
It's like,
okay.
And the,

485
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.100
the only thing I would say that's cool about it is you could,

486
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.830
he could kind of give an outside view,

487
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.020
but the thing that's not cool about it is he couldn't be,

488
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:20.010
I was thinking this right now,
which is kind of what I want to hear.

489
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:23.520
And that's why normally cover books that are first person,

490
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.470
people that actually experience it.

491
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.770
But he's the guy that did a couple other people have when you're gone,

492
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.910
when you're glove or John's though and your,
you're uh,
David Hackworth.
See Daddy,

493
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:37.260
I think you can do whatever you want to do,
what you want for sure.
Uh,

494
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.010
now that's another part that's again,
you

495
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.800
<v 0>know,
we've,
we've in this book,</v>

496
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:49.801
we set it up the same way with combat story principal followed by a business

497
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:54.860
example.
But one thing that I think,
and this is feedback that,

498
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.750
that we both got that I certainly got was that for what?
For?

499
00:29:59.751 --> 00:30:01.990
Well because the consequences are so high in combat,

500
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.200
it makes the principal very clear.

501
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.130
And even though people might know,
well,
I've never been in combat,

502
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.390
but they understand that if we're not working together as a team doing cover

503
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.100
move,
we will die.
And so when they understand that,
they go,
oh,
okay,

504
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.740
now that means if I'm not working with the other department,

505
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.920
then we're going to lose money or we're not going to complete our mission,

506
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:26.440
or we're not going to take market share.
Yes.

507
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.890
So I think one of the strongest points of,

508
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.310
of extreme ownership that we did again is the combat stories too,

509
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.030
to sort of introduce the principles and plus it's cool to hear cool stories like

510
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:43.300
that,
but one of them,
I think chapter three,

511
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:47.770
another nother one that we pulled out that said it'd be good to sort of cover

512
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:52.570
this one real quick,
is you opened up chapter three with a little,
a little bit,

513
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:57.070
get some,
I guess we could say and can hit that one.
Man.
I want to,

514
00:30:57.071 --> 00:31:00.370
I want to hear that one.
I want to hear the Texas Batman get crazy.

515
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:05.080
And in Ramadi in 2006 this is bringing back some awesome memories there.

516
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.440
<v 2>Bright orange tracer streak like laser beams just a few feet over our heads,</v>

517
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.350
each supersonic bullet,
zipping past with a thunderous crack.
Holy Shit.

518
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.060
Thought as we quickly ducked down behind the roof wall.

519
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.810
Those are friendly shooting at us.
I looked over at Dave Burke,

520
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.470
who crouched down nearby like the other seals on the roof with us.

521
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.380
We tried to stay low enough not to get her head shot off.

522
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.760
Dave looked back at me and shook his head with a smile.
Mixed humor and concern.

523
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:34.960
That's not cool.

524
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:39.850
Dave said the understatement of the year they Burke was a US Marine Corps major,

525
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.530
a fighter pilot by trade.

526
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.640
He had been the lead instructor at the legendary U s navy fighter weapons
school,

527
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.020
better known as top gun.

528
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.670
David left the cockpit behind a volunteered to serve on the ground as a forward

529
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:54.880
air controller and the most dangerous place in Iraq.
Ramadi.

530
00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.130
He led us supporting arms liaison team or salt attach to the U S Marine Corps.

531
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.860
Fifth Air Naval gunfire liaison company.

532
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.970
Dave and his 12 marines from salt six a company,
Charlie platoon,

533
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.750
to coordinate with the aircraft supporting this operation and the skies
overhead.

534
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.190
They patrolled in with us on foot to spearhead the operation ahead of the U s

535
00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:16.870
army and Iraqi army units.

536
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.440
A US tank 200 yards away had fired a burst from its heavy machine gun directly

537
00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:25.210
over our position.
It was friendly fire,

538
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.390
a blue on blue and US military parlance to be killed or horribly wounded by

539
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:35.290
enemy fire was one thing to be killed by our own American forces was something

540
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:40.060
much worse that was way too close for comfort,
I thought in the seconds

541
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.640
<v 4>following is that crouch as low as possible behind the low concrete wall.</v>

542
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.110
That was our only means of cover.

543
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.940
We had to shut that down immediately and alert the tank that we were friendly

544
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:51.770
forces to do so.

545
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.810
I had to contact the specific tank commander directly via radio and tell them to

546
00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:57.644
cease fire.

547
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.350
The tanks heavy machine gun was a 50 caliber m two browning known as the Mod

548
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:04.184
deuce.

549
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:09.310
It packed a hell of a punch and US military service since 1933 it had proven

550
00:33:09.751 --> 00:33:13.100
it's deadly effectiveness in every American war since World War One.

551
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.200
Each massive round could take a man's head clean off or move the bulk of his

552
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:19.034
chest cavity.

553
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.150
It can also punch right through concrete walls like the one we were hiding

554
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.984
behind.

555
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.860
We had just received a fully automatic burst of probably a dozen rounds and a

556
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:28.760
matter of seconds.

557
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.570
If I didn't shut down the fire immediately and let the u s tag,
no,

558
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:36.770
we were friendlies.
It could mean horrible wounds and death for a number of us

559
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.740
blue on blue.
It's even an extreme ownership.
We talked,

560
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.770
there's three episodes of blue on blue potential or boot the out with with Chris

561
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.400
potentially shooting the uh,
American trooper that was in a,
in a building,

562
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.760
the Bradley Getting Ready to light up stoners guys in and also the blue and blue

563
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:02.530
that the book starts off with theirs.
It's,

564
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:07.540
it's interesting and a reality of war that we talk about blue on blue a lot in

565
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.320
that urban environment.

566
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.330
The other thing I noticed is did you,

567
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.780
I don't mean to accuse you hear like you know,
on this,
in this format,

568
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.100
but each massive round could take a man's head clean off.

569
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.760
Is that not just jacked from Clint Eastwood right there come home man,

570
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:28.490
that's 44 magnum metal dirty Harry.
Right.

571
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:33.700
I can neither confirm that too.
There's a,
the,
the,
the,

572
00:34:33.701 --> 00:34:38.330
did you consult with echo for,
you know,
party your writing here,
Echo,

573
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.230
echo and I uh,
we see that out in the movie quotes.
Yes,
there was a little,

574
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:44.600
there was a use of parlance in there too that,
uh,

575
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.480
in the parlance parlance our times.
So you threw a little,

576
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.450
little big Lebowski in there that we had previously.
It looked that way.

577
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.250
That was a crazy situation.
And we were,
I thought we'd done everything.

578
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.240
What was so crazy about that situation for us is I thought we'd done everything

579
00:34:59.241 --> 00:35:03.500
in our power to mitigate the risk of that and let everybody know where we were

580
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:07.760
marked our position,
you know,
talk,
talk and coordinate with people and a,

581
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:12.080
and a steel get shot at by friendlies.
Um,
you know,
they,
uh,
that was,

582
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.410
that was crazy.
And Dave and I were sitting looking at each other like,
man,
this,

583
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:18.410
this is good.
This isn't good at all.
So it was,
it was a,

584
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:22.250
I was foam of that radio trying to get and talk to them immediately.
Uh,

585
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.460
and thank God a,
as we've talked about on previous podcasts,

586
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.940
you'd come down on us to be able to use,
uh,

587
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.730
to be able to learn how to use those radios ourselves and not just rely on the

588
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:34.330
radium and,
uh,
and I was able to swap over and,

589
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.130
and make direct comps that tag and,
and,
and get done to cease fire.

590
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.130
<v 3>And that's one of the things that I like completely held the line on.
And,
and w,</v>

591
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.481
you know,

592
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:45.960
when you talk about in the book how there's some other things where I allowed a

593
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:47.370
little bit of slack and you actually,

594
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.060
you actually kind of capture that in a couple pages later that I pulled up here.

595
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.090
It's a middle of page 76 punch through that little section right there.

596
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.480
And I think it's a,
it's a good good.
Um,

597
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.580
kind of captures what we're talking about in terms of,

598
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.160
and you were saying this to me early,
earlier today,
you're like,

599
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.780
everyone thinks Jocko would just be lucky.

600
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.760
You're going to shut up and do what I tell you to do.
And it's like,
well,

601
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.180
actually there's some things I'm going to tell you that,
but there's some,

602
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.330
it's good.
There's going to be a balance.
Well,
you actually,

603
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:24.920
you never said you shut up and do,
do,
do what I tell you to do.
Right.

604
00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.910
I'm sure you probably want it to many,
many times and still do.

605
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:34.590
I'm sure often.
But there is a,
it's not effective.

606
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.290
It's never effective to do that.
And I think so many leaders that want to just,

607
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:39.420
you know,
why won't they just do what I told them to do.
It's,
it's,

608
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.180
people get really frustrated by that.
But obviously there,

609
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.620
you've got to hold the line.
You absolutely have to hold the line,
you know?

610
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.790
And if you to relented on,
on us being able to learn how to use our radios,

611
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.830
I mean that could have cost lives right there.

612
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:51.090
Another verse around comes through,

613
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:53.760
it comes through the roof wall or we take a main gun round.

614
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:58.410
Now you're talking to the cannon on the tank,
the 120 millimeter main gun round,

615
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.280
you know,
just smash through both sides of walls,
you know,
it would,

616
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.400
it would have an absolute catastrophic.
Those guys think,
you know,

617
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.900
they're under attack,
they're shooting back at what they think is enemy.

618
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:09.270
They don't even realize it.
And it's not like they were,

619
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.510
they were not ready to use those main gun rounds if they had to.
They were,

620
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.650
they were putting some buildings down over there for sure.
And that's,

621
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.700
and that's the hard part,
right,

622
00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:20.280
is that you've got to hold the line and their standards that can't be

623
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:21.730
compromised and you've got to,

624
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.410
you're failing your team and you're failing as a leader if you're not keeping

625
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:29.100
those standards a high and making sure the team achieves them.

626
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:34.101
And yet also you can't be the unrelenting task master or the slave driver that

627
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:36.930
just smashes people down and says,
shut up and do what I tell you.

628
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.750
This is something that I bring up a lot when I'm working with companies is like,

629
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.000
do you actually want people to do exam to do whatever you tell them to do?

630
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.240
And the the,
the immediate answers like,
well yeah,

631
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.460
I just want everyone to shut up and do what I tell them to do.
Well,

632
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.360
the actual answer is no,
you don't want that.
If you're a good leader,

633
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:57.180
what you want is if I tell Lafe,
hey,

634
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:00.570
go take that building over there and you say to me,
no.

635
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.390
And I say,
why not?
And you say,
well,

636
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.390
there was an IED in the front yard and we'll all get killed if we go there.

637
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.960
I've got,
okay,
thank you.
Now as opposed to you're,

638
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:12.090
you're just going to blindly do whatever I tell you to do,

639
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.750
well then that's going to be problematic.
So there's a balance in this too.
And,

640
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.090
and that's something that we talk about all the time.

641
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:20.490
But to surround you don't want to surround yourself with,
yes ma'am.

642
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.940
You don't want to surround yourself with yes men and we,

643
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.770
I've seen plenty of companies where the boss man has surrounded himself with yes

644
00:38:28.771 --> 00:38:33.430
men and they yes themselves into the grave because the everyone's just agreeing

645
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.980
all.
Yep,
we'll do that.
That sounds like a great plan boss.
Oh yeah,
dude,

646
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.100
<v 0>yes boss.
That sounds like a great plan boss.
And,
and the next thing you know,</v>

647
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.160
someone along the line,
she just said,
hey boss,
that doesn't make any sense.

648
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.020
Hey boss.
Like,
oh,
we got a good relationship with these people over here.

649
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.780
But you know what?
They're raising the price a little bit.

650
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.750
We don't want to work with them anymore.
But w w okay,

651
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:54.850
well let's think about that.
You know that,

652
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.250
that that's one of our biggest suppliers.

653
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.400
Do we really want to nix our relationship with our biggest supplier?

654
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.550
Does that make sense?
Well,
you know,
they're getting in our face now.
A yes,
man.

655
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:05.920
It'd be like catch right boss.
We don't take no crap from,

656
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:07.390
no one will screw those guys.

657
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.570
But maybe you want someone below you in the chain of command says,
Hey boss,

658
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.360
let's think about this.
That's our biggest supplier.

659
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.920
If we cut them off and demand goes up,
we won't be able to service our customers.

660
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.590
That could be problematic.
Wouldn't you agree how,
but we negotiate with them.

661
00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:25.690
Right.
So there's,
my point is you don't just want people you know,

662
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:27.160
just don't want to be surrounded by yes men.

663
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:28.570
You want people that are going to question you.

664
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.240
You want people that are going to be,
that's why I like you so much life.

665
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.860
Cause you,
you questioned,
you have no problem.
Question you wrote.

666
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:38.130
I'm saying it's all about pushing,
pushing back,
the humble,
not passive.

667
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.920
I,
I've never,
uh,
never been passed,
but I think this this year,

668
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.090
page 76.
That's a good,

669
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.640
that's a good little way to capture what we were talking about

670
00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.960
<v 2>as there are collected upon Jockos demonstration of a leader's responsibility to</v>

671
00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:55.490
ensure standards are maintained.

672
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.630
I thought about the times in my career when I failed to do so.
As a young leader.

673
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.120
I knew there were times we needed to improve our performance.

674
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:06.860
Do another run to the kill house where we practice close quarters combat or add

675
00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:11.150
an additional rehearsal to ensure we were fully prepared.
Yet in those moments,

676
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.020
I sometimes hadn't held the line.
I hadn't pushed the team hard enough.

677
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.620
Any additional work assigned to the team was going to get pushed back and

678
00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:22.760
generate complaints and there were times when I let things slide confusing.

679
00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:27.230
The idea of taking care of your people with allowing them not to work as hard,

680
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:32.360
but in the end that resulted in mediocre performance and the team never got

681
00:40:32.361 --> 00:40:36.290
better,
never held each other accountable.
This was a failure of leadership.

682
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.040
My leadership.
I also recognize the dichotomy.

683
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.320
There were other times when I was overbearing.

684
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:47.030
I insisted on doing things a certain way because it was my way or harped on

685
00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:51.680
trivial matters that were strategically unimportant thinking I was doing right.

686
00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:56.270
By holding the line,
it causes unnecessary friction,
stifled growth,

687
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.420
and inhibited junior leaders on the team from stepping up.

688
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.740
It prevented us from functioning properly with effective decentralized command.

689
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.420
I had seen and worked for numerous leaders throughout my navy career who had

690
00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:10.970
been overbearing and it wasn't the way I wanted to lead.

691
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.220
Some of them imposed harsh discipline,

692
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.490
screamed at their people and crush the morale of the team.

693
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.840
No one wanted to follow them.
They might accomplish an immediate task,

694
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.780
but in the long run,
the team's growth was smothered.

695
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.410
Often they're negative example stood starkly in my mind,

696
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.810
I never want to be a leader like that.

697
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.100
<v 0>There you go.
The tyrannical</v>

698
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.460
<v 3>leader that's running around screaming at everyone and,
and,</v>

699
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.780
and like you just said,

700
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.100
they'll get some little tasks accomplished and they actually think that what's

701
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.220
horrible is they get some little task accomplished because they screamed and

702
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:48.740
yelled and it reinforces that behavior.

703
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.190
And so they become even more tyrannical and yell and scream even more.

704
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.580
And they never see the fact that acting that way.
It'll get you a little,

705
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:56.870
some little short term thing done,

706
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:59.870
but you'll never get everything you can out of people.

707
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.960
You never get everything you can out of somebody that you've beaten into

708
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:06.620
submission you they're not going to perform to their fullest potential.

709
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:08.540
And capability and that's just where you're going to be.

710
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.450
That's just where you're going to be.
The other thing

711
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.540
it takes this is,
this is one of those things,

712
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:20.540
like if you've got something that's hard to do,
right,

713
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.660
you've got something that the team has got to do,

714
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.360
it's hard to do and you're wishy washy about it.

715
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.620
You know it's the right thing to do,

716
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:30.950
but you're wishy washy about how you approach the team with doing it.

717
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.120
It's not going to happen.
It's just not gonna happen.

718
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:37.880
I'm reading another book right now by a guy that was in Vietnam with Hackworth

719
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.260
and he's saying just,
he would just lay down the law,

720
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.660
like Hackworth are just like,
no,
we're doing this.
This is what we're going to do,

721
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:49.580
this is how it's going to be.
And that's,
that's what it is.
You know,

722
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.700
I've got so many examples from my career,

723
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:57.470
but I'll tell you a really kind of a lame one,
but it's,
it's worth telling.

724
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.120
So back,
Bourbon,
boom,
dude,
guess what we used to do in the teams,

725
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.760
we used to drink beer,
a lot of it.
And that was kind of like,
hey,
you know,
we're,

726
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:08.720
we're,
we're in the stools,
you know,
were beer drinking frog men.
And that's cool.

727
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:14.710
And I was in a seal platoon where we drank a lot,

728
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.770
even more than a normal seal platoon,
which is,

729
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.840
which is once you're in the running for all lot,

730
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.400
and this is back in the 90s there's no war going on.
And I've said this before,

731
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:27.800
kind of the way that we proved ourselves,

732
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.340
because there's a certain level of sacrifice you have to make to prove to your

733
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:33.590
teammates that you're like,
you're willing to sacrifice.
Well,

734
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:37.640
one of the ways that you can sacrifice as you can just drink a lot and prove

735
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:40.550
that you can go all night and go hard and still get up the next day.

736
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.510
And so I was in a seal platoon where we drank a lot of just about everyone in

737
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:49.040
the chain of command,
except for the,
the,
the commander,
the OIC.

738
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.420
But everyone else,
you know,
we drank hard and you know,
we partied and whatever.

739
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.410
And we were a shipboard.
We were an arg platoon.

740
00:43:58.411 --> 00:44:02.060
So we were deploying on board ship and

741
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.850
when we were getting ready to deploy on the ship,
that was kind of like,
oh well,

742
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:08.960
you know,
we'll just,
we'll just,

743
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.060
cause you're not allowed to drink any alcohol on the ship.

744
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.280
You're not allowed to have any alcohol.
You're not allowed to drink any alcohol.

745
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.620
You can after 90 days at sea,
you can get a beer day.
They give you,
what was it,

746
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.590
45 back when I was in.
So you get,

747
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:25.340
you get one beer at 45 days.
So they gave us a two beers.

748
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.390
But I will say they gave us fosters.
So they were big oil cans.
Right.

749
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.440
But if you're living large,
I did too.

750
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.900
Two beer days in one deployment anyways,
you're not allowed other than that,

751
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:38.670
you're not allowed to drink.
That's the rules.

752
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.740
And so I think it wasn't like we openly discuss like how are we going to smuggle

753
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:47.070
bureau?
Maybe we did a little bit,
but our bosses came down to like,
yeah,

754
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:51.210
well there's no drinking,
no drinking on the ship.
And we were like,
okay,

755
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.180
those are the rules.
They just came down and put the rules down like,
Hey,

756
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:59.210
no drinking on the ship and I had respect for my office or my platoon commander

757
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:05.160
at the time had respect for my platoon chief at the time and they came down and

758
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:08.160
said,
yeah,
well there's no drinking on ships so don't even think about it.

759
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.030
We're like,
okay cool.

760
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.880
That's the law came down and we just got on board and we just got on board with

761
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:13.920
it.
Whereas if it would have been,

762
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.900
well you know a little bit of a wishy washiness us young eve threes,

763
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.040
fours and fives,
if they would have been remotely wishy washy would it,
I'm like,

764
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:25.110
oh cool,
you guys go drink whatever you want.

765
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.630
Just don't let us see it or whatever.
And that would have been bad.

766
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.980
Cause eventually guess what?
You put a bunch of seals on a ship with,
with booze,

767
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.240
and you leave them on there for multiple days at sea,
months at sea,

768
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.640
while they're gonna have an incident of some kind,
they're going to get a fight.

769
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.550
They're going to throw up somewhere.
They're going to be,
you know,

770
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.010
just dumb stuff's got to get to the highest level of attention is going to be a

771
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:45.510
total,
it's going to be a total disaster.

772
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.070
So the idea of actually just stepping up and holding the line,

773
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.600
and I'll tell you what I learned as a leader,
is it's liberating to do that.

774
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.620
It's liberating to say,
hey look,
here's the rules.
And,
and you know,

775
00:45:58.621 --> 00:46:01.580
I did this with the fact of when we got back to Ramadi,

776
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.440
we got to Ramadi and they told us we had to work with Iraqi soldiers and

777
00:46:04.441 --> 00:46:07.260
everyone was kind of hemming and hawing about having to work with Iraqi
soldiers.

778
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:12.390
And I told you guys don't even submit a concept of operations without Iraqi

779
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:15.990
soldiers.
Don't even submit it cause we're not doing it.
And you guys were like,

780
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.610
okay,
got it.
Yeah,
it is super liberating.
I think that's the,
you know,

781
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.020
one of the things that,
that I,

782
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.180
that I learned from you as we started working together.
I mean it,

783
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.430
and I talked to me about this all the time I've talked about on the podcast

784
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:33.210
before,
but it was the kind of things that you know,
you probably should be doing,

785
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.750
but for whatever reason you are and,
and you know,
for,

786
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:39.210
you could just put in perspective for me of like it's very black and white.

787
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:40.710
I'm like,
no,
if you're not,

788
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.260
if you're not holding the line on these things that are important and pushing

789
00:46:43.261 --> 00:46:46.140
your team to perform at the highest standard or making sure they're not going to

790
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:48.840
do something that's going to get them in trouble or cause massive issues,

791
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.450
not only for us but for the entire,
you know,
not on,

792
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:54.690
for our unit with the entire seal teams,
then,
then that's,

793
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.540
you're failing them as a leader.
You've got to hold the light on that stuff.

794
00:46:57.541 --> 00:47:02.160
You've got to,
and it is very liberating to say,
oh,
check,
okay,

795
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.270
that's the way it is.
And I,

796
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:06.210
and I think that ambiguity is very frustrating for people that they don't know

797
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:08.610
what's right and you don't know what's wrong and they can get away with stuff.

798
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.080
Yeah.
That's what I was going to say is,

799
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.030
but the people below you in the chain of command,

800
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.090
they get frustrated because they're like,
well,
what does that mean?

801
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:16.650
And they're going to push it to the envelope that they,

802
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.860
this guy got away with it over here with that guy.
Did you know?
I mean,
that's,

803
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.990
yeah.
Those are the kinds of things where their needs,

804
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.500
there's got to be a standard.
You got to hold that standard and it's,
I,
it,

805
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:27.420
the team is so much better off when you do that.

806
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.160
And certainly bruiser absolutely was.

807
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.080
<v 0>And this is one of those things where then people think,
well,</v>

808
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.430
Jocko always holds the line and there'll be no slack whatsoever.
Right?

809
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:42.410
No fucking slack.
Right.
That's how we roll.
And it's like,
hm,

810
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.080
actually there is slack and there's times where your gifts,
I can,
I mean,

811
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.890
I mean I always talk about,

812
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:52.120
and we always talk about how I was super strict about uniforms,
right?
Like hey,

813
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:54.130
we're going to wear uniforms,
no patches,
all this stuff.
Right.

814
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:57.010
We talk about that stuff all the time.
But when someone was in,
when we were,

815
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.760
when we were in our camp,
I didn't care what you wore,

816
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.220
if you weren't going to be interacting with the army or the Marine Corps,

817
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.980
I didn't care what you wore at all.

818
00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:08.620
I mean I barely put on a shirt when we were all bad.
Right?

819
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.860
I mean I'd be sitting in the tactical operations that aren't I up flags,

820
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.150
flip flops and shorts and that's it.

821
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.060
And you had a brown t shirt and yeah,

822
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.950
sometimes an and so I didn't,
I'm not holding the line.

823
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:23.260
I'm not getting crazy cause guess what,
that's not important.

824
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:28.290
If I would have been running around policing up people's uniforms inside of our

825
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:32.020
camp,
which was just us,
man,

826
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:36.820
that would have wasted a bunch of leadership capital and frustrated everyone.

827
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.730
And then guess what,
when I tell them,
hey,

828
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.270
you got to learn how to program your radio.
That is,

829
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.050
that is explained with the same importance as,
hey,
you got a blouse,

830
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:51.550
your boots when you're inside our camp,
that's the wrong message to send.

831
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:55.210
So that's why this,
that's why I wrote this book because this is about balance.

832
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:58.570
You've got to be able to balance when to hold the line,
what's important,

833
00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:01.690
what's worth holding the line for and what things do you go,
okay,

834
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:04.180
you know what you,
you know what life,
you guys want to do it that way.

835
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.230
That's cool.
Go do it.
And that's what you need to learn.
That balance,

836
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.510
that balance is hard.
It's hard to do.

837
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:16.030
I think that again,
I think the awareness of it,

838
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.820
I think the awareness of it and

839
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.040
I don't really know when I recognize the awareness of it.

840
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:25.660
I mean I know like when,
um,

841
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.970
when Flynn Flynn puts up the slides of like the Jocko brief from back in the
day,

842
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.520
I talked about the dichotomy of leadership back then.

843
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.070
I'm surprised I even knew what dichotomy meant,

844
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.670
but they looked it up right before the break.

845
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.570
I probably looked at it right before the briefing and said,

846
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:44.620
what am I talking about?
But it's one of those things,
I recognized it,

847
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.050
I saw it and I could definitely see it.

848
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:51.970
But now and just the more we work with companies,
even when I was in the teams,

849
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:55.600
the more I was working with a seal platoon.
You'd see when a guy was like,

850
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.330
here's a good example though.
You know when a guy talks too much,

851
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.690
when you have a leader that just talks all the time,
just doesn't stop.

852
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:04.600
He's always has something else.
He,
he won't let anyone else get the last word.

853
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.400
It's always that guys,

854
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.540
that people stop listening to him because he's talking all the time and it's

855
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:13.720
like,
hey I got a good idea.
Well why don't you be quiet for a little while?

856
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:18.400
And I hated to have to tell that to somebody cause they get super self
conscious.

857
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.640
But you know,
I usually phrase it a different way.
Like,
Hey,
you should,
you should,

858
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.490
you should let your guys run a little bit.
You know,
let them,

859
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.920
let them get the last word in,
let,

860
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.610
it's going to give them more ownership of what you're doing.
If,

861
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.040
if when they get done San and that's how we're going to do it tonight.

862
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.890
And then this guy chimes in and you know what?

863
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.630
When we do it that way and you're like,
just,
you don't need to say it again.

864
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.990
He's like,
you don't need to double tap guys would say this debriefing,

865
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.850
I'm going to double tap that.
That's already been tapped.
Don't double tap it.

866
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.490
We're going to triple tap this thing.
We used to have a symbol.

867
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.580
If you can't see this,
if you're listening,
we'd put our two,
whatever,

868
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:56.240
two peace signs and and touch your thumbs together and it's like four legs

869
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:59.990
sticking up in the air.
That's a dead horse.
That's the symbol for dead horse,
Bro.

870
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:02.390
You don't need to say this again.
It's a dead horse.

871
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:06.800
Quit beating it to death with what is double double tap.

872
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.320
Double Tap.
When you shoot a target,
you should at once.

873
00:51:09.321 --> 00:51:11.660
And then what you normally do is you shoot it twice,
boom,
boom.

874
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.810
And so it's called a double tap.
It's like go fast,
fast mobile,
mobile.

875
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.520
So if I was debriefing you and,
and I was like Echo,

876
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.500
you know,
you need to keep your uh,

877
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.610
shop groups a little bit tighter on the next run.
Cool.
You got it.

878
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.360
Well the double tap on that,
you know,
you really need to work on the shot.
Yeah,

879
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:35.120
I'm saying the same thing.
Kind of like I second that notion kind of thing.
It is.

880
00:51:35.121 --> 00:51:39.950
But if you said that,
if you said I second that you could leave it there,

881
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.900
but if you said I second that because you really need to tighten up your groups

882
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:48.290
because the groups were a little bit dispersed around the target area and that's

883
00:51:48.291 --> 00:51:51.880
going to be bad.
We all know it's bad,
bro.
We all think,

884
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.450
think office space,

885
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:58.451
TPS report 100% clear enough and now all that being said,

886
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:03.170
so it's cool.
I think again,

887
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.590
having the combat stories let some of these things done and that's a good

888
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:10.430
example right there.
You're talking first person,
what you're actually thinking,

889
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.630
which I think is powerful,

890
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:16.690
but it's good also to to outline the principles and the,

891
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:21.860
and that's where we did.
So here's one of the principles we outlined,

892
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.880
and this is an important one because man,
we got,

893
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.100
cause we talk about being aggressive.
As a matter of fact,

894
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.560
we have tee shirts that say default aggressive,
right?

895
00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:33.620
Like we're not playing around with being aggressive.
And what does that mean?

896
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.600
That means that we get some people in the,

897
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.740
in the military and in the civilian sector that we say d default mode

898
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:44.630
aggressive.
They go default mode aggressive and they don't know when to stop.

899
00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:46.760
They get reckless,
they get careless,
they go too hard.

900
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.880
And so going back to the book here,

901
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.350
problems aren't going to solve themselves.

902
00:52:55.070 --> 00:53:00.070
A leader must get aggressive and take action to solve the problems and implement

903
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.303
a solution.

904
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.480
Being too passive and waiting for a solution to appear often enables the problem

905
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:10.070
to escalate and get out of control.
The enemy isn't going to back off.

906
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.720
The leader must get aggressive and put the enemy in check.

907
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.490
The good deal isn't going to deliver itself to accompany.

908
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:23.030
The leader has to go out and make a good deal happen.

909
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:29.190
Changes and new methodologies in a team are going to implement themselves.

910
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.590
Leaders need to aggressively implement them.

911
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:36.240
An aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader.

912
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:40.470
Default aggressive.
This means that the best leaders,

913
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:43.500
the best teams don't wait to act.

914
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.730
Instead understanding the strategic vision or commander's intent,

915
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.880
they aggressively execute to overcome obstacles.

916
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.160
Capitalize on immediate opportunities,

917
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:58.370
accomplish the mission and when rather than passively waiting to be told what to

918
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:00.270
do,

919
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.860
default aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways to further the strategic

920
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:05.280
mission.

921
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.180
They understand the commander's intent and where they have authority to do so.

922
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:14.270
The execute for decisions that are beyond their pay grade or above their

923
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:15.060
authority.

924
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.170
Default aggressive leaders still make a recommendation up the chain of command

925
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:24.290
to solve problems and execute key tasks to achieve strategic victory in seal

926
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:26.490
platoons and task units.

927
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.200
We expect this from leaders at every level right down to the frontline trooper

928
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.010
in charge of just himself and his small piece of the mission.

929
00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:41.240
But this mentality is crucial to any leader in any team or organization.

930
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.880
It is just as critical to success in business as on the battlefield.

931
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:50.600
Aggressive means proactive,

932
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.760
but it doesn't mean that leaders can get angry,

933
00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.170
lose their temper or be aggressive toward their people.

934
00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:05.330
A leader must always deal professionally with subordinates on the team.
Peers,

935
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:09.230
leaders up the chain of command customers or clients and personnel and

936
00:55:09.231 --> 00:55:11.450
supporting roles outside the immediate team.

937
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.720
Speaking angrily to others is ineffective.

938
00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.680
Losing your temper is a sign of weakness.

939
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:24.410
The aggression that wins on the battlefield in business or in life is directed

940
00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:28.250
not towards people,
but towards solving problems,
achieving goals,

941
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.050
and accomplishing the mission.

942
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.720
It is also critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to

943
00:55:37.371 --> 00:55:41.690
make sure that risks have been assessed and mitigated.

944
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:47.830
The dichotomy with the default aggressive mindset is that sometimes hesitation

945
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:54.520
allows a leader to further understand the situation so that he or she can react

946
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.690
properly to it rather than immediately respond to enemy fire.

947
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:03.950
Sometimes the prudent decision is to wait and see how it develops.

948
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:07.540
Is it a simple reconnaissance by fire?

949
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:12.520
Is it a faint by the enemy meant to distract from the real attack is the enemy

950
00:56:12.521 --> 00:56:17.020
simply trying to lure you into a confined area where they have a superior force

951
00:56:17.021 --> 00:56:18.010
waiting to ambush.

952
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:24.030
A careful moment of consideration might reveal the enemy's intentions to be

953
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.140
overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless.

954
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:34.960
That can lead the team into a disaster and put the greater mission in peril to

955
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:39.961
disregard prudent council when someone with experience urges caution to dismiss

956
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:45.571
significant threats or to fail to plan for likely contingencies is foolhardy.

957
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.870
It is bad leadership.
Uh,

958
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:54.460
chief contributing factor to recklessness comes from what military historians

959
00:56:54.461 --> 00:56:57.850
have long referred to as the disease of victory.

960
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.890
This disease takes place when a few battlefield success is produce an

961
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.510
overconfidence in a team's own tactical prowess while underestimating the

962
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.240
capabilities of its enemy or competitor.

963
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.960
This is a problem not just for combat leaders,

964
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:18.760
but for leaders and teams anywhere in any arena throughout the business world

965
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.440
and the civilian sector.

966
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:25.420
It is a leader's duty to fight against this disease so that the team,

967
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.500
despite its success,
never gets complacent.

968
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:35.670
The risk in any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards

969
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:39.460
of mission success.
And of course to counter that thought,

970
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:45.030
the cost of inaction must be weighed as well as aggressive as leaders.

971
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:51.991
Must be leaders must be cautious that they are not running to their deaths

972
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.750
simply because it is their instinct to take action.

973
00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:01.570
The dichotomy between aggression and caution must be balanced,

974
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.190
so be aggressive but never reckless.

975
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.250
<v 3>So there's a principle principle laid out and then of course it's followed up</v>

976
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:18.251
with a business example of which there are manifold of of businesses where the

977
00:58:20.211 --> 00:58:21.680
business gets too aggressive,

978
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:26.570
they start getting properties to put more stores into and they build up all this

979
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.250
rent that they got to pay every month.

980
00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:31.580
And next thing you know they have a down month and they got real estate bills to

981
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:35.000
pay or they start hiring a ton of people because they get a super aggressive and

982
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.280
that's,
you know,
kind of where this story leads to us.

983
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:39.830
We're bringing a gun to bring in all these people because we think this future

984
00:58:39.831 --> 00:58:41.390
success is coming in.
The next thing you know,

985
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.900
you're overhead is so huge because you got overly aggressive.

986
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:48.300
You end up with problems that,

987
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:52.940
that is hard to get so hard cause it that is absolutely in my nature is to,

988
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.540
and I think in to,

989
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.200
and so many people that resonate with extreme molar shit that come to the

990
00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:58.430
monsters that,
I mean we,

991
00:58:58.431 --> 00:59:02.300
we've got default aggressive leaders that want to go dominate the universe and

992
00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:05.420
you've got to really,
you've got to really take a step back and detach it.
Think,

993
00:59:05.421 --> 00:59:08.000
okay,
what am I not thinking about?
What am I not seeing?

994
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.440
How might planning for those contingencies we just talked about,
you know,

995
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:15.650
situation day w you know,
with,
with a,
a client where,
uh,
you know,
they,
they,

996
00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.030
when things are going really well,
that's when you gotta be looking at,
okay,
what,

997
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.980
what,
what's,
what's,
what's about to go wrong

998
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.060
<v 4>that I haven't seen yet?
You know,
what am I not playing it for?
So it is very,</v>

999
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:28.290
very difficult to balance as a leader.
Uh,

1000
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.740
but you absolutely have to balance that.
You have to be aggressive,

1001
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.680
you have to maneuver.
You know,
so many people get,
you know,
the,

1002
00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:36.950
the paralysis to analysis people talk about,
uh,

1003
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:41.000
don't want to make it make a decision until you know the solution is right there

1004
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:44.930
and it's 100% guarantee.
Nothing is ever 100% guaranteed by the time that's,

1005
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.230
you know,
that's even close to being that,
you know,
the,

1006
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.820
your competition's already maneuvered on the battlefield.

1007
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:52.610
You're going to get wiped out,
killed,
you know,
in the business world,
you know,

1008
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:56.180
you're going to get you,
you're going to get crushed by your competition and,

1009
00:59:56.181 --> 01:00:00.500
and so and yet being aggressive and also being prudent so that you're not

1010
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.630
falling into the traps,
not run into your desk,

1011
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:07.010
not sending your team up for total disaster.
It's the only,

1012
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.660
the only answer to this,
the only answer to this is you have to be balanced.

1013
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:14.480
That's the only answer because if you

1014
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.150
<v 0>go too far in one direction together,</v>

1015
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.720
if you get super aggressive and you take too much risk and you'll get wiped out,

1016
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.110
if you don't do anything and you sit there,
you're going to get wiped out.

1017
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:27.710
You have to,
you have to balance these two all the time.

1018
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:30.950
And Yeah,
you're right.
This is something that,

1019
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.290
it's something that we see all the time and I saw it,
you know,

1020
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.610
train in seal platoons,

1021
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.420
you get the guy that's super hyper aggressive and every time there's something

1022
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:45.380
going on there,
a lets you send a fire team over there and okay you send,

1023
01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.630
you send a fire team over there and then that fire team gets whacked,

1024
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.970
will send another five team over there.
Okay.
Then that fire team gets back,

1025
01:00:49.971 --> 01:00:53.150
we'll send it another fighting.
Next thing you're gonna have a platoon left.
Okay.

1026
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:56.420
So that was good.
You got everyone killed cause you were hyper aggressive.

1027
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.510
The other end of the spectrum is what we're not sure where the fire's coming

1028
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:01.460
from.
So we're going to sit here and wait.
Okay,

1029
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.770
well while you're not shooting at the enemy,

1030
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.550
the enemy is maneuvering and they are getting high ground and they are getting a

1031
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:11.810
superior position.
And this is the exact same thing in the business world where,

1032
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.630
I mean the,
the example of like,
hey we got to grow.

1033
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:17.630
And so the aggressive leader of the overly aggressive,

1034
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:22.520
the hyper aggressive leader will grow too fast and all of a sudden has overhead

1035
01:01:22.521 --> 01:01:25.430
that's too much and can't afford to go on.

1036
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:30.110
But at the same time you get a,
you get a company that's not,

1037
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.590
that's not aggressive enough,
and they should be entering another,

1038
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.130
another line of operation they should be putting,

1039
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.950
they should be entering another market.
You know,

1040
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.330
we were talking about this morning while we were working out blockbuster,

1041
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:46.970
blockbuster,
and blackberry,
right?
Blockbuster and blackberry.

1042
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.610
Who would have thought that blockbuster,

1043
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:52.400
which was there was a blockbuster on every street corner and there was a block

1044
01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:56.450
blackberry and everyone's pocket and they owned something like 80 something

1045
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:59.030
percent of the market share how they're done.

1046
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.830
Now are you telling me that someone that was default aggressive would've said,

1047
01:02:03.831 --> 01:02:07.640
you know what?
We need to figure out how to,
you know what,
these,

1048
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.010
these movies might be able to come on the Internet.
In fact,

1049
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:12.740
there's streaming video.
Let's get into that market.

1050
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.750
And of course they would have had the capitol,

1051
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.540
they would have had the infrastructure,
they would have had the people and,

1052
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.850
and they could have,
they would have being able to make that happen.

1053
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.590
They had relationships with,
with,
with the,
um,
with the big Hollywood studios,

1054
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:27.690
right?
They were getting sent those movies,
they'd relationship,

1055
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:31.200
they could have done that,
but they were sitting there going,
we were,
we were,

1056
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.260
you're going to come rent these videos for four 99.

1057
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.790
You got to get that VHS tape up in here.
Right?
That's the way it's got to be.

1058
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.950
And same thing with blackberry.
They're thinking,
well,

1059
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:44.220
no one's going to leave us because we got the little thing with the keyboard on

1060
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:48.420
it and we're set.
And,
and meanwhile they're,
they're both done,

1061
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.640
done.
Lack of aggressive,
lack of foresight,
lack of planning.
And,
and for me,

1062
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:57.270
it's really just a lack of being aggressive,
aggressively looking around.

1063
01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.550
Now we could go the other way and we could look at,

1064
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.670
look at companies that put so much capital out there that they run out of money

1065
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:09.720
and they go,
they go down to,
so what do you have to do?

1066
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.580
You have to balance,
you have to balance.
That's what you have to do.
Uh,
you know,

1067
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:18.350
one more thing.
I think we do one more thing from this,
from this book,
um,

1068
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.890
just you and it's a short,

1069
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.720
short little piece we were talking about earlier and it kind of relates to what

1070
01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.130
there,
I think the reason we were talking about,

1071
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:30.380
cause it was kind of related in the disease of victory.
Um,

1072
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:32.940
you had that little chunk.
Again,
we do the,

1073
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:37.950
we do the applications of business so people can see really directly how these

1074
01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:41.760
principles in combat and a principal correlates to the civilian sector.

1075
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.620
But you had a good one,

1076
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:48.770
just a couple paragraphs on a 84 about your kind of a stereotypical fired up

1077
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:56.670
extreme ownership poss that's going to come in there and make stuff happen.

1078
01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.400
I thought this was a good one.
Go.

1079
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.560
<v 2>I've read a lot about Patton,
the executive vice president said with pride,</v>

1080
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.970
referring to General George s patent jr the famous us army general whose

1081
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.070
exploits in World War II were legendary.

1082
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:13.800
I love that you reference patent in your presentation.

1083
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.370
I want exactly the kind of discipline organization around here that patent

1084
01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:21.330
expected.
We need people who carry out orders,
not questioned them.

1085
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.010
I could tell right away that the executive vice president had no previous

1086
01:04:26.011 --> 01:04:26.970
military experience.

1087
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:30.870
He clearly misunderstood how effective leaders in the military led their teams.

1088
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.090
It was not through rigid authoritarianism do this because I said so are you will

1089
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:39.960
be punished.
Sure.
There were those in the military who tried to lead like that,

1090
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.520
but it was never effect active.

1091
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.430
<v 0>So there you go.</v>

1092
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.100
And I know you and I both and the rest of the team has dealt with guys that
they,

1093
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:49.670
they,

1094
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:52.950
they have that vision of this military leadership and usually it's guys that

1095
01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:56.010
weren't in the military.
And you know,
I like to draw a line and maybe I'm right,

1096
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:59.410
maybe I'm wrong about this.
I think,
well,
and,

1097
01:04:59.411 --> 01:05:03.210
and from what I know from military history,

1098
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:07.680
when you go back to conscripts,
when you,

1099
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.330
when you get to the conscripts,

1100
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.590
those guys are beaten until they are doing what the,
you know,

1101
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.800
what they're told to him.
And we've,

1102
01:05:13.801 --> 01:05:18.400
we've covered some great examples of that on this podcast situations where it's

1103
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:19.900
like,
Oh,
you know what?
You know how we're going to lead,

1104
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:23.110
we're going to lead through tyranny and we're going to lead through punishment

1105
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:27.550
and want to lead through rigid discipline,
rigid discipline,

1106
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.010
which obviously everyone knows I'm a fan of discipline.

1107
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.290
But when you're leading guys,

1108
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:35.380
and the reason that they're following your orders is because they fear being

1109
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:37.600
beaten or fear being shot.

1110
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:42.700
They shot by you,
you know,
punished by you.
Uh,

1111
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.740
if that's why they're,
again,

1112
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.200
it's the same situation where if that's why they're doing it,

1113
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.560
you're never going to get the true optimal work and effort out of those people

1114
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.170
ever.

1115
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.680
<v 4>And even from,
from history,
I mean,
if you read Alexander the Grade Right,
or,</v>

1116
01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:01.930
or Julius Caesar who is a great example,
they had conscripts but,
uh,

1117
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:05.600
his men loved him and admired him and held him and tremendous,
regardless,
he,

1118
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.100
he rewarded them,
he gave them credit.
He,
he explained why and then he,
he was,

1119
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:14.360
he was a guy who was always put himself at the forefront,
uh,
of a,

1120
01:06:14.361 --> 01:06:16.970
of where the fighting was and uh,
you know,

1121
01:06:16.971 --> 01:06:20.210
much more so than just a political leader,
like many of the Roman,
uh,

1122
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:23.420
the role of the leader.
So just a phenomenal leader on the battlefield.

1123
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:27.900
And so even even then you hear the most effective leaders are always going to
be,

1124
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:31.030
they're always going to try to get the team on board with a mission,

1125
01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.140
help them understand why they're doing it,
put it,

1126
01:06:33.141 --> 01:06:36.980
put a greater purpose in their mind.
And I think so often,
as you said before,

1127
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:40.940
you know,
leader,
a leader like that this was,
this was a aggressive leader,
great,

1128
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:44.300
great person who wanted to dominate the universe and,
and make things happen,

1129
01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.280
love extreme ownership.
And yet is,

1130
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.710
is struggling to see that because they think they're leading.

1131
01:06:48.711 --> 01:06:49.960
Like you would leave,
they look at,

1132
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.360
they look at a picture of Jocko like this is what Jocko would do and just crush

1133
01:06:53.361 --> 01:06:56.980
everyone and tell them to do it.
Cause I sat as you've explained it,

1134
01:06:56.981 --> 01:07:01.850
it doesn't work.
It doesn't work that way.
It's never effective.
And that's why,
uh,

1135
01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.270
that's why I'm,
and I'm proud of this,
but,

1136
01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:06.920
and I think it can be so useful to leaders to see you can't do that.

1137
01:07:06.921 --> 01:07:07.491
If you do that.

1138
01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:10.580
You're not ever going to be as successful as you could be if you actually,
uh,

1139
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:13.330
get the team on board,
explain why to them and,
and,

1140
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:16.660
and tie that to the bigger purpose of,
of what you're trying to accomplish.

1141
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.560
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's all true.</v>

1142
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.730
I think the book will be helpful to people.
Um,
so yeah,
dichotomy of leadership.

1143
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.200
It's coming out September 25th.
If you want to,
if you want to get some,

1144
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.390
you can get some of that.
We got some Q and a,

1145
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.690
we've got some questions to discuss here.

1146
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:41.200
I'll just jump right into it.
Number one.
What are speaking of that,
this is,

1147
01:07:41.201 --> 01:07:44.140
this is phone together quite nicely.
Question number one,

1148
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:49.320
what are things to look for when you're debating whether to raise your voice or

1149
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:54.280
yell due to those under you being lazy or unmotivated.

1150
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.990
Y'All talk a lot about the importance of self control and not just losing it,

1151
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:04.120
but would you say there's a time and place for raising the intensity while still

1152
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:08.530
being respectful towards your guys?
So there you go.
Yelling and screaming,

1153
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.393
get some.

1154
01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:10.920
<v 4>Sometimes you got to just drop the hammer</v>

1155
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:16.100
Jocko a yelled and at us all the time.
Like I've,

1156
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.510
<v 3>I've,
I've talked about on this,
you know,</v>

1157
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.480
I think on the podcast we started talking about all the time and then the number

1158
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:24.980
of times at Jocko screamed and yelled at me zero,

1159
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.760
zero times in all the years that we worked together.
And,

1160
01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:30.200
and I know I gave him at least dozens,

1161
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:33.950
maybe hundreds of opportunities to want to probably done that.
Uh,

1162
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:37.030
and he didn't do that because he realized that it wasn't effective.
So,
uh,

1163
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:41.030
now listen,
there,
there is,
uh,
there is a time where,
you know,

1164
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:44.540
if there's a major safety issue going on and you're trying to get people's

1165
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:47.110
attention and you want people to cease fire,
uh,

1166
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.550
are you need a rally the truth where you got to raise your voice and get

1167
01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:51.530
people's attention.
Uh,
and I think that's,

1168
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:54.380
you can't be afraid to do that as a leader.
Certainly Times where I'd say,
Hey,

1169
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.170
life could get those Bobby's lined up for there and stuff like that.
I mean,

1170
01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:59.450
for sure.
That's,
is that yelling?
Well,
yeah,

1171
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:04.010
I'm definitely raising my voice and using a loud voice,
but I'm not doing it.

1172
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.630
Whatever with anger,
it's just,
hey,
you got to hear me.
And so,

1173
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.290
and also,
you know,
there's times where you've got to,

1174
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.680
you've got to pick up the intensity and your voice so that people realize

1175
01:09:15.681 --> 01:09:17.570
there's something important happening,
right?

1176
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:21.590
There's just enough now you don't want to yell and scream and get all crazy.

1177
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.390
But to be like,
Hey,
I need vehicles here now.
Like that is different than,
hey,

1178
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:30.050
can you get the vehicles over here?
Now,
those are two different things and you,

1179
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.950
I would react differently if I heard those two voices.
So yes,

1180
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.530
now to go vehicles over here now,

1181
01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:40.010
no one that we're creating a whole panic situation.
But that's a great point too,

1182
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:44.480
right?
And it's,
it's the kind of,
you know,
never cry Wolf,
you know,
story.

1183
01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:47.020
So when,
when you're,
if you're yelling all the time,

1184
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.210
how do you do vehicles over here right now when there's nothing at stake and

1185
01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:53.830
it's no big deal and it's just a routine movement,
you know,

1186
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.530
then when you do that and you really need it,
then no one's paying attention.

1187
01:09:57.531 --> 01:10:00.710
They think,
oh,
it's just Lafe yelling again into the radio.
So,

1188
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.740
so I think that's another reason why I actually have seen Jocko raise his voice

1189
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:09.410
on one occasion.
And,
uh,
when there was a,

1190
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:14.430
a serious issue that needed to be addressed and you needed to get the person's

1191
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:17.000
attention to show just how serious of a situation it was.

1192
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:20.870
And it got everybody's attention.
It got everybody's attention right away,

1193
01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:24.520
cause you never did that.
And when you did do it,
it was like,
oh man.
Yeah,

1194
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:28.970
I was always tell that to leaders like being on the radio and this it goes from

1195
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:30.830
being in a meeting,
right?
If you go to a meeting,

1196
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.650
if you're in charge of a meeting and you talk the whole time and then you have

1197
01:10:33.651 --> 01:10:36.140
something important to say at the end,
well that's great,

1198
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.580
but it's not as impactful as when you say very few things during the meeting and

1199
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.590
then at the end you say,
hey guys,
listen up.

1200
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:45.830
Here's what's going on with us and everyone,
everyone pays attention.

1201
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:49.700
So I've said this before,
the less you talk,
the more people listen.

1202
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.490
And that goes true here.
The more you yell,

1203
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:55.820
the less people listen and it takes away the opportunity.

1204
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.060
If you ever do have to yell,
it's going to have zero impact.

1205
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:04.210
So my blanket statement is you should hardly ever have to raise your voice and

1206
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:10.280
it should just barely ever happen.
Next question.

1207
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.460
It's a long one.
Can you explain

1208
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.690
<v 0>more how you manage to working with the local Iraqi troops?</v>

1209
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.780
General Mattis who I hold in the highest esteem esteem said something to the

1210
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.380
effect that if you are doing anything that negatively impacts relations with

1211
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.910
allied forces,
you are of more use to the enemy than you are to your team.

1212
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.860
This makes it quite obvious that he believes that full cooperation with allied

1213
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:40.050
forces is key to attaining victory.

1214
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.180
It is a well established fact that most of the Iraqi forces were incompetent to

1215
01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:48.510
the point of posing a danger to US troops.

1216
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.770
So what steps did you take to ensure success when working with them?

1217
01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:55.773
<v 4>Well,</v>

1218
01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.060
obviously relations with your allies are critical,
but it's covered move,
right?

1219
01:12:01.061 --> 01:12:03.640
You've got to work together as a team and,
and if you've got,

1220
01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:07.050
if you're working against each other,
that's absolutely catastrophic.
Uh,

1221
01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:11.520
I think for us with Iraqi troops,
you know,
again,
we,

1222
01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:14.960
we talked about how,
uh,
that was liberating,
right?
For,
for,
you know,
the,

1223
01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:16.660
the big pushback was always like this.

1224
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.290
We want to do just seal unilateral operations.

1225
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.180
We call it just seals are just Americans.
Uh,
you know,

1226
01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:26.560
just like NATO ally forces and,
um,
and not work with,

1227
01:12:26.561 --> 01:12:31.530
with the Iraqi troops.
And you know,
when you said that right away at [inaudible],

1228
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.530
listen,
don't even put up a concept of operations,
but if a con ops we call it,

1229
01:12:35.531 --> 01:12:39.700
which is the approval for the plan that doesn't have Iraqi troops on it.
Okay.

1230
01:12:39.701 --> 01:12:41.590
Got It.
We're going to have to figure out a way to make that happen.

1231
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.120
So that was the line was drawn.

1232
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:46.300
We knew we had to do that and we knew it was also important.
I mean,

1233
01:12:46.301 --> 01:12:50.050
cause you explained that,
we talked about it,
we,
we thought through that.
Um,

1234
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:54.130
but obviously we had to take some steps to mitigate that.
So I think there were,

1235
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.120
uh,
there were,
again,
this is the dichotomy.
It's,
you gotta be balanced.
There were,

1236
01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.870
I saw units who thought,
um,
and we gave some examples,

1237
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:06.120
even extreme ownership,
certainly.
Um,
and we talk about regularly about where you,

1238
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.820
you see a unit that would take two or four Americans and a bunch of Iraqis and

1239
01:13:09.821 --> 01:13:12.260
try to go into a really bad area.
I'm like,
man,
you're the,

1240
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.540
you're not going to be able to cancel most Iraqis in the middle of a gunfight

1241
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:16.450
when they're overwhelmed.

1242
01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.350
You better have enough Americans here to have your back.
So,

1243
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:22.180
so they were asking too much of,
of the Iraqis.

1244
01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.100
And then there are other units that didn't want to do,
you know,

1245
01:13:24.101 --> 01:13:25.150
didn't want to have any Iraqis.

1246
01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.740
Willem didn't want have any relationships with them.

1247
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.360
And I had some stern talking to,
you know,
stop talking soon.

1248
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.210
So my guys who wouldn't,
we're weren't treating Iraqi soldiers with respect.

1249
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.440
I threatened one of my guys,

1250
01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:38.020
he was gonna have to go sleep in the Iraqi soldiers barracks.

1251
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:43.000
If he did go shake their hand.
Individual,
who's a great guy,

1252
01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:48.180
I think that was the last threat you had to maybe to make him to think I was

1253
01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:51.980
serious.
The person was like,
I'm totally serious.
They're taking this.
So,

1254
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.500
and you'll,
what?
Props,
props.

1255
01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.400
<v 0>The SF guys,
Mitt teams that go out there and they do,
they live,
they eat a,</v>

1256
01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:00.320
you know,
even even having Dakota Meyer on here,

1257
01:14:00.321 --> 01:14:05.060
he did two meals a day out of three with,
with his Afghan soldiers.
Uh,
that's,

1258
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:07.880
that's awesome.
And you know,

1259
01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:10.910
what I liked about this question was the way that,

1260
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:16.000
that it relates to to the civilian sector.
Because you know what?

1261
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:16.930
I talk about a lot.
I,

1262
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:20.380
a lot of times I talk about how my relationship with my boss,

1263
01:14:20.381 --> 01:14:21.640
regardless of who my boss was,

1264
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:24.010
regardless of my boss was great or my boss was horrible.

1265
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.980
My relationship was always the same.
I was going to have this great,

1266
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:28.780
I was going to build a relationship where they trusted me,

1267
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:31.900
they gave me what I needed to do my job,
and then they let me do my job.

1268
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:35.470
That's the relationship I always had with all my bosses.
Right?
But I,
I,

1269
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:41.790
that same methodology and concept can absolutely be applied to other

1270
01:14:41.891 --> 01:14:46.090
organizations that you're supposed to work with.
So whether it's the army,

1271
01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:49.000
whether it's the marine corps,
whether it's the Iraqi soldiers,

1272
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.840
whether it's the mps,
whether it's the I,
the,
uh,

1273
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:56.890
the Intel people who that Intel organization that you're working with,

1274
01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:00.340
no matter what the organization,
you can build a relationship.
Again,

1275
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.100
might you love that organization?
No,
you might not.

1276
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:05.200
And where I see this all the time,
it will,

1277
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.630
we see it all the time now is with businesses.
Cause guess what?

1278
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:09.290
There's no business that standalone the question,
it's safe.

1279
01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:13.270
There's very few that are completely vertically integrated businesses.

1280
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.170
I mean like an origin,
right?
We don't,
we were pretty vertically integrated.

1281
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.020
But guess what?
We don't grow the cotton.
Like we don't do that.

1282
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:21.670
We don't grow cotton.
But guess what?

1283
01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:24.070
We have a good relationship with the people that grow cotton.

1284
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.730
We have a good relationship with the people at stain,
the conduct or sorry,

1285
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:32.140
die the cotton.
So we build those relationships with those other people.

1286
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.160
Now I work with businesses where there's a supplier that they don't like.

1287
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:40.570
So guess what?
They'd form a hostile relationship with this whole company.

1288
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:45.280
A whole company.
What good does that do them?
It doesn't do him any good at all.

1289
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.890
What it means is they have no personal relationships.

1290
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:52.150
They formed that antagonistic relationship with a whole nother organization and

1291
01:15:52.151 --> 01:15:53.980
it's almost impossible to overcome.

1292
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:58.810
So now this is something where if you don't explain that culture throughout your

1293
01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:01.240
team,
they're going to treat that other team horribly.

1294
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:02.620
And so if you're waiting on supplies,

1295
01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:06.310
if you're on a construction site and you're waiting for materials to be

1296
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:09.100
delivered and you don't have a good relationship with the people that deliver

1297
01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:13.150
the drywall,
and now the drywall is running late for whatever reason,

1298
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:17.610
and you call you,
you fly off the handle or whatever,
you're,

1299
01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:21.580
you're not going to get that dry wall any earlier.
It's not happening.

1300
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:26.200
Have you ever,
you know when I call customer service,
right?
Customer survey.

1301
01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:28.450
I learned this when I was working for them for the animal working from the

1302
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.430
admiral's aid,
I'd call up,

1303
01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:35.440
we traveled a lot and I'd have to call up whatever Delta or American,

1304
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:36.544
whoever,

1305
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:41.670
and I'd be trying to get whatever seats on an aircraft or something or a flight

1306
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:45.010
that was full,
whatever,
get him an upgrade,
whatever.

1307
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:49.870
And you know,
I'd say,
hey,
how you doing?
That's what always,

1308
01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:53.110
I always start off with the,
with the,
cause they're gone.
American airline,

1309
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:54.460
how can I help you?
And they're mad,
right?

1310
01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:58.570
They're just mad to start with how the gate,
their mat,

1311
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:02.530
whatever you know,
airline,
whatever,
car rental service,

1312
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.310
whatever restaurant we like.
People are just mad.
They don't care.
They're mad,

1313
01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:09.620
they don't know who you are.
Well they actually,
they've just talked to probably,

1314
01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:09.891
you know,

1315
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:12.680
the last 25 people who have screamed and yelled and screamed and yelled at him

1316
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.130
and it's awful.
So you know,
you,
you call them and say,
hey,
how's it going?

1317
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.380
And you know,
I always,
I had little head,

1318
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:22.880
little Mike wrote jokes that I would make with the airlines that I used it with

1319
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:26.240
all of them all the time.
One of them was,
I'd say,
they'd say,
well,

1320
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:29.720
do you need to do you need to sit next to your boss?
And I'd say,
you know what,

1321
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:32.300
I'd honestly appreciate it if you put me as far away from it.

1322
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:34.130
And they'd laugh and then they try and hook me up.

1323
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:35.840
Even though my boss was a great guy and I'd sit with him all day.

1324
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:40.040
But it was a funny thing and it,
it,
it humanized me with them.

1325
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:41.540
They thought I was rich,
some poor,

1326
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:45.110
sorry bastard that had to travel with his boss and then they were trying to take

1327
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:48.320
care of me.
It was like awesome.
So I would get the hookups.

1328
01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:53.321
I remember one time I went up and I had a conversation on the phone with someone

1329
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.240
and then of course this is different because it was live,

1330
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.170
but I had a conversation,
they're like,
no,
it can't get you on that flight.

1331
01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:00.170
And then I went up to the counter and I was like,
hey,
how you doing?

1332
01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:03.320
I'm trying to get me in my boss on this flight and we're trying to get there.

1333
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:07.340
And he's like,
there's cross,
like,
you know,
do you need to go to?
I'm like,

1334
01:18:07.341 --> 01:18:11.480
well look,
if we don't get there,
here's the deal.
If you can just get my boss on,

1335
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.930
that's great.
If,
if neither one of us get get on this flight,

1336
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:19.640
it's been nice knowing you because I'm screwed.

1337
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:21.980
And she just started laughing and again humanized it.

1338
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.290
And then it's like all of a sudden she's like,
oh,
guess what we can,

1339
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.440
we're going to pump some of these or whatever and she's making room and we're on

1340
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:28.274
the flight.

1341
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:33.370
So don't develop this antagonistic relationship with another organization with

1342
01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:37.700
Iraqi soldiers.
Like,
is it great working with Iraqi soldiers?
No,
it's socks.

1343
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:41.510
It's hard.
But guess what?
That's what we have to do.

1344
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.000
And I'll tell you something else strategically,

1345
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:50.100
the Iraqi soldiers that are descendants of the guys that we train to me,

1346
01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:53.810
maybe not,
I'm saying training or,
or training descendants,
right?

1347
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:55.040
The guys that we trained,

1348
01:18:55.130 --> 01:19:00.130
trained guys who just went and fought back and got Ramadi back from Isis and

1349
01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:01.910
gotten miserable back from Isis.

1350
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:04.530
Those are the guys that went in there and did the bulk of it.

1351
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.840
Did they get supported by Americans?
Yes.

1352
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:09.800
Did Americans do a kickass job of doing massive fire support?
Yes,

1353
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:11.510
but the guys that were moving from street to street,

1354
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.680
those were majority Iraqi soldiers.
Did they have a special ops guys with them?

1355
01:19:15.681 --> 01:19:16.190
Yes,

1356
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.340
but it was a majority of the people that were moving through the streets were

1357
01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:24.341
Iraqi soldiers and there's no way possible that wouldn't have happened if

1358
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.810
American coalition forces over the last,
whatever it was,
10 years,

1359
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:34.100
12 years,
would have taken those guys and made them work and done the,

1360
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.730
the type of partner missions that we did with them.
So it was,

1361
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:41.570
and when I say again,
when I say we,
I'm not talking about us,
the seal teams,

1362
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.470
I'm talking about everyone.
Everyone made this concerted effort.

1363
01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.850
And it ended up being a great call because when those guys went out to,

1364
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.410
to finally have to fight to take these cities back,
they were able to do it,

1365
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.530
not totally by themselves,
but they were able to do it.
They did it.

1366
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.320
And that's a vast improvement.
If we would've sent,

1367
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:05.360
if we would've sent the Iraqi troops as they were when we were in Ramadi into

1368
01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:07.920
Missoula,
they would've gotten decimated.

1369
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.890
So it's a credit to the u s military.

1370
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:14.040
It's a credit to the Iraqi military that they have now gotten up to speed where

1371
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:14.880
they can push forward.

1372
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:18.450
And it's a credit to the u s military and other coalition forces that work with

1373
01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:19.860
them to get them up to speed.

1374
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.100
And what that all boils back to is forming relationships with the people that

1375
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:29.490
you are dependent on.
Not just the people,
but the organizations.

1376
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.193
That's all I'm saying.

1377
01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:37.750
<v 4>We learned the lesson.
It's,
it's,
let's do,
uh,
let's use them for their strengths.</v>

1378
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:40.680
And,
and that's what we learned at Ramadi.
Uh,
we,

1379
01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:43.300
we put them in situations where they could succeed.
Uh,

1380
01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:46.000
we took enough Americans where we could actually succeed and,
and,
and,

1381
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:50.560
and help them succeed.
And,
uh,
and of course we put some,
uh,
you know,

1382
01:20:50.561 --> 01:20:54.010
some efforts to mitigate risks to with,
with,
uh,
all,
we always had armed guys.

1383
01:20:54.011 --> 01:20:57.470
He always had guys looking around.
We always present it a,
you know,
a hard target.

1384
01:20:57.471 --> 01:20:59.710
If one of those guys decided that they wanted to,
you know,

1385
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:03.450
start batting for the other team and uh,
you know,
we were in a position to,

1386
01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:06.190
to handle those problems and we never had an issue as a result.
But that's,

1387
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:09.640
that's what you have to do is it's all about building coalitions and,
and,
and,

1388
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.410
and using people's strengths and complimenting those strengths and working

1389
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.150
together as a team.
It's,
it's government.
If you don't do that,
you're going to,

1390
01:21:16.151 --> 01:21:16.940
you're going to fail.

1391
01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.610
<v 0>Yeah.
And to all you people at the airlines.
Thank you.</v>

1392
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.610
Thank you for taking care of me over the years.
Appreciate it.
Next question,

1393
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.860
Jocko.
Leif and echo,

1394
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:34.520
your opinion has been solicited on this leadership question right here.

1395
01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:35.870
So we'll see how that works out.

1396
01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:41.040
A good leader ensures his team understands what their goals are and why there

1397
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:42.530
are performing tasks.

1398
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.750
But how do you balance doing this with not being the leader that talks so much

1399
01:21:47.751 --> 01:21:49.580
that the team stops listening?
We did.

1400
01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:52.460
We just covered this for a long period of time.
Pretty much it didn't we,

1401
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:54.930
I guess we can leave it at this echo.

1402
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:58.580
Do you agree with what we said earlier or do you have a different opinion about

1403
01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:03.530
talking too much and mind you,
you've said a lot today,
so don't be,

1404
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:06.920
don't get,
don't get crazy over here or we'll stop listening.

1405
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.600
The guy who talks too much,
no less is more a hundred percent go.
I agree.

1406
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.550
There you go.
I like it.
I will say it.
Musters a win.

1407
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:24.850
<v 4>Echos echo his words to the audience.
Um,
he always gives an epic speech.</v>

1408
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:28.870
W have have solicited probably the greatest applause of everyone out there.

1409
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.840
<v 0>Yeah.
Matt fee.</v>

1410
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:35.290
I guess to dig in this a little bit of how to balance that with being a leader

1411
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.583
that talks too much.

1412
01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.590
I think you've got to pay attention to what the reactions are you getting from

1413
01:22:39.591 --> 01:22:40.410
people,
right?

1414
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:43.130
You've got to pay attention to the reactions you're getting from people.

1415
01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.300
If the people are not totally,
uh,

1416
01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:51.590
actively listening to you,
right?
If they're not actively listening to you,

1417
01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.330
if they're taking notes,

1418
01:22:53.331 --> 01:22:55.430
if they're looking at their phone or what not taking notes,

1419
01:22:55.431 --> 01:22:58.240
but if they're looking at their phone or whatever,
then you're,

1420
01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.680
you're talking too much.
Keep it short,

1421
01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:04.940
keep it concise and people will listen to you more also that,
um,

1422
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.710
<v 6>when you say you got to pay attention to yourself,
that's like a deep one.</v>

1423
01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.790
It's like you just said it really simply like,
hey,

1424
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.940
just pay attention to yourself.
I mean,
you didn't say it like that,

1425
01:23:14.941 --> 01:23:17.670
but that's what it felt like.
That's the hardest part right there.

1426
01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:19.230
Because a lot of times like,
hey,

1427
01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:23.010
me and life are talking and lay starts looking at his phone.
I'm not thinking,

1428
01:23:23.011 --> 01:23:25.800
Hey,
I'm talking too much.
I'm saying what I'm saying.
It's not interesting enough.

1429
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:26.551
So I need,

1430
01:23:26.551 --> 01:23:30.750
so I need to say some more cool stuff or I need to be more this or more of that

1431
01:23:30.751 --> 01:23:33.870
because I'm losing them kind of thing.
Like if I'm losing you,

1432
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.490
the intuitive thought is not to completely disconnect and stop talking and

1433
01:23:38.491 --> 01:23:42.370
that's not the intuitive thought seems saying when you're in a situation,
Joe,

1434
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:44.670
you got to pay attention to that kind of stuff on yourself.

1435
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.690
<v 3>Jocko does this all the time.
What do I do?
Like the buses,</v>

1436
01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.710
phone out and start sorting emails,
whatever action.
You know what I got?
Okay,

1437
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:56.240
cool.
I guess our conversations,
I do that to Dean and dean lister,

1438
01:23:56.241 --> 01:24:00.980
so dean,
Dean,
Jack Deans,
really important stuff we're talking about here.

1439
01:24:00.981 --> 01:24:04.340
He's like,
yeah,
no.
What Dean does though,
see if it makes him mad.
Right?

1440
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:08.990
He's got the,
he's got the pet peeve.
So Dean will be telling us something.

1441
01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:13.490
And so you're doing it on purpose to get under your skin?
Uh,
no.

1442
01:24:13.491 --> 01:24:17.360
Sometimes he's saying some rambling stuff.
Right?
And I'm,
I've got stuff going on,

1443
01:24:17.361 --> 01:24:19.100
Dean,
come on.
I know you're listening to this bro.

1444
01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:23.420
But sometimes he'll be saying something to me and all of a sudden I'll like,

1445
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:25.410
I'll like look around and,

1446
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.640
and now I realize I'll just be watching people do you just because we're

1447
01:24:28.641 --> 01:24:29.930
normally on the mat with this happens.

1448
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:33.410
So he's telling me something like looking me in the eyes and he's like,
you know,

1449
01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:34.550
when the ancient blah blah blah blah,

1450
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:39.500
he'll be telling me about the Peloponnesian war or something or whatever.
And,

1451
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:40.910
and as I'm listening to them,

1452
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.900
I'll kind of look and like start looking at someone that's training or looking

1453
01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:47.300
at something and he'll,
he'll like attack me.

1454
01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:52.670
They went through a period where he would just attack me and like take me down

1455
01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.950
and just start,
you know,
going psycho on me.

1456
01:24:54.951 --> 01:24:57.710
So that got me tuned up there,

1457
01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.580
got me turned up where I try and give dean some more attention.
I like that.

1458
01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:05.160
I think that's a,
I think that's a good,
do you feel like,

1459
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.750
<v 6>like when he starts doing this,
none of the Bro,
I see what you're doing.
Well,</v>

1460
01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:09.350
the thing is though,

1461
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:14.210
that I think you're in the same boat lake where I know you kind of know now like

1462
01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.720
in everyday life with other people,
you might think,
I mean intuitively anyway,

1463
01:25:17.721 --> 01:25:18.890
like,
Oh,
I'm losing them or whatever.

1464
01:25:18.891 --> 01:25:22.430
But you can tell with him if he starts doing that stuff and you're like,
okay,

1465
01:25:22.431 --> 01:25:25.130
and he's either or,
yeah,
move on or something.

1466
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:29.610
<v 3>But it's only because,
you know,
listen,
if you can give me 35 more seconds,</v>

1467
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.160
we'll be on this.
You can move on and do whatever you need to.

1468
01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:37.410
I will say that's a bad characteristic that I have where I can do that.

1469
01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:39.390
Sometimes I'm done listening to you,

1470
01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:42.750
so wrap it up all the time.

1471
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:47.910
All right,
next question for life.

1472
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:52.380
This is the heavy one.
You know what?

1473
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:58.920
All right.
Life in and out Burger or water burger.

1474
01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:02.430
Dude,
I do not want to go there man.

1475
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:06.830
That is too much as like double rainbow,
too much,
much man.

1476
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:14.180
This is,
uh,
I,
I gotta,
I gotta tell you,
look,
obviously I'm from Texas.

1477
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:17.090
Water burgers are all over the place and water burgers are awesome.

1478
01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:20.520
You can't go wrong with water burger,
um,
in and out is,
uh,

1479
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.720
is pretty tough to beat though.
It's a,
there's something special about the in,

1480
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:25.040
and I used to have,
um,
you know,

1481
01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:28.940
over in Pacific Beach I had a storage unit over there and there's like,

1482
01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.530
my storage unit was like real,
those are good burgers.

1483
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.873
The uh,

1484
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.450
my storage unit was like kick the exhaust wreck right back up into the,

1485
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:47.690
so,
so like the exhaust blasting in your face,
you know,
from like 25 yards,

1486
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:50.300
30 yards away.
Yeah.
As I'm like,
they're in my storage unit,

1487
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:53.960
unload surfboards or whatever and I was like double,
double.

1488
01:26:53.961 --> 01:26:57.410
We're getting some terrible.
So yeah,
in and outs are awesome.
I like,
it's,

1489
01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:00.080
it's tough to beat.
I'm a huge fan of that.
And I will say this though,

1490
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:05.660
where's the meat man?
Come on those burgers.
You gotta put what?
A Burger.

1491
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.480
They've got a lot more,
more patty to him.
Well,

1492
01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:12.470
apparently you're not ordering the triple,
triple,
quadruple,
quadruple

1493
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:19.220
my,
my kids after they would cut weight for wrestling during wrestling season,

1494
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:23.240
I spent more money in and out burger during wrestling season because after they

1495
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:26.420
cut weight and then they wrestle all day and then you're going home and all they

1496
01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:29.600
want to do is go in and out burger and it helped broker in n out burger.
Yeah.

1497
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.490
See it.
Cutting weight for me is the various,

1498
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.100
I mean playing football and it's like,
man,

1499
01:27:34.101 --> 01:27:39.040
you want to be as big and fat as a class.
We can crush food.
Check.

1500
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:42.950
All right.
Speaking of,
well I guess speaking of Combat Sports,

1501
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:47.330
next question six.
This is a Jujitsu question.

1502
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:51.860
Should instructors not teach white belts,

1503
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:57.200
Aka Leif Babin,
David Burke and JP Denelle.
That's cold blooded.

1504
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:59.520
It's a good deal team.
That is good deal.

1505
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.160
Should instructors not teach white belts certain techniques or should,

1506
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:12.260
why they shouldn't do them be explained,

1507
01:28:12.261 --> 01:28:14.660
but still expose the white belts to techniques.

1508
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:15.980
So not the white belts recognize them.

1509
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.850
So there's some techniques that you don't get taught very often as a white belt.

1510
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.350
For instance,
a heel hook.

1511
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.360
I believe that it is good to not teach people.

1512
01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.840
I teach white belts to do heal hooks because the,

1513
01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.920
for example,
heel hooks can be very dangerous.

1514
01:28:33.921 --> 01:28:36.530
The reason that they're dangerous because they don't hurt a lot before they

1515
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:37.873
injure you.

1516
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.360
And so white belts who are by nature completely insane and going crazy and going

1517
01:28:45.321 --> 01:28:48.260
nuts.
And so when they get ahold of something,
they just go as hard as they can.

1518
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:50.180
And by the way,
they're usually going against the white belt.

1519
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:52.220
That's the only reason they're getting anything on him because the ground gets

1520
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:55.010
wiped off and another white belts going completely insane and he's not going to

1521
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:59.270
tap.
And so what happens?
You get the triple,
triple Lindy,
right?

1522
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:03.480
ACL,
MCL,
PCL tear game over.

1523
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:05.520
This guy's never trained in Jujitsu again,

1524
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.580
or this guy's not training Jiu Jitsu for two years or whatever.

1525
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.780
So is it smart to not teach them?
Yes,
it is.

1526
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:16.380
However,
dichotomy,
balance.

1527
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:19.710
Should you just never show them what they are?
No,
you should.

1528
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.200
You should explain to them,
hey,
this is what the move is.
This is,

1529
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.350
this is why we don't teach him.
The other thing that,

1530
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:27.720
this is why we don't teach them cause you can get hurt and when you get a little

1531
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:29.490
bit more advanced and you learn to relax a little bit more,

1532
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:32.820
we'll teach you some of these,
these techniques that are slightly more dangerous.

1533
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:38.450
Dean always freaks out because you saying that a heal hook is more dangerous

1534
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:40.740
than a,
than a camera.

1535
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:44.510
I mean if you asked me what I wanted to have somebody just go berserk on a

1536
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:47.460
camera on me or he'll look,
I'd probably pick the heel hook.

1537
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.780
Right because then you,

1538
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:52.470
you still have shoulder mobility whereas [inaudible] that's,

1539
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:55.820
that's just if someone goes nuts on a computer and just rips your arm,

1540
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:59.730
your shoulder apart,
what would you rather have the heel hook for?
Sure.
Yeah.

1541
01:29:59.731 --> 01:30:02.160
I'm thinking too,
look all day long.
So,

1542
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.030
but for some reason it's kind of a rough choice there.
That is a rough choice.

1543
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:09.210
That is a rough choice.
That's not a choice you want to be making.

1544
01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:10.710
Cause either one of them is not good,

1545
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:15.000
but I think you can do a better job of replacing the knee and getting them neve

1546
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:19.320
squared away.
Then you can the shoulder,
there's no the shoulders tough.

1547
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:22.890
But for some reason the Camaro's everyone you're learning Camaro day one,

1548
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.061
day three,

1549
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:27.330
you're learning cmera and you could definitely trash someone's shoulder,

1550
01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.470
but it hurts.
It does hurt then that's beneficial.

1551
01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.530
Chill is going to have way more flexibility of being your,

1552
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:39.030
literally your knee twisting the joint that you can't be like,
hey,

1553
01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:41.680
I wouldn't feel it unless you get some because doing,
doing today.

1554
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.070
So you got guys who can do shoulder,
you know,

1555
01:30:47.071 --> 01:30:50.040
there's varying levels of shoulder flexibility.

1556
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.800
And then that also goes for the like the pain tolerance as well.

1557
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.740
It needs less wait lists from,
from a wide belt perspective.

1558
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.950
There's so much to learn.
And the more I try,

1559
01:30:59.951 --> 01:31:04.890
the more I realize how little I actually know and how much more there is that,

1560
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:10.140
I mean why I would,
I would,
I would,
I'd rather focus on,
you know,
uh,
on the more,

1561
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:13.100
uh,
the more foundational aspects of the game.
And,

1562
01:31:13.101 --> 01:31:14.940
and until I can get those a little bit better,

1563
01:31:14.941 --> 01:31:16.410
I think that makes a lot of sense to me.

1564
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:19.260
I think you might be the bull white belt right now if the world,

1565
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.040
so then in the navy,
the ensign,

1566
01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:26.760
which is the lowest ranking and sin add a ship or a seal team,

1567
01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.710
he gets called the bull ensign,

1568
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.910
which means he's been the junior guy for the longest amount of time.

1569
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:38.130
And you've been trading for quite some while you start sharing with me in 2005,

1570
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:43.110
right?
Yep.
Then your train before me with Fabio,
I turned a few tubs.
Oh,
okay.

1571
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.790
So you've been training since oh three Oh four.
That's been a long time.

1572
01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.600
Most of that,
14 years.
Most of that 14 years.
Uh,

1573
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:57.930
I would say I've been seriously training for,
probably probably like back at it,

1574
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.310
you know,
pretty consistently

1575
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:04.150
<v 7>in a mobile times a week for a year and a half.
Okay.
Years.
You're in a zone,</v>

1576
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:06.520
you're in the zone.
You'd be getting up Blue Bouchee at some point.

1577
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:11.050
Todd white down in Texas.
I'm going to crack it out.
Possibly.
I don't know.

1578
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:15.040
Maybe you're not ready though.
I'll maybe Todd white.
I'm definitely not ready.

1579
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:18.940
He's looking at you going,
no,
you got nothing.
You got nothing.

1580
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.080
Check.
So yeah,
that's,
I think the deal.
Same thing with same thing.
Uh,

1581
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:28.600
the other problem with teaching a person,
for instance,

1582
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:33.340
heel hooks is then they think that that's the solution to the guard and it's not

1583
01:32:33.341 --> 01:32:36.790
the solution to the guard.
It's a solution to the guard.

1584
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:39.820
It's one possible,
one,
one,

1585
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.830
one small possible on a solution.
There's many,
many more.
And there's others,

1586
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:49.850
as you said,
life that are more fundamental.
So it's,

1587
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:53.560
that's my,
that's my answer.
Yeah.
That thing.
How do you say the,

1588
01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.520
like let them know what it is.
Yeah.

1589
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:59.890
And when you consider an actual typical white belt class,

1590
01:32:59.891 --> 01:33:03.970
the hill probably not going to be introduced in any significant capacity at all.

1591
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:04.211
Like,

1592
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:08.260
no one's going to choose to spend time in a whiter white belt class to teach a

1593
01:33:08.261 --> 01:33:11.620
heel hook typically is nothing happening.
But like the control thing,
right?
Like,

1594
01:33:11.621 --> 01:33:12.580
you know,
you get an even a,

1595
01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:17.170
a good blue belt who's been in for a long time per up purple belt and up.

1596
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.720
They're going to know the control and the heel hook.
Like if I,
you know,

1597
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:24.220
a purple belt does,
he'll look on you.
The risk of you getting injured,

1598
01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:26.710
unless you don't tap or something like that is pretty low.

1599
01:33:26.711 --> 01:33:30.010
It's gonna be pretty low because they know that control of just their whole body

1600
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:33.340
and you know you should tap.
Exactly right.
Yes.
So the white belt,

1601
01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.350
they don't even have control.
Very important.

1602
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.970
They don't have control or they have a lot less control in everything.

1603
01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:43.510
By the way,
even the strong possibility,
they have zero,
very strong.

1604
01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.220
But that's with everything.
Like even on a defending I take down or defendant,

1605
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:51.580
it's like,
so out of Chi as a blue belt,
I heal hooked.

1606
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:56.410
A friend of mine and I heard him and,
and I didn't,

1607
01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:01.480
it wasn't even,
he was,
he was,
he was a no nothing right.
And we're going.

1608
01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:05.980
And I just started learning heel hooks and I put a heel hook on them and we were

1609
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:10.030
overseas and I put a heel hook on him and he wasn't tapping.

1610
01:34:10.031 --> 01:34:12.730
And I was kind of like,
oh,
that's weird.
You know,
why isn't it happening?

1611
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:15.760
So I went a little bit harder and then all of a sudden there was a little pop

1612
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:20.710
and I let go.
And I was like,
and yeah,
but you know,
he was a seal.

1613
01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:24.270
And so he was like,
all this isn't going to work on me.
It doesn't hurt.

1614
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:28.030
And all of a sudden I wasn't going nuts because like I said,
I was a blue belt.

1615
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:32.350
I was in pretty good control.
But even I didn't realize at that time,
oh,

1616
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:37.600
this will injure him before it will cause pain,

1617
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:42.670
which is a bad thing to have to have.
So yeah,
these kids,
I mean he's got his,

1618
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:47.050
if there,
no one has control over anything by the way,
any,
any of their moves.

1619
01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:50.160
And they're doing heel hooks as a normal thing.
Like,
Oh yeah,
we did,

1620
01:34:50.170 --> 01:34:52.570
we got taught this and stuff.
And it's effective.
You know,

1621
01:34:52.571 --> 01:34:55.690
like a lot of submissions and he'll hook then a lot of foot locks or one of

1622
01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:58.010
those ones where you have to gain

1623
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.290
<v 6>the position to,
to go for that submission.</v>

1624
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.220
You have to work a lot less than like an arm bar where you have to actually pass

1625
01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:05.750
someone's guard and you know,

1626
01:35:05.751 --> 01:35:08.210
getting even site control but a lot of time to get to them,
you know,

1627
01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:10.970
you've got to work more to get into the position with your hooks.
Not,

1628
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:14.450
not so much like that.
So if you know,
throw it at him.
Yeah.

1629
01:35:14.451 --> 01:35:18.200
You can just throw it out there and you throw in the lack of control.
Yeah man.

1630
01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:21.260
See in increase the chance for injury for sure.

1631
01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:24.510
<v 0>All right,
next question.</v>

1632
01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.890
I am a 66 year old police chief and crossfit athlete.

1633
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:31.020
Is your muster doable for me?

1634
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:36.110
<v 4>Absolutely.
Yeah,
you,
there'll be,
there'll be plenty of people,
uh,</v>

1635
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:40.820
who are in your age group and um,
there's no question that a,

1636
01:35:40.821 --> 01:35:44.480
you should come and join us from Oster get after it.
If you're your police chief,

1637
01:35:44.481 --> 01:35:46.310
your crossfit athlete,
you can more,

1638
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:51.560
more than get after it with the four 45 club workouts are,
are uh,
voluntary.

1639
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:56.480
Uh,
we usually have,
I mean,
we probably have what,
you know,
80,
85% participation.

1640
01:35:56.481 --> 01:35:58.340
I mean,
it's massive.
Uh,
but they're,

1641
01:35:58.341 --> 01:35:59.960
they're designed so that really anybody can do it.

1642
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:04.270
We have people with top level athletes down to,
you know,
folks who look like the,

1643
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.490
probably hadn't been in the gym a whole lot.
[inaudible] start again.

1644
01:36:07.491 --> 01:36:09.380
So I remember one guy that was,

1645
01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.730
<v 0>I'm heading in for double knee surgery in a week and so I'm just,</v>

1646
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:13.920
and he was an older guy,
you know,

1647
01:36:13.921 --> 01:36:16.880
that it had been out of the gym for a bit and he was out there,
like you said,

1648
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:17.360
the,

1649
01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.360
the workouts are scalable to the individual that's participating in the,

1650
01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.470
in the event.
And so we had all,

1651
01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.650
every level you can come to the monster in any,

1652
01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.610
literally in any physical condition,
you can come to the muster and you can,

1653
01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:36.840
you can get after it with us.
Next question.

1654
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:43.390
I find meetings of greater than or equal to eight people,

1655
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:49.210
far less productive than smaller groups.
Even with Straw,

1656
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.790
with a structured action oriented agenda.

1657
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:58.280
Is there a maximum amount of people you'd involve in a strategic or tactical

1658
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:59.420
planning group?

1659
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1660
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.480
<v 4>I don't think,
I don't think there is a maximum amount.</v>

1661
01:37:05.481 --> 01:37:08.000
I think it just has to be controlled.
And you gotta have,

1662
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.270
you gotta have some decentralized command where people understand if there's

1663
01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:15.230
just a bunch of people at a meeting and everyone's kind of speaking in,
in turn,

1664
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.320
um,
and talking over each other,
you're not gonna get anything done.

1665
01:37:18.321 --> 01:37:20.600
So you've got to have,
there's got to be one leader who's running that.

1666
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:24.590
There's gotta be some,
some,
you know,
some other,
uh,
uh,
subordinate leaders that,

1667
01:37:24.591 --> 01:37:25.241
uh,
and,

1668
01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:29.180
and one person's got to drive that meeting and make sure that when someone

1669
01:37:29.181 --> 01:37:31.370
starts going down a rabbit hole,
okay,

1670
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:34.070
you guys have a sidebar conversation afterward.

1671
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.150
Let's keep this meeting focused and less.

1672
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.340
And ultimately the decision maker who can focus the team on a single course of

1673
01:37:40.341 --> 01:37:41.270
action,
get her by behind them.

1674
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:42.990
<v 0>I agree.</v>

1675
01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.810
And there's certainly times where you can bring too many people in to try and

1676
01:37:45.811 --> 01:37:46.770
figure something out.
I mean,

1677
01:37:46.771 --> 01:37:50.190
that can certainly happen and we have the good idea fairies that keep coming

1678
01:37:50.191 --> 01:37:52.430
around with their good ideas and [inaudible] well,
what if we did it?

1679
01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.293
I wonder if we did that.

1680
01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.610
There's also an interesting dynamic that you pointed out that ties into a

1681
01:37:56.611 --> 01:38:00.270
question that we had earlier or something that we were talking about earlier,

1682
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.160
which is,
okay,

1683
01:38:02.161 --> 01:38:04.980
so let's say we have a meeting and there's 15 people in that meeting.

1684
01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.830
If the leader of that meeting,

1685
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.920
then we'll say steps down into the position of being the,

1686
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.940
the director of the meeting itself.

1687
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.060
Guess what he's doing the whole time he's talking,

1688
01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:23.640
he's pulling things he's getting and what he's doing while he's doing that,

1689
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:26.070
as he's getting in the weeds of what's going on.

1690
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:28.320
So as he's getting in the weeds of what's going on,

1691
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:30.480
he's losing this strategic vision.

1692
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.830
And so if there's 20 people in a meeting and you as the leader are going,
okay,

1693
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:36.990
what do you think?
What do you think?
What do you thinking?
Hey,
no,

1694
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:40.500
let's get it refocused.
When you're doing all that traffic copping,

1695
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.710
you're actually losing your strategic altitude.

1696
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.230
You're not going to be able to see and make a good clear decision.

1697
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:50.160
So if there's 30 40 50 people in a meeting,

1698
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:55.530
and you as the leader get down in the weeds and get down in the trenches and you

1699
01:38:55.531 --> 01:38:59.070
start throwing down with everyone,
well,
it's not going to take very long.

1700
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.220
Well you're just,
you're just one of the troops and you don't see anything.

1701
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.140
Whereas if you let,

1702
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.680
let one of the other leaders let one of the subordinate leaders let them step
up,

1703
01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:10.510
let them start to do their thing,
let them do the direction of meaning.

1704
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.040
And you might even tell him,
hey,
run this meeting.
I would do that.
I'd be like,

1705
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:15.300
Hey,
you run this meeting.

1706
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.290
And then you let them get in there in the trenches and left them try and sort

1707
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:19.980
out ideas and they,

1708
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.250
their mind gets filled with a bunch of crap and meanwhile you're in the meeting,

1709
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:24.220
you're just not running it.

1710
01:39:24.630 --> 01:39:28.800
So there's a big difference between running the meeting and overseeing the

1711
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:31.920
meeting or being in the meeting or being the leading leader of a meeting.

1712
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.730
So if we're going through a kill house or if we're going,

1713
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:38.490
if we're going through a kill house,
that's a good example,
which is,
you know,
the,

1714
01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.020
with a building with a bunch of rooms in it,

1715
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:44.130
if as the leader you don't say,
Hey,

1716
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:46.880
I'm going to run this kill house.
I'm not gonna,
I'm not,

1717
01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:49.320
I'm not going to direct the movement for the kill house.

1718
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:50.490
Cause then guess what you're doing,

1719
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.530
you're directing the movement through the kill house.

1720
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:55.890
What you want to do is take a step back and say,

1721
01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.240
hey you third,
fourth,
fifth and the chain of command.

1722
01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:04.770
You run this kill house,
you run the train and now that guy goes,
okay,
cool,

1723
01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:07.560
I got it.
And now while he's running the train,
doing the work,

1724
01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.500
you're stepped back at altitude,
you can see what's going on,

1725
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:13.620
you can hear the frustration,
you can hear shots fired,

1726
01:40:13.621 --> 01:40:17.130
you know where people are moving,
then you become,
you are the real leader.

1727
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.290
So same thing in a meeting.

1728
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.710
If the dynamics of the meeting or you get more than 10 people,
15 people,

1729
01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.110
and what you're doing is you're down there directing traffic,

1730
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:26.910
it's going to be really problematic for you.

1731
01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.420
If you have a meeting with 15 or 20 people and you tell someone else to direct

1732
01:40:32.941 --> 01:40:37.230
the meeting and run the meeting and you take a step up and you simply observe,

1733
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.180
you're going to have a better time

1734
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.030
feeling like the meeting is effective and you will get the benefit of hearing

1735
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:46.950
all these different voices,
which is good,

1736
01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:49.980
which is good to hear all these different opinions and voices and be able to

1737
01:40:49.981 --> 01:40:53.520
pick through and sort through and that's going to give you more benefit than it.

1738
01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.413
You know what

1739
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:56.440
<v 3>I get?
There's too much going on in this meeting,</v>

1740
01:40:56.441 --> 01:40:59.710
only giving me two people and we'll make the decisions.
Well,
there's some people,

1741
01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:03.580
number of number,
the six person,
that person had a good input,
right?

1742
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:08.170
The 12th person might've had some good input.
So again,
is there balance?
Yes.

1743
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.770
Are there certain decisions that you kind of need to take and really dive down

1744
01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:13.810
and with a small group?
Absolutely,

1745
01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:18.850
but is it good sometimes to let things air out and let someone run a meeting and

1746
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:22.480
you listen and you learn kind of what the overall atmosphere atmospherics of the

1747
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:27.370
situation are?
Absolutely.
That's my answer.
I think it's great,

1748
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:30.310
but it helps people.
It helps people to listen to you as well.
Right?

1749
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:33.100
I mean when if if you're the boss and you're just sitting back and you're not

1750
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:35.140
saying anything and then all of a sudden you're like,
hey guys,

1751
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.930
we're getting way off topic here.
This is what we need to do.

1752
01:41:37.931 --> 01:41:41.380
Here's the direction we need to go.
Got It.
Everyone's back on track.

1753
01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.460
Whereas if you're in the middle of it,
then yeah,

1754
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:46.050
people are just automatically kind of doing their,

1755
01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:48.140
I'm sure we've said this before,
and I know we talked about earlier too,

1756
01:41:48.141 --> 01:41:51.220
but like when I would say something on the radio and tasking at bruiser,

1757
01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:53.860
when I would say like a legitimate thing,

1758
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:58.780
Manny would happen if I got on and said everyone get to building 34 now,

1759
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.140
people would go and I,
one of my favorite things to do,

1760
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:04.660
one of my favorite conversations to have on the radio with,

1761
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:09.550
with either you or stoner was like,
I remember you'd be like,
you'd say,

1762
01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:10.091
Hey Jocko,

1763
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:13.540
we've got another mover where I want to take down building 34 and I'd come up

1764
01:42:13.541 --> 01:42:15.730
and go do it.
But that was all I'd ever set be like,

1765
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.990
do it just like go because I'm not trying to talk.
Right.

1766
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:24.730
I got these guys,
got their situations handled.
Hey,
he's going outside of,

1767
01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:26.250
it's something that we planned.
Hey Jack,

1768
01:42:26.251 --> 01:42:31.240
I want to build a move to building 34 and take that thing down.
Do it not,

1769
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.680
well,
why do you want to do that?

1770
01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:34.540
You know why he wants to do it because he's got a good reason.

1771
01:42:34.541 --> 01:42:37.360
He's not asking me that because it's a fantasy that he thinks it's going to be

1772
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:40.240
cool.
No,
there's a reason.
And he'll explain that to me later.

1773
01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.430
And if it was something where he's like,
I want to,
you know,

1774
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:45.700
start doing jumping jacks out here,
then I might ask why,

1775
01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.300
because that doesn't make much sense to me.
But to say,
hey,
we're gonna take,

1776
01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.380
we're gonna hit building 34 as well.
What if we were doing burpees with de,

1777
01:42:53.381 --> 01:42:55.690
would that make more sense?
That makes it a little more sense,

1778
01:42:56.330 --> 01:43:00.520
a little more sense than jumping jacks.
That absolutely works.

1779
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.730
It worked for us when you,
when you said some over the radio,
like got it.

1780
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:08.590
We're good.
Like it is the decision made.
Everyone's on board and uh,
I think it's,

1781
01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:13.240
it's something that you've got to,
you've got to focus on what,

1782
01:43:13.241 --> 01:43:16.210
like when a leader talks,
it should matter and,
and I think you can be,

1783
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:17.590
you gotta be really careful about that.

1784
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.150
And I've certainly been a chief violator that of like going off to dip too many

1785
01:43:22.151 --> 01:43:23.770
different directions,
but um,
that,

1786
01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.410
that you did extremely well tasking at bruiser and it works and every leader

1787
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.820
should be very conscious to them.
Yeah.
The less you talk,
the more people listen.

1788
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.300
All right.
Next goal

1789
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.760
in a,
in a middle management position,

1790
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:44.790
what's the best way to support the company and leadership you work for while

1791
01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:50.320
still showing your fellow workers?
They are supported and appreciated.

1792
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.340
I work in surgery

1793
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:56.270
<v 0>at a large hospital within even larger corporation.</v>

1794
01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:00.980
This is one of those things,
and I remember saying,

1795
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:02.330
I'm sure I got this from Hackworth,

1796
01:44:02.331 --> 01:44:05.360
but it's one of those things that I've said so many times,

1797
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:09.890
I actually probably forget to even give credit to Hackworth,
but you know,

1798
01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:10.701
when problems,

1799
01:44:10.701 --> 01:44:13.130
little problems would arise up the chain of command and I'd be like,

1800
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.210
everyone hates the echelon of command above them.
Right.
That's the way it is.

1801
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.650
Like,
and that's just the way it is.
That's the way it is.
It's always,

1802
01:44:21.651 --> 01:44:22.730
they don't get it.
It's always,

1803
01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:27.731
they don't understand unless you get somebody that really knows how to explain

1804
01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.040
and communicate down the chain of command so that everyone understands why

1805
01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:33.020
they're doing what they're doing.
That's what this is.

1806
01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.380
That's exactly what this is.
I get it.

1807
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.720
What's the best way to support the company in leadership is to take what the

1808
01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:43.721
company and the leadership of the company says and translate it to the troops in

1809
01:44:43.881 --> 01:44:47.750
a way that they understand and that means something to them,
right?

1810
01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.020
So you go to a big meeting and you know like let's say an all hands meeting for

1811
01:44:53.991 --> 01:44:58.940
a company and,
and the CEO is saying,
Hey,

1812
01:44:58.941 --> 01:45:02.030
we made,
we made $87 million last year profit.

1813
01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.620
And if all the frontline troops are in there,
they're like,
well that's cool.

1814
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:13.160
But I didn't see that reflected in my pay cheque.

1815
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:16.850
By the way.
You gave me a $4 raise over the last three years.

1816
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.880
How about some of that 87 million kick it down to the people.

1817
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.660
So that's problematic because we aren't explaining,
hey,
that's it.

1818
01:45:24.661 --> 01:45:28.010
That literally that statement right there,
we'll actually make people mad.

1819
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:29.660
The CEO's thinking,

1820
01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:32.240
everyone's going to love me because I'm telling you how profitable we are as a

1821
01:45:32.241 --> 01:45:34.120
company.
All everyone's thinking as well.

1822
01:45:34.130 --> 01:45:37.250
Then why can't you afford to buy me that piece of gear that we need on the front

1823
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:41.630
lines?
What's your problem?
That's so you actually think you're helping,

1824
01:45:41.631 --> 01:45:44.630
but you're actually hurting unless you can explain to people,
look,

1825
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:45.590
we made this much profit.

1826
01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:49.220
Here's how it's going to benefit us as a company and you as a frontline troop,

1827
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:53.060
by us making this much money,
it means we can grow these areas.

1828
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.670
It means we can bring on more people.
That means everyone in this room right now,

1829
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:56.900
in the next three years,

1830
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:59.330
you're going to have an opportunity to be in a leadership position.

1831
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:01.820
That's what I'm talking about.
That's why we're trying to grow.

1832
01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:05.020
That's why we're trying to do better.
By the way,
as we,
this is snowball.

1833
01:46:05.021 --> 01:46:07.520
I'm even more because now we're putting more money into advertising.

1834
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:09.620
We've got a whole advertising campaign that's going out.

1835
01:46:09.621 --> 01:46:12.350
We've invested a bunch of money in that and it's going to bring us more
business.

1836
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:15.230
And that means the jobs that you think might not be stable,

1837
01:46:15.231 --> 01:46:16.550
your job if you don't think it's stable,

1838
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.580
it just got stable because we have the capital to get this machine moving even

1839
01:46:21.891 --> 01:46:24.500
faster.
So when you do that,

1840
01:46:24.501 --> 01:46:27.740
when you explain to the troops why something's happening,

1841
01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.480
it makes them understand and it shows your people,
hey,
you're supporting,

1842
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:36.590
are there times where you should push back?
Yes there are.

1843
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.460
And if something makes no sense whatsoever,
you should raise your hand and say,

1844
01:46:40.461 --> 01:46:43.790
Hey,
let me,
let me go.
Let me run this up.
The chain of command.
Let me run this up,

1845
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:46.670
the chain of command and explain why this isn't a good idea.

1846
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:48.920
And that way you can go and when you get the reason,

1847
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:51.540
cause there'll be a reason and it might not be the best reason,

1848
01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:53.910
but it will be a reason.
And you go back to the troops and say,
Hey,

1849
01:46:53.911 --> 01:46:56.040
here's why this is going on.
This is what's happening,

1850
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:58.740
this is the decision they made.
And you know what,

1851
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.560
we're going to do our best to execute it because that's what we do.

1852
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:04.890
We make things happen,
we're going to get it done.
Boom.

1853
01:47:05.150 --> 01:47:08.900
<v 4>And we got a great,
we've got a great a depiction of that in,</v>

1854
01:47:08.901 --> 01:47:13.480
in the talking about being humble,
not passive and pushing backward matters.
Uh,

1855
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:16.040
in the deck out of me leadership,
uh,
that's a,

1856
01:47:16.041 --> 01:47:17.840
that whole section is talking exactly about that.

1857
01:47:17.841 --> 01:47:19.670
It's a very hard thing for people.

1858
01:47:19.671 --> 01:47:23.030
And that the basis of this question though is the US versus them,
right?

1859
01:47:23.031 --> 01:47:26.180
Front lines versus corporate headquarters.
Uh,

1860
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:30.020
and you've got to defeat that.
If you're a good leader,
you got to recognize,
look,

1861
01:47:30.021 --> 01:47:31.220
we're all on the same team.

1862
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:36.110
We can't do what we need to do without having the support and,
uh,
you know,

1863
01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:40.790
the resources and the approvals of plans,
uh,
from the,
uh,

1864
01:47:40.791 --> 01:47:42.160
corporate headquarters,
you know,
and,

1865
01:47:42.161 --> 01:47:45.420
and at corporate headquarters that oftentimes,
so not only are,

1866
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.850
is there frustration up the chain,
there's also frustration down the chain.

1867
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:51.560
You hear that all the time.
Like,
well,
the front lines,
they don't really get it.

1868
01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.510
They don't get it over there.
It.
Well,
listen,

1869
01:47:53.511 --> 01:47:58.320
from the front lines is where the actual mission gets won or lost.
So,
uh,
you,

1870
01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.840
you've got to,
you might want to have them on board with the PROZAC.

1871
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:02.990
So you gotta make sure that you know that it's got to,

1872
01:48:02.991 --> 01:48:05.750
if you want a successful team,
you,
you can't have us versus them.

1873
01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:09.370
Everybody's got a horse.
They're the big win on board for the big one.
Yeah.

1874
01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.820
<v 0>Oh,
the full metal jacket,
right?
What's your problem?</v>

1875
01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.340
Why don't you get on board for the big win and,
and you think,
oh,

1876
01:48:15.341 --> 01:48:16.630
well if I'm the general,

1877
01:48:16.631 --> 01:48:19.030
and I'm telling this young guy that's got a peace sign on his helmet,

1878
01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:21.310
that represents the dichotomy.

1879
01:48:21.311 --> 01:48:24.460
Maybe that's where I learned the word dichotomy from that represents the

1880
01:48:24.461 --> 01:48:26.710
dichotomy of what does he say?
That dichotomy.

1881
01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.010
And he says the duality of duality of man.
Yeah,
you're right.

1882
01:48:30.011 --> 01:48:31.690
That represents the duality of,
man,

1883
01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.020
why don't you take that thing off and get on board for the big win?

1884
01:48:35.530 --> 01:48:38.390
And that's such a great line from that movie.
Joined the team son,

1885
01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.640
get on board for the big win.

1886
01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:42.580
Such a great line from that movie because that's exactly what we're talking

1887
01:48:42.581 --> 01:48:46.840
about.
That does absolutely nothing for that frontline soldier that goes,
okay,

1888
01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:51.460
you're saying that,
and I'm literally burying people right now in this situation,

1889
01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:54.610
and so for you saying that to me means nothing.
In fact,

1890
01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:58.540
it shows how completely freaking out of touch you are and so they did a great

1891
01:48:58.541 --> 01:49:02.170
job in that movie of representing that through one single line and why don't you

1892
01:49:02.171 --> 01:49:06.670
just get on board for the big win?
It's like,
well,
no,
actually,
why don't you lead?

1893
01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.533
How does that sound?

1894
01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:13.970
So communicate up and down the chain of command.

1895
01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:17.930
Make sure people know why and tie in why it matters to them.

1896
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:20.330
Next question.

1897
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:26.360
<v 0>In extreme ownership,
you talk about being close with the team,</v>

1899
01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:30.590
but not so close that they forget who's in charge or that the good of the team

1900
01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:34.880
suffers.
How do you overcome the isolation of leadership?

1901
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:40.930
What strategies did or do you employ to avoid the isolation becoming an issue?

1902
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:48.070
This is an example of,
I'm going to take this to the extreme.

1903
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:51.070
Hey,
I'm not going to be too close to my people.
Guess what?

1904
01:49:51.130 --> 01:49:54.680
I'm not talking to them.
Right?
I'm not going to speak to them.
I'm going to,

1905
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.270
I gotta maintain a distance.
I get up and it's,
it's obviously not true.

1906
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:00.310
It's obviously not true.
And I think,
you know,
the,

1907
01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:05.050
the relationship that you and me and Seth and the,
that we all had was clearly,

1908
01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.770
uh,
this right.
I wasn't alone.

1909
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:12.940
I wasn't isolated as the leader because we were all bros and hanging out.

1910
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:15.450
And now did it start off like that?
No.
You know,
I,

1911
01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:18.820
as we always talk about like our come across Hackworth style of like,
Hey,

1912
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:20.740
we're not going to joke around for at least whatever,

1913
01:50:20.741 --> 01:50:24.370
six to eight weeks to make sure that these dudes are good to go and that,

1914
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.020
that they understand where I'm coming from and,
and that's cool.

1915
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:32.710
But once we get through that,
okay,
like then it's like open up a little bit,

1916
01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:34.810
then it's like open up a little bit more than then is up bone up a little bit

1917
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:36.640
more so that you're not isolated at the top.

1918
01:50:36.641 --> 01:50:39.940
Because not only is it important that you're not isolated,
that's like,

1919
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.590
that's like a marginal thing.

1920
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:46.300
What's more important is what I talked about earlier is if you,

1921
01:50:46.301 --> 01:50:49.930
if life can't come to me and say,
hey man,
hey,

1922
01:50:49.931 --> 01:50:52.840
I don't agree with this plan or more importantly,
Hey Jocko,

1923
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.850
here's what's going on with the troops right now.

1924
01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:56.770
Here's what's going on with the mentality.

1925
01:50:56.771 --> 01:50:58.150
Here's what's going on with the morale.

1926
01:50:58.270 --> 01:51:00.850
If he can't knock on my door and say that to me,

1927
01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:06.340
then that's a real problem.
Because now,
you know,
um,
um,

1928
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.210
in the dark on what's happening inside inside with the troops,

1929
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:11.403
which is problematic.

1930
01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:15.700
<v 4>Yeah.
I think it's,
this to me sounds like a,</v>

1931
01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:19.230
I was thinking about this question and it sounds to me like a maybe a junior

1932
01:51:19.231 --> 01:51:21.780
leader that was promoted at the shame cause that cause that's where you really

1933
01:51:21.781 --> 01:51:23.040
feel like when I go from,
you know,

1934
01:51:23.041 --> 01:51:25.980
the assistant platoon commander where I'm like kind of one of the boys and um,

1935
01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.370
you know,
we're,
we can,
you know,
it's kind of a,

1936
01:51:29.610 --> 01:51:32.250
I can kind of play interference with it,
with the officer in charge.

1937
01:51:32.251 --> 01:51:35.430
And the platoon commander now all of a sudden I get promoted as he recognize

1938
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:37.380
instantly.
There's a little bit of difference.

1939
01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.130
You've got to maybe kind of distance yourself slightly from where you were

1940
01:51:41.131 --> 01:51:43.130
previously and recognize when you took over.
Yeah.

1941
01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:44.660
<v 0>Charlie platoon as a platoon commander.</v>

1942
01:51:44.661 --> 01:51:48.200
When did you realize that you needed to transition from being one of the boys

1943
01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:51.470
until being the OIC and that there was,

1944
01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:54.410
that the gap was going to open up a little bit?
Was it as soon as you took over?

1945
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:57.280
<v 4>It was pretty quick because I'd been to buds,
uh,
and,</v>

1946
01:51:57.281 --> 01:52:00.510
and a seal qualification training,
you know,
escuchar advanced training with a,

1947
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.150
with several guys.
And I knew these guys very well.
And you know,

1948
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:07.590
I think we had a big house party hanging out,
you know,
having a good time and,

1949
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:08.590
and uh,

1950
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:11.320
everybody's over at my house and all of a sudden I realized some I did all the

1951
01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:14.990
time,
you know,
as an assistant platoon commander and all of a sudden,
uh,

1952
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:15.970
we're in at work,
you know,

1953
01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:20.530
the next week and I got to get to make some tough calls and we've got to get,

1954
01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.810
you know,
drive the standards a little bit higher where we're at.

1955
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:26.090
And there's some pushback and you realize like,
okay,
when it's,

1956
01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.210
when it's time to give people some bad news or say,
hey,

1957
01:52:28.211 --> 01:52:30.640
we're not doing as good as we should.
We need to fix that.

1958
01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.680
And they kind of give you the like,
hey bro,
you know,

1959
01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:36.280
what are you doing on Friday?
Then it's,
then you're like,
okay,

1960
01:52:36.281 --> 01:52:39.300
I'm going to have to,
I'm going to have to distance a little bit.
But the,

1961
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:42.880
the isolation,
you should never be isolated.
I think that's one thing that,

1962
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:46.700
you know,
I remember coming into your office and,
uh,

1963
01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.320
I would come in and hang out all the time and your office,
you know,
you,
you'd,

1964
01:52:50.321 --> 01:52:53.090
you'd come in and hang out in the platoon space.
I mean,
I've come,
you know,
we'd,

1965
01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:54.530
we'd see each other and to jam.
We like,

1966
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:58.550
we are always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk and,
and um,

1967
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.530
it was even when,
you know,

1968
01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.950
Seth stone was all the way across the other side of the city.
I mean,
I,
you know,

1969
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:07.070
we'd still connect with him and talked to him on the phone or once a while and I

1970
01:53:07.071 --> 01:53:11.570
talked to him all the time on the,
uh,
a and DVT.
Yeah,
you guys,

1971
01:53:11.571 --> 01:53:15.170
do you guys talk regular but,
but having,
but even me,
you know,
he would always,

1972
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:16.191
he came by like,

1973
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:18.650
we'd always try to try to get together and talk to each other and catch up,

1974
01:53:18.651 --> 01:53:23.540
whether it was in the Chow Hall or are,
uh,
you know,
in,
in a platoon space.
And,

1975
01:53:23.541 --> 01:53:26.630
uh,
you know,
guys,
I've ever,
Tony would come in there.
I'd come in,

1976
01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:30.500
I'd walk in and I'd see the wind plan written up on chocolates,

1977
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:33.920
whiteboard and tasking at bruiser or Tony had written down all the things that

1978
01:53:33.921 --> 01:53:38.880
we needed to do to win and robotics,
which is pretty harsh.
Yes,
true.

1979
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:40.530
But probably on the property,

1980
01:53:40.531 --> 01:53:44.660
on the level like Ganga Eskom and certainly con rib plan,

1981
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.440
which you know,
hey man,
we are,
has its merit.

1982
01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:50.360
We're joking and laughing about that.
This is the relationship Jocko hat,

1983
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:54.020
you know,
not only with me but with other leaders in the task unit.
And uh,

1984
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.510
and I think you have to have that.
I mean,
you've got to have a,

1985
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:58.340
you've got to have a relationship with your people.

1986
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:01.730
You can't think that I can't talk to anyone.
I can't interact with anyone.

1987
01:54:01.731 --> 01:54:05.790
I think there's,
you're going to be unsuccessful as a leader.
Um,
you know,
if,

1988
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:08.120
if you try to roll that way,
it's just not going work.
You know,

1989
01:54:08.170 --> 01:54:11.960
I think where you might feel what might feel like a isolation,

1990
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:15.500
which is definitely true,
and this is the burden of command,
right?
Like,

1991
01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.130
guess what?
You're friends with Lafe,
you're friends with Seth,

1992
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:22.730
you're friends with Tony,
you're friends with these guys.
But at the same time,

1993
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.210
like,
oh,
the burden of command is on you and it's going to be,

1994
01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.580
it's going to be you.
You're going to,

1995
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.910
you're going to bear that right in your platoon.
It's like,
Hey,

1996
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:33.380
you got your assistant platoon commanders,

1997
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.000
you've got your opportunity if you've got your Lpo.

1998
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.290
But when something goes wrong,
if something goes wrong,

1999
01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.820
if you,
if there's a bad,
if something happens on a mission to it goes bad.

2000
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:45.530
I'm not talking,
I'm not,

2001
01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:50.060
I'm not looking at the assistant platoon commander.
I'm,
I'm looking at you.

2002
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:53.370
That's the burden of command.
That's so that thing.
Yeah,
that's,
that.

2003
01:54:53.570 --> 01:54:56.810
There's one man that stands on the carpet,
right.
That's,
that's the way it works.

2004
01:54:56.811 --> 01:55:01.310
And sometimes being one man,
that's,
that's a little bit of an isolating feeling.

2005
01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.490
And to help help you understand that.
Our leading petty officer,
Charter Tone.

2006
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:08.170
Awesome.
Awesome,
amazing seal.
Love the guy.
And,
uh,

2007
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:09.770
hopefully it can be on here one of these days,

2008
01:55:09.771 --> 01:55:14.590
but after maybe their heroes as retirement comes when one of these days.
But uh,

2009
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:16.550
he was,
we were,

2010
01:55:16.551 --> 01:55:19.920
we were up in Nevada training and uh,

2011
01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:24.460
we took a couple of days to go snowboarding,
which was a,

2012
01:55:24.461 --> 01:55:28.010
an awesome,
good deal.
And he's like,
oh,
we're in the van.
He looks around,

2013
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:31.250
he like sees me,
he's like,
I'm not the senior guy.

2014
01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.580
And uh,

2015
01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.920
so he's scream and a laugh and about how awesome it is to not be the senior guy

2016
01:55:36.921 --> 01:55:40.460
cause he knows the burden of command is now with me,
not with him.

2017
01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:42.960
The fuck guys get in trouble or do something stupid they should to know

2018
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.460
<v 3>which is while you're in Tahoe guys getting in trouble and doing stuff stupid is</v>

2019
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:53.730
probably a fairly likely thing to have happen.
Highly probable.

2020
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.380
That's one of my favorite trips that I did multiple times.
Yeah.

2021
01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:02.490
So that's it man.
Build relationships and at the same time you are,

2022
01:56:02.491 --> 01:56:05.310
when you're in charge,
you're in charge and there's a little bit of a,

2023
01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:07.770
that's called the burden of command.
Embrace it.

2024
01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:12.030
And I think we got time for one more question

2025
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:20.130
here ago in Lafe and Jockos opinion,
you've been excluded from this one,

2026
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:22.260
Echo Charles.
So they don't want your opinion.

2027
01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:29.420
What has changed or what point do you find you need to emphasize more from when

2028
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:33.630
you wrote extreme ownership to now?
Oh,

2029
01:56:33.631 --> 01:56:38.310
this is a softball question that I selected.
All the easy ones.

2030
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:41.010
Well yeah,
I think the answer to this one is pretty obvious.

2031
01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:44.750
<v 4>That's why we wrote the book that got to me leadership.
I mean this is a,</v>

2032
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:50.360
this is what we had needed.
Emphasize more.
And uh,
just as you know,

2033
01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:53.420
you talked about this when we were talking about jaws too.
You know,

2034
01:56:53.421 --> 01:56:56.200
whether or not you know,
the sequence is going to be as good.
And you know,
we,

2035
01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:59.600
we had pressure to write a book.
Extreme ownership did very well.
Like,
Hey,

2036
01:56:59.601 --> 01:57:00.650
you guys should write of the book.

2037
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:04.400
We didn't want to write another book until we actually had something useful to

2038
01:57:04.401 --> 01:57:06.710
write about that would impact leaders for the better.

2039
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.210
Help them be better people that are leaders,
lead better teams,
lead better lives.

2040
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:14.880
And that's what this is tight.
The dichotomy of leadership answers,
uh,

2041
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:18.670
the most difficult challenges and obstacles that we see leaders face.
And,

2042
01:57:18.671 --> 01:57:21.780
and I think that three years,
you know,
one thing that,
uh,

2043
01:57:21.781 --> 01:57:23.190
extreme ownership did for us.

2044
01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.640
I mean our company blew up as a result echelon front.

2045
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:27.810
We were able to work with so many more,
uh,

2046
01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:32.390
leaders and so many more companies and we got to see this over and over and over

2047
01:57:32.391 --> 01:57:37.100
and over and over again.
And uh,
and this,
uh,
this is capturing those,

2048
01:57:37.101 --> 01:57:39.660
those issues,
uh,
that,
that we saw,
uh,

2049
01:57:39.661 --> 01:57:42.230
and then the solutions to solve those problems through leadership.

2050
01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:43.890
<v 3>Yeah,
I think it's going to be pretty evident.</v>

2051
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:48.891
I think it was cool how it revealed itself as the subject matter of the next

2052
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:55.650
book.
I mean,
we,
we,
we,
like you said,
business blew up.
Yes,
we were busy.

2053
01:57:55.651 --> 01:57:57.870
We weren't really sitting there going,
okay,

2054
01:57:57.871 --> 01:58:00.270
what should the next book would be about?
What's in the next book be about?

2055
01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.560
We actually didn't even think of,
we weren't even thinking about it.

2056
01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:09.690
And then as we started saying,
hey,
you know,
people don't understand this as well.

2057
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:14.970
Hey we,
we should have added more chapters about the dichotomy we,

2058
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:17.970
and it's like over time,
all of a sudden it became very,

2059
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
it became completely blatantly obvious that what people needed help with was

2060
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:25.710
this most difficult thing,

2061
01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:30.420
which is achieving the balance of all the different dichotomies of leadership.

2062
01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:33.450
And that's why we wrote the dichotomy in leadership,

2063
01:58:33.570 --> 01:58:36.510
gets them right on.
Well,

2064
01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.910
we're just hitting that two hour mark,

2065
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:42.490
which means we only have two hours for echo to talk about support.

2066
01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:48.910
It's just saying,
man,
you said echoes excluded for that last question,

2067
01:58:48.911 --> 01:58:51.720
but I want to know what your answer is that go from what you've learned.

2068
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:55.780
I learned since extreme low ships come out since the podcast is launched.

2069
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:58.740
<v 6>Okay.
So the,
the,
the main thing that sticks out,</v>

2070
01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:04.160
main thing is that is what people seem to ask you all the time is what do I do

2071
01:59:04.621 --> 01:59:07.380
when other people aren't taking extreme ownership?
And here's the thing.

2072
01:59:07.381 --> 01:59:10.240
When you're outside and listening to you,
you're like,
Aha,
I see what you know.
I,

2073
01:59:10.410 --> 01:59:12.660
it's almost like a funny question,
right?
Because it's like what,

2074
01:59:12.661 --> 01:59:15.690
what do you call that?
Like Ironic,
right?
Kinda where they're like,

2075
01:59:15.691 --> 01:59:18.720
what do you do when other people,
but it's you the one supposed to anyway,

2076
01:59:18.721 --> 01:59:19.430
so that's six.

2077
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:23.640
But the reason that that's significant is because when you're in the situation,

2078
01:59:23.641 --> 01:59:27.630
that's exactly what it feels like.
You can't really see it.
See what I'm saying?

2079
01:59:27.631 --> 01:59:32.580
So you got a detach,
which kind of sheds we even more light on the,
uh,

2080
01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:37.350
the importance of detaching.
All right.
So it kind of feeds into itself,

2081
01:59:37.351 --> 01:59:38.970
but so yeah,

2082
01:59:38.971 --> 01:59:43.971
when you're in the situation and you have to essentially take ownership when the

2083
01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:48.300
other person should be taking ownership factually in your mind,

2084
01:59:48.301 --> 01:59:50.520
the other project,
hey,
you need to take responsibility for this.

2085
01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:54.630
That's the time you got to take responsibility of it.
Yeah.
It's hard to like,

2086
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:57.390
it's hard to really grasp that.
In the beginning I thought,

2087
01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:58.690
<v 3>well,
that was pretty cool.</v>

2088
01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:03.691
Recently we got an email from a guy that's overseas running a company and he,

2089
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:08.050
he listened to Dave Burk and guilty.
Yeah.
Good deal,
Dave.

2090
02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:12.160
And I think it's a great example to say,
can you take ownership of the weather,

2091
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:14.860
right?
Because the obvious answer is no,
I can't take ownership of the weather.

2092
02:00:14.861 --> 02:00:16.510
And I talked about this on that podcast is like,

2093
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:19.270
well actually you can because you can come up with contingency plans,

2094
02:00:19.271 --> 02:00:22.930
you can come up with,
you can stage your force forward closer.
And so anyways,

2095
02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.390
this guy in his company,

2096
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.600
it's a software type company and implementation company and they piggy back on a

2097
02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:31.990
big giant,
you know,

2098
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:36.700
one of the biggest companies in the world and that biggest company in the world,

2099
02:00:36.701 --> 02:00:41.701
one of the biggest companies in the world made some errors and it messed up

2100
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:45.340
their platform.
And they went to their client and said,
hey,

2101
02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.690
the platform got messed up.
It was the big guys,
they did this,
this,

2102
02:00:49.691 --> 02:00:54.490
and this wrong.
And the people were like,
oh,
well,
okay.
You know,
I guess,

2103
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.300
and then he went home and he listened to that podcast and he went,

2104
02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.720
I screwed up because the,
that's,
Hey,

2105
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:05.530
the biggest company in the world is still easier to control than the weather.

2106
02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.700
Right?

2107
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.700
And so he went back to the company and he went back to the his client and said,

2108
02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.670
you know what?
It wasn't their fault.
It was our fault.
It was my fault.

2109
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.230
Here's some things I'm going to put in place so that this never happens again,

2110
02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:23.920
and all of a sudden the attitude completely changes and the client is super

2111
02:01:23.921 --> 02:01:27.880
happy and his all of his team also because what does that do to your team when

2112
02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:30.280
you blame,
when you blame the weather,
your team just goes,
okay,

2113
02:01:30.281 --> 02:01:33.700
we've got a permanent excuse.
Now,
whether it wasn't good,
cs were too big,

2114
02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:37.030
when was too high,
cloud cover was too low.
Whatever the case may be,

2115
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:40.370
you've got a permanent excuse now because you can't control the actually wrong,

2116
02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.470
wrong.
We do control the weather.
We,
we will set up our missions.

2117
02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:48.680
We will set up our contingencies that no matter what the weather does,

2118
02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:51.830
where do accomplish the mission,
no matter what our big,
we'll never wouldn't,

2119
02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.680
no matter what the big platform that we rely on,

2120
02:01:54.681 --> 02:01:57.080
no matter what happens with them,
we're going to be in control.

2121
02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:00.680
That's how we roll.
Get some,
that feedback was phenomenal.

2122
02:02:00.681 --> 02:02:02.600
And to hear him say that his client was like,

2123
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:04.580
I've never seen anyone handle a problem like this before.

2124
02:02:04.581 --> 02:02:08.870
You guys have done an amazing job,
and it's,
it's another example of how you're,

2125
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:13.820
you're scared to take ownership by taking ownership.
You're willing trust,

2126
02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:14.691
building trust,

2127
02:02:14.691 --> 02:02:18.290
and you win it when you take ownership and you actually get the problem solved

2128
02:02:18.291 --> 02:02:22.490
going forward.
Speaking of ownership and taking ownership,

2129
02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:26.870
maybe echo could take ownership of,
you know,
support.
Sure.

2130
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:32.390
<v 7>Be Happy to,
how to support,
you know,
sure.
Selves,</v>

2131
02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:35.720
selves,
the path.
Really,
that's what we're supporting the path,
right?

2132
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:38.840
You think you're on the path that you not on the path,
right?

2133
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:40.460
If you're not on the path,
well actually,

2134
02:02:40.461 --> 02:02:45.040
even what he posted a picture of just a sign that said,
please stay on the path

2135
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:50.490
is legit.
Exactly right.
And I was gonna say,
if you're not in the path,

2136
02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.370
we were not talking to you,
but if you're not in the path,

2137
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:56.210
I think we're talking to you equally.
Maybe more so.

2138
02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.570
I want to say more still,
but really if you're on the path,

2139
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.870
what I'm talking super loud too.
So equally I think,
I dunno,

2140
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:07.760
maybe we'll think about that more later.
Um,
we'll go into origin,
right?

2141
02:03:07.761 --> 02:03:12.110
Our Co company origin main.com.

2142
02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.520
Geese,
rash guard for Jujitsu.

2143
02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:18.800
Lafe talked about Jujitsu earlier.

2144
02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.690
<v 3>Awesome stuff.
Yeah,
origin makes the best stuff.
It's a,
I've got,</v>

2145
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.720
I think I have like five different,
uh,

2146
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:30.390
you have the for the first very first origin GI I ever touched was yours

2147
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:36.940
as well,
right?
Yeah.
Interesting.
And I was like,
was it the muster and uh,
yeah,

2148
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:41.980
in New York Real,
when you see the weave like on the origin,
the pattern in there,

2149
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:46.040
<v 7>you can understand.
Do you have,
do you have currently,</v>

2150
02:03:46.041 --> 02:03:48.770
do you have any other geese that are not origin?

2151
02:03:48.970 --> 02:03:53.860
<v 3>I have three gays.
I have one non origin to origin.
I'll put that on,
put that on.</v>

2152
02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:58.390
And then he says it like as a threat,
but put that on,
see what kitchens,
boy,

2153
02:03:58.410 --> 02:04:01.210
what happened.
And I'm serious cause I put on mine,
I was like,

2154
02:04:01.211 --> 02:04:03.430
oh should I keep this or not?
I put,
I put it on,
you know,

2155
02:04:03.431 --> 02:04:05.860
one of my old and I was like,
Bro,
I can't,
I can't wear this.

2156
02:04:05.861 --> 02:04:09.960
Like it doesn't donate those geese.
Even at the,
at the,

2157
02:04:09.961 --> 02:04:11.680
at the white belt level.
Uh,

2158
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:15.570
I can totally tell that I roll better and my origin game.
Oh yeah,

2159
02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.260
that's a whole nother level.
They felt good.
He's rolling bad.
I'm telling you

2160
02:04:21.970 --> 02:04:26.500
it actually has give to my shoulders.
I can move in a way that like I would,

2161
02:04:26.501 --> 02:04:30.220
my other geese,
I,
it's,
it's really tight.
I can't move and I feel like I don't,

2162
02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:32.790
I actually,
I seem to be more,

2163
02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:38.110
what percentage of increased performance do you achieve wearing an origin?

2164
02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:41.780
<v 7>At least Nypa 19% minimum of life.</v>

2165
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.870
That is a good point because I had a Gig,

2166
02:04:43.871 --> 02:04:46.680
it was like my second gig ever and I was like,
hey,
that one looks cool.

2167
02:04:46.681 --> 02:04:50.070
Cause it had like cool designs on it or whatever.
And it was like thick material.

2168
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:54.450
For some reason I thought that beefy thick material looked cool.
So I got it.

2169
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:58.710
And it,
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna name the name of the brand.

2170
02:04:58.711 --> 02:05:01.050
So it doesn't even matter.
But um,
yeah,

2171
02:05:01.051 --> 02:05:03.630
when I'm rolling in it feels like more claustrophobic.

2172
02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:07.980
Like with which we know you have an issue with before.
Yeah.
Back in those days.

2173
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.020
Did I carry,
you have claustrophobia?

2174
02:05:10.021 --> 02:05:13.260
I think you were contributing to the cure of my clouds rolling.

2175
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:18.350
Andy and we were working with the g and I was trying to do like a crazy

2176
02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.520
whatever.
Lapel,
not lapel.
What's the,
what's the down here?

2177
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:25.080
Like the bottom part of the jacket?
Yeah,

2178
02:05:25.081 --> 02:05:29.310
there's the little had to Andy and house and I was almost just working something

2179
02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:33.000
and I couldn't,
I didn't have enough jacket out and I was like,

2180
02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:36.000
I whisper to him like I'm going to have origin make you a thing

2181
02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:42.630
for him to wear.
Yes,
exactly.
And then he was doing,
he,

2182
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:46.230
you know how people drag your jacket and they get between your leg on a single,

2183
02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:48.720
you know what I mean?
Just,
and he,
he's doing it.
He's like,

2184
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:52.230
that's his game right now.
And I told him and then I was home.

2185
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:55.200
I'm going to make half origin,
make a gift from me.
That's shorter.

2186
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.220
It's tailored to your,
we got to do it,
we've got to do it.

2187
02:05:59.250 --> 02:06:01.380
That makes sense though.
If you roll better,

2188
02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:03.590
like if you're feeling like you're kind of in a straight check.

2189
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:06.240
I'm not saying other brands feel like straight Jack.
I'm not saying that,

2190
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:10.770
but I'm saying if you have a specific feeling while you're rolling and it's

2191
02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:15.930
for a guy like me,
it's not very flexible.
It's,

2192
02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:19.740
it's awesome and it definitely improves your game and it helps you and you look

2193
02:06:19.741 --> 02:06:20.960
good by the way.
Side,
no.

2194
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:24.720
Also speaking of looking good and feeling good and comfort,

2195
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.420
they do have joggers and tee shirts and whatnot.

2196
02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:31.920
Most comfortable joggers still today in my experience,
which just means a lot.

2197
02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:33.160
Are you getting Jocko to where this job?

2198
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:38.410
My joggers apparently the undisputed champion of comfort at fair according to

2199
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:42.780
kind of story and rash guards I wear,

2200
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:48.350
I wear the rash card when I'm working out some days the days I wear it when I'm

2201
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:49.410
working out,

2202
02:06:49.410 --> 02:06:53.010
it's long sleeve is when I'm doing a lot of stuff on the rings so my arms don't

2203
02:06:53.011 --> 02:06:56.550
get all choked up,
which is a comfort move.
If you break it down,

2204
02:06:58.050 --> 02:06:59.040
just saying,
yeah,

2205
02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:04.100
well let's say the results of not having the rash guard or impedes or it gets in

2206
02:07:05.671 --> 02:07:09.750
the way of your functionality or something like this.
You know how like,
um,

2207
02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.100
like some people that were,

2208
02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:15.300
they'll were straps or they'll wear 'em on an a one of the,
oh,

2209
02:07:15.301 --> 02:07:19.770
like some of that at a full power lifting suit.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
Yeah.

2210
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:23.170
Like the full thing.
Yeah.
But that's more of like in a,

2211
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:26.440
I don't know when someone else has to put your belt on you.

2212
02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:29.070
You know what I'm saying?
When they're like heaving,

2213
02:07:29.071 --> 02:07:32.600
there's two or three people trying to heave the belt and a position.
Yeah.

2214
02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:33.391
I guess no,

2215
02:07:33.391 --> 02:07:37.210
I'm thinking more cause like can compare that to your rash guard scenario.
Right?

2216
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:40.240
It's like something,
something that's going to like,
you know,

2217
02:07:40.241 --> 02:07:43.090
people wear those things on their hands so they don't get blisters.
Right.

2218
02:07:43.091 --> 02:07:47.080
So the blisters show you could power through it,
but if,
if it was measurable,

2219
02:07:47.110 --> 02:07:50.770
would it get in the way of the performance,
the blisters.
You do rip a Callus,

2220
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:55.120
which sometimes people post ripped Callison and I get it like you got a good

2221
02:07:55.121 --> 02:07:58.180
workout in,
but guess what?
Your tomorrow's workout is not going to be as good,

2222
02:07:58.181 --> 02:08:01.510
especially with the exact tomorrow on the dead lifts with the rip callous from

2223
02:08:01.511 --> 02:08:02.344
pull ups,

2224
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:07.030
you need to go back for some maintenance calcis.
Yeah,

2225
02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.940
so the question is,
I'm stoked you got after it,

2226
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:14.050
but I'm not stoked it the next day when you're like not being able to lift,

2227
02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:17.800
so let's say they wear gloves or in your case you were the rash guards.

2228
02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.440
Is that technically for comfort or is it for,
you know,

2229
02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.600
the facilitate functionality?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't,

2230
02:08:24.601 --> 02:08:29.601
I don't know if I could see fit to say that I've witnessed you do anything for

2231
02:08:29.861 --> 02:08:34.340
comfort as far as getting after it goes.
Okay,
cool.

2232
02:08:34.490 --> 02:08:38.860
I'll keep note.
We'll keep looking for that one.
Also,
what supplements?

2233
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:42.760
Supplements?
Yeah,
Jocko.
What's up?
Joint Warfare.

2234
02:08:43.810 --> 02:08:47.770
We got Krill oil,
we got discipline,

2235
02:08:48.450 --> 02:08:53.260
joint warfare and Krill oils for your joints and now surprisingly alternate

2236
02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:54.094
fact,

2237
02:08:56.750 --> 02:09:01.130
curcumin is also good for your brain function apparently,

2238
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:06.220
which I could use all the help I can get.
Yeah,
I just,

2239
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:07.560
I just got an order in uh,

2240
02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:12.700
a new new replacement order and for some Krill oil and no joint warfare.
Wait,

2241
02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.390
I hear you're on the discipline train right now.

2242
02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:16.640
I'm all the discipline trade right at this moment.

2243
02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:19.450
I see you've got some discipline master right at this moment to unfortunately

2244
02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:24.000
lost discipline earlier.
Dude,
this is weird.
Lack of discipline.
He,
he,

2245
02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.570
he made discipline and then he lost his discipline.

2246
02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:29.620
I mixed up a huge bottle of discipline,
a Jockos House,

2247
02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:31.640
and then as we were leaving to come here,
I'm like,

2248
02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.170
what the hell did I do with it?
Where is your discipline?
I think you're,

2249
02:09:36.171 --> 02:09:39.710
I think your dog is probably getting after right now on level 19.

2250
02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:45.110
But you got it back though.
I see.
So that milk can forget about the milk,

2251
02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:49.810
which is the tastiest of all Taystee's.
This is comfort.

2252
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:55.890
And I'll be honest with you now,
maybe I burned myself out on men,

2253
02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:57.110
but I've been going,

2254
02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:01.960
I've been going Richter on TB and I haven't tried these yet.
I'll only have,

2255
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:06.140
I've got mint chocolate chip,
I run after it.
So the,
okay,

2256
02:10:06.141 --> 02:10:10.340
so the chocolate or the peanut butter chocolate and comes in,
oh,
big hype.

2257
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:11.330
We're talking about it.

2258
02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.910
Does it come in and it's supposed to come in this one week,
it took what?

2259
02:10:13.911 --> 02:10:16.760
A few days later,
whatever the big hype comes in,
everyone's fired up.

2260
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:19.310
I'm one of those people.
So I'm like boom,
pilot.

2261
02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:24.020
So I'm pounding a chocolate peanut butter now,
pounding it,
milk train,
full speed,

2262
02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:28.670
double Moltrin training.
So after awhile I'm pounding the,
the peanut butter,

2263
02:10:28.671 --> 02:10:33.620
you know,
one.
And then I look and I still have that mint one.
One day I go in,

2264
02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:35.750
I'm gonna make it.
I see the mid one and the mint,

2265
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:38.720
when it looked like he was looking at me like,
what did you forget about me?

2266
02:10:38.721 --> 02:10:43.040
You know,
like I was cheating on them.
Like I had less than men,
you know,
so,
uh,

2267
02:10:43.041 --> 02:10:47.660
I put them in one back in and I was reminded that that is my favorite one.

2268
02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:51.910
<v 3>Different flavor.
Yeah.
I but um,
they,</v>

2269
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:56.810
they taste good.
See,
it's Kinda like,
it's Kinda like,
um,
it's,

2270
02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:57.980
it's ridiculous.

2271
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:02.390
It's ridiculous that you can just completely eat that and just enjoy it.

2272
02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.910
My son has been posted,
I've been retreating it.

2273
02:11:04.911 --> 02:11:08.210
Someone's been posting like milk recipes.
Oh yeah.

2274
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:13.160
[inaudible] I haven't tried any of them yet because I just,

2275
02:11:13.161 --> 02:11:16.100
that's not my thing.
What do you,
we just put it straight in milk.
Oh No,

2276
02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:20.810
I just put it in milk.
But this guy is creating like,
like cookies,

2277
02:11:20.811 --> 02:11:23.810
balls,
cookies,
all kinds of crazy,
most conventions.

2278
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:28.530
And they look good and he's saying they taste good.
So I don't know.

2279
02:11:29.110 --> 02:11:30.730
<v 7>[inaudible] what you do is,</v>

2280
02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:34.540
or what I wound up doing is because peanut butter is like to,
in my opinion,

2281
02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:38.860
undeniable thing in life.
Peanut butter,
the flavor,

2282
02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:44.410
the mint chocolate.
So I put actual peanut butter.

2283
02:11:44.411 --> 02:11:47.440
You sometimes you can mix one scoop,
one scoop,
you know,
peanut butter,

2284
02:11:47.441 --> 02:11:52.030
chocolate and the mint chocolate.
Cool.
But you've done that.
Oh,
I'm not building.

2285
02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:55.780
That's like crossing the streams and Ghostbusters and you know that's how they

2286
02:11:55.781 --> 02:11:59.820
won the movie.
That's how they defeated the bad guy.
They cross the street so

2287
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:07.340
she do is you put peanut butter with the milk when that's due,

2288
02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:12.010
that report back.
Okay.
Hey,

2289
02:12:12.011 --> 02:12:14.620
would at this time invite everyone to the immersion camp,

2290
02:12:14.621 --> 02:12:19.621
but it's sold out so I'm sorry God sign up next year early and come hang out

2291
02:12:19.961 --> 02:12:23.320
with us at the immersion camp check.
Yes.

2292
02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:26.710
Also good way to just to support Jocko has a store.

2293
02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.920
It's called Jocko store and this is where you can get apparel.

2294
02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:36.130
Apparel's cool,
right?
Yeah.
Fashion is not,

2295
02:12:36.131 --> 02:12:40.670
not cool fashion apparel,
but if you want to represent it,

2296
02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.450
it has not.
What we're doing right there you go,

2297
02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:46.920
but you will look fashionable if you accept the terms.

2298
02:12:46.930 --> 02:12:50.140
Questionable Jocko does anybody not?
Yeah.
All good.
You'll look good though.

2299
02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:53.890
I think.
I Dunno.
That's a matter of opinion,
but if you want to represent,

2300
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:55.870
that's where you can get shirts,
rash guards,

2301
02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.850
<v 3>hats,
trucker hats,</v>

2302
02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:02.720
namely trucker hat or flex fit.

2303
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:07.490
Where are you at her?
At city.
There you go.
Dang.
When did the flex fit?
Yeah.

2304
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:11.150
Interesting.
I'm actually speaking of report back.

2305
02:13:11.630 --> 02:13:16.630
I want to know what sells more trucker hat or or flex fit.

2306
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:18.500
That's an interesting question.

2307
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.620
Let's find out what you're doing now and also got a long comment about hoodies.

2308
02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:28.520
A guy from Michigan that works construction said,

2309
02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:32.340
Hey Jocko,
just letting you know in Michigan

2310
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.590
<v 7>we do need lightweight hoodies.
Oh boom.</v>

2311
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:40.140
Everything I've ever said has been disproven.
Now this is one man's opinion.

2312
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:45.150
Yes.
You know.
Well here's the thing about that.
When you kind of take a step back,

2313
02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:48.630
it's like you,
you just went extreme.
You weren't wrong.
You just went extreme.

2314
02:13:48.631 --> 02:13:51.490
That's all.
You got to have the balance

2315
02:13:53.650 --> 02:13:55.830
equilibrium.
So this guy in Michigan,

2316
02:13:55.831 --> 02:13:57.690
he had the balance cause he knows the extreme,

2317
02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:00.330
he knows about the value of that big hoodies in Michigan.

2318
02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:03.540
It for the folks in Michigan though,
like being up there in North Dakota,

2319
02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:06.120
they went to work at like when you go to Alaska and you,
you know,

2320
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:08.970
it's like pretty cool out and you got your jacket on.

2321
02:14:08.971 --> 02:14:11.490
He looked around and this dude too,
like t shirts,
just setting it up.

2322
02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.410
It's all relative
like in Maine,

2323
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.740
just where I just wear a heavy sweatshirt all day long.
I mean all winter long,

2324
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:23.390
maybe occasionally you got to throw on some kind of a Parka and you know the

2325
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:28.320
park is being from Hawaii.
No,
that sounds,
yeah.
So what you'll do with your car,

2326
02:14:28.321 --> 02:14:30.870
right on the trucker hat to a flex foot debate.
Dope.

2327
02:14:30.930 --> 02:14:34.320
Like flex foot I think is great.
I like flex flex foot hats,

2328
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:36.960
but I will say I've got a large Mellon.
Uh,

2329
02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:39.930
being able to adjust is important.

2330
02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:44.190
Particularly when you're fishing and you're rolling out and your hat gets blown

2331
02:14:44.191 --> 02:14:46.310
off and then it's,
then it's soaking wet.
He's like,
man,

2332
02:14:46.410 --> 02:14:49.710
we're the largest Mellon I've ever seen on a human.

2333
02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:53.820
There was a guy on the special boat teams who was a great dude.

2334
02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:58.140
He was a big,
I'll just say Polynesian.

2335
02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.870
Maybe he was Filipino.
Maybe he was Polynesian,
I don't know.

2336
02:15:00.871 --> 02:15:03.330
But he was something like that.
Right?
Pacific islander,

2337
02:15:03.331 --> 02:15:07.740
I guess he's head was so big.
Okay.
You know what?
Protech helmet,

2338
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.470
you know to protect,
protect bike helmet.

2339
02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:15.510
He had one of those four for riding in the boat for like doing operations where

2340
02:15:15.511 --> 02:15:16.344
you got to wear a helmet.

2341
02:15:17.010 --> 02:15:21.960
He had one of those and he had all the foam inside of it.

2342
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:26.970
All of it was gone and we still had to like basically grease up his head to get

2343
02:15:26.971 --> 02:15:30.480
that thing on and it would be was crazy how big.

2344
02:15:30.481 --> 02:15:34.830
His head was huge and he was a great dude but he had a huge head.

2345
02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:37.260
He had no protection.
He just had a little thin.

2346
02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:40.470
He only wore that thing cause it was a part of the rules.
Technicality.

2347
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:44.430
He could've just called.
He goes,
well look,
I don't need to helmet my freaking

2348
02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:50.790
get away from me.
I get this stupid home at all and people.
All right,

2349
02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:54.550
so he would need the flex fit in a lot of flex in that fit.

2350
02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:55.890
Do you need a lot of flex in that fit?

2351
02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:58.770
I don't think the truck or would fit nonetheless.
Anyway,
like I said,

2352
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:02.490
Jocko store.com this week can get all this cool.
My opinion.

2353
02:16:02.670 --> 02:16:06.750
Cool stuff from when you make new stuff to new stuff is on there.
Yeah.

2354
02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:11.070
Jocko white tea.
There's a shirt.
So my brother has a Pepsi shirt.

2355
02:16:11.690 --> 02:16:15.330
Garbage,
garbage pail kids.
Yes.
You know the little cards.

2356
02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:19.460
So my twin brother Jake,

2357
02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:24.560
he has a garbage pail kid shirt and you'd think as an adult you're like all

2358
02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:28.140
right.
But it kind of,
you know,
it's kind of cool.
It's cool.
Sure.

2359
02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:32.770
And then you get your Pepsi shirt.
Like even if you don't drink Pepsi,

2360
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:37.300
it just looks cool.
Right?
So we've got a Jocko white tee shirts.
So that was not,

2361
02:16:37.301 --> 02:16:41.020
I thought I actually gave you credit in my mind for having an original cool.

2362
02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:43.870
Cause I thought I didn't think it looked pretty cool.
And the thing is,

2363
02:16:43.871 --> 02:16:47.080
it does the,
the fact is that concept is a very cool concept.

2364
02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:50.230
I didn't do it because hey Pepsi do it,
so let's do it.
That's not why I did it.

2365
02:16:50.290 --> 02:16:53.860
I think that that concept is cool.
Right on Jocko white tea.

2366
02:16:53.861 --> 02:16:56.440
Let me get this shirt and it's a tee shirt.

2367
02:16:57.850 --> 02:17:01.780
We call those layers anyway.
Yeah.
Some new stuff on there.
Check it out.

2368
02:17:02.410 --> 02:17:04.750
Check.
Awesome.

2369

2372
02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:16.780
That's a good way to support and leave a review.

2373
02:17:16.781 --> 02:17:20.290
If you're in the mood and you know you want your kids to listen to this podcast,

2374
02:17:20.291 --> 02:17:23.650
but you know you can't because sometimes it's completely inappropriate,

2375
02:17:23.651 --> 02:17:28.651
but for that reason we have the warrior kick podcast and that's questions from

2376
02:17:28.721 --> 02:17:33.721
uncle Jake or for Uncle Jake and so you can get that one to the youtube.

2377
02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.470
We also have a youtube channel that you can subscribe to.
Hey,
subscribe.

2378
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.420
You know what?
Let's not do this.

2379
02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.760
You never watch a youtube video and the end at the end it costs.

2380
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:47.140
Please subscribe and Click whatever,
click.
We're not going to do that.
Yeah,

2381
02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:48.850
we're not going to do that.
When you think about it,

2382
02:17:48.851 --> 02:17:51.130
and I don't want to go into a whole deep thing here,

2383
02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:55.680
but it seems like as a consumer,
that's it.
As a,

2384
02:17:55.690 --> 02:17:59.350
as an audience member of viewer of videos,
whatever you,

2385
02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:03.520
and it does defeat the whole purpose of clicking like right when you like have,

2386
02:18:03.521 --> 02:18:04.091
let me ask you this,

2387
02:18:04.091 --> 02:18:07.030
how many people do you think at the end of a youtube video where it says click

2388
02:18:07.031 --> 02:18:08.940
subscribe now to watch more awesome videos,

2389
02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:11.890
how many people does that convince push them over the edge and they just can't

2390
02:18:11.891 --> 02:18:16.570
stop?
I don't know.
But from what I've read before,

2391
02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:21.930
it's like they recommend that like that you do that as a content creator is what

2392
02:18:22.031 --> 02:18:25.330
they call it.
They say,
yeah,
Hey,
just ask cause people will do it kind of thing.

2393
02:18:25.331 --> 02:18:27.670
It's Kinda like,
hey,
you can't get,
if you don't ask,

2394
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.380
but it does kind of give you this kind of underlying feeling of like,

2395
02:18:32.381 --> 02:18:37.300
you're asking me to do something that's made to be organic.
It's made to be,

2396
02:18:37.301 --> 02:18:38.410
if you like this video,

2397
02:18:38.411 --> 02:18:42.070
you press like that's what that thing is made for and now you're asking me to

2398
02:18:42.071 --> 02:18:46.270
violate that whole reason that it's made.
So you want me to do it as a favor?

2399
02:18:46.271 --> 02:18:47.740
Like you ain't gonna like your videos.

2400
02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:51.280
I was watching your video cause I thought we were just cool.
I,
yeah,

2401
02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:54.040
and I thought we were just having a little moment,
right?
A little,

2402
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:57.650
two minute and 32nd moment and then I get to the end of it and now y'all
started,

2403
02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:00.620
you're coming out saying,
asking me to do this and do that and now this was not,

2404
02:19:00.670 --> 02:19:02.350
I see what it was.
It was a setup

2405
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:06.370
and I'm not saying that's what people were doing.

2406
02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:08.320
I'm not saying that's what you're doing.
If you're doing that,

2407
02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:13.010
I'm just saying as a consumer or as a viewer,
that's what it kind of feels like.

2408
02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:17.350
We'll try and avoid that.
Try to just saying,
hey,
on this podcast,

2409
02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:18.850
go there and subscribe to it.

2410
02:19:18.851 --> 02:19:21.700
That way you won't get bothered with a little thing from echo at the end that

2411
02:19:21.701 --> 02:19:22.120
says,

2412
02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:27.120
please click subscribe to more videos from Echo Cha podcasts to here.

2413
02:19:27.351 --> 02:19:30.050
Let's put it this way.
The most,
the most,
how should I say?

2414
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.910
Accurate for lack of better term,
way to put it.

2415
02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:37.640
If you didn't know that we have a youtube channel we do.

2416
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:42.590
If you didn't know,
you could subscribe to it.
Boom.
Now you do.

2417
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:46.070
If you want to subscribe,
you can,
but that goes without saying.
Obviously.

2418
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:49.010
Same thing with the like,
oh,
like I like it.

2419
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:54.140
That's a youtube that's youtube grabbed her.
Yup.
It's true.
Also,

2420
02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:57.320
if you're working out,
you want to switch it up,
I'm talking about on it.

2421
02:19:57.350 --> 02:20:00.260
So on it.com/jocko here's the thing too,

2422
02:20:00.261 --> 02:20:05.000
which I kind of forget to say you get 10% off if you go to the slash Jocko so go

2423
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:09.320
on at.com/jobs so when you're buying your kettle bells,
primal bells,

2424
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:13.430

you know,
battle road,
stuff like that.

2425
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:17.180
Go on it.com/chocolate that's where you can get 10% off really good stuff.

2426
02:20:17.181 --> 02:20:18.380
Their good info as well.

2427
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:22.310
Psychological warfare is an album with tracks.

2428
02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:25.790
We're working on number two right now,
so we'll make that happen.

2429
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:29.810
And I'm getting some good requests via the interwebs about what should be on

2430
02:20:29.811 --> 02:20:30.350
there.

2431
02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:35.330
So I tunes Google play MP3 platforms.

2432
02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.730
You can get that psychological warfare album

2433
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:43.610
with trucks.
But what does that for though?
We're not going to let you say it.

2434
02:20:43.611 --> 02:20:46.850
Everybody knows what it's for.
It wasn't for,
do you notice for yes.

2435
02:20:46.851 --> 02:20:47.511
He knows what it's for.

2436
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:50.510
It's to combat those moments of weakness that we all have.

2437
02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.840
I'm going to make a psychological track about how to not say something that has

2438
02:20:56.271 --> 02:20:59.800
been said.
What'd he do it?
He do it.
Oh yeah,
some days worse.

2439
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:03.920
That's something that's not been said yet.
Beat a dead horse.
I'm just saying if,

2440
02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:06.260
if this is the first time they heard it,
they're going to be like,
hey,

2441
02:21:06.261 --> 02:21:07.430
what is that psychological warfare?

2442
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:10.920
I know what regular the traditional psychological warfare is.

2443
02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:14.660
It's kind of like if I kept saying,
hey,
Jocko white tea.
Oh,
you know what?
You can,

2444
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:16.040
you can deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2445
02:21:16.041 --> 02:21:19.480
And I kept saying that over and over again and never stopped saying it.
Yeah,

2446
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:20.810
that'd be kind of like what you're doing.
Yeah,

2447
02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:23.060
but so it seems like it from your perspective,

2448
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:25.220
but from the perspective of someone just tuning in,

2449
02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:28.550
you're not seeing just turning it over 138 podcast.
Here's the thing,

2450
02:21:28.551 --> 02:21:31.160
and they started here.
They did.
They'll go listen to another one.

2451
02:21:31.161 --> 02:21:34.230
They'll hear it eventually and then they'll start to hear it over and over
again.

2452
02:21:34.231 --> 02:21:38.870
Right.
But I'm saying as an individual account,
which means more in my opinion,

2453
02:21:39.690 --> 02:21:42.740
I think just get ahold of you said it on the Mat.
Yeah,
that's right.

2454
02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.860
I know we're getting

2455
02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:50.150
Amazon cans.
You can get cancer.
People don't know this.

2456
02:21:50.151 --> 02:21:51.380
You can get cancer Jocko white tea.

2457
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:56.410
It's stopped drinking other energy drinks that are filled with sugar and other

2458
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:59.630
crap and get yourself from Jocko Willink.
Me Ask you this.

2459
02:21:59.631 --> 02:22:02.470
So you know how there's these preworkouts,
right?

2460
02:22:02.471 --> 02:22:05.870
You know we're preworkout fitting is right.
It's like super like it's,

2461
02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:08.920
I don't know what pre work.
It's hard,
but I know it are.

2462
02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:13.580
You know what I'm talking about,
right?
The one that they have,

2463
02:22:13.930 --> 02:22:15.080
they have like a bunch of caffeine,

2464
02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:18.920
whatever the label is real shiny a lot of the time.

2465
02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:19.970
You know what I'm talking about?
Oh,

2466
02:22:19.971 --> 02:22:22.300
you want you with the ones that have a light label that's really exciting.

2467
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:27.240
And there was lightning bolts.
All right,
so let me ask you this.

2468
02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:33.150
If I have a Jocko white tea in a can.
Yeah,
it's cold.
Yeah,
right.
Very refreshing.

2469
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.140
And then I put some of that energy,
uh,

2470
02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:39.600
pre workout in it since it doesn't have that much caffeine.

2471
02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:41.310
And I was maybe looking for some caffeine.

2472
02:22:41.311 --> 02:22:44.670
If I put that pre workout stuff in the,
in the Jocko white tea.

2473
02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.570
How much of a violation is that on a scale from one to 10?

2474
02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.060
I don't think it's a violation,
but I would just use discipline.

2475
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:53.040
You can put discipline and Jocko white.
Yeah.

2476
02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:55.200
But that's just another micro dose of caffeine.

2477
02:22:55.201 --> 02:22:59.640
No Caffeine jungle,
right.
White Tea,
that's the thing.
Sure.

2478
02:22:59.641 --> 02:23:00.750
There's takes got jammed up.

2479
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:05.400
There's 60 milligrams of caffeine and Jocko white tea cans.
That's,
that's enough.

2480
02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:07.230
Let's say hypothetically,
again,

2481
02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:11.460
hypothetically one was looking for more than 60 milligrams.

2482
02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:17.120
Get get Greek fire.

2483
02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:21.090
Okay.
So you know what Greek virus origin,
Greek fire from origin,

2484
02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:25.890
which has caffeine in it.
It's like a,
it's like a fat burner.

2485
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:30.310
Right?
So if you get that,
that has caffeine in it and it'll get you,

2486
02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:34.390
get you what you need.
Alright,
so the violation level four?

2487
02:23:35.250 --> 02:23:39.720
<v 4>Yeah,
sure.
I drink a lot of coffee and uh,
a lot of caffeine or not yet.</v>

2488
02:23:39.810 --> 02:23:42.690
That's Jocko white tea has got foot and calf pain from it.
It's legit.

2489
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:45.990
I'll tell you what I like about it with the cans and it would take her weight.

2490
02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:49.010
It's been crazy hot in Texas this summer and just,

2491
02:23:49.011 --> 02:23:51.630
just pull like a freezing cold one out of the,
uh,

2492
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:53.730
if I'm about to jump on my truck that's,
you know,

2493
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:58.130
125 degrees from sitting out in the sun and crack open a super cold.

2494
02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:02.700
I'm rolling down the road.
It's pretty legit.
Yeah.
Mellow.
I gotta make it,

2495
02:24:02.701 --> 02:24:03.361
you know what I'm going to make,

2496
02:24:03.361 --> 02:24:06.810
is I going to make something like this that you can drink before you go to bed

2497
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:09.940
at night?
Oh yeah.
Just cause,
cause I can't,
I mean I want,

2498
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:13.440
<v 7>sometimes it's seven or eight o'clock at night and I think,
Oh man,</v>

2499
02:24:13.441 --> 02:24:17.660
I've crack one open.
But then I think now,
then I'll be all wired up all night.

2500
02:24:18.270 --> 02:24:23.060
Yeah.
Yay.
Some sort of a cause there's like,
you know tea,

2501
02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:26.030
what do you call the tea that you brew before bed.

2502
02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.270
It makes you feel kind of that.
Yeah.

2503
02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.950
<v 4>Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
We got a situation here.</v>

2504
02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.950
Tell me you didn't know all of that.
I didn't know about it.
What

2505
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:41.100
<v 7>does it cam a meal.</v>

2506
02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:46.400
So you could take that approach,
right?
You could,

2507
02:24:46.430 --> 02:24:49.030
you could call it so we don't Jocko Kemah meal tea,

2508
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:51.470
you know you could call it that if you want.

2509
02:24:51.471 --> 02:24:54.500
Yeah I would probably just call it like well I'll figure something out but I

2510
02:24:54.501 --> 02:24:57.050
will do that because I do need something at night.

2511
02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:01.640
Warm hot in the summertime or hot in the winter time.
But you could drink a cold.

2512
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.960
That's tasty cause that's the thing about the,

2513
02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:07.430
the Jocko white tea is the taste is good.
Like we had this,

2514
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:08.530
I thought where you're going with this.

2515
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:14.110
If you had a can of Jocko white tea and it can have the most sweet,

2516
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:19.160
like,
like doctored up thing that's supposed to taste delicious.

2517
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:20.000
Which would you pick?

2518
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.270
I'd pick Jocko white tea all day long because the taste is you when you,

2519
02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:24.100
you know when

2520
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.460
<v 3>you realize that Gatorade,
no offense against Gatorade.
No,</v>

2521
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:28.360
a little bit of fence group.

2522
02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:32.260
You know when you realize that Gatorade doesn't actually quench your thirst.

2523
02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.410
Like when you're,
I dunno,

2524
02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.440
I think I was 20 right and I was real thirsty and I drink a Gatorade and I was

2525
02:25:40.511 --> 02:25:44.440
like why am I still thirsty that cause there's syrup in there or whatever.

2526
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:47.630
Doesn't work good Jocko white tea.
You could that quench

2527
02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:55.030
well this for back to the energy or the pre workout mix in the teeth scenario,

2528
02:25:55.031 --> 02:26:00.031
this person that we're talking about didn't finish it because it did jam up the

2529
02:26:00.041 --> 02:26:04.160
whole t scenario.
Okay.
It was like a theory check

2530
02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:08.650
nonetheless.
There it is.
Boom.
Jocko white tea,

2531
02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:13.700
understanding hey books we got where the word kid books where the warrior kid

2532
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.820
and Mark's mission.
Those are good books for kids to read.

2533
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:23.470
Just talking to a teacher out in the gym.
Yeah,
teaching the book.
Eighth Grade.

2534
02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:27.880
If you're wondering about,
well how old is an eighth grader?
1112,
11,
12,

2535
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:31.000
so 11,
12 year old.
Definitely it maybe 13.

2536
02:26:31.210 --> 02:26:35.380
Sometimes when I meet someone and their kid is eight or 10,

2537
02:26:35.410 --> 02:26:38.860
I just think your kid's in the zone and they dig it so way.

2538
02:26:38.861 --> 02:26:42.070
The warrior kid and Mark's mission.
I just just started reading a way.

2539
02:26:42.090 --> 02:26:45.440
The way your kid to uh,
my son does he get it?
He's three,
he writes three,

2540
02:26:45.441 --> 02:26:47.530
he doesn't get it.
Uh,
we got,

2541
02:26:47.531 --> 02:26:50.590
we got about 30 days until he was fired up and he wanted to go out and do some

2542
02:26:50.591 --> 02:26:54.280
bull up.
So it's funny they get certain parts.

2543
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:59.530
The grander kind of messages may not,
you know,
compute quite yet,
but yeah,

2544
02:26:59.531 --> 02:27:00.970
they'll get certain parts so they'll like,

2545
02:27:00.971 --> 02:27:05.240
like when this part comps stoked to the feedback on that one.

2546
02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:07.000
And also discipline equals freedom field manual.

2547
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:13.060
It's a manual about how to get after it.
And the audio version is not on audible.

2548
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.470
It's on iTunes,
Amazon music,
Google play and other MP3 platforms.

2549
02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:22.270
So you can make it specifically we did that.
Maybe took a little financial hit,

2550
02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.230
whatever.

2551
02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:27.790
Want people to be able to use it as an alarm clock in their phone or a ringtone.

2552
02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:32.770
So that's what you can do there.
Those are,
uh,
a few books.

2553
02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.630
Then we got,
then we got extreme ownership obviously,

2554
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:39.290
which a jock when I wrote,

2555
02:27:39.310 --> 02:27:43.150
but out for three years now we have new new edition out and of course a

2556
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:47.680
dichotomy of leadership,
which we were just talking about.
And that's for,

2557
02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:51.280
it's available now for preorder.
It'll be released September 25th.

2558
02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:55.520
Super excited about that.
Looking forward to all your readers out there.
Uh,

2559
02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:57.820
provide us some feedback on that.
And A,

2560
02:27:57.821 --> 02:28:02.640
I hope this is at least as useful to you,
uh,
in your lives.
Professional,

2561
02:28:02.650 --> 02:28:06.400
personal lives as extreme ownership.
So go get some dichotomy of leadership,

2562
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:11.010
find the balance.
You also leave.

2563
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:16.590
Talk to me about the difference between first a dish and let's say fifth,

2564
02:28:17.531 --> 02:28:22.070
a dish of a book,
which would you rather have?
Which was,
which

2565
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.050
<v 0>would I rather have?
Yeah,
I'd have to go with the first edition.</v>

2566
02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.320
That's right.
Anything that's sort of the standard,
that's the standard.

2567
02:28:30.350 --> 02:28:32.630
Is there anyone running around going,
man I wish I had the night,

2568
02:28:32.631 --> 02:28:34.860
the day she can wait for that fourth edition

2569
02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:38.830
<v 4>then that it is pretty cool with extreme ownership with where there uh,</v>

2570
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:42.530
people still come up to us and have,
you know,
with,
with uh,

2571
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:46.190
the caught in the original paper this was printed on was not very good for

2572
02:28:46.191 --> 02:28:49.100
extreme ownership.
You know,
it doesn't have the,
uh,

2573
02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:51.890
and it doesn't have the number one New York Times bestseller cost the top.

2574
02:28:51.891 --> 02:28:54.860
So every once while we still see some of those you're like,
wow,
that's a,

2575
02:28:54.861 --> 02:28:57.980
that's a,
that was a first printing run.
I just,
it's pretty cool

2576
02:28:58.490 --> 02:29:01.270
<v 0>that the other day,
so a girl came up and I was signing her,</v>

2577
02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:03.970
her first a dish and there's,
there's,

2578
02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:07.390
there's four additions that you could possibly have.
There's more than that.

2579
02:29:07.391 --> 02:29:10.960
But the first one that came out is white and there's no sticker on.

2580
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:13.180
As soon as they,
as soon as that made New York Times best seller,

2581
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:15.600
they went and got stickers that says Number One New York Times best selling.

2582
02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:18.130
They put them everywhere cause it's a,
it's an advertising Gig,
right?

2583
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:22.750
But there's so the people that got the first 10,000 copies,

2584
02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:25.510
it's just a plain first a dish.

2585
02:29:25.930 --> 02:29:30.340
So I know there's people and then you got,
then they got the stickers on it.

2586
02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:31.540
So you're still early.

2587
02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:34.480
Then you got the one that actually has printed on the cover,

2588
02:29:34.810 --> 02:29:36.910
Number One New York Times best seller,
blah blah blah.

2589
02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:40.780
And then finally we get to the fourth,
the fourth version,

2590
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:45.020
which is the black cover back in black,
which is,
wait,

2591
02:29:45.021 --> 02:29:47.710
we have to say that one's pretty good.
Cool.
Yes,
it does look different.

2592
02:29:47.711 --> 02:29:51.070
We're good,
cool avenues.
Coolness and yeah,
it's a different avenue of coolness.

2593
02:29:51.071 --> 02:29:55.900
But still the first,
the dish,
we always like the first dish.
And if you,

2594
02:29:55.901 --> 02:30:00.340
so if the,
my point is if you want the first a dish,
you got to order it pre.

2595
02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:03.190
Otherwise you're going to get some other,
you know,

2596
02:30:03.191 --> 02:30:05.710
you'll get one that says something else on it.
Be all different.

2597
02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:09.100
And we'll know when I meet you.
I'll just,
I'll just be,
oh,

2598
02:30:09.101 --> 02:30:10.960
you want me to sign that before?
That's cool.

2599
02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:16.090
I'm glad you got in the game eventually.
Oh No,
I'm,

2600
02:30:16.091 --> 02:30:19.210
I appreciate it.
Um,
echelon front

2601
02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:24.190
<v 4>view.
If you're interested in coming in and bringing us in to talk to your,
your,</v>

your frontline troops,
your mid level managers,

2603
02:30:27.921 --> 02:30:29.200

2604
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:32.360
that's what we do with echelon front is we solve problems through leadership.

2605
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:34.400
Everything that we wrote about extreme ownership,

2606
02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:37.640
all the things that we just talked about for dichotomy of leadership as what we

2607
02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:42.110
do.
Uh,
it's me and Jocko.
We launched this company going on seven years now.

Go hit us up at a echelon,

which is,
uh,
two days leadership</v>

2617
02:31:15.570 --> 02:31:18.840
conference seminar gathering.
That's what I'm called the,

2618
02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.190
it's a leadership muster.

2619
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:24.270
<v 4>That's what it feels straight up.
October 17th and 18th,
up in San Francisco.</v>

2620
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:28.080
All the other ones have sold out.
This is the six muster.
They've all sold out.

2621
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:30.540
This one's going,
this one's going to sell out even earlier.
Actually,

2622
02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:33.000
we're way ahead of schedule way ahead of schedule.

2623
02:31:33.090 --> 02:31:36.990
If you want to come to an extreme ownership.com you can come to the muster.

2624
02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:42.150
And then also for our military,

2626
02:31:46.771 --> 02:31:50.580

uh,

2627
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:55.470
first responder or military uniform wearing focused,
uh,
leadership,

2628

The roll call roll call zero zero one a first ever is going to happen.

2630
02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:05.620

And a,
this thing is,
it was,

2631
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:10.380
it was by request.
We worked with so many different,
uh,
first responders and,

2632
02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:11.260
uh,
you know,

2633

2634
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:20.640
federal,
state,
local.
We were worked with all levels of,
uh,
you know,
of,

2635
02:32:20.641 --> 02:32:24.000
of a,
of these groups.
And we've had so many folks say,
Hey,

2636
02:32:24.210 --> 02:32:28.650
can we have a focus leadership conference just for us?

2637
02:32:28.651 --> 02:32:29.484

This is for all you listeners that are interested in this.

2641
02:32:36.901 --> 02:32:40.020
We tried to make it at a price point that was much more affordable than the

2642
02:32:40.021 --> 02:32:44.850
muster of so that we could,
we could have as many folks attend as,
as could come.

2643
02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:47.070
And,
uh,
we hope you come from far and wide to be,

2644
02:32:47.071 --> 02:32:50.160
they're going to be talking about the importance of training,
the importance of,

2645
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:54.600
uh,
dealing with what you deal with every day and driving those standards and a,

2646
02:32:54.601 --> 02:32:59.490
and pushing your team,
uh,
and leading up the chain as well as,
uh,

2647
02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:03.360
you know,
all those kinds of specific law enforcement,

2648
02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:07.440
firefighter first responder,
uh,
military focused issues,
uh,

2649
02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:09.030
that we can really dive into.
You know,

2650
02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:11.520
we don't have to talk about the business leader stuff cause this is for you
guys.

2651
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:14.430
That's what it's for.
So if you're interested in that,
if you're on the fence,

2652
02:33:14.431 --> 02:33:18.330
if you're thinking about it,
come join us for a roll call at,
uh,

2653
02:33:18.450 --> 02:33:20.070
in Dallas September 21st.

2654
02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:26.220
And of course you've heard on this podcast,
we've,
we launched a new company,

2655
02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:31.290
a subsidiary company to echelon front.
It's called Echelon Front,
Overwatch,
r,

2656
02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:35.250
e,
F,
Overwatch.
And uh,
you can check that out at,
uh,

2657
02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:38.880
at@efoverwashed.com.
It's a,

2658
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:43.740
it's a great company designed to,
uh,
we,
we,
one of the biggest things that,
that,

2659
02:33:43.741 --> 02:33:46.620
uh,
that we see from the companies who work with is people ask us,

2660
02:33:46.621 --> 02:33:48.510
where can we get people like you?

2661
02:33:48.511 --> 02:33:51.270
Where can we get folks with a mindset of extreme ownership?

2662
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:54.660
And so we started that in the special operations world.

2663
02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:00.020
And the goal of Overwatch is to take a special operations veterans and combat

2664
02:34:00.451 --> 02:34:05.451
aviator veterans and place them in companies with a play.

2665
02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:09.840
Place them in companies who are looking for people with that mindset.

2666
02:34:10.410 --> 02:34:14.610
And EFO Overwatch is a,
is something I'm,
I'm super excited about.

2667
02:34:14.611 --> 02:34:17.010
We have a massive demand signal right now,
frankly,

2668

have a lot more clients that are reaching out,

2669
02:34:18.881 --> 02:34:23.120

uh,
in,

2670
02:34:23.130 --> 02:34:24.820

2671

People that make this podcast possible and it's not some long list of sponsors.

law enforcement,
firefighters,

2702
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:34.590
Without you protecting us from evil abroad and keeping us safe here at home,

2703
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:38.620
we wouldn't be able to do what we do.

2704
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:43.770
So thank you for doing what you do and to everyone else out there,

2705
02:36:46.690 --> 02:36:50.710
whether you are making something or baking something,

2706
02:36:50.711 --> 02:36:53.740
whether you're serving food or serving warrants,

2707
02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:57.820
whether you work in a bank or you build banks,

2708
02:36:58.030 --> 02:37:03.030
if you wear a suit and tie or you wear coveralls and a hard hat,

2709
02:37:03.251 --> 02:37:06.700
no matter who you are and what you do,

2710
02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:09.670
do it to the best of your ability.

2711
02:37:09.671 --> 02:37:13.420
Take pride in your work and be the best you can.

2712
02:37:13.421 --> 02:37:15.070
But at the same time,

2713
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:21.140
<v 0>stay balanced.
Be Aggressive,
but not reckless.</v>

2714
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:25.370
Take ownership,
but empower your team.
Be Humble,

2715
02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:29.030
but not passive.
Be disciplined,

2716
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:33.170
but be free.
Balance.

2717
02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:37.040
That dichotomy is of leadership and the dichotomies of life.

2718
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:41.870
And as you do that,
keep getting after it.

2719
02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:44.660
And until next time,

2720
