00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
I am seen at work as a very assertive and aggressive dude and I seem to rub

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.820
people the wrong way when they think I'm upset or frustrated at problems they

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.530
the present,
which is rarely the case.
I'm just so fired up.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.540
How do I work on Mike hacked while still being assertive with my team?

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.160
You know what?
I'm fired up too.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.920
How you liked that Jagan and w when I was young I,
this is

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.640
when I was younger.
Sure.
I rubbed some people the wrong way.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
I know that even when I was a young kid working on a construction site,

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.830
guess what?
I was doing work in too hard,

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.910
making people rubbing people the wrong way.
When I got to the team,

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.680
those little crew of us that were too hardcore,
we were too fired up.
We were,

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.130
I would run the o course with my,

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.330
with with a ruck sack with a 40 pound pack,
a 40 pound sandbag in it.

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.880
No one was doing that,
like everyone does it now.

15
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.880
But back then there was a small crew of us that were doing it,

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.970
running with jungle boots all the time instead of in sneakers.

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.220
And I literally got pulled aside by some of the old guys.
And by old guys,

18
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:10.200
I don't mean nom,
I mean old guys from wherever,
uh,
you know,
from the,

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.910
from the nineties or the late eighties.
And you know,

20
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.380
I'd get the,
hey,
you just need to calm down dude.
You know,
you need to do that.

21
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
And so yeah,
maybe I wrote those guys a little bit the wrong way.
Understandable.

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.660
But when I got a little older and a little bit more mature,

23
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.190
I got fired up to actually do a good job as a leader to actually build

24
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.930
relationships with my platoon mates.

25
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.170
And I got fired up

26
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.930
for people to,

27
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.860
instead of thinking that I was upset or frustrated what I was fired up because I

28
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:51.240
wanted people to think that I was calm and cool and collected.
So how's that for?

29
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:52.230
Don't totally different.

30
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.140
It's like when we say default aggressive and I always say,
hey,

31
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.510
you're not being aggressive and being aggressive towards your people.

32
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.210
It's not yelling.
It's being aggressive towards the mission.
I was,

33
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.500
I'm aggressive towards making people think that I'm not upset and that no matter

34
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.020
what's going on and they just look man chocolates,

35
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.380
he's not going to lose his temper.
He super levelheaded.
Right?
Um,

36
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.420
now that being shed,
that doesn't mean that I was passive.

37
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.240
Sure.
That doesn't mean that I wasn't assertive.

38
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.850
It means that I was aggressive and assertive,

39
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.090
but I did it with tact and instead of coming to people straight on,

40
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.200
I flanked them.

41
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.820
I've listened to their little ideas or I made their ideas come from me,

42
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:36.260
but they didn't know it.
I listen to their solutions.
I helped him supported,
well,

43
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.760
how do you go so far?

44
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.820
Just by helping people out and helping them with their idea instead of trying to

45
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.380
control them and make everything your idea.

46
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.180
So that's my advice here.
Relax,

47
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.710
calm down,
focus,
get fired up,

48
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:57.600
get aggressive about being tactful,
get aggressive about working with people,

49
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.320
get aggressive about showing your calmness.

50
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.540
That's what you get aggressive about.
Don't get assertive,
aggressive,

51
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.260
and create antagonistic relationships across your

52
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.870
<v 1>company.
Check sounds good.</v>

53
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.601
He said he,

54
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.601
he gets or they think he gets upset or frustrated at problems that they present,

55
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.400
which is rarely the case.
He said,
he said,
I'm just fired up.
So it's,
it's,

56
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.240
it seems like,
and I'm no expert,

57
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:33.960
but I'm trying to put myself in this position where like,

58
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:38.250
I think maybe like it,
it's just a presentation thing,

59
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.210
you know?
Like he definitely has a presentation is aggressive.

60
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:43.890
Like he's saying he's not even getting frustrated.

61
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.540
I'm getting frustrated with him for fracking this,
right?
Yeah.

62
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.310
It's definitely a presentation thing.
No doubt about it.
But,

63
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.760
so that means you say,
okay,
I'm presenting the wrong thing.

64
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.590
I will fix what I'm presenting it.
D Do you think,

65
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.660
actually I think you do think this or know this or whatever.
Oh,

66
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.070
you know how people,
they'll,
they'll get nuts or whatever.
They'll,
they'll,

67
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.690
they'll be aggressive.
They get fired up.
Right.

68
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.350
And you know,
the,

69
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:22.500
whether it be they'll lose their temper or their behave in a way that's,

70
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:27.501
that's aggressive towards people and their justification is not to say that this

71
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.030
guy does this.
I don't know.

72
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:34.770
But I'm just saying their justification is I'm just passionate about it.

73
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.750
I'm just whatever,
you know.
Um,
is that,

74
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:43.290
that's just the justification,
right?
It is because,
yeah.

75
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.910
Like if at the end of the day

76
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.830
<v 0>it is,
it's a joke.
It's a justification.
It is also a reality.</v>

77
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.830
So think about it from the other perspective.
If,
if you're dealing with someone,

78
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:54.970
if you have someone on your team that gets all that,
they're,

79
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:58.100
they're passionate about something and it can be problematic if they don't learn

80
00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:00.710
to control their passions,
right?
Cause they just get,
Hey,

81
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.760
we're gonna make this happen.

82
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:05.720
And they make bad decisions because they're so passionate about making something

83
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.990
happen that there dot did not doing something logical.
So yes,

84
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.600
you could say it's just an excuse and there's no such thing as a passionate

85
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:15.800
person.
But that actually wouldn't be true.
It's not an excuse.
It's a real thing.

86
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.480
Now,
if you are aware of that,
then why do you keep acting that way?

87
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.300
You've got to put your passions into check.
That's what you gotta do.

88
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.600
<v 1>Hundred percent.
Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.580
And I meant more like it's an excuse for their behavior.
You know,

90
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.530
like,
to me,
I personally,

91
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.710
I think that being passionate about something that you're into is good.

92
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.320
Wayne beneficial,
of course.
But again,

93
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.860
you know how to say like there's a difference between what you feel and how you

94
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.970
behave,
you know?
So if you're,
if you're super passionate about something,

95
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:45.870
it doesn't justify it.

96
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.670
Like all this aid rational or emotional or like loss of temper situation,

97
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.720
behavior.
You see what I'm saying?
So,
you know,
yeah,
be passionate,

98
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.860
but don't behave in some crazy off the handle.
It

99
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.060
agree.
So I think that they use their passion as an excuse for their behavior.

100
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.520
I just got a quick temper man.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

101
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.900
It doesn't mean that you can act like that's worse.
That's

102
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.010
exactly right.
Yeah.
That's just how I am.
I'm unique in that way.
