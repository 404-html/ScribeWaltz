00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.400
This is Jocko podcast number one oh five with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.260
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.630
specialist.
Vieira was witness to scenes of horror.

4
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.690
The enemy was all over,

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.500
at least a couple of hundred of them walking around for three or four minutes.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.690
It seemed like three or four hours.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.370
<v 0>They were shooting in machine gunning are wounded and laughing and giggling.</v>

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.960
<v 0>I knew they'd kill me if they saw I was alive when they got near,</v>

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.010
I played dead.

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
<v 0>I kept my eyes open and stared at a small tree.</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.870
I knew that dead men had their eyes open.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.210
<v 0>Vieira continues.
Then one of the North Vietnamese came up,
looked at me,</v>

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.280
then kicked me and I flopped over.

18
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040
<v 0>I guess he thought I was dead.
There was blood running out of my mouth,
my arm,</v>

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.070
my legs.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.340
<v 0>You took my watch and my 45 caliber pistol and walked on.</v>

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.780
I watched them strip off all our weapons.
They left.

24
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.510
Then they left back where they came from.

25
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.200
I remember the artillery,
the bombs,

26
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.960
the napalm everywhere real close around me.

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.900
It shook the ground underneath me,

28
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.840
but it was coming in on the north Vietnamese soldiers too.

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.770
All this and more,

30
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.430
much more took place between 6:50 AM and 7:40 AM on November 15th,

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520
1965 the agonies of Charlie company occurred over 140 yards of the line,

32
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.230
<v 1>okay.</v>

33
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.310
<v 0>But men were fighting and dying on three sides of our thinly held American</v>

34
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.310
perimeter
in the center.

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.930
I held the lives of all of these men in my hands.

36
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.570
<v 0>The badly wounded captain Bob Edwards was on the radio now asking for</v>

38
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.830
reinforcements.
The only reserve I had was a reconnaissance platoon.

39
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.040
22 men was the attack on Charlie company,

40
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.450
the main enemy threat.

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.710
<v 0>Delta Company and the combined mortar position.
We're also under attack now,</v>

43
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.803
reluctantly,

44
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.350
I told Captain Edwards that his company would have to fight on a loan for the

45
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:27.184
time being.

46
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.520
The Dean of the battle was unbelievable.

47
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.030
Rifles and machine guns and mortars and grenades rattled,
banged and boomed.

48
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.100
<v 0>Two batteries of 105 millimeter howitzers,</v>

50
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.260
12 big guns located on another landing zone,
five miles distant.

51
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.030
We're firing nonstop,

52
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.050
their shells exploding no more than 50 yards outside the ring of shallow

53
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.400
foxholes beside me in the battalion command post,

54
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.950
the air force forward controller,
Lieutenant Charlie hustings 26 from Lamesa,

55
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.260
New Mexico radio to special code word broken Arrow,

56
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.130
meaning American unit in danger of being overrun and within a short period of

57
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.090
time,

58
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.090
every available fighter bomber in south Vietnam with stacked overhead at a

59
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.880
thousand foot intervals from 7,000 feet to 35,000 feet waiting,

60
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.880
it's turned to deliver bombs and napalm to the battlefield.

61
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.450
<v 0>Among my sergeants,
there were three war men,</v>

63
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.210
men who parachuted into Normandy on d day and had survived the war in Korea.

64
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.160
In those old veterans were shocked by the savagery and hellish noise of this

65
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:41.994
battle.

66
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.870
<v 0>Choking clouds of smoke and dust obscured the killing ground.</v>

68
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.420
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.420
<v 0>we were dry mouth and our bowels churned with fear and still the enemy came on</v>

70
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.930
in waves.

71
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
<v 0>And that right there is from the opening chapter of the book.</v>

73
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:11.620
We were soldiers once and young,

74
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.820
but general how more and Joe Galloway and the book,

75
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.930
which was turned into a movie,

76
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.550
which I saw when it came out in 2002 Mel Gibson,

77
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.630
it's a good movie for sure,

78
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.610
but it's also a Hollywood movie in Hollywood movies.

79
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.730
They're forced to fit

80
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.940
<v 1>okay</v>

81
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.050
<v 0>into two hours and they got to follow some kind of a plot and they can't dig</v>

82
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:48.051
into the details and I can't really give you a comprehensive understanding of

83
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:48.721
the events.

84
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:52.410
And I purposely did not watch this movie again while preparing for this podcast

85
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:54.000
or cause I didn't want it in there.

86
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.560
I didn't want it in my brain.
The movies,

87
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.480
interpretation of the characters in it and the way that they were portrayed.

88
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.430
And the book is so good.

89
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.663
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

90
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.530
<v 0>It's so packed with detail and drama and action and</v>

91
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.520
<v 1>okay</v>

92
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.190
<v 0>and utterly incomprehensible heroism.</v>

93
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.203
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.280
<v 0>Everyone should read this book.
Everyone.</v>

95
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.010
It starts off,

96
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:33.011
it explains the way the battle unfolded and it talks how it went tactically,

97
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.710
operationally and strategically goes through all those levels of warfare.

98
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.530
And you can see in the book how strategy unfolds.

99
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:46.610
At the tactical level and how tactical situations impact strategy as well.

100
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:50.210
You can see it on both sides.
And there's also,
which is interesting,

101
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:55.070
there's significant commentary from the Vietnamese enemy leadership that they

102
00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.050
went back and interviewed after the war was,

103
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.430
which just makes it an incredible book.
And like I said,
everyone should read it.

104
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.850
So it tells the story of operations in the,

105
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.851
I drank valley in 1965 from November 14th until November 18th so five days.

106
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.680
<v 0>But the fighting as was noted in that opening chapter is absolutely brutal.</v>

108
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720
Leadership is tested over and over and over again.

109
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.360
<v 0>And this battle took place with battalions and companies from the Seventh</v>

111
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.010
Cavalry Regiment.

112
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.240
And if you remember the books we covered on General George Custer,

113
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.300
he was a officer that led seventh cavalry troops in the battle of little big

114
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:50.131
horn where he was surrounded and he was killed along with 267 of his soldiers,

115
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:56.421
all of them dead by the native American warriors on the Psu side from the Lakota

116
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:03.351
and the Dakota and the northern Cheyenne and the Arapaho tribes.

117
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.610
And Cavalry in those days meant horseback.

118
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.970
That's what I meant.
That's what mounted cavalry,
that's what it was.

119
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.070
And in 1965,

120
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.930
they adopted cavalry to a new kind of steed,

121
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.810
a new form of transport.
And this was the helicopter.

122
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.890
And in 1965 they converted the 11th Air Assault Test Division to the First

123
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.870
Cavalry Division.

124
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.040
And the first and second battalions of the First Cavalry Division soon took on

125
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:42.890
the historical name of general Custer's and unit.
And,

126
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:45.630
and by the way,
general cost of the seventh Cav,

127
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.580
even though that's kind of the most famous along with this,
I guess,

128
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.490
along with the,
I drank valley,
but they're,

129
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.720
they the seventh cabs served in World War II and Korea,

130
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.670
all kinds of incredible service there.
And a lot of that is covered in the book.

131
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.460
But again,

132
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.630
we'll have to move through this a little bit more quickly.

133
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.820
Otherwise,
go read the book,
which I highly recommend,

134
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.580
but let's get into it.
Uh,

135
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
starting about where Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore takes over the first battalion

136
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.490
seventh cavalry.
Going back to the book on Monday,

137
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:34.260
June 29th as scheduled,
I took command of my battalion.
I was 42 years old,

138
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:38.910
a west point graduate of class of 1945 with 19 years commissioned service

139
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.310
including 14 month tour in Korea,

140
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.920
combat tour in Korea.
In a brief talk to the troops afterward,

141
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.070
I told him that this was a good battalion,
but it would get better.

142
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.530
I will do my best.
I said,
and I expect the same from each you

143
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.440
before taking command.

144
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.320
I had a long talk with the most important man in any battalion.

145
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.260
The sergeant major Bazell,

146
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.530
l Plumley 44 years old and six and a six foot two inch bear of a man hailed from

147
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:16.800
West Virginia.
The men sometimes called him old iron jaw,

148
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.090
but never in his hearing.

149
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.970
Plumley was a two warm man and war master parachute wings with his five combat

150
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:27.240
jumps stars.

151
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.980
He was what the young airborne types called a Ford jump bastard.

152
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.260
Plumley had survived all four combat jumps of the 82nd airborne division in

153
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.180
World War II,

154
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.490
Sicily and Salerno in 1943 the and then in 1944 d day at Normandy and market

155
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.320
garden in the Netherlands for that matter.

156
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.840
He also made one combat parachute jump in the Korean War with the hundred 87th

157
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.660
airborne infantry regimen.
He ended World War Two,

158
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:02.661
a buck sergeant and was promoted to sergeant major in 1961 so let's think about

159
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:07.530
that for a minute.
Let's think about that.
I mean,
we've talked,

160
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.380
we've definitely talked about Normandy.
We definitely talked about market garden.

161
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.370
He jumped into both those and jumped into Sisley and Salerno and jumped into

162
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.260
combat in the Korean War.
Unbelievable.

163
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.790
Going back to the book,

164
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:31.350
the Sergeant Major was a no bullshit guy who believed as I did in tough
training,

165
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.610
tough discipline and tough physical conditioning.
To this day,

166
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:39.450
there are veterans of the battalion who are convinced that God may look like

167
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:41.400
Sergeant Major Basil Plumley,

168
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.140
but he isn't nearly as tough as the sergeant major on sins,

169
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.500
small or large.
Privately.

170
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.590
I thanked my lucky stars that I had inherited such a treasure.

171
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.440
I told Sergeant Major Plumley that he had unrestricted access to me at any time

172
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.340
on any subject he wished to raise.
After the ceremony,

173
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.570
the company commanders and the battalion staff got to look at their new boss and

174
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:09.420
award on my standards.
They were fairly simple.

175
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.140
Only first place trophies will be displayed,

176
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.970
excepted or presented in this battalion.
Second place in our line of work,

177
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:21.810
his defeat of the unit on the battlefield and death for the individual and

178
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:22.644
combat.

179
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.900
No fat troops are officer's decision making will be decentralized.

180
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.640
Push the power down.

181
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.830
It pays off in wartime loyalty flows down as well.

182
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.480
I check up on everything.

183
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.970
I am available day or night to talk with any officer of this battalion.
Finally,

184
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.470
the sergeant major works for only for me and takes orders only for me.

185
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.270
He is my right hand man,
so he sat in the stage

186
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.270
pretty interesting.
Not only first place trophies,

187
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.350
second place,
no,
not happening here.

188
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:04.961
Back to the book.

189
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:09.370
The officer's of my new battalion were the usual great army mix of men who had

190
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:10.570
come from their jobs,

191
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.590
come to their jobs from west point ROTC officer candidate school and military

192
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:15.670
schools like the citadel.

193
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.110
Most of the young second lieutenants had come through ocs and college ROTC

194
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:23.350
programs.
There were three rifle companies in the battalion,

195
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.930
Alpha Bravo and Charlie companies.

196
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.370
Each at full strength supposed to have six officers in 164 enlisted men.

197
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.410
They were my maneuver elements.

198
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.720
Each rifle company had three rifle platoons plus one platoon of three 81

199
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:39.850
millimeter mortar squads for fire support.

200
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.210
Each rifle platoon in turn had three rifles,

201
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:48.070
squads plus a weapons squad of two m 60 machine guns for fire support.

202
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.700
So there's,
there's the breakdown right there may.
And they also had a,

203
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.890
another combat support company,
Delta Company,
which had a recon platoon,

204
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.690
a mortar platoon and an anti tank platoon.

205
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.190
And they converted the unneeded anti tank platoons in a machine gun platoon for,

206
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.070
for duty in Vietnam because there was no enemy tanks going up against.

207
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.200
So that's so that's what the battalion was looking like.

208
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.830
Going back to the book during the,
during those first 14 months from now,

209
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:16.360
he's going to talk about their work up a little bit,

210
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.030
how they got ready for combat back to the book.

211
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:22.000
During those 14 months before we sailed for Vietnam,

212
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.270
we spent most of the time in the field practicing assault landings from

213
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:29.620
helicopters and the incredibly complex coordination of artillery tactically or

214
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:34.621
support an aerial rocket artillery with the all important flow of helicopters

215
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:36.510
into an out of the battle zone.

216
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.870
Commanders had to to learn to see terrain differently,

217
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.600
to add a constant scan for landing zones,

218
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.630
which are called LZs and up zones pzs to all the other features they had to keep

219
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:49.894
in mind.

220
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.250
We practice rapid loading and unloading of men and materiel to reduce the

221
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.930
helicopters window of vulnerability.

222
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.010
Total flexibility was the watchword and planning and attitude.

223
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.990
There was one bit of sobering reality that I insisted be introduced at every

224
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:05.920
level in this training.

225
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.780
We would declare a platoon commander dead and Tate led his sergeant takeover and

226
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:14.560
carry out the mission or declare a sergeant dead and have one of his PFCs take

227
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:15.640
over running the squad.

228
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.330
We were training for war and leaders are killed in battle.

229
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.080
I wanted every man trained for and capable of taking over the job of the man

230
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.680
above him.
So their,
their work in a whole new gig here.
They'd never,

231
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.710
no one had really done this before.
Riding,

232
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:36.280
everyone's going into combat on helicopters and obviously helicopters give you

233
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.450
great amount of maneuverability.

234
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:41.440
You can be up vertically and take off and travel a great distance and sat down

235
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:43.960
anywhere or not anywhere,
just about anywhere.

236
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:45.550
You can sit down in a lot of places I should say,

237
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.660
cause you can't sit down anywhere,

238
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:50.710
especially in the jungle where you've got trees and all kinds of obstacles and

239
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:53.060
then you've enemy on top of that.
And helicopters are,

240
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.880
are pretty vulnerable flying machines.

241
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.620
And so this idea of what,
what they were practicing was this massive movement,

242
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:04.040
move all the troops into the combat zone very quickly and the enemy doesn't

243
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:07.160
expect you.
And you can just show up there.
So it's,

244
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:10.760
that's what they're practicing over and over again and clearly,

245
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.660
you know,
a Korean War veteran,
like how more was,

246
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:17.300
he knows that leaders can get killed in combat.

247
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.390
And so he's sometimes kill on the leaders and training.

248
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:23.090
And that's a tradition that we still had.
We do that all the time.

249
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:24.440
When I was running training the seal teams,

250
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.440
the minute the leaders started to get a grip on things,
it was like,
okay,

251
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:29.510
you're dead.
Next man's got to step up.

252
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.470
And sometimes that would just wreck a platoon or a task unit leader dies.

253
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.960
If they're a good leader and they're not and no one has used to stepping up,

254
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.920
it'd be problematic.

255
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.400
But sometimes it would actually be beneficial because you get some guy that's a

256
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.060
micromanager,

257
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.550
kill him and then watch everything run smoothly and you come back and you go,

258
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.384
dude,

259
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.780
you better back off a little bit cause this guy's running a better show than you

260
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:54.980
are.
And it's really clear.
So sometimes we teach guys lessons that way

261
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.630
back to the book.
Unfortunately,

262
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.420
my battalion and every other in the division now began to suffer the

263
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:07.190
consequences of President Johnson's refusal to declare a state of emergency and

264
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:11.300
extend the active duty tours of draftees and reserve officers.

265
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.340
The order came down,
any soldier who had less of less,

266
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.870
who had 60 days or less left to serve on his enlistment as of the date of

267
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:25.580
deployment,
August 16th must be left behind.
We were sick at heart.

268
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.860
We were being shipped off to war,

269
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:32.510
sadly under strength and crippled by the loss of almost a hundred troopers in my

270
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:33.440
battalion alone.

271
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.120
The very men who would be the most useful and combat those who had trained the

272
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:40.610
longest and the new techniques of helicopter warfare.

273
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.410
We're by this order taken away from us.
It made no sense then.

274
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.410
It makes no sense now.
So again,

275
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:52.220
I talked about the strategic kind of implications that these guys felt and this

276
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:54.980
is one of them,
and obviously I'm jumping through the book.

277
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:57.740
They talked more about the workup and what they did to prepare,

278
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:01.040
but now he's getting to this point where President Johnson doesn't declare a

279
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:04.820
state of emergency and keep these guys in.
And so,
you know,

280
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:09.230
that's a political decision obviously.
Uh,
but what awareness does impact,

281
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.990
sure it impacts the guys on the front line.
That's where it impacts.

282
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.080
Now like I said,
this book is written not only by,

283
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.170
not only by Lieutenant General Hal Moore is how he retired in this book.

284
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.560
I'll refer to him as lieutenant colonel or sometimes I guess I'm just a

285
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.250
disrespectful and call him how more,
I don't mean it disrespectfully,

286
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.630
but anyways,
how Moore wrote the book.

287
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:40.631
But he also wrote the book along with another guy named Joe Galloway and you

288
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.460
know,
you know what a ghost writer is.
Yeah,
yeah.
Ghost rider.

289
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:46.550
Well this is so ghost writer writes a book,
a person's book,

290
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:47.900
but no one's supposed to know it.

291
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.040
And then there's people that write the book but they get credit for it.
Right.

292
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.660
And you might think that's a situation here looking at the title cause you've

293
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:59.580
got Lieutenant General Harold more retired and Joseph L.

294
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.280
Galloway like you know,
it doesn't say any servicing.
Well

295
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.130
in this particular case that could give you an absolutely wrong impression

296
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:10.800
because Joe Galloway was a reporter,

297
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.760
a combat reporter who was obviously,

298
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.410
he was very courageous and,

299
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.430
and basically got after it for lack of a better word.

300
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.810
So I'll go and where they introduce him a little bit.
Back to the book,

301
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:29.220
Upi reporter Joe Galloway,
a 23 year old native of Refugio,

302
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:32.910
Texas marched with us when he hooked up with us,

303
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.220
he carried on his shoulder and m 16 rifle,

304
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.430
which the special forces commander Major Charles Beckwith had handed him when

305
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.330
the fight was over.

306
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.710
Galloway told Beckwith that strictly speaking under the Geneva Convention,

307
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.580
he was a civilian noncombatant Beckwith's response,

308
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.000
no such thing in these mountains.
Boy,
take that rifle.

309
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.380
So if you know anything about Charles Beckwith,
Major Charlie Beck width,

310
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:03.381
it's the guy that created delta force complete badass warrior.

311
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.790
And he was a special forces commander in Vietnam and was one of the first people

312
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:11.430
that apparently Galloway work with and Galloway said,
you know,

313
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:12.600
you better arm yourself.

314
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.100
So here's Galloway talking.

315
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.750
Galloway remembers my first time out with how Moore's first battalion seventh

316
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:26.580
cavalry was a hellish walk into the sun to remote Monta Guard mountain village.

317
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.580
We got into a patch of brush and wait a minute.

318
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:33.240
Vines so thick and phony that every step had to be carved out with machetes.

319
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.720
We covered maybe 300 yards in four hours and 40 to fast running chest deep

320
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:42.300
mountain stream just as darkness fell than huddled in our ponchos,

321
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:45.270
wet and freezing all night long.
At first light,

322
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:49.170
I pinched off a small piece of c four plastic explosive from the emergency

323
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:53.520
supplies in my pack and use it to boil up a canteen of water for coffee.

324
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.730
If you let see for very carefully,

325
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.270
you could be drinking hot coffee and maybe 30 seconds if you were careless,

326
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.950
it blew off your arm
over us.
First cigarette,

327
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.640
I watched more as men.
First they shaved,

328
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.860
shaved up here.
I was amazed.
Then the colonel himself,
blonde,

329
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.430
jut jawed and very intense,
uh,
son of Bardstown,

330
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:22.431
Kentucky and West Point walked by on this morning rounds with the sergeant made

331
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.520
with sergeant major Plumley more look to me over and said,

332
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.710
we all shave in my outfit.
Reporters included my steaming coffee water,

333
00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:35.580
went for a wash and a shave and I gained a measure of respect for the man,

334
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.520
daily disciplined and all things.
You know,

335
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:43.260
that's another thing that I failed to mention,

336
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:47.560
but it's very clear when you read the book is this is 1965 and the war had not

337
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:50.290
escalated at all and it wasn't the,

338
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.560
the meat grinder that it turned into.

339
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.740
So these guys,
you know,
in their workup,
oh,

340
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.910
they knew that they were going to fight,
but they didn't.
They didn't know.

341
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.590
It wasn't the Vietnam that we think of now where there's a lot of casualties

342
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:08.260
happening if it hadn't gotten there yet.
And as a matter of fact,

343
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.420
this battle is really the first one where that,

344
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.290
where you start seeing very significant American casualties.

345
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.030
The guy that's in charge over how,

346
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:26.560
over how Moore is a guy named Colonel Brown and he shows up going back to the

347
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.050
book,
not long laughter.
Colonel Brown flew in,

348
00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.090
checked on the situation with Alpha Company and then called me aside how I'm

349
00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:37.720
moving your battalion West tomorrow morning.
He said on folding his map,

350
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.520
here is your area of operations,
north of two Pong and the I drank valley.

351
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.110
Your mission's the same one you have now find and kill the enemy.

352
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.600
He rapidly outlined the scope of operations and the resources he could spare 16

353
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.550
you h one d Hueys,
so that's a Huey helicopter.

354
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:02.200
It's the most,
I guess the the most iconic helicopter,

355
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.400
a probably of any military and certainly of Vietnam.

356
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:10.720
The Huey helicopter is,
is completely iconic.

357
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.240
16 Hueys to move my troops to one oh five howitzer batteries within range to

358
00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:19.840
support us in at least two days on the ground patrolling.

359
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.030
He added that Alpha Company of the 229th helicopter assault helicopter battalion

360
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:29.980
would provide the helicopters.
The two 29th a company commander,

361
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.180
Major Bruce Crandall was on his way.
Now one more thing.

362
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:38.860
How in that area,
be sure your companies are close enough for mutual support.

363
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.890
So the reason I highlighted that

364
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.750
a lot of times people have a tendency in,

365
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.120
in combat situations,

366
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:52.030
especially when planning to get too far apart from each other,

367
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.670
then I would see this all the time.
And what happens is it,

368
00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:59.590
it seems to make sense because you cover more ground or you have better angles

369
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:01.360
and it seems like a good idea.
Like,
hey,

370
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:03.850
we'll just split up and you can take care of your guys and I'll take care of my

371
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:04.684
guys.

372
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.700
But you always need to stay within a position where you can mutually support

373
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:10.930
each other.
Where if we get in trouble,

374
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:13.090
we can cover and move that that's what it is.
And you,

375
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.020
you want to be able to cover,
to move,
cover,
move.

376
00:23:15.021 --> 00:23:19.330
So the minute you're out of sight,
out of line of sight,
out of radio,

377
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
out of the,
out of,
uh,
uh,

378
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.480
distance where your weapons can be used to support your alone.

379
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.760
That's the thing,
you,
you get away from the line of sight,
radio contact,

380
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.100
the distance that weapons can be shot effectively from the other unit that

381
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:38.170
you're out there with.
Now you are alone.

382
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.720
So when you're planning,
make sure,
and he's saying in that area,

383
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.780
I always use rule,
oh,
we as much as often as possible.

384
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.610
Are there times where you can,
you can,
you can flex that rule a little bit.

385
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.190
Of course there are there situations you can get into and you can,

386
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.870
it might be a better tactical call,

387
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.490
but always keep in mind what you're doing and what you're sacrificing when you

388
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:06.491
can no longer more mutually support the other units out you're out with and they

389
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:09.830
cannot mutually support you.
You're alone.
Mm,

390
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

391
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.460
<v 0>So he knows this is going to be a little bit of a hot area.
At least he exists.</v>

392
00:24:15.461 --> 00:24:18.760
He suspects it.
Going back to the book,
how ready was my battalion for combat?

393
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.060
We had never maneuvered in combat as an entire battalion,

394
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.880
although all three rifle companies had been minor scrapes.

395
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.630
So they've been in Vietnam for a while.
They'd been in a little bit of contact,

396
00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:31.180
but nothing too major and like he just said,
none of it,

397
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.380
none of them had been been been out as a group,
as a battalion.
Back to the book,

398
00:24:35.381 --> 00:24:38.740
most of the men had never seen an enemy soldier dead or alive.

399
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:43.960
We'd killed fewer than 10 black Pajama gorillas in the get acquainted patrols

400
00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:46.030
and small operations.
Since our arrival,

401
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.970
the four line companies had 20 of their authorized 23 officers,

402
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.740
but the enlisted ranks had been badly whittled down by expiring enlistments

403
00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.070
malaria cases and requirements for base camp guards and workers back in and k

404
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.280
Alpha company had 115 men,

405
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.670
49 fewer than authorized Bravo company at 114 men was 50 short Charlie company

406
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:17.911
at 106 men down by 58 and the weapons company Delta had only 76 men.

407
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.790
42 fewer than authorized headquarters company was also under strength and I had

408
00:25:24.221 --> 00:25:28.570
been forced to draw it down further by sending men out to fill crucial medical

409
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:31.780
and communication vacancies in the line companies.

410
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.480
I didn't like being shorthanded,

411
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:40.050
but things had been no different in the Korean War and somehow we made do you

412
00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:43.930
just suck it up and do it?
And we would do the same.

413
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.970
We do the same way in the,

414
00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:50.971
I drank the officer's and shows would do what they could to make up the slack

415
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.140
just as we had done in Korea.

416
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.500
So my point in reading that these guys are heavily under,

417
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.630
they're supposed to have 150 people and they have,
you know,

418
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.000
a hundred 105 whatever,

419
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.840
and there's nothing they could do about it.

420
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.160
And it's also interesting and worth noting that he has a headquarters company.

421
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:09.820
So you've got the,

422
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.820
the battalion commander and he's got a group of guys that do weapons for him and

423
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.620
also communications.
And he's pushed those guys out.

424
00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:21.910
So instead of keeping those guys and making him his,
his own team,

425
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.500
all fat and happy,
nope,

426
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.950
he makes his teen thin and gives as much as he can to the,

427
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:30.910
to the forces that are out in the field.
So another good note on leadership.

428
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.333
<v 2>No.</v>

429
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.470
<v 0>Now they're getting ready to roll in and we will talk about,</v>

430
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.230
he's kind of going through the plan a little bit.
Here we go.
Back to the book.

431
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:45.550
I would personally land on the first helicopter pilot,

432
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.050
my Bruce Crandall and Bruce Granules was the commander of the helicopters that

433
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:52.530
are flying the men that would permit me a final low level look at the landing

434
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:56.010
zone and surrounding terrain and with Crandall in the front seat and me in the

435
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:56.281
back.

436
00:26:56.281 --> 00:27:00.530
We can work out on the spot any last minute diversion to an alternate landers

437
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.890
landing zone if necessary and fix any other problems with the lift and the

438
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:06.090
American civil war.

439
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.960
It was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as

440
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:13.110
possible.
There were sound reasons for this.

441
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.810
If you are riding and your soldiers are marching,

442
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.350
how can you judge how tired they are?
How thirsty,

443
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.660
how heavy their packs way on their shoulders.

444
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.340
I applied the same philosophy in Vietnam where every battalion commander had his

445
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:31.120
own command and control helicopter.
Some commanders use their helicopters,

446
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.590
their personal mountain.
I never believed in that.

447
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.920
You had to get on the ground with your troops to see and hear what was
happening.

448
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.600
You have to soak up firsthand information for your instincts to operate

449
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:46.470
accurately.
Besides,
it's too easy to be crisp,

450
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.450
cool and detached at 1500 feet to easy to demand the impossible of your troops.

451
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:56.630
Too easy to make mistakes that are fatal only to those souls far below in the

452
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:59.250
mud,
the blood and confusion.

453
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.700
So this is something we talk about all the time from a leadership perspective,

454
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.130
do you cannot be,
you know,
it's,
it's the,
it's the dichotomy of detachment,
right?

455
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.720
It does pay.
And there's certain times where you can tell in these situations,

456
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.930
if you're in the command helicopter that's up above the fighting,
well,
you're,

457
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.670
you're defacto.
I mean you,

458
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.300
you are detached from the situation and you can see what's happening and you

459
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:25.020
have,
you have a good view of what's going on.

460
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.040
But even though we have a good view,
you're also missing a bunch.

461
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.860
You're missing what it's like down there.
You're missing what the men are seeing.

462
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:33.240
You'll missing one.
It looks like to them,

463
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:35.550
you're missing the communication breakdowns that are happening down there.

464
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:38.530
So you have to find that balance between these two.
And,

465
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.880
and he clearly is aware of that.

466
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.530
He's preparing for this and he's got a book,
a book,

467
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.400
<v 2>okay.</v>

468
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.930
<v 0>Called Street without joy by a guy named Bernard fall.</v>

469
00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.120
And it's,
it's a book about Vietnam.

470
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:02.340
It spoke about the,
the,

471
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:08.000
the tragedy that the French troops went through fighting the Vietnamese and he

472
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:11.630
says that he took one lesson away from that book and this is the lesson,

473
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.040
death is the price you pay for underestimating this tenacious enemy.

474
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.870
Hmm.
So he was aware and like General Mattis said,
you know,

475
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.470
not too long ago they were talking about General Madison,

476
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.750
how can we read so many books?
And he says,
cause I get to see,
I get to learn.

477
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.540
And this is a classic case.
He,
he knew,
he read books about the,

478
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.640
the French that had fought the Vietnamese what,
10 years earlier,

479
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.610
11 years earlier.
And that made him more prepared.

480
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

481
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.960
<v 0>Now talking a little bit.
Like I said,
there's a,</v>

482
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.070
there's great information in here about the enemy and like I said,

483
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:50.200
they went and interviewed and got reports from the enemy

484
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.030
and here we go.
A little bit about the enemy.
Back to the book,

485
00:29:55.031 --> 00:30:00.031
the soldiers commanded by Brigadier General Chu [inaudible] man had been

486
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:04.240
training for more than 18 months when they joined the people's army.

487
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:08.350
Each recruit was issued to khaki shirts,
two pairs of khaki trousers,

488
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.270
a sewing kit,
and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals cut from used tire trucks.

489
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.680
Those uniforms were expected to last five years.

490
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.070
Basic training lasted 13 weeks,
six days a week,

491
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:25.690
6:00 AM to 9:15 PM the instructor's emphasized weapons and tactics.

492
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.710
The house of warfare,
while the political commissaries had time,

493
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.400
had time set aside each day to lecture on the why's of this war.

494
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.810
The recruits were reminded constantly that their fathers had beaten the French

495
00:30:37.811 --> 00:30:42.070
colonialists.
Now it was their duty to defeat the American imperialists.

496
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.250
They were imbued with hace men's dictum.

497
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.430
Nothing is more precious than freedom and independence.

498
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.070
After basic training.

499
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.090
Some were selected for six months of NCO school and would emerge as new

500
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.440
corporals for the rest.

501
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.860
Advanced infantry training included familiarization with all weapons,

502
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.090
the use of explosive ambush tactics,
recognizance tactics,

503
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.310
adjusting mortar fire and patrol tactics.

504
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.200
And June of 1964 man soldiers moved up into the mountains of north Vietnam,

505
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.460
Vietnam terrain similar to that in Western highlands of South Vietnam.

506
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.730
Here,
physical conditioning was emphasized.

507
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.470
They scaled steep slopes while wearing rucksacks loaded with 50 to 60 pounds of

508
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.160
rocks.

509
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.990
They're advanced training now also focused on the art of camouflage when the

510
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:33.040
time came for them to begin the arduous two month journey down the Ho Chi Minh

511
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:37.540
trail through Laos General Man's regiment broke down into battalions for

512
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:42.280
security purposes.
Each moving separately,
at least three days ahead of the next.

513
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.660
Each soldier carried four pounds of rice,
seven days rations,

514
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.080
plus another eight pounds of food stuffs that we're expected to last him the

515
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:53.410
whole trip.
Two pounds of salt,
two pounds of wheat flour,

516
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.210
and four pounds of salt pork.

517
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.400
One man in every squad carried the aluminum cook pot that would,

518
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.840
that the squads rice would be boiled in.

519
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.440
Each man also carried 50 anti-malaria pills,

520
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.040
one for each day on the trail and a hundred vitamin B,

521
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:13.720
one tabs to be taken at the rate of three per week.
Despite the pills,

522
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:17.740
virtually every man who walked the trail contract and malaria and on average

523
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.330
three or four soldiers of each 160 man company would die on the journey.

524
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.780
Malaria,
diarrhea,
accidents,

525
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.900
poisonous snakes and American error rates took their toll.

526
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.460
Mans soldiers march nine miles each day.

527
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.260
The distance between rest camps where they spent each night,
every day,

528
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.350
every fourth,
they stayed in camp taking the day off to rest up,

529
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.920
wash their clothes and tend to minor medical problems.

530
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:51.140
So this is a legit enemy.
We're looking at legit enemy,
organized,

531
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.880
well trained,
hard,
tough,
well led

532
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.583
<v 2>and</v>

533
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.260
<v 0>and ready and you can't ever,
you know,</v>

534
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.500
this is one of the biggest problems with fighting a counterinsurgency is you're

535
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:09.710
going against someone that's fighting on their home turf and that is just that

536
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:11.570
you can't eat.
How do you overcome that?
Advantage.
Well,

537
00:33:11.571 --> 00:33:14.540
you overcome that advantage with firepower with some technology,

538
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.400
but that is a hard advantage to overcome.

539
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.443
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

540
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.650
<v 0>and here's a quote from General An,
when you landed there,</v>

541
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.420
you landed right in the middle of three of our battalions of the 66 regimen.

542
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.760
Our service,
our reserve force,

543
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.360
it was the strongest we had at full strength.

544
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:40.310
The battalion's each had about 450 men.
Also,
there was a headquarters battalion.

545
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.210
The is total strength was about 1600 men,

546
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.290
so they're kind of by chance set up on the same spot where these guys are going

547
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:56.630
to go in,
which is l z x Ray Landing Zone X ray,

548
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:00.530
and here these,

549
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:06.090
they're flying in into the Lz x-ray captain John Heron,

550
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.980
who's Bravo company,
troops filled the helicopter recalls.
It was a cool,

551
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.610
it was a misty cool morning with some low hanging fog when we lifted off,

552
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.930
but shortly after takeoff we broke into the clear and you could see the one oh

553
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:22.931
five artillery pounding the areas around the Lz as we headed in Vietnam.

554
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.970
Even in war was scenic with green jungle,

555
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.440
heavy forested mountains and wild looking rivers criss crossing the terrain.

556
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.940
Now the helicopters of the Ariel rocket artillery slammed the perimeter with

557
00:34:39.191 --> 00:34:40.120
rockets,
grenades,

558
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:45.121
and machine gun fire using 24 of the 48 2.7 inch rockets.

559
00:34:45.641 --> 00:34:49.450
They carried,
so it's the,
it's the same thing that we've heard before.

560
00:34:49.451 --> 00:34:54.451
It's covered move right as you come into a landing zone like they did in d day,

561
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.190
what do you do first?
You bomb the crap out of it.

562
00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.040
You hit it with naval gunfire and they're doing the same thing here.

563
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.480
They're prepping the landing zone by dropping a bunch of one oh five howitzers

564
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.930
into the,
around the surrounding area,
around the landing zone,

565
00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:09.190
and then the helicopters wants,

566
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:12.490
it's too close and the and the howitzers have to turn off.

567
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.360
Then the helicopter starts shooting and they do their best to clear the area

568
00:35:16.361 --> 00:35:17.920
around the landing zone.
That's what's going on.

569
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.273
<v 2>Okay.</v>

570
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.290
<v 0>Back to the book,
the People's Army commander on the battlefield.</v>

571
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.630
Then senior Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen,

572
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.200
who on says when you drop troops into x,

573
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.730
I was on Tupac Mountain.

574
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.920
We had a very strong position and a strong mobile command group.
We were ready.

575
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.370
We were ready.
Had prepared for you and expected you to come.

576
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.350
The only question was when the trees and Bush limited our view of the

577
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:47.370
helicopters landing,

578
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.510
but we had an observation post on top of the mountain and they reported to us

579
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.780
when you dropped troops and when you move them.
So

580
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.110
man,
you know I talk about all the time about having the high ground.
Well,

581
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:05.220
when these guys are landing in a valley and they're surrounded by hand,

582
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.670
high grounds,
so it's a,
you're at,
you're at a tactical disadvantaged there,

583
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.530
right?
As soon as it just about,
as soon as they hit the ground,

584
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:15.180
they're there for a little while and they get a prisoner.

585
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.140
The the Americans get a prisoner and here's there's a translator and he

586
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:26.520
translates the prisoners words.
And here's what the prisoner says.
Well,

587
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:28.350
here's what the translator says.
He says,

588
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:31.470
there are three battalions on the mountain who want very much to kill Americans

589
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:32.970
but have not been able to find any.

590
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.940
Now you take that with a grain of salt because it's coming from a prisoner,

591
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.440
but it's not nothing.
I'll put it to you that way.
It's something

592
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.661
back to the book.

593
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:48.870
Suddenly a few rifle shots rang out in the area where the prisoner had been

594
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:52.200
captured.
Sergeant Gill,
Ruth's men were in contact.

595
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.310
It was now 12:15 PM we had to move fast.
If we were going to survive,

596
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.460
had to get off the landing zone and hit them before they could hit us.

597
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.900
Only if we brought the enemy to battle deep in the trees and brush.

598
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.770
Could we stand even a slim chance of holding onto the clearing and getting the

599
00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:09.090
rest of the battalion landed.

600
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.560
That football field size clearing was our lifeline and our supply line.

601
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.210
If the enemy close the way to the helicopters,
all of us would die in this place.

602
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:22.530
So that's one of the,
one of the hard things about helicopter warfare,

603
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.430
especially in Vietnam,
well actually anywhere is you go,
that's great.

604
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:30.310
You can go a long distance and get in there.
But then once you're there,
there's,

605
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.540
if the helicopters can't come get you out or they can't resupply you,

606
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.540
you're in real problem.
You're,
you're back to the word that I said earlier.

607
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:40.500
You're alone.
Back to the book.

608
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:42.030
Even as the first shots rang out,

609
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.420
I was rating Ewing heron to saddle up the rest of Bravo company,

610
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.420
the rest of his [inaudible] Bravo company men and move out fast toward the

611
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:52.200
mountain to develop a situation turning to the,
and he's again,

612
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.790
there's all these characters.
I mean there's,

613
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.190
there's all the company commanders that platoon commanders,
the platoon leaders,

614
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:01.440
the platoon sergeants,
there's the ground troops,

615
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:02.750
there's all these characters and,

616
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.290
and the book does an outstanding job of detailing who all these individuals were

617
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:11.570
and what their background was,
where they came from.
And I,
I just don't,
we,

618
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.960
we can't do that right now,

619
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.120
but that's why you buy the book and you read the book.

620
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.850
But this guy and the doll is one of the company commanders.
So here we go,

621
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:24.540
turning them into doll.
I told them that the original plan was out the window,

622
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.710
that his Alpha company should immediately take over [inaudible] security and get

623
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:31.380
ready to move up on Bravo.
Company's left when Charlie,

624
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.560
when enough of Charlie Company and arrived on the next lift who assumed the job

625
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:38.440
of securing and clearing.
So
classic.

626
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.610
You hit the ground and and now all of a sudden the plan is out the window.

627
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.970
Right out the window.
We're going with our standard operating procedures,

628
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:48.010
which is,
hey,
we're going to move a company here.

629
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:51.970
You're going to set up perimeter security and go back to the book and a small

630
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:53.500
cops,
the other two platoons,

631
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.280
platoons of Bravo company men had opened c ration cans and we're grabbing a

632
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:02.770
bite.
When they heard the first shots in the brush,

633
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.640
the older sergeants glanced at one another and nodded,
eat fast.

634
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:11.641
They told the men and get ready to move the battle of Lz x ray had just begun

635
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.770
and it,
it doesn't take long to begin.

636
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.450
Going back to the book says Sergeant Gill Wreath,

637
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.280
we were virtually pinned to the ground and taking casualties.

638
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.070
Lieutenant Dennis deal remembers that moment.

639
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.400
Daphne's platoon was taking moderate fire.

640
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.930
We could all hear it through the foliage and I heard the crackling on my radio

641
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.880
hour wasn't some sort of trouble.
The firing,

642
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:42.830
it increased in volume and intensity.
Then I saw my first wounded trooper,

643
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.800
probably the first American wounded in Lz x Ray.

644
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.810
He was shot in the neck or mouth or both was still carrying his rifle,

645
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.110
was ambulatory and appeared stunned at what had happened to him.

646
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.820
When he asked where to go.

647
00:39:55.821 --> 00:39:59.300
I put my arm around him and pointed to where I had last seen the battalion

648
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:04.190
commander.
So it's immediately on and you of course it is cause there's,

649
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:09.530
there's three battalions of Vietnamese soldiers there.

650
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.673
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

651
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.143
<v 0>And this is,</v>

652
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.410
this is how I'm more talking back to the book of the Military Historian Sla.

653
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:25.580
Marshall wrote that at the beginning of a battle units fractionalize groping

654
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:29.930
between the antagonist takes place and the battle takes form from all of this.

655
00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.370
Marshall had it right.

656
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.160
That is precisely what was happening up in the scrub brush.

657
00:40:34.161 --> 00:40:39.161
A brush above landing zone x ray this day and no other single event would have

658
00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:44.990
greater impact on the shape of this battle than what Lieutenant Henry heric was

659
00:40:44.991 --> 00:40:49.180
in the process of doing.
Herrick charged,
right past lieutenant devotees,

660
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.630
men swung his platoon to the right in hot pursuit of a few fleeting m enemy

661
00:40:53.631 --> 00:40:58.631
soldiers and disappeared from sight into the Bush says Sergeant Ernie savage of

662
00:41:00.621 --> 00:41:01.454
Herricks orders.

663
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.120
He made a bad decision and we knew at the time it was a bad decision.

664
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.910
We were breaking contact with the rest of the company.

665
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.180
We were supposed to come up on the flank of first platoon.
In fact,

666
00:41:11.181 --> 00:41:15.620
we were moving away from them.
We lost contact with everyone.
Everybody.

667
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.930
So again,
this is what I just talked about

668
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.620
and it's you're going to see throughout this book all these principles that we

669
00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:29.570
talk about all the time that that we taught and that we live through.

670
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.970
You can see that these types of things happen.

671
00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:35.540
And here's a classic thing I was just about like when you get out of distance

672
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.390
from your supporting elements,
you're now alone

673
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.710
and that's a bad situation to be in.

674
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.490
Back to the book now,

675
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:50.120
John Heron was up on my radio reporting that his men were under heavy attack by

676
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:53.960
at least two enemy companies and that his second platoon was in danger of being

677
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.740
surrounded and cut off from the rest of the company even as he spoke,

678
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.070
mortar and rocket rounds hit in the clearing where I stood.

679
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.420
My worst case scenario had just come to pass.
We are now in heavy contact.

680
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:10.110
Before all my battalion was on the ground and now I had to deal with a cutoff

681
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.730
platoon.
My response was an angry shit.

682
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.110
Coptic captain John Herons estimate that is Bravo company.

683
00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:20.180
Men were trying to deal with two enemy companies,

684
00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:23.090
was slightly off one full enemy battalion.

685
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.440
More than 500 determined enemy soldiers was boiling down the mountain toward

686
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:31.430
Herricks trapped second platoon and maneuvering near Al de Vinnie's pinned down

687
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:34.280
first platoon.
Again,

688
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:37.790
here's something that I failed to talk about with helicopter warfare.

689
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.360
So he's got a battalion of 500 guys,

690
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:46.361
550 guys that you can't fit all those guys on 16 helicopters.

691
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.170
So you've got to do multiple laps.
And that's what he's,

692
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.620
he's worried.
He was worried about it going in that,
hey,

693
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:57.470
I want to get my whole battalion on the ground before the fighting starts.

694
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.010
He's already failed to do that.
Or maybe he hasn't failed to do it,

695
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.360
but it didn't happen.

696
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.700
Back to the book.
I was tempted to join the dolls or Edwards men,

697
00:43:08.701 --> 00:43:10.230
but resisted the temptation.

698
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.740
I had no business getting involved with the actions of only one company.

699
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.610
I might get pinned down and simply become another rifleman.

700
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.750
My duty was to lead riflemen.
So there's,
uh,
uh,
you know,

701
00:43:21.751 --> 00:43:24.510
we talked about the detachment that he said,
hey,
look,

702
00:43:24.511 --> 00:43:27.030
I'm not going to be up in the helicopter,
but right now he's saying,
look,

703
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:29.280
I'm not gonna be in a helicopter overhead at 1500 feet,

704
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.240
but I'm not going to be sitting in a platoon as a rifleman,

705
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.120
slugging it out with the enemy.
That's not the right place to be either.

706
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.580
You have to lead in,
in order to lead,
you have to take a step back.

707
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.040
You have to detach and he does that to the best of his ability.

708
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:42.900
<v 2>Okay,</v>

709
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.340
<v 0>and here we go.
Back to the book just now.</v>

710
00:43:44.341 --> 00:43:46.290
The snaps and cracks are the rounds passing nearby.

711
00:43:46.291 --> 00:43:50.070
Took on a distinctly different sound like a swarm of bees around our heads.

712
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.150
I was on the radio trying to hear a transmission over the noise when I felt a

713
00:43:54.151 --> 00:43:58.590
firm hand on my right soldier shoulder.
It was sergeant major plum Lee's.

714
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.550
He shouted over the racket of the firefight serve.
You don't find some cover,

715
00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:04.830
you're going to go down and if you go down,

716
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.820
we all go down plum leaders,
right as always,

717
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.860
anyone waving,
yelling,

718
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.820
hand signaling or talking on the radio was instantly targeted by the enemy.

719
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.630
These guys were quick to spot and shoot leaders,

720
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.850
radio operators and medics.

721
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:25.590
I had never fretted about being wounded in combat in Korea or here,

722
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.460
but Plumley brought me up short.
The game was just beginning.

723
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.500
This was no time for me to go of it.

724
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.240
The sergeant major pointed to a large termite hill,
six or seven feet high,

725
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:40.230
located in some trees in the waste between the two open areas of the landing

726
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:41.064
zone.

727
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.420
It was about 30 yards away in three of us turned and ran toward it with bullets

728
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:49.710
kicking up red dirt around our feet and the bee's still buzzing around our heads

729
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.480
that termite hill,

730
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.040
the size of a large automobile would become the battalion command post the aid

731
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.700
station,
the supply point,
the collection area for enemy prisoners,

732
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.440
weapons and equipment,
and the place where our dead were brought.

733
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.530
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

734
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:06.161
<v 0>casualties.</v>

735
00:45:06.161 --> 00:45:09.070
We're now beginning to pile up as we dropped behind that termite hill.

736
00:45:09.071 --> 00:45:11.500
I fleetingly thought about an illustration,

737
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.670
an illustrious predecessor of mine in the Seventh Cavalry,

738
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:20.910
Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and his final stay stand in the

739
00:45:21.161 --> 00:45:24.850
valley of little big horn in Montana 89 years earlier.

740
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.860
I was determined that history would not repeat itself in the Valley of the I

741
00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:32.050
drank.
We were a tight,

742
00:45:32.051 --> 00:45:35.860
well trained and disciplined fighting force and we had one thing,

743
00:45:35.861 --> 00:45:39.730
George Custer did not have fire support.

744
00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:47.140
Fire support plays it.
It's,
it's beyond critical.

745
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.850
I mean they would not have been able to do this without fire support and that's

746
00:45:51.851 --> 00:45:55.900
the one thing that's going to save them.
I mean obviously the discipline,

747
00:45:55.901 --> 00:45:58.990
obviously the training,
obviously the bravery,
but the fire support is,

748
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.010
is a gift.
[inaudible]

749
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.233
<v 2>back to the book</v>

750
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.940
<v 0>Sergeant Steve Hanson was behind and to the right of lieutenant Taft.
He says,</v>

751
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:15.260
we moved at a trot across the open grass toward the tree line and heard fire up

752
00:46:15.261 --> 00:46:19.310
on the finger to the West where we were headed.
My radio operator,

753
00:46:19.311 --> 00:46:22.640
friend specialist for Ray Turner,

754
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:27.730
Rea Tanner and I crossed the stream bed captain noodles party and the two other

755
00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:29.510
platoons were off to the right.

756
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.130
Lieutenant Taft was well forward as we crossed over into the trees.

757
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

758
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.850
<v 0>Sergeant First Class Lorenzo Nathan rate.
Turner and I were close,</v>

759
00:46:39.851 --> 00:46:43.360
maybe 10 yards behind.
We were moving fast.

760
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.440
Specialists Spec for Pete Winter was near me.

761
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.860
We ran into a wall of led.

762
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:56.620
Every man in the lead squad was shot from the time we got the order to move to

763
00:46:56.621 --> 00:47:01.300
the time where men were dying was only five minutes.
The enemy.

764
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:04.480
We're very close to us and overran some of our dead.

765
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.520
The firing was heavy.

766
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:10.690
Sergeant Nathan pulled us back out of the woods of the stream bed.

767
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:13.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

768
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.641
<v 0>Bob Hazen.</v>

769
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:18.120
Bob Taft's radio operator recalls lieutenant Taft got out in front of me.

770
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.330
I was off to his left.
He had his,
he had his radio.

771
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.810
He had the radio handset in his left hand,
connected to the radio on my back.

772
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:26.850
Would that flux at flexible rubber wire.

773
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.920
It got tight and I pulled back on the lieutenant and hollered,

774
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.250
we're getting offline.
He glanced back at me,

775
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.490
turn back to his front and took four more steps.

776
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.430
Then he fired two shots at something I couldn't see what.

777
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.960
Then he dropped face down on the ground.
Lieutenant Taft was hit.

778
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.630
I didn't realize how bad until I rolled him over.

779
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.920
He was shot in the throat and the rounded ricocheted down and come out his left

780
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:54.790
side.
He was dead and it was difficult to roll them over.

781
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.600
Even though he was a slightly built man captain,

782
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:03.250
the DOL says the enemy on the mountain started moving down rapidly in somewhat

783
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.720
uncoordinated attacks.
They streamed down the hill and down the creek bed.

784
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.710
The enemy knew the area.
They came down the best covered route.

785
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.330
The third platoon was heavily engaged in the volume of firing.

786
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:18.910
Reached a crescendo on my left.
At this time,

787
00:48:18.911 --> 00:48:23.911
I lost con radio contact with Taft's platoon in the center of that fury,

788
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:28.150
Bob Hazen struggled.
Enrolled is dead platoon leader rover.

789
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.180
He was gone and there was nothing we could do.

790
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.900
The first thing I thought of was what they taught me.

791
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.070
Never let the enemy get his hands on a mapper.
The signals code book,

792
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.700
I got those from lieutenant Taft and was kneeling over to try and pull his body

793
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:43.534
back.

794
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.860
That's when my radio was hit and the shrapnel from the radio hit me in the back

795
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:50.680
of the head.
It didn't really hurt.
All of a sudden,

796
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:53.740
I was just laying face down on the ground next to lieutenant Taft.

797
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.400
I felt something running down my trick.

798
00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.700
My down my neck reached back and came out with a handful of blood.

799
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.060
Carmen Maselli was on Hasan's,
right?

800
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.860
We knew what had happened the word past fast.
They got lieutenant Taft

801
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:14.330
again.
We're talking within minutes of these guys arriving.

802
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.660
This is going completely sideways.

803
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.513
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

804
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.430
<v 0>Back to the book captain and a doll out of radio contact with Taf Splatoon mood</v>

805
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.120
moved toward the furious firing on his left flank to find out what was
happening.

806
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.930
Nodal says my radio operator,

807
00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:33.270
Sergeant Jack e Gell,

808
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.050
the company communications chief who had volunteered to carry one of my two

809
00:49:37.051 --> 00:49:41.520
radios ran with me out from out of the creek bed and into the open area toward

810
00:49:41.521 --> 00:49:46.140
tasks position.
We ran into sergeant Nathan and I asked him what was happening.

811
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.290
He said the platoon had been attacked on the left flank.

812
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.830
The left squad had taken a number of casualties and had pulled back out of the

813
00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:56.460
creek bed,
refusing their left enemy.
The left flank to the enemy.

814
00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:01.890
Nathan said Taft had been hit and was left in the creek bed.
That made me angry.

815
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.910
We'd been taught never to leave any wounded or dead on the battlefield.

816
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.960
Sergeant Gal and I crawled forward of our lines to that creek bed where the

817
00:50:09.961 --> 00:50:11.340
enemy,
where to find Taft.

818
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.360
We came under grenade attack from the west side of the creek bed but had some

819
00:50:15.361 --> 00:50:17.100
cover from a few trees.

820
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.400
We located Taft dead while bringing him back.

821
00:50:20.401 --> 00:50:24.000
We saw another soldier who had been left behind after leaving calf's body with

822
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:27.890
his platoon gal and I went back again and we picked the other man

823
00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.990
back to the book.
Dennis deal remembers.

824
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.080
We moved online for about a hundred or 150 yards before the volume of firing

825
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:49.080
forced us to stop.
We were taking too many casualties.

826
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:53.070
I radioed Herricks platoon and said,
I think we're getting close to you.

827
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.150
Shoot one round off weight to the count of three and shoot two more.

828
00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.360
The radio man or whoever was on the radio did that.

829
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.090
So we had a pretty good fix on where he was.

830
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.490
We got up and started the assault again.

831
00:51:05.491 --> 00:51:07.830
We went about 10 yards and the whole thing just blew in.

832
00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.020
Our faces blew up in our faces.

833
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.180
The enemy have infiltrated between Herricks platoon and us and now we're

834
00:51:15.181 --> 00:51:19.800
starting to come behind us.
So that platoon that had gotten separated,

835
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.880
this element with Dennis deal was going out to try and get contact with them and

836
00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.990
bring them back inside the perimeter.
They meet,
they,
they,
they're assaulting,

837
00:51:27.991 --> 00:51:30.690
they go 100 yards,
150 yards and they started getting mowed down

838
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.530
and now they realize that in between they've got bad guys in between where

839
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:41.430
Herricks platoon is and where the rest of the perimeter is set up.

840
00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:44.250
Cause they do have kind of a rough perimeter on this,
on this landing zone,

841
00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:45.084
in the landing zone.

842
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.750
Apologize for not explaining this to me in order to bring in helicopters and the

843
00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:50.820
junk,
would you need some open space?
So the landing zone,

844
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:54.060
Lz x ray has an area where there's not much foliage for whatever reason.

845
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:58.260
And so that's where they've kind of consolidated their forces only cause they

846
00:51:58.261 --> 00:52:01.140
can't go anywhere else.
They hit the ground,
they start getting shot at.

847
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:05.850
So now they're setting up what's called a perimeter and obviously Herricks

848
00:52:05.851 --> 00:52:07.680
platoon is outside the perimeter.

849
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:10.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

850
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.090
<v 0>Back to the book lieutenant deal ads that he and another,</v>

851
00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.490
he and the other two platoon leaders now began planting.

852
00:52:15.491 --> 00:52:19.450
Yet another attempt to break through and rescue Herricks men leaders were

853
00:52:19.451 --> 00:52:23.170
running back and forth coordinating.
When all of a sudden firing began,

854
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:27.970
the Lord dissipated quickly.
It was at this time my weapons squad leader,

855
00:52:27.971 --> 00:52:32.500
Sergeant Curry,
the chief was killed.
His last words war.

856
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.510
Those bastards are trying to get me.

857
00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.140
He was caught rolling around on the ground.

858
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.140
Later on is my men were carrying and back.

859
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:45.340
I had them put them down and turned his face toward me and looked at him.

860
00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.120
I could not conceive of the chief being dead

861
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.520
Staff Sergeant Wilbert Curry,
junior of Buffalo,

862
00:52:53.521 --> 00:52:55.920
New York was 35 years old.

863
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.240
Eric and the other two squads were holding precariously to the small knoll near

864
00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:11.330
the bottom of the finger savage.
So

865
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:17.890
a kid named savage is out there with Herricks platoon and he ends up running a

866
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:20.630
lot of stuff and you'll find that out.
But here,

867
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:23.000
here we start hearing a little bit of him.
Right now.

868
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.160
Savage teamed up with Mchenry Squad,
which was pinned to the ground.

869
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:31.350
Heric was with that squad.
Sergeant Zealand squad was off to the left rear.

870
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.800
Savage checked on his men when he tied up with McHenry.

871
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:38.430
He knew that Spec for Robert M.

872
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.670
Hill m 79 granted year was no longer with them.

873
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:44.250
He got killed in there somewhere.

874
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:49.430
He had his m 79 and a 45 caliber pistol and he was firing both at the same time.

875
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.420
The 23 year old hill came from Starkville,
Mississippi.

876
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:56.420
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

877
00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:00.470
<v 0>and here's sergeant savage talking,
explaining some more back to the book.</v>

878
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:03.590
The enemy was passed the machine gun before it ever quit firing.

879
00:54:03.591 --> 00:54:08.020
I could hear sergeant hurdled down there cursing even even over the firefight.

880
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.540
I heard him.
He was famous for that mother Fucker,
son of a bitch.

881
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.380
I could hear him hollering that down there when they through.

882
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.980
Then they threw grenades on him.
Hurdle 36 was from Washington DC.

883
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.930
Barren bomb 24 was a native of New York City,

884
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.210
Pfc Donald Roddy.
22 hailed from Ann Arbor,
Michigan.

885
00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:30.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

886
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:35.330
<v 0>The three of them died in a hail of rifle fire and enemy grenades.</v>

887
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.620
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

888
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.260
<v 0>the enemy down below turns.</v>

889
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:45.261
Surgeon hurdles m 60 around and began using it on the Americans on the knoll.

890
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.230
So that causes all kinds of confusion.

891
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.490
You can tell the difference between different types of weapons by the way they

892
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:58.140
sound when they shoot and when someone starts shooting a friendly weapon at you.

893
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.190
It's caused a lot of confusion and the [inaudible] is a beast of a weapon

894
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.620
belt fed machine gun and it's when I've gotten the seal teams.
That was the,

895
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.950
that was the machine gun that we used was the [inaudible] machine gun and it's a

896
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:14.790
devastating weapon.
Back to the book,

897
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:19.820
the enemy more than 150 strong now attack the knoll from three sides north,

898
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:23.940
south,
and east and soldiers on both sides were falling.

899
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.280
Lieutenant Herrick ran from trooper,

900
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:30.540
the trooper trying to get a defense organized an enemy volley cut across
Herrick,

901
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.720
his radio operator specialist John,

902
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:37.800
our Stewart and the three Rick and the artillery recon sergeant,

903
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:43.200
Sergeant John T.
Brown wounding,
all three Herrick and Brown.

904
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:46.770
Seriously.
Stewart took a single bullet through the leg,

905
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:50.670
Herrick radioed Bravo company commander John Harrington told him he had been hit

906
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.210
and he was turning the command of the platoon over to Sergeant Carl Palmer.

907
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.950
Herrick then gave explicit instructions to his men to destroy the singles codes,

908
00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.820
redistribute the ammunition and calling artillery and if possible,

909
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.870
make a break for it.

910
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

911
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.963
<v 0>Heron says,</v>

912
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.690
I give Herrick all the credit in the world for pulling that platoon together so

913
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:10.830
they could make their stand.

914
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:12.790
<v 1>Okay,</v>

915
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:17.790
<v 0>so should we all savage and Zac Allen paint a clear picture of a green young</v>

916
00:56:18.791 --> 00:56:22.300
lieutenant who did a superb job in a hailstorm of enemy fire.

917
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.320
His platoon stopped the very large north Vietnamese unit,

918
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:29.530
clearly heading down to join the attack on the landing zone.

919
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.820
I long ago concluded that the very presence of this platoon so far to the

920
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:38.050
northwest confused the enemy commander as to exactly where we were and how far

921
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:41.560
we had penetrated in all directions and thus helped us,

922
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.900
helped us as the battle built.

923
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.460
Sergeant savage recounts the final moments of Henry Herricks life.

924
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.030
He was lying beside me on the hill and he said,
if I have to die,

925
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.160
I'm glad to give my life for my country.

926
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.090
I remember him saying that he was going into shock.

927
00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.900
He had in the hip and in and a lot of pain.
He didn't live long.

928
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.410
He died early in the fight.
Next to a little brush pile

929
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:12.100
spec for Charles,
our lows,
22 of mobile ammo.

930
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:14.590
Alabama was the new platoon medic.

931
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.110
He joined the platoon only a few days earlier.

932
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.160
Lieutenant Harris was kneeling when hit,
he had a bullet wound to the hip.

933
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.580
He told me to go help the other wounded.

934
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.100
Yeah,
it's,

935
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:35.160
we have to remember that this Guy Herrick is like 22,

936
00:57:35.531 --> 00:57:39.040
23 year old,
fresh out of him.
He's a first,
he might even be 21.

937
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:40.750
Um,

938
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:45.750
and he made that majorly offensive move and pursued and got out of touch.

939
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:49.660
But what,
how more saying,
hey,
that confused the enemy,

940
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:52.030
even though it confused the friendlies.
Sue,
it confused the enemy as well.

941
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:54.280
So there's some,
there's some good that came out of it.

942
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:59.231
Back to the book.

943
00:57:59.231 --> 00:58:02.590
Sergeant Reuben Thomas was struck by a bullet above his heart that exited under

944
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:04.510
his left arm,
bleeding heavily.

945
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:09.570
He grabbed a rifle and fought on the encircled infantry men of the lost platoon

946
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:14.290
refuse to give up.
Here's what specialists,
Doorman said,

947
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.590
we were all on the ground now and if you moved,
you got hit.

948
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:22.000
Our training really showed.
Then we shifted into defensive positions.

949
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.310
We had five men killed in 25 minutes.

950
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.310
Then all of a sudden they try to mass assault from three directions,

951
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.830
rushing from Bush to Bush laying fire on us.

952
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.860
We put our m sixteens on full automatic and killed most of them.

953
00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:39.730
Another guy named Galen Bong,
bong,
bong,
them said,

954
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.830
we gathered up all the full magazines we could find and stack them up in front

955
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:47.230
of us.
There was no way we could dig a foxhole.

956
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.370
The handle was blown off my entrenching tool and one of my canteens had all hole

957
00:58:51.371 --> 00:58:55.240
blown through it.
The fire was so heavy that if he tried to raise up to dig,

958
00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:58.090
you are dead.
There was death and destruction all around

959
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.410
my now eight men of the platoons,

960
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:05.740
29 had been killed in action on other 13 were wounded.

961
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:11.050
The 25 yard wide perimeter was a circle of pain,
death,
fear,

962
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:14.590
and raw courage.
Medic Charlie,

963
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:18.300
Lowe's crawled from man to man throughout the raging firefight,

964
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:22.040
doing his best to patch the wounded with limited supplies.
His medical pack,

965
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:27.620
although he himself was wounded twice,
Lowe's never slowed his pace.

966
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:33.460
He would keep all 13 of the wounded alive for the four 26 long Harwin hours.

967
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:40.370
Low says on several occasions I had to stand or sit up to treat the wounded.

968
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.040
Each time the VC fired heavily at me.

969
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:48.140
Lowe's used his 45 and m 16 rifle too,

970
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.670
to help defend his patients.

971
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:53.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

972
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:58.190
<v 0>Of getting attacked from three sides,
13 wounded,
eight dead.</v>

973
00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.360
Was it nine dead?

974
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.910
Unbelievable.
Back to the book command had passed.

975
01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:11.970
So this is talking about,
you know,
when you,
when someone,

976
01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:15.330
if the leader gets killed,
it goes to the next person.
That person gets killed,

977
01:00:15.331 --> 01:00:19.290
it goes to the next person.
So here's what's happening in Herricks platoon.

978
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:23.670
The loss platoon back to the book command had passed from Lieutenant Henry

979
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:28.260
Herrick to Sergeant Carl Palmer to Sergeant Robert Stokes and each intern died

980
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:32.760
fighting.
Now it was the turn of Buck Sergeant Ernie savage.

981
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:36.090
Sergeant savage came up on the radio.
Captain Haren recalls,

982
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:41.100
he said Herrick Palmer and stokes were dead to give him more artillery and he

983
01:00:41.101 --> 01:00:43.050
would direct it in as close as possible.

984
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.960
We could never establish the platoons exact position,

985
01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:49.740
but lieutenant riddle could adjust fire on savages sensing.

986
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.270
And he began to do that.

987
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.450
The extraordinary unyielding resistance that the dozen or so effective fighting

988
01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.610
fighters we're putting up.

989
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.120
Plus the artillery barrages that Ernie savage was bringing down.

990
01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:05.760
Finally beat off the heavy enemy attack,

991
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.660
Ernie savage and his small band hunkered down,

992
01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:12.510
determined to hold their ground to the end.

993
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

994
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:17.200
<v 0>Yeah.
And these guys are calling into danger calls.</v>

995
01:01:17.201 --> 01:01:20.320
If we were talking about danger close,
no,
no.
Okay.

996
01:01:20.321 --> 01:01:25.321
Danger close is when you're calling in fire support and you want it to be very

997
01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:30.670
close to where you are and you on the ground have to take responsibility for it.

998
01:01:30.671 --> 01:01:33.820
So in other words,
the the person,
whether it's artillery,
whether it's aircraft,

999
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:38.750
you have to call and say danger close.
Yes.
Send the rounds.
We know it's close.

1000
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:41.590
It's we take responsibility for what happens.

1001
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:44.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1002
01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.170
<v 0>And by the way,</v>

1003
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.200
going back to the book as this fifth left lift of the day roared out at treetop

1004
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.440
level,
the landing zone was suddenly turned red hot,

1005
01:01:52.441 --> 01:01:54.470
so they haven't even landed everyone yet.
But this is going on.

1006
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.270
They haven't even gotten everyone on the landing zone yet.

1007
01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.880
And here's Crandall talking.
And again,
he's the the pilot,

1008
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.840
unbelievably heroic pilot and a commanding officer of this helicopter unit says,

1009
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:12.410
Crandall,
as I was flaring out to touchdown,
we started receiving heavy,

1010
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:16.860
heavy ground fire.
I had three dead in three wounded on my board,

1011
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:20.640
bird,
the wounded included my crew who had been hitting the throat.

1012
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.841
When we landed,

1013
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:25.380
we saw that every bullet had struck the wounded in the head or neck.

1014
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:29.640
Excellent marksman ship by the other side and not a happy thought for a

1015
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:31.650
helicopter pilot to say the least.

1016
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:34.920
So the the enemy's taking head shots

1017
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.600
back to the book with Crandall Flying Serpent Yellow three where chief warrant

1018
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:45.840
officer's Ricardo,
Jay Lombardo 34 of Hartford,

1019
01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:50.790
Connecticut and Alex s pop Jekyll 43 of Seattle,
Washington.

1020
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:55.350
Pop Jekyll was a father of nine children during World War II at the age of 20 he

1021
01:02:55.351 --> 01:03:00.351
had flown beat 20 fours out of England and be 29 during the postwar years until

1022
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:05.481
he left the service in 1950 pop Jekyll reenlisted in in 1952 it had been flying

1023
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:10.881
helicopters since 1963 pop Jekyll keyed the inner calm and said I flew 31

1024
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:16.680
missions in [inaudible] in World War II and that's the closest I've ever come to

1025
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:20.190
swallowing my balls.
So these,

1026
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:25.110
these landing zones were crazy with these helicopter pilots flying in there.

1027
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:29.610
It's,
it's,
you're here,
you're getting there as fast as you can,

1028
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.940
but there's not much you can do.
You know,
you bring it in as fast as you can.

1029
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.890
You try and get loaded up quick and you try and take off,

1030
01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:38.130
but it's not like you're able to shoot back.
Even once you're on the ground,

1031
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:39.150
your machine gunners in the huge,

1032
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:41.340
they can't shoot anymore cause you don't know where the friendly troops are,

1033
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:43.440
so you're a sitting duck,

1034
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.470
literally a sitting duck and these pilots going in time and time and time again.

1035
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.680
This goes to the Delta company commander La Phaedra and here's what's going on.

1036
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.700
Love Bro.
Seriously wounded was phasing was fading fast.

1037
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:01.590
I lost a lot of blood.

1038
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.980
I could see people shooting but I couldn't hear any sounds anymore.

1039
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.760
I told John Heron somebody had to take over.
I called again,

1040
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:13.080
Colonel Moore and told him that I was going to turn over the company to Sargent

1041
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.913
Gonzalez.

1042
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:14.680
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.580
<v 0>Then the medic arrived to bandage my wound.</v>

1044
01:04:16.581 --> 01:04:20.170
Shortly after I remember someone putting me in a Poncho and hauling me over to

1045
01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:22.000
the area of the battalion command post.

1046
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.010
When I saw lieutenant to Ibotta again later,
we never did talk much about it.

1047
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:31.590
It was just too damn close to the real thing.
Raila,

1048
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:36.240
Phaedra and his handful of Den Delta Company troopers had unknowingly joined the

1049
01:04:36.241 --> 01:04:38.160
Alpha company flight at a crucial moment.

1050
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:42.840
About 30 North Vietnamese were flanking the dolls.
Men on their left and captain,

1051
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:47.100
the Febreze,
Febreze party ran smack into them and killed most of them.

1052
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.980
The dolls,
men dispatch the rest unknown to [inaudible].

1053
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.900
Sergeant Gonzales had been hit in the face by an enemy.

1054
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:57.680
Bullet Gonzalez simply said,
Roger,

1055
01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:01.950
when the fabric told him he was now in command and for the next half,

1056
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.540
hour and a half,
he ran Delta company

1057
01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.630
Sergeant Gonzales shot in the face.
No factor.

1058
01:05:10.631 --> 01:05:12.190
I mean it still going to take leadership right now,

1059
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.300
going back to the book,

1060
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.590
it was during all this core that Beck remembers fear coming over him and here's

1061
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:27.640
backtalking.
While doc nall was here with me working on Russell fear,

1062
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:31.030
real fear hit me fear like I had never known before.

1063
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.470
Fear comes in once you recognize it and accepted a passes just as fast as it

1064
01:05:35.471 --> 01:05:37.990
comes and you really don't have to think about it anymore.

1065
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.910
You just do what you have to do,

1066
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:44.260
but you learn the real meaning of fear and life and death.

1067
01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.610
For the next two hours,

1068
01:05:46.611 --> 01:05:50.960
I was alone on that gun shooting the enemy anymore shooting at me and bullets

1069
01:05:50.961 --> 01:05:53.420
were hitting the ground beside me and cracking above my head.

1070
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.900
They were attacking me and I fired as fast as I could in long bursts.

1071
01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.850
My m 60 was cooking.
I had to take a crap and elite bad,

1072
01:06:01.851 --> 01:06:05.660
so I pulled my pants down while laying on my side and did it on my side taking

1073
01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:06.620
fire at the time.

1074
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.240
Now we're going back to how more talking here from my command post at the

1075
01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.510
Termite Hill,
the enemy were clearly visible a hundred yards to the south.

1076
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:22.670
They were damned good soldiers used cover and concealment to perfection and were

1077
01:06:22.671 --> 01:06:23.481
deadly shots.

1078
01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:26.660
Most of my dead and wounded soldiers had been shot in the head or upper body.

1079
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.040
The North Vietnamese paid particular attention to radio operators and leaders.

1080
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:33.620
They did not appear to have radios themselves.

1081
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:38.770
They controlled their men by shalts waves pointing whistles and sometimes bugle

1082
01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:40.154
calls.

1083
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:46.040
It was 2:45 PM all three of my rifle companies were heavily engaged.

1084
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.450
We had lost the use of the larger clearing for the helicopter landings,
wounded.

1085
01:06:50.451 --> 01:06:52.910
We're streaming into the command post aid station.

1086
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.270
We were in a desperate fixed and I was worried that it could become even more

1087
01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:57.104
desperate.

1088
01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:01.610
By now I believe we were fighting at least two people's armies battalions.

1089
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.330
Turns out it was three they were very determined to wipe us out.

1090
01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:09.560
But a major difference between Lieutenant Colonel Merwin who on of the People's

1091
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.660
Army of Vietnam and lieutenant colonel,

1092
01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:15.980
how more of the First Cavalry Division was that I had major fire support and he

1093
01:07:15.981 --> 01:07:16.814
didn't.

1094
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:22.860
Air Force Captain Bruce Wallace and his fellow a one e Skyraider pilots as well

1095
01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:27.880
as the jet fighter bombers from all three services help provide that edge flying

1096
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:32.620
50 sorties and close air support that Sunday afternoon says Wallace,

1097
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:37.210
the importance of airplanes and a vulgar brawl is to be down among the palm

1098
01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:38.200
trees with the troops,

1099
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:41.710
putting ordinance on the ground at the exact time and the precise place that the

1100
01:07:41.711 --> 01:07:43.990
ground command needs it.

1101
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:49.620
And then so he there in these old school,
uh,
Sky Raiders,

1102
01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:53.730
but then Captain Wallace is talking about what it was like watching the

1103
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:55.530
helicopters back to the book with it.

1104
01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:00.990
It was different with a Huey to watch for eight of them at a time maneuvering up

1105
01:08:00.991 --> 01:08:05.730
and down and latterly and even backwards boggles the f the fighter pilots mind

1106
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.210
those guys swarm a target like bees over honey.

1107
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.490
I had to hand it to those Huey guys.

1108
01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:14.040
They really got down there in the trees with the troops.

1109
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.410
Then this is how America,
how more talking again,
the field artillery,

1110
01:08:20.411 --> 01:08:23.470
what we called Tube artillery to distinguish how it's your folks from the

1111
01:08:23.471 --> 01:08:26.890
helicopter rocket folks proudly calls itself the King of battle.

1112
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.260
The brave cannon cockers and Lz Falcon went without sleep for three days and

1113
01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:36.130
three nights to help keep us surrounded by a wall of steel.

1114
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:37.750
Those two batteries,

1115
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.870
12 guns fired more than 4,000 rounds of high explosive shells on the first day

1116
01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:48.130
alone
says Barker on the first afternoon,

1117
01:08:48.131 --> 01:08:52.750
both batteries fired for effect directly on target for five straight hours.

1118
01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.870
One of Bruce Crandall's,
Huey slick pilots.

1119
01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:59.920
Captain Paul Winkle touched down at Falcon briefly that at first afternoon and

1120
01:08:59.921 --> 01:09:01.480
was astounded by what he saw.

1121
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:06.640
There were stacks of shell casings at least 10 feet high and exhausted gun
crews.

1122
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.850
They had fired for effect for three state straight hours.

1123
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:12.790
By then without even pausing to level the bubbles.

1124
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.650
One Tube was burned out too at busted hydraulics.
That's some shooting.

1125
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.140
No matter how bad things got for Americans fighting for their lives on the x ray

1126
01:09:23.141 --> 01:09:23.974
perimeter,

1127
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.990
we could look out into the scrub brush and every direction internet seeding

1128
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.620
inferno of exploding artillery shells,
2.75 inch rockets,

1129
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.060
napalm canisters,

1130
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:39.180
250 and 500 pound bombs and 20 millimeter cannon fire and thank God and our

1131
01:09:39.611 --> 01:09:43.390
lucky stars that we didn't have to walk through that to get to work.

1132
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:49.790
Yeah.
So like I said,
the,

1133
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.580
the close air support is absolute or the close air support.

1134
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:55.790
The artillery is absolutely what and that's,

1135
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.360
that's been happened many on many occasions for,

1136
01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.660
for American soldiers,
sailors,
marines,

1137
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.300
overseas fighting,
uh,
you know,
the air force,
the Navy pilots,
the Marine Corps,

1138
01:10:08.301 --> 01:10:09.770
five pilots coming in.

1139
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:12.620
And actually the guy in the ground controlling these guys is an air force pilot

1140
01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:13.070
as well.

1141
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:18.070
So having that air superiority is a wonderful thing.

1142
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.390
Now,
speaking of the aviators,
going back to the helicopters,

1143
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.790
chapter nine in this book is called brave aviators in it.
Again,

1144
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.240
these sitting ducks coming in is crazy to to read about.

1145
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.930
Going back to the book.
Over the 20 months of air mobile trading,

1146
01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:38.960
a bond had been welded between the infantry and their rides,

1147
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:40.790
the Huey helicopter pilots and crewman.

1148
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.560
Now the strength of that bond will be tested in the hottest of fires if the air

1149
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:49.700
bridge failed.
So the meaning the helicopters ability to get in there.

1150
01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:50.840
If the air bridge failed,

1151
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:55.940
the embattled men of First Battalion Seventh Cav would certainly die in much the

1152
01:10:55.941 --> 01:11:00.941
same way George Armstrong Custer's cavalry men died at little big horn cutoff

1153
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.840
surrounded by numerically superior forces overrun and butchered to the last man

1154
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.780
I asked Bruce can't Crandall's brave air crews of Alpha Company,

1155
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:16.810
the 229th aviation battalion for the last measure of devotion for service far

1156
01:11:17.851 --> 01:11:19.800
beyond the limits of duty and mission.

1157
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.800
And they came through as I knew they would.

1158
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:24.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1159
01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.730
<v 0>And so,
so again,</v>

1160
01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:29.850
you're basically asking these guys to get shot down every time they fly in.

1161
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:32.130
And this is interesting.
Back to the book.

1162
01:11:32.131 --> 01:11:35.670
This was early in the war and the medivac commanders had decreed that there

1163
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:39.780
birds would not land in hot landing zones.
You,
in other words,

1164
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.950
that they would not go where they were needed,
when,

1165
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:43.500
when they were needed the most.

1166
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.350
Even before I asked Bruce Crandall at our,

1167
01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:50.340
decided to begin doing everything that had to be done,

1168
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.521
staying with it.

1169
01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:59.720
Crandall now dropped this Huey loaded with casualties onto the red dirt strip.

1170
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.770
When we hit,
and this is,
this is grant Crandall talking.
When we hit the ground,

1171
01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.110
we were met by medics and infantry troops still waiting to be lifted into x-ray.

1172
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.200
So that's another crazy thing to think about.
Your,

1173
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.150
you're unloading wounded men and you're,

1174
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.030
and you're getting on that aircraft that's going to go pick up more when you

1175
01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:17.990
remember you're going to stay.

1176
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.840
So the troops that aren't on the ground yet think about what's going through

1177
01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:21.674
their minds.

1178
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:22.603
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1179
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:24.360
<v 0>They,</v>

1180
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.700
they remove the dead end and you wanna know what's going through their minds.

1181
01:12:26.701 --> 01:12:28.530
I actually,
I actually know what's going through their mind.
They're going,

1182
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.290
most of those guys are saying,
get me in there as fast as you can.

1183
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.750
That's what they're saying.
These are the brothers out there.

1184
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:34.683
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1185
01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.121
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

1186
01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:41.930
They remove the dead and wounded from my bird and this act is engraved in my

1187
01:12:41.931 --> 01:12:46.580
mind deeper than any other experience in my two tours in Vietnam and huge black

1188
01:12:46.581 --> 01:12:49.280
enlisted man clad only in shorts and boots,

1189
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.730
hands bigger than dinner plates reached into my helicopter to pick up one of the

1190
01:12:52.731 --> 01:12:54.020
dead white soldiers.

1191
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.520
He had tears streaming down his face and he tenderly created,

1192
01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:03.080
cradled that dead soldier to his chest as he walked slowly from the aircraft to

1193
01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:07.940
the medical station.
I never knew if the man he picked up was his buddy or not.

1194
01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.500
I suspect not.

1195
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:15.190
His grief was for a fallen comrade and for the agony that violent death brings

1196
01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:16.550
to those who witness it.

1197
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:22.023
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1198
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.270
<v 0>More about the helicopters.
Back to the book.</v>

1199
01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:29.980
One of the ships brought in Larry Litton who immediately took over command of

1200
01:13:29.981 --> 01:13:32.590
Delta Company from the wounded Sergeant Gonzales.

1201
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.040
I told him to add the four Delta mortars to consolidate mortar positions set up

1202
01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:42.640
by Captain Edwards and to control all seven mortars from a single fire direction

1203
01:13:42.641 --> 01:13:47.080
center principal direction of fire was towards Alpha and Bravo companies and the

1204
01:13:47.081 --> 01:13:51.010
mortar men would also have the mission of defending our to chopper landing zones

1205
01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:51.844
from the east.

1206
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.630
And the reason I highlighted that is even though I talk about decentralized

1207
01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:59.110
command all the time and how more starts off the book talking about how

1208
01:13:59.111 --> 01:14:00.580
important decentralized command is,

1209
01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:04.840
he's right now in that in that moment he's centralizing command.

1210
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:08.410
He needs to get control of all the mortars so that they can use it correctly.

1211
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.850
So again,
that's why it's the dichotomy of,
because you can,

1212
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.720
there's times when you,
most of the time you decentralized,

1213
01:14:15.721 --> 01:14:17.890
but you can actually decentralize too much.
And if you don't coordinate,

1214
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:20.260
the efforts of these mortars are not going to use them effectively.

1215
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.330
So he centralizes the command of the mortars,

1216
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:25.210
brings them all into one location and starts using them effectively.

1217
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:27.160
So that's a good note for leaders to remember.

1218
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:32.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1219
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.540
<v 0>Now here's another platoon commander Joe Marm.</v>

1220
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.610
Joe Marm describes the situation in his platoon.

1221
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.510
My platoon medic was a short timer and did not accompany us to chew Pong.

1222
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.660
Sergeant First Class George Mccauley,

1223
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:51.400
the platoon sergeant carried the aid kit and we plan to use staff sergeant

1224
01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:54.880
Thomas Tall lover as our medic when the need arose.

1225
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:58.900
He had been a combat medic during the Korean War and it was well qualified.

1226
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.500
Still.
We did not have enough medics to go round,

1227
01:15:02.501 --> 01:15:05.950
so we sent down specialists boot night and specialists.

1228
01:15:05.951 --> 01:15:10.840
Charles Lowe is a senior medical aid man as platoon medics to Bravo company.

1229
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.590
Now Calvin boop night,
still alive,

1230
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:18.640
but mortally wounded was laid gently on the ground and his blood filled rubber

1231
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:21.220
poncho before the medical platoon.

1232
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.950
Sergeant Sergeant First Class Keaton,

1233
01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.570
his friend and comrade for the last two years.
And here's what Keaton says,

1234
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.100
boot night wasn't dead.

1235
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.780
He was shot right between the soldiers right directly between the sore
shoulders.

1236
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.400
He reached up and took my hand and said,
Sarge,
I didn't make it.

1237
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:45.010
We got an IV,
started on him and put a pressure bandage over his back wound.

1238
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:50.080
There was just no hope.
We were able to get them on an Evoque ship,

1239
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:51.243
but he died.

1240
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:52.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1241
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.770
<v 0>The scriptures say that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for</v>

1242
01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:57.604
your friends.

1243
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:02.530
This is what Calvin book night did in that fire filled jungle.

1244
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.000
He sheltered the wounded.
He was treating with his own body,

1245
01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:11.020
his back to the enemy guns,
completely vulnerable.

1246
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.473
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1247
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.890
<v 0>and here's how more it was.</v>

1248
01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:28.891
Now 3:45 PM and except for the predicament of sergeant savage and the cutoff

1249
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:33.580
platoon,
I was feeling a good deal better about the situation we had.

1250
01:16:33.581 --> 01:16:36.580
All of our men in massive firepower had been deployed.

1251
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:41.080
A company reinforcements was on the way our to chopper lifeline landing zone was

1252
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:41.914
secure.

1253
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.060
Most of our wounded were either evacuated or awaiting evacuation and we were

1254
01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:47.110
holding tough.

1255
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.850
I was determined to make one more attempt to rescue sergeant savage and all is

1256
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:53.290
wounded and dead on the slope.

1257
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:57.250
I ordered Alpha and Bravo company's to evacuate their casualties,

1258
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:01.210
withdraw out of close contact with the enemy under covering fires.

1259
01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:04.880
It prepared to launch a coordinated attack supported by heavy preperatory

1260
01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.900
artillery fire to reach the cutoff platoon I was by the fate of those men and

1261
01:17:11.901 --> 01:17:16.901
the need to rescue them in chapter 10 is called fix bayonets,

1262
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.220
which can give you an indication
back to the book.

1263
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:26.000
Alpha and Bravo company's the first units to land had now been locked and

1264
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:28.550
violent battle for more than two hours had suffered.

1265
01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:29.930
No small number of casualties,

1266
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:32.210
especially among the sergeants and radio operators.

1267
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:34.310
And it's shot up most of their ammunition.

1268
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:37.910
That's another thing we got to remember.
The movies,

1269
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:39.980
they never run out of ammunition.
No.
Right.

1270
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:44.060
Unless it makes some theatrical point plot point.
Right.
Uh,
they also,

1271
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.790
in the movies,
there's plenty of water.
Oh,
they're in the jungle.

1272
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:48.710
They got plenty of water.
These guys don't have water out here.

1273
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.840
No water,
no food.
And now they're running out of ammunition.
The two commanders,

1274
01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:00.340
Tony Noodle and John Heron needed time to evacuate their dead and wounded to

1275
01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:04.660
reorganize and regroup their diminished platoons and designate new leaders and

1276
01:18:04.661 --> 01:18:07.840
to replenish stocks of ammunitions of ammunition and grenades.

1277
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.600
They would have 40 minutes to accomplish this.

1278
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:14.410
Then heavy artillery fire wood lane down ahead of them as they kicked off.

1279
01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:17.740
One more attempt to break through the ring of enemy troops and rescue the

1280
01:18:17.741 --> 01:18:20.560
survivors of lieutenant hair.
Henry Herrick second platoon.

1281
01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:26.710
Meanwhile help was on the way back at Third Brigade headquarters in the tea

1282
01:18:26.711 --> 01:18:29.480
plantation.
The orders were going out,
our sister battalion,

1283
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.650
the second Battalion Seventh Cav was informed that one of it's companies,

1284
01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:37.540
Bravo was being detached and sent to landing ex-ray landing zone x ray to

1285
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:40.990
reinforce on arrival in x Ray Bravo company.

1286
01:18:40.991 --> 01:18:44.620
Second Battalion would come under my operational control for the duration of the

1287
01:18:44.621 --> 01:18:47.380
flight,
so there's a,
there's two battalions each.

1288
01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:50.170
Each battalion has a number of companies in them and they're going to take one

1289
01:18:50.171 --> 01:18:55.171
of the companies from the other battalion and let him let them come in as

1290
01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:59.920
reinforcements.
Captain Myron did.

1291
01:18:59.921 --> 01:19:02.430
Yuric Bravo

1292
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:05.990
company troops won the toss hand down.
So

1293
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:08.510
do you,

1294
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:12.460
there was a bunch of different companies there and they were all doing various

1295
01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:17.140
things but uh,
Myron to Derek's company was actually,

1296
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:17.831
I think they weren't,

1297
01:19:17.831 --> 01:19:21.190
they were standing guard and they were closest by and so they're the ones that

1298
01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.590
were going and it's,
it's,

1299
01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:25.960
it's probably a good thing because this guy captain did.

1300
01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:29.290
Derek is a complete bad ass as we'll see.

1301
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.331
Bravo company.

1302
01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:34.270
Second Battalion had good solid professional non coms and it's true.

1303
01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:37.690
Could serve together for some for a long time.
It was a good rifle company.

1304
01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:40.930
I was happy to get it.
Captain to Derek was 27 years old,

1305
01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:45.340
a native born Ukrainian who'd come to the United States with his family in 1950

1306
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:49.660
he was an ROTC graduate from Saint Peter's College and in Jersey City,

1307
01:19:49.661 --> 01:19:50.470
New Jersey.

1308
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:54.970
And it was commissioned in July of 1960 he completed paratrooper and ranger

1309
01:19:54.971 --> 01:19:59.260
training and had served two tours in Germany and at Fort Benning to Derek was

1310
01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.840
married and the father of two children.

1311
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:07.680
While our reinforcements,
we're saddling up my Alpha and company's,

1312
01:20:07.681 --> 01:20:10.620
we're about to launch their second attempt to break through Lieutenant Harris,

1313
01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:12.350
trap platoon,
John Heron,

1314
01:20:12.351 --> 01:20:16.140
and Tony and a doll had pulled their men back to the dry creek bed during the

1315
01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:20.580
wall so they would begin the attack from their platoon Sergeant Troy Miller

1316
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:21.414
remembers the scene.

1317
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:25.080
Our morale was very high after the first contact before we went off,

1318
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.240
before we went after the carnival tune captain,

1319
01:20:27.241 --> 01:20:29.160
the doll got us together and said,
man,

1320
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:32.160
we've got an American platoon caught off out there and we're going after them.

1321
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:33.990
The replies word.
Yeah,

1322
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.190
and let's go get them at Gary Owen and Gary Owen is the,

1323
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.180
it's like the war cry of the,
of the cavalry.
Hmm.

1324
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:45.960
So then there's a comes from an old song and it's,

1325
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:48.600
it's just a historical thing and that's why you read the book.

1326
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:53.040
She can find out about Gary Own.
It's their marching song.

1327
01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:55.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1328
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.421
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

1329
01:20:56.421 --> 01:21:01.421
Captain Tony Nudel Alpha company was the first man out of the creek bed leading

1330
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:03.650
first platoon in the assault.
He recalls.

1331
01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.740
We moved about 50 yards when we ran into the enemy force,

1332
01:21:06.741 --> 01:21:08.000
which had come down the mountain.

1333
01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:11.660
I presume they were preparing to launch their attack about the time we launched

1334
01:21:11.661 --> 01:21:15.650
ours.
The fighting quickly became very vicious at close range.

1335
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:19.490
We took many casualties.
Lieutenant Wayne Johnson,

1336
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.950
the first platoon leader was hit at least three other squad leaders were also

1337
01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.231
hit.

1338
01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:28.490
Two of them killed one while going forward in an attempt to rescue one of his

1339
01:21:28.491 --> 01:21:30.740
soldiers against direct orders.

1340
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1341
01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.250
<v 0>Against direct orders going out to get my buddy.</v>

1342
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:46.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1343
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:51.750
<v 0>Tony Nidal had ordered his men to fix bayonets for the attack bill back firing a</v>

1344
01:21:52.781 --> 01:21:57.781
burst from his m 60 machine gun to his right front was transfixed by what he saw

1345
01:21:57.911 --> 01:22:02.530
just forward a tall thin sergeant bayoneting of north Vietnamese in the chest.

1346
01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.020
It was just like practice against the straw dummies.
Forward thrust,
pull out,

1347
01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:10.840
move on.
One,
two,
three.

1348
01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:14.620
Captain Tony to Dahl had four men in his command group as he charged into the

1349
01:22:14.621 --> 01:22:16.210
brush to radio operators,

1350
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.360
Sergeant Jack Gal and a 25 year old native New Yorker and specialists Spec for

1351
01:22:21.521 --> 01:22:25.420
John Clark.
Of Michigan plus the company's artillery.
Forward Observer,

1352
01:22:25.421 --> 01:22:29.530
Lieutenant Timothy M.
Blake 24 from Charleston West Virginia,

1353
01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.680
and Blake's recon Sergeant Sergeant Floyd l Reed Jr 27 years old of Hef,

1354
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:39.570
Arkansas.
As they moved up,

1355
01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:41.970
muddle had the radio handset to his year,

1356
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.060
a burst of enemy machine gun fire swept across the group.

1357
01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:48.520
Sergeant Gal was hit and dropped without a sound.
Nadar

1358
01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:50.973
<v 1>okay.</v>

1359
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.820
<v 0>Kept moving until the long black cord pulled back on him.</v>

1360
01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:57.370
He was looking around to see what was wrong.

1361
01:22:57.371 --> 01:22:59.130
The same burst that killed Sergeant Gail.

1362
01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:03.430
It also killed Lieutenant Blake and suck and struck Sergeant Reid who died

1363
01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:08.270
shortly thereafter.
Sergeant Sam Holman,
native,
uh,

1364
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:12.250
Sergeant Sam Home Holman Junior,
a native of Pennsylvania,
a native Pennsylvania.

1365
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:16.450
Nope.
Beside is mortally wounded.
Buddy Jack Gal and heard him.
Gasp.

1366
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.190
Tell my wife I love her.

1367
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:30.020
Tony to Dahl had no time to mourn.
Jack.
Now Jack Gal,

1368
01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:34.730
a man he greatly respected too many other lives were in his hands

1369
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.460
on the right flank
of the bravo line.

1370
01:23:40.461 --> 01:23:42.920
Lieutenant deal was now rolling around on the ground,

1371
01:23:42.921 --> 01:23:45.440
desperately trying to dodge a valley of machine guns.
Slugs,

1372
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:50.290
cutting through the grass all around him.
Suddenly 25 yards away deal,

1373
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:53.810
saw an American get up and charge forward while everyone around him was flat on

1374
01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:56.330
his belly says deal.

1375
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:59.630
I saw him throw a grenade behind an ant hill and mps weapon into it.

1376
01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.380
Then he fell to his knees.
I said to myself,
please get up.
Don't be hurt.

1377
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:05.960
I didn't know who it was.
I couldn't make out the form.

1378
01:24:05.961 --> 01:24:09.710
There was so much battlefield Hayes dust and smoke.

1379
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.710
It was Lieutenant Joe Marm.

1380
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:16.670
He'd spotted an enemy machine gun dug into a big termite hill.

1381
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:19.580
It was chewing up both Bravo company tunes.

1382
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:24.710
After failing to knock it out with a law rocket and a grenade and a thrown

1383
01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:29.150
grenade,
he decided to deal with it directly.
He charged through the fire,

1384
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:32.870
tossed a hand grenade behind the hill and then cleaned up the survivors with his

1385
01:24:32.871 --> 01:24:33.920
m 16 rifle.

1386
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:35.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1387
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.630
<v 0>The following day we tend to Al [inaudible] found him dead,</v>

1388
01:24:38.631 --> 01:24:43.580
north Vietnamese officer and 11 enemy soldiers sprawled behind that termite
mound

1389
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.820
says deal.
Joe Marm saved my life and the lives of many others.

1390
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.770
Lieutenant Mom's staggered backwards position with a bullet wound to his jaw and

1391
01:24:54.771 --> 01:24:55.604
neck.

1392
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:59.480
He joined a growing stream of walking wounded flowing back toward the battalion

1393
01:24:59.481 --> 01:25:00.314
aid station.

1394
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:05.030
Sergeant Keaton treated mom's a wound and one of Bruce Kahn Dells.

1395
01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.890
Krandell's qes evacuated him to the rear within days.

1396
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:13.520
Lieutenant Joe Martin was recuperating at Valley Forge Army hospital near his

1397
01:25:13.521 --> 01:25:18.521
home in Pennsylvania in December of 1966 Joe Marr and report it to the Pentagon

1398
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:24.110
where the secretary of the army acting on behalf of president Lyndon Johnson

1399
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:29.300
presented him with the metal of honor,
the nation's highest award for valor.

1400
01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.420
Joe,
my arms heroic action unfortunately failed to open the door to the cut off

1401
01:25:45.421 --> 01:25:46.254
platoon.

1402
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1403
01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:47.741
<v 0>Bravo company.</v>

1404
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:52.741
He progressed only about 75 yards Alpha company a bit further all through of

1405
01:25:53.401 --> 01:25:55.650
noodles.
Platoon leaders.

1406
01:25:55.770 --> 01:25:59.790
We're now either dead or wounded as were many of his non coms.

1407
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:01.530
Worst yet.

1408
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:05.750
Alpha Company's first platoon had out ahead of the two other and was heavily

1409
01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:07.730
engaged with perhaps a hundred enemy.

1410
01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1411
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.960
<v 0>Some of the north,</v>

1412
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:14.220
some of the Alpha troopers bypass the enemy and dense brush and those north

1413
01:26:14.221 --> 01:26:15.750
Vietnamese.
It opened up on them.

1414
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:17.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:21.180
<v 0>Not only were we unable to punch through the rescue Herricks platoon,</v>

1416
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:24.450
we were now in danger of having another platoon caught off.

1417
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:27.180
And again,
I apologize.

1418
01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.760
It's one of the things I should have talked about was the way this terrain is

1419
01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:34.710
set up,
it's a,
there's a lot of grass,
like I would say waist high grass,

1420
01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:39.000
maybe a little bit taller than waist high.
And it's,
if you take cover,

1421
01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:43.560
you can't say anything because you're in grass.
If you stand up and you get shot.

1422
01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:44.650
So it's,

1423
01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:49.650
it's a terrible a catch 22 do you stand up so you can see what's happening and

1424
01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:52.650
see where people are going and see where the enemy's maneuvering and you might

1425
01:26:52.651 --> 01:26:54.420
get shot or do you lay down where you take cover?

1426
01:26:54.421 --> 01:26:56.460
Do you have a better chance of not getting shot but you can't see anything?

1427
01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.700
Captain did.
Derek ran up to me and shouted,
Garryowen sir,
now this is,

1428
01:27:02.701 --> 01:27:05.370
this is awesome.
So Kevin did.
Eric is the guy that's coming into,

1429
01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.890
he's from to seven.
He's coming in as reinforcements and like I said,

1430
01:27:10.891 --> 01:27:14.670
Gary owners like their war cry.
Yeah.
So here we go.
Captain did.

1431
01:27:14.671 --> 01:27:15.700
Derek ran up to me and shadow.

1432
01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:20.710
So this is how more talk and he's all in this embroiled warzone been taken so

1433
01:27:20.941 --> 01:27:23.160
many casualties and here's what,

1434
01:27:23.161 --> 01:27:26.010
how Morris's captain did Yurik random to me and shouted,
Gary Owen,
sir,

1435
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:30.180
Captain Derek and Pr and Bravo Company,
Second Battalion Seventh Cavalry,
120 men,

1436
01:27:30.181 --> 01:27:34.800
strong reporting for duty.
His eyes sparkled with excitement.

1437
01:27:34.801 --> 01:27:38.400
And the challenge of the situation I told the director to assemble as men in a

1438
01:27:38.401 --> 01:27:41.930
competency is 30 yards northwest of the command post to act as a bazaar

1439
01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:46.620
battalion reserved for the time being.
It's awesome.
Colombian report.
Gary,

1440
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:49.070
Gary Allen,
sir.
Uh,

1441
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:52.263
<v 1>okay.</v>

1442
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.040
<v 0>Captain did all says the fight continued for another 20 or 30 minutes with</v>

1443
01:27:57.041 --> 01:27:58.240
neither side making headway.

1444
01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:01.120
It was getting dark and casualties mounted and I decided we are not going to be

1445
01:28:01.121 --> 01:28:01.811
able to break through.

1446
01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:04.510
I called Colonel Moore and ask for permission to pull back.

1447
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.740
And here's what Colonel Morris says with Knight approaching,

1448
01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:09.820
there was no real choice.

1449
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:12.280
I did not want to get into the hours of darkest with my battalion,

1450
01:28:12.281 --> 01:28:17.281
fragmented with a companies and capable of mutual support and subject to defeat

1451
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:18.453
in detail.

1452
01:28:20.890 --> 01:28:21.723
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:26.790
<v 0>Word came over the radio and this and so now this is a specialist Galen Bung Him</v>

1454
01:28:28.181 --> 01:28:32.530
who's out there with the loss platoon back to the book of Ward came over the

1455
01:28:32.531 --> 01:28:34.660
radio that we would have to hang on till morning.

1456
01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.570
I could not believe what I heard.
I fought.

1457
01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:41.380
There was no way we'd be able to do that.
Others thought the same thing.

1458
01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.810
Clark [inaudible] asking me do you think will make it?
I didn't know,

1459
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:51.370
but I said,
we have to pray and pray hard.
Who's a big question mark?

1460
01:28:51.371 --> 01:28:52.360
In all of our minds?

1461
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:57.750
We had to keep our cool and bear down and now a year from Hell Morrigan I now

1462
01:28:58.001 --> 01:29:01.200
considered the toll.
This days,
fighting had taken,

1463
01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.510
donated to dolls.

1464
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:08.120
Alpha company had lost three officers and 31 enlisted enlisted men,

1465
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.160
killed or wounded and now reported effective strength of two officers in

1466
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:17.100
[inaudible] 84 enlisted John Herons.

1467
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:22.101
Bravo company had lost one officer and 46 enlisted men killed or wounded and was

1468
01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:27.321
down to four officers and 68 and listed men with one platoon Herricks trapped

1469
01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:28.500
outside the perimeter.

1470
01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:30.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1471
01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:31.870
<v 0>For almost eight hours.</v>

1472
01:29:31.871 --> 01:29:34.540
I had been involved in the minute to minute direction of the battle.

1473
01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.670
Now I wanted to personally walk the perimeter and check the preparations for

1474
01:29:39.671 --> 01:29:44.590
what promise to be a tough night and another tough day tomorrow just before dark

1475
01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:49.600
sergeant major Plumley and I broke away from the command post and set out to

1476
01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:50.470
check the perimeter,

1477
01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:54.100
talking with the troopers and getting for a feel for the situation on the
ground.

1478
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:58.120
What concerned me the most was the morale of the men,

1479
01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:00.460
how well the companies were tied in there,

1480
01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:04.840
defensive fire plans and the situation with ammunition and water supplies.

1481
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:06.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1482
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:08.140
<v 0>Morale among the men was high,</v>

1483
01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.170
although there was understandable grief over the friends.

1484
01:30:11.171 --> 01:30:15.000
We had lost the men and I talked,

1485
01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.780
the man I talked with realize that we were facing a fierce determined enemy,

1486
01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.880
but he failed to break through our lines.
They knew the fight wasn't over.

1487
01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.190
I heard weary soldier saying things like,

1488
01:30:27.191 --> 01:30:31.660
we'll get him Sir and they won't get through us,
or they're fighting.

1489
01:30:31.661 --> 01:30:36.070
Spirit had not dimmed and they made me proud and humble.

1490
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1491
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.860
<v 0>In every one of my companies that had landed in this place this morning,</v>

1492
01:30:41.861 --> 01:30:46.861
there were 15 to 20 soldiers who had less than two weeks left to go in the army.

1493
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:52.570
Some of those men now lay dead wrapped in ponchos near my command post.

1494
01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.930
The rest of them were out on that perimeter,

1495
01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:59.200
standing shoulder to shoulder with their buddies,

1496
01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.200
ready to continue the fight.

1497
01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.670
37 miles to the northeast.

1498
01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:15.630
Bruce Crandall and big Ed Freeman friendly,

1499
01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:20.440
shutdown their Hueys at alarm at a huge helicopter pad nicknamed the Turkey farm

1500
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:22.300
outside the wire at Camp Holloway.

1501
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:28.980
They had been flying nonstop since 6:00 AM it was after 10:00 PM would Crandall

1502
01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.960
shutdown and tried to get out of the aircraft.

1503
01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.610
That is when the day's activities caught up with me.
My legs gave out.

1504
01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:40.600
As I stepped on the skid and I fell to the ground for the next few minutes,

1505
01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.553
I vomited.

1506
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:46.240
I was very embarrassed and it took some time to regain my composure.

1507
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.790
Someone slipped me a bottle of cognac into my hand and I took a big slug.

1508
01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:56.980
It was a waste of good booze.
It came up as fast as it went down.

1509
01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.540
I quit shaking and made it to the operations.

1510
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:06.370
Tend to recap the day and plan the next.
The aviation unit had quite a day.

1511
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.910
We had not suffered a single fatality and we had not left the mission undone

1512
01:32:13.190 --> 01:32:16.450
when our infantry brothers called,
we hauled.

1513
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:17.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1514
01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:21.510
<v 0>The standard for combat assaults with helicopters had been set on this day.</v>

1515
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:26.490
I wondered about tomorrow.
Would it be worse?

1516
01:32:27.450 --> 01:32:29.670
I wasn't sure I could handle another day like today.

1517
01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:31.963
<v 1>Then again,</v>

1518
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:36.130
<v 0>I thought about the troops in x Ray.</v>

1519
01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:37.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1520
01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.760
<v 0>And the choice was not mine to make.</v>

1521
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:48.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1522
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:53.570
<v 0>Here's how I'm more talking about the wound did back to the book,</v>

1523
01:32:53.571 --> 01:32:54.980
all of the wounded,

1524
01:32:54.981 --> 01:32:58.910
all of our wounded phone out of x ray by Crandall's Hueys ended up at Charlie

1525
01:32:58.911 --> 01:33:02.480
company 15th Medical Battalion,
First Cavalry Division,

1526
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:05.210
which was temporarily set up intensive Camp Holloway.

1527
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:06.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1528
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:11.410
<v 0>The executive officer of Charlie Med was Captain George H [inaudible] 28 from</v>

1529
01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:13.970
Saint Louis,
Missouri.
Charlie meds,

1530
01:33:13.971 --> 01:33:17.870
five surgeons tried to stabilize the soldiers coming off the helicopters.

1531
01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:22.070
The treatment we provided says Carolyn was designed to keep the blood flowing

1532
01:33:22.071 --> 01:33:25.400
through the patient system until he could be gotten to a hospital which had the

1533
01:33:25.401 --> 01:33:28.100
personnel and equipment to perform definitive surgery.

1534
01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:29.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1535
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:29.931
<v 0>Charlie meds.</v>

1536
01:33:29.931 --> 01:33:34.931
Doctors tied off perforate the blood vessels to stop the hemorrhaging and then

1537
01:33:35.121 --> 01:33:36.800
pumped in whole blood.

1538
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1539
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.870
<v 0>Kelly recalls that many of the casualties were rapidly bleeding to death,</v>

1540
01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.620
so it was a race against time to get blood into the soldier faster than he was

1541
01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:49.460
losing it even while the surgeons we're trying to tie off bleeders.

1542
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:50.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1543
01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:54.310
<v 0>We threw caution to the wind and gave a patient for cut downs,</v>

1544
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:58.870
which is an intravenous tube tied into blood vessels with four Corman squeezing

1545
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.670
the blood bags as hard as they could.

1546
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:02.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1547
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.410
<v 0>It was not unusual for the patient to shiver and quake and loose body</v>

1548
01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:08.650
temperature from the rapid transfusion of so much cold blood.

1549
01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.980
Both.
The alternative was to let them die

1550
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:19.570
so they're giving blood directly into the veins and they've got Corman standing

1551
01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:23.390
there squeezing the bags of blood to try and keep people alive.

1552
01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.350
Back on Lz,

1553
01:34:32.130 --> 01:34:36.000
here's sergeant John Steadily and talking.
They probed us all night long.

1554
01:34:36.001 --> 01:34:39.240
We had a few men wounded.
I'd never been in a situation like that.

1555
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.950
When they would come at us,
they would come screaming and we could hear bugles.

1556
01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1557
01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.460
<v 0>As darkness fell,
savage was on the radio with Lieutenant Bill Riddle,</v>

1558
01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:59.750
herons,
artillery,
forward absorb,
observer walking,

1559
01:34:59.751 --> 01:35:02.690
the high explosive barrages all around the cutoff platoon.

1560
01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:08.030
All of us were lifted off the ground by the impact and covered with dirt and

1561
01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:12.620
branches,
Bung them,
recalls.
Savage told them on the radio.

1562
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.610
That was right where we want them.
We hollered that it was too close,

1563
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.600
but I looked back where those first rounds hit and saw three men running towards

1564
01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:24.410
us.
We opened up,
they must've been crawling up on our position.

1565
01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:25.700
When that artillery came in,

1566
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.940
they would sneak in his closest 10 yards or less and many times just stand up to

1567
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:33.740
laugh at us.
We would mow them down.

1568
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:39.650
It begins to work on your mind.
What are they laughing at?
I couldn't believe it.

1569
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:47.360
The North Vietnamese launched three separate attacks to keep the pressure on the

1570
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:49.820
trapped second platoon during that long night.

1571
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:53.390
Each time sending about 50 men against the Americans and each time being beaten

1572
01:35:53.391 --> 01:35:54.740
back by artillery and rifle.

1573
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:59.741
Fire savage had seven men on hurt and 13 wounded nine others were dead.

1574
01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:04.370
Some of the loss platoons wounded,
continue to fight,

1575
01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:07.820
including Sergeant Reuben Thompson who had been shot through the chest.

1576
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:14.850
A platoon later heard still another large enemy force moving down the northern

1577
01:36:14.851 --> 01:36:19.170
trail toward x-ray and again brought artillery fire down on them.

1578
01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.930
This was followed by a flurry of hand grenades back and forth at about 4:30 AM

1579
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:26.310
within an hour.

1580
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:30.630
The first light in the eastern sky revealed dozens of khaki clad enemy dead,

1581
01:36:30.631 --> 01:36:34.590
scattered all around the little knoll,
the trap platoon,

1582
01:36:34.591 --> 01:36:37.290
and survived the longest night any of them would ever know.

1583
01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.110
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1584
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:44.110
<v 0>They checked their ammunition and prepared to receive a dawn attack and here's</v>

1585
01:36:44.901 --> 01:36:48.800
one of the platoon sergeants talking

1586
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:56.110
platoon sergeant Robert Jemison Jemison.
At first light.

1587
01:36:56.530 --> 01:36:59.740
We sent out a patrol staff Sergeant Sidney Cohen,

1588
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.090
Spec for Arthur l Bronson,
and three other men were picked to go,

1589
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:07.300
says Jemison.
They saved us from being surprised.

1590
01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:10.210
They spotted the enemy on their way back into an attack position.

1591
01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:13.540
They came running back with Bronson screaming their common sarge.

1592
01:37:13.541 --> 01:37:14.710
A lot of them get ready.

1593
01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.550
I told him machine gunners to hold their fire until they were close.

1594
01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.650
Pfc Willy,
God Bolt 24 of Jacksonville,

1595
01:37:23.651 --> 01:37:27.670
Florida was hit while firing from his position.
20 yards to sergeant jemisons.

1596
01:37:27.671 --> 01:37:32.260
Right.
Jemison remembers gall bolt hollering.
Somebody helped me.
I yet,

1597
01:37:32.290 --> 01:37:33.123
I'll go get him.

1598
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:35.860
<v 1>Lieutenant Joe.
Hey</v>

1599
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:45.910
Jake.
Jake,

1600
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.410
we want to go to the Joe Jagan.
George Hagen,

1601
01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.810
<v 0>Pfc Willie f God bolt.
24 of Jacksonville,</v>

1602
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:05.070
Florida was hit while firing from his position,
20 yards to sergeant jemisons.

1603
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:09.390
Right.
Jemison remembers God bolt was hollering.
Somebody helped me.

1604
01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.580
I yelled,
I'll go get him.
Lieutenant George Hagen yelled back.
No,

1605
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:15.414
I will.

1606
01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:16.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1607
01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:19.720
<v 0>George Jagan moved out of his position in the Foxhole,</v>

1608
01:38:19.721 --> 01:38:21.320
the help God bolt and was shot.

1609
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:26.140
This was 10 minutes or so from the time the firing first broke out,

1610
01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.880
struck in the back of the head.
Lieutenant John Lance,

1611
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:34.840
Jack Joe Jagan was killed instantly.

1612
01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:36.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1613
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:40.860
<v 0>The man he was trying to save Pfc God bolt died of his wounds shortly afterward.</v>

1614
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1615
01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:47.020
<v 0>The enemy was now close to within 75 yards of Edward's line.</v>

1616
01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:48.760
They were firing furiously,

1617
01:38:48.761 --> 01:38:52.150
some crouch low and at times crawling on their hands and knees.

1618
01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:57.010
Others no taller than the elephant grass they were passing through,
came on,

1619
01:38:57.011 --> 01:38:58.210
standing up and shooting.

1620
01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:03.580
They advanced screaming at each other and Edwards men leaders were blowing

1621
01:39:03.581 --> 01:39:05.500
whistles and using hand and arm signals,

1622
01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.940
a few or even carrying 82 millimeter mortar tubes and base plates.

1623
01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.200
This was clearly a no hit and run a fare.
They'd come to stay

1624
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:24.740
and here's Joe Stetler and talking or Sergeant John,
sorry,
John Statler.

1625
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:29.070
Here's John's and talking.
It seemed like half of Italian hit us all at once.

1626
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.640
He hit us head long and he had a strong,

1627
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.120
I thought we were going to be overrun when Charlie hit us.

1628
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:38.520
He had this strange grazing fire.

1629
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.850
He shot right at ground level trying to cut off your legs,

1630
01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:45.690
or if you weren't deep enough in your Foxhole,
he shot your head off.

1631
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.070
When he started firing at us,
it came like torrents of rain.

1632
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.340
You just couldn't get your head long up long enough to shoot back.

1633
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:57.330
You just stuck up your weapon,
pulled the trigger and empty the magazine.

1634
01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:02.250
Lieutenant Charlie Hastings,

1635
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:06.450
our forward air controller had already swung into action sensing disaster.

1636
01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.690
Hastings made an immediate instinctive decision.

1637
01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:11.790
I use the code word broken Arrow,

1638
01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:16.140
which meant the American unit on the incontact was in danger of being overrun

1639
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.850
and we received all available aircraft in south Vietnam for close air support.

1640
01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.990
We had aircraft stacked at a thousand foot intervals from 7,000 feet to 35,000

1641
01:40:26.991 --> 01:40:30.740
feet each waiting to receive a target and deliver their ordinance.

1642
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:35.510
And here's how more by now,

1643
01:40:35.511 --> 01:40:38.900
I was convinced that the enemy was making a primary effort to overrun us from

1644
01:40:38.901 --> 01:40:40.060
the South and southeast,

1645
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:44.240
and I alerted the reserve platoon for probable commitment into Charlie or Delta

1646
01:40:44.241 --> 01:40:48.380
company sectors.
The noise of the battle was unbelievable.

1647
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:53.060
Never before or since in two wars have I heard anything equal to.

1648
01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:57.913
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1649
01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.560
<v 0>and here's specialist Arthur Vieira.
The gunfire was very loud.</v>

1650
01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.990
We were getting overrun on the right side.

1651
01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.500
Lieutenant Kroger came out into the open in all this.

1652
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.550
I thought that was pretty good.
He yelled at me,
I got up to hear him.

1653
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.760
He hollered at me to help cover the left sector.

1654
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:19.030
I ran over to him and by the time I got there he was dead.

1655
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.420
He had lasted a half an hour.
I knelt beside him,

1656
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:26.890
took off his deck dog tags and put them in my shirt pocket and went back to

1657
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:29.380
firing my m 79 and got shot right in the elbow.

1658
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:33.370
My m 79 went flying and I was knocked over and fell backward over the lieutenant

1659
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.520
Vieira now grabbed his 45 pistol and began firing at lefthanded and he says,

1660
01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.950
then I got hit in the neck and the bullet went right through.

1661
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:45.870
I couldn't talk or make a sound.

1662
01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:49.740
I got up and tried to take charge and we shot it with a third round.

1663
01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:52.260
That one blew up my right leg and put me down.

1664
01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.850
It went in my leg above the ankle,
traveled up,
came back out,

1665
01:41:57.030 --> 01:42:01.650
then went into my groin and ended up in my back close to my spine

1666
01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:07.680
just then to stick.
Grenade blew up right over me and tore up both of my legs.

1667
01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.540
I reached down with my left hand and touched the grenade fragments on my left

1668
01:42:12.541 --> 01:42:16.200
leg and it felt like I touched a red hot poker.

1669
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.610
My hands just sizzled.

1670
01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:23.563
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1671
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:30.970
<v 0>Unbelievable attack and I think that screwed description right there really</v>

1672
01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.730
spells out how intense this was.

1673
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:38.510
Obviously when you got chrome more saying that this is the loudest thing he's

1674
01:42:38.511 --> 01:42:39.980
ever heard and two wars.

1675
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.083
<v 2>That</v>

1676
01:42:43.230 --> 01:42:45.930
<v 0>also confirms what we're dealing with here.</v>

1677
01:42:45.931 --> 01:42:50.520
Back to the book at 7:45 AM the enemy struck at the left flank of Tony and
dolls,

1678
01:42:50.521 --> 01:42:54.510
Alpha Company at the critical elbow where Alpha and Charlie companies were tied

1679
01:42:54.511 --> 01:42:57.960
in.
We are now under attack from three directions.

1680
01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.810
Grazing fire from rifles and machine guns,

1681
01:43:00.811 --> 01:43:03.360
shredded the elephant grass and swept over the battalion.

1682
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:07.350
Command post an aid station leaves Barkan small branches,

1683
01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:09.030
branches fluttered down on us.

1684
01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:13.680
Several troopers were wounded in the same command post and at least one was

1685
01:43:13.681 --> 01:43:14.514
killed.

1686
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:19.330
My radio operator Spec for Robert Plm,

1687
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:22.230
23 years old,

1688
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:26.400
had a spectacle of a speckled [inaudible] from Madawaska.

1689
01:43:26.401 --> 01:43:30.750
Maine was hit and slumped over in a sprawl unmoving and seemingly dead.

1690
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.820
I kept the handset to my ear
and here's Joe Galloway,

1691
01:43:35.821 --> 01:43:36.654
the reporter.

1692
01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:40.290
The incoming fire was only a couple of feet off the ground and I was down as

1693
01:43:40.291 --> 01:43:44.010
flat as I could get when I felt the toe of a combat boot and my ribs.

1694
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:49.050
I turned my head sideways and looked up there.
Standing tall was sergeant major.

1695
01:43:49.051 --> 01:43:53.720
Bazell Plumley Plumley lean down and shouted over the noise of the guns.

1696
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:58.700
You can't take no pictures laying down there on the ground.
Sonny,
he was calm,

1697
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.720
fearless and grinning.
I thought he's right.

1698
01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:06.710
We're all going to die anyways so I might as well take mine standing up.

1699
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:09.800
I got up and began taking a few photographs.

1700
01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:11.870
Plumley moved over to the aid station,

1701
01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:16.490
pulled out as 45 chambered a round and informed Doctor Carrera and his medics.

1702
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.970
Gentlemen prepare to defend yourselves,

1703
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:23.930
<v 2>so pull,
only thought</v>

1704
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:27.020
<v 0>they're getting over on to,
or at least going to get close.</v>

1705
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.830
You're in the aid station that's in the center of this whole perimeter and he's

1706
01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:34.850
pulling out his 45 and st prepared to defend yourselves.
You can't make that up.

1707
01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:42.510
Specialists,
Willard F parish,

1708
01:44:42.511 --> 01:44:44.880
24 years old and a native of Bristow.

1709
01:44:44.881 --> 01:44:49.110
Oklahoma was an assistant squad leader of one of Charlie company's 81 millimeter

1710
01:44:49.111 --> 01:44:50.010
mortar squats.

1711
01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:53.820
Paris was one of the mortar men who had been outfitted with a spare machine,

1712
01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:57.870
guns and rifles collected from our casualties and put on the Delta Company.

1713
01:44:57.871 --> 01:45:01.410
Perimeter parish recalls when we were hit.

1714
01:45:01.411 --> 01:45:04.770
I remember all the tracer rounds and I wondered how even an aunt could get

1715
01:45:04.771 --> 01:45:09.180
through that.
Back to our right.
We started hearing the guys hollering,

1716
01:45:09.181 --> 01:45:10.860
they're coming around,
they're coming around.

1717
01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:16.200
I was in a foxhole with a guy from Chicago,
j PFC James Eat Coleman,

1718
01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:21.540
and he had an m 16 I had my 45 and his 45 and I had an [inaudible] machine gun.

1719
01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.210
We were set up facing out into the tall grass.

1720
01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:28.440
I was looking out front and I could see some of the grass going down like

1721
01:45:28.441 --> 01:45:30.570
someone was crawling in it.
I hollered,
who's out there?

1722
01:45:31.110 --> 01:45:35.040
Nobody answered and I hollered again,
no answer.
I turned,

1723
01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.380
I turned to Coleman,
burn his ass.
Coleman said,
my rifles jammed.

1724
01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:42.000
I looked at him and him at me.

1725
01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.080
Then I look to the front and they were growing out of the weeds.

1726
01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:50.490
I just remember getting that machine gun from there on out and the training

1727
01:45:50.491 --> 01:45:53.610
takes over and you put your mind somewhere else because I really don't remember

1728
01:45:53.611 --> 01:45:56.940
what specifically I did.
I was totally unaware of the time,

1729
01:45:57.030 --> 01:46:02.030
the conditions on that m 60 machine gun according to the extracts from his

1730
01:46:02.491 --> 01:46:05.220
silver star citation specialists,
Paris,

1731
01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:10.500
Paris delivered lethal fire on wave after wave of the enemy until he ran out of

1732
01:46:10.501 --> 01:46:11.334
ammunition.

1733
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:16.770
Then standing up under fire with a 45 pistol in each hand.

1734
01:46:16.890 --> 01:46:21.890
Parish fired clip after clip into the enemy who were 20 yards out and he stopped

1735
01:46:22.051 --> 01:46:25.260
their attack.
Says parish.

1736
01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:29.160
I feel like I didn't do any more than anybody else did up there.

1737
01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.260
I remember a lot of noise,
a lot of yelling and then all at once it was quiet.

1738
01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:40.610
The silence out in front of Willard parish was that of this cemetery more than a

1739
01:46:40.801 --> 01:46:45.590
hundred dead north Vietnamese were later found where they had fallen in a semi

1740
01:46:45.591 --> 01:46:47.100
circle around his foxhole.

1741
01:46:52.330 --> 01:46:53.740
45 in each hand.

1742
01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:57.933
<v 1>That's,</v>

1743
01:46:58.690 --> 01:47:02.710
<v 0>that's crazy actually.
I mean you,</v>

1744
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:08.970
yeah,
he's,
he's going through a whole nother level because you can't reload,

1745
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:12.810
you know,
you can't reload your pistol.
So maybe he,
maybe he would stand up fire.

1746
01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:16.450
Both just dump will mag and each around and each to pistol,
get back down,

1747
01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.320
reload them both.
But then he got up there.
Well,

1748
01:47:21.321 --> 01:47:23.130
that's after he used all of his 60 Emma,

1749
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.140
George Fox 25 and Nathaniel bird 22 were slumped across their silent and 60

1750
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:36.390
machine gun surrounded by heaps of empty shell casings in empty ammunition cans.

1751
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:41.820
They had died together shoulder to shoulder sergeant Jemison pays them the

1752
01:47:41.821 --> 01:47:43.950
ultimate compliment of a professional soldier.

1753
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:46.830
Bird and Fox did a great job.

1754
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:50.280
They kept firing that gun and didn't leave it.

1755
01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:53.940
They stayed on it to the end.

1756
01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:05.980
So all this close air is coming in this whole time,

1757
01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:09.930
artillery is coming in the whole time and all of a sudden they get a situation

1758
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:14.050
where they start,
they see aircraft coming overhead with jets coming overhead,

1759
01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:15.400
low pass and they're,

1760
01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:19.360
they're heading towards them and they dropped some napalm.

1761
01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:25.660
So here's how more I yelled at the top of my lungs to Charlie Hastings,

1762
01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:30.930
the air force FAC call that son of a bitch off column off Joe Galloway Heard

1763
01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:33.850
Hasting screaming in the radio,
pull up,
pull up,
Matt Dillon says,

1764
01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:38.170
I can still see the canisters tumbling toward us.
I remember thinking,

1765
01:48:38.171 --> 01:48:40.360
turn your eyes away so you won't be blinded.

1766
01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:44.380
I put my face into a reporter shoulder to hide my eyes.

1767
01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:48.730
That was Joe Galloways.
I could hear good time.

1768
01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:52.510
Charlie Hastings shouting into his radio,
pull up the second jet,

1769
01:48:52.511 --> 01:48:55.180
did the napalm from the first,

1770
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:58.000
hit some people and caught some ammo on fire.

1771
01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.570
Sergeant Major Plumley jumped out to put the fire,

1772
01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.760
put out the fire around the ammunition.

1773
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:07.540
I ran out into the Lz to put an air panel out.

1774
01:49:08.410 --> 01:49:09.060
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1775
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.790
<v 0>Sergeant Nye says,
two of my people,</v>

1776
01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:17.450
Pfc Jimmy d Nakiyama and specialists five James Clark,

1777
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:22.050
we're on the other side of me.
Several yards away.

1778
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.210
Somebody was hollering and Co.

1779
01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:27.840
Colonel Moore was standing up there hollering about something about a wing man,

1780
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:28.674
and I looked up,

1781
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:32.340
there were two planes coming and one of them had already dropped this napalm and

1782
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:36.090
everything seemed to go in slow motion.
Everything was on fire.

1783
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:40.020
Nakiyama was all black and Clark was burned and bleeding

1784
01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:42.960
and here's Joe Galloway.

1785
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:47.200
Before I'd walked over and talked to the engineer guys and their little Fox.

1786
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.790
Now those same men were dancing in the fire.
Their hair burned off in an instant.

1787
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:56.330
Their clothes were incinerated.
One was a massive blisters.

1788
01:49:56.331 --> 01:50:00.470
The other not quite so bad,
but he had breathed fire into his lungs.

1789
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:04.700
When the flames died down,
we all ran out into the burning grass.

1790
01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:08.210
Somebody yelled at me to grab the feet of one of the charge soldiers.

1791
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:09.460
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1792
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.293
<v 0>When I got him,</v>

1793
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:15.010
the boots crumbled and the flesh came off and I could feel bare bones of his

1794
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:16.840
ankles and the palms of my hands.

1795
01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.080
We carried him to the aide station.

1796
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:23.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1797
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.530
<v 0>I can still hear their screams</v>

1798
01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:32.220
SPEC for Thomas Ybor.
Lyle,
a medical man from Bravo Company,
second battalion,

1799
01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:36.360
rushed out into the clearing with his kit bag to help of napalm victims.

1800
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:41.960
Birla was shot in the head and died within minutes in lieutenant rest score,

1801
01:50:41.961 --> 01:50:45.640
Lowe's arms,
an Oklahoma man.

1802
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:50.320
Berlin had turned 23 years old just four days before he was killed

1803
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:54.960
back in the command post.

1804
01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:00.900
Our Air Force Fac Charlie Hastings was stunned by all the consequences of the

1805
01:51:01.211 --> 01:51:02.470
misplaced air strike.

1806
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:06.350
Hastings recalls after the napalm strike,

1807
01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:09.400
Colonel More looked at me and said something that I never forgot.

1808
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.690
Don't worry about that one,
Charlie.

1809
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:15.190
<v 2>Just keep them coming.</v>

1810
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:23.163
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1811
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1812
01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:27.820
<v 0>Yeah.
Debbie,
he knows what he's got to do.</v>

1813
01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:30.370
He's got a things that just killed some of his own men,

1814
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.820
wounded some of his own men by fire and he's freaking out.

1815
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:35.680
Probably doesn't want to call any more bombs on,

1816
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.820
and how more realizes that that's what's keeping him alive.

1817
01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:42.970
Don't worry about that one.

1818
01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:45.580
<v 2>Just keep them coming.</v>

1819
01:51:51.810 --> 01:51:54.780
<v 0>Charlie company,
First Battalion,
Seventh Cavalry,
he'd be be gone.</v>

1820
01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:58.980
It's day with five officers in 106 men by noon.

1821
01:51:58.981 --> 01:52:02.190
It had no officers left and only 49 men on hurt.

1822
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:07.230
A total of 42 officers and men had been killed and 20 more wounded than two and

1823
01:52:07.231 --> 01:52:09.240
a half hours of vicious hand to hand fighting

1824
01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:15.660
the bodies of hundreds of slain Vietnamese north Vietnamese littered the bloody

1825
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:16.503
battleground

1826
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:26.990
Spec for pat Selleck.
24 and a native of Mount Kisco.
New York says,

1827
01:52:26.991 --> 01:52:30.440
I remember one guy had a small American flag on the back of his pack.

1828
01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.960
When I saw that I felt very proud.
That's something that always stuck with me.

1829
01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:42.220
This American flag was put on top of a blown up tree,
just like,
Ooh,
Jima.

1830
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:44.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1831
01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:46.280
<v 0>Another battle we had for the United States,</v>

1832
01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.500
<v 2>that little flag flew over landing zone x ray for the rest of the fight,</v>

1833
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:53.390
raising all our spirits

1834
01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:01.060
<v 0>and now there's a lull in the fighting</v>

1835
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:06.620
and here we go back to the book.
During this little,
the saddest,

1836
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:10.430
most painful and hardest duty to endure what's collecting are dead and loading

1837
01:53:10.431 --> 01:53:12.050
them on board the helicopters.

1838
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:13.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1839
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.920
<v 0>There were so many that the brigade ordered the big choppers,
the ch 47 chinooks.</v>

1840
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:19.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1841
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:23.110
<v 0>One such helicopter lifted out all 42 of the dead from Charlie Company.</v>

1842
01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:29.140
They came in together,
died together and now left together,

1843
01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.640
wrapped in their green rubber.

1844
01:53:30.641 --> 01:53:35.641
Ponchos SPEC for Vincent Cantu says we were picking up our dead and placing them

1845
01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:38.960
in the choppers.

1846
01:53:40.090 --> 01:53:40.660
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1847
01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.640
<v 0>some of these guys I had known for two years,</v>

1848
01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.700
you'd I could recognize them only by their name tags.

1849
01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:52.140
Their faces were blown off.
It was hard not to get sick.

1850
01:53:54.190 --> 01:53:57.100
We would look at each other and without saying a word,

1851
01:53:57.430 --> 01:54:00.820
just continue putting our dead on the choppers.

1852
01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.093
Now.

1853
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.840
The colonel that's in charge of the both,

1854
01:54:22.871 --> 01:54:26.380
both battalions,
he makes a visit and here we go.

1855
01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:30.040
Mid morning before Tali arrived,
Colonel Tim Brown flew in for a visit.

1856
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:33.430
Plumley recalls Lieutenant Colonel Moore saluted Brown and said,

1857
01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:35.530
I told you not to come in here.
It's not safe.

1858
01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:40.060
Brown picked up his right collar lapel and waggled his full colonels eagle at

1859
01:54:40.061 --> 01:54:44.830
Moore and said,
sorry about that.
Dylan and I gave him a situation report.

1860
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:48.520
Brown asked whether he should stay in X.

1861
01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:51.100
Ray established a small brigade command post and run the show.

1862
01:54:51.190 --> 01:54:52.870
We we recommended against that.

1863
01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:57.910
I knew the area and Bob Tully and I got along just fine.
Brown,
a Geek agreed.

1864
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.110
Lieutenant Dick Merchant says Colonel Brown had trust and confidence in his

1865
01:55:02.111 --> 01:55:02.944
commanders.

1866
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:06.820
I'm aware that some felt he should have landed an x ray and established a

1867
01:55:06.821 --> 01:55:08.740
command post.
I've never accepted that.

1868
01:55:09.610 --> 01:55:14.170
The First Battalion Seventh Cavalry was probably the finest battalion in
Vietnam.

1869
01:55:14.171 --> 01:55:16.660
Well-Trained,
superbly led with outstanding officers.

1870
01:55:16.661 --> 01:55:20.770
An NCO is throughout the unit.
Brown would have been out of place in X-ray.

1871
01:55:21.670 --> 01:55:24.340
Besides,
there was no room for a brigade CP.

1872
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.940
I recall it being rather crowded behind that ant hill.

1873
01:55:27.941 --> 01:55:32.080
So the reason I put that in there,
because here's the,
the guy that's,

1874
01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:37.200
you know how Morris boss comes in to to check on the scene and some people say,

1875
01:55:38.681 --> 01:55:42.250
oh he should have stayed there because it was a bad fight.
And he in this,
um,

1876
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:45.280
Dick Merchants said no.
Like he shouldn't have stayed there.
He,

1877
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.200
he did the right thing.
He came,
visited and left.
And by the way,

1878
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:51.450
you want to set up a brigade command posts,

1879
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.870
you need to find your own little ant hill.
Cause this one's on,
this one's,

1880
01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.950
you know,
all the size of a,
yeah,
it's full and it's the size of a car.

1881
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:02.340
We got dead and wounded everywhere.
And uh,
so,

1882
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.540
but it's,
it's the important point there from my perspective is,
you know,

1883
01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.110
the key thing is that he had trust and confidence in his officers.

1884
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:13.830
He didn't need to go out there and micromanage them.

1885
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:16.050
And I'm not saying you can never do that.

1886
01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:19.170
I've definitely not say that's the dichotomy of leadership.
You know,

1887
01:56:19.171 --> 01:56:21.180
sometimes you might look out there and say there's something going on,

1888
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:23.730
I need to get out there and you'd get in the weeds and get this brown problem

1889
01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:24.021
handled.

1890
01:56:24.021 --> 01:56:27.210
I need to come out there and support in this particular case probably wouldn't

1891
01:56:27.211 --> 01:56:29.610
have been a good idea how more had it under control at this point.

1892
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:34.020
That's why they're landing.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
chinuch which is a c 47 giant helicopter,

1893
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:35.520
much bigger than a Huey needs.
You know,

1894
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:40.620
it's slower and at least on OnApproach it's slower.
Hmm.
So yeah,

1895
01:56:40.621 --> 01:56:43.410
there's a time to get out there and micromanage and there's a time when you let

1896
01:56:43.411 --> 01:56:44.250
your teams lead.

1897
01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.620
Okay.
Going back to the book in Myron [inaudible] and Lieutenant Rick Ross Scola.

1898
01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:58.750
So these are the two guys that came from the second battalion seventh Cav and he

1899
01:56:58.751 --> 01:57:01.570
just talks about him a little bit and I think it's worse it worth mentioning.

1900
01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:02.240
Rick risk.

1901
01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.820
Scola and Myron did Yurik Bravo company,

1902
01:57:06.821 --> 01:57:10.690
second battalion had to foreign born officers whose accents and Gung Ho

1903
01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:13.540
attitudes lent a Tacho Foreign Legion flair,

1904
01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:17.710
the Ukrainian to Duroc and the Englishman risk score.

1905
01:57:17.711 --> 01:57:22.420
La was were destined over the next 72 hours to become battlefield legends in the

1906
01:57:22.421 --> 01:57:26.110
seventh Cav as much for their style as they're fearless leadership under fire.

1907
01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:31.660
And
yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1908
01:57:33.010 --> 01:57:37.750
you can see what these leaders do and you do get to see it.
But here's when,

1909
01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:40.270
when to Derek,
remember he touched down and he was told,
hey,
go,

1910
01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.100
go set up security.
And here we go.
Uh,

1911
01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:44.770
Myron to Derek and his soldiers had not yet been sorely tested,

1912
01:57:44.771 --> 01:57:48.970
but they soon would be during that wall to direct made certain that fields of

1913
01:57:48.971 --> 01:57:53.020
fire and observation were cleared out to beyond 200 yards at good fighting

1914
01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:53.860
positions were dug.

1915
01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:56.920
That machine guns were placed in positions that a shirt that assured flanking

1916
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:57.850
interlocking fire,

1917
01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.630
that trip flares and anti intrusion devices were installed as far as 300 yards

1918
01:58:01.631 --> 01:58:04.940
out,
that every man was locked down,
loaded down with ammunition to that ammo.

1919
01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.680
Ammo resupply points were designated that all radios were checked and double

1920
01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:09.280
checked.

1921
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.370
Then did Yurik worked very carefully with his artillery forward observer,

1922
01:58:12.371 --> 01:58:16.330
registering,
preplanned fires across the front.
The officer,

1923
01:58:17.230 --> 01:58:19.510
the officer,
Lieutenant William Lund had four batteries,

1924
01:58:19.511 --> 01:58:23.140
24 Howard's there's registered and adjusted on call.
So that's,

1925
01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:27.790
you ever wonder what,
uh,
what a military leader does?

1926
01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:30.400
That's what he does right there.
Dials everything in.

1927
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:31.343
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1928
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:34.520
<v 0>And here he's talking about,
uh,</v>

1929
01:58:34.521 --> 01:58:37.510
so one of the Dereks platoon leaders was Rick Rusk Orla.

1930
01:58:38.090 --> 01:58:40.520
And here's what he says about Rick.
Risk score low Rick,
or scroll up.

1931
01:58:40.521 --> 01:58:45.250
First platoon leader was six months out of ocs at the infantry school at Fort

1932
01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:45.280
Benning,

1933
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.060
but he had arrived there with a wealth of good training rd and in under his belt

1934
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.720
he had served in the British army in Cyprus and with the colonial police in

1935
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:55.390
Rhodesia.
And he knew what soldiering was all about,

1936
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.610
what he did to prepare his position and his men speaks for his professionalism.

1937
01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.990
So here's what [inaudible] did.

1938
01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:06.520
[inaudible] walked the terrain and tried to see it from the enemy's point of

1939
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:10.820
view.
That's critical.
What's the enemy thinking?
Scrub brush,
elephant grant,

1940
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.930
grass and hills and some ground cover stretched to the front.

1941
01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.600
The ground was not as flat as it first appeared,

1942
01:59:16.601 --> 01:59:20.110
but had seams and thick ruck stretching off to the south with a slight incline

1943
01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:24.220
away from his positions.
The hasty prone shelters dug by Charlie company.

1944
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:28.780
First Battalion had been dug after nightfall under enemy pressure risk score.

1945
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:31.340
Allah moved his men back 50 yards,

1946
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:34.840
which not only shorten the sector but meant the enemy would now have to leave

1947
01:59:34.841 --> 01:59:39.330
the trees and cross 40 yards of mostly open area to reach Bravo Company
foxholes.

1948
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:43.690
Risk score of the recalls because of our short and lines,

1949
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:47.920
I decreased the number of foxholes.
Three man holes were constructed.

1950
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:52.000
The [inaudible] machine guns were set on principle directions of fire from which

1951
01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:56.320
they could switch to final protective grazing fire interlocking with each other

1952
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:58.390
and with the machine guns on our flanks.

1953
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:03.490
Foxholes and pair of pets were built in detailed.
I tested the holes.

1954
02:00:04.410 --> 02:00:07.570
Some were so deep the occupants could not even see the pen over the parapet.

1955
02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:12.460
In these cases,
firing steps were built back up two hours before dusk.

1956
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:17.850
Sergeant e s Bach a two seven and Sergeant Thompson organized a booby trap

1957
02:00:18.071 --> 02:00:22.300
detail carefully they rigged grenades and trip flares far out on the main

1958
02:00:22.330 --> 02:00:26.860
avenues of approach.
Claimer mines,
Claymore mines would have ice the cake,

1959
02:00:26.861 --> 02:00:30.220
but somewhere they had been lost a screw up,

1960
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:33.880
but I felt we were ready to tangle with the best of the North Vietnamese and

1961
02:00:33.881 --> 02:00:34.750
again,
these guys are,

1962
02:00:34.751 --> 02:00:37.690
luckily there's a lull and they have all the time to prepare this and get it all

1963
02:00:37.691 --> 02:00:41.590
set up and that's a big difference from what happened when these guys hit the Lz

1964
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:42.820
and they didn't have any of this stuff.

1965
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:44.170
They didn't have any of the terrain figured out.

1966
02:00:44.171 --> 02:00:46.090
They'd have a chance to set it into their personnel up.

1967
02:00:46.091 --> 02:00:50.140
And these guys are taking advantage of that tactical situation to get up there

1968
02:00:50.141 --> 02:00:53.920
and make things right.
And you know,
both those guys,

1969
02:00:53.921 --> 02:00:56.560
you can see that's what a leader does.
That's what a leader does.

1970
02:00:56.561 --> 02:00:57.910
They make sure things are right,

1971
02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:02.030
they make sure you're ready to win and you can do that.

1972
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:07.030
And that applies to every,
every leader in every position,
in every industry,

1973
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:10.810
in every team in the world that the leader is stepping up and making sure we are

1974
02:01:10.811 --> 02:01:14.260
going to be prepared to win.
And by the way,

1975
02:01:14.261 --> 02:01:18.730
this Rick risk score law,
and this is a little bit of a side note,

1976
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:23.820
he ended up working for Morgan Stanley as the head of security for Morgan

1977
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:28.840
Stanley and they worked at the twin towers in New York City.

1978
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:30.070
That's where Morgan Stanley was.

1979
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:35.130
And he felt like they needed to do drills like they needed to prepare and that

1980
02:01:35.911 --> 02:01:36.251
like,
well,

1981
02:01:36.251 --> 02:01:40.940
what happened if the towers came under attack and they ran a bunch of drills and

1982
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:46.160
when September 11th came day,
ran those drills and got everyone evacuated.

1983
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.593
And

1984
02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:49.180
<v 2>okay,</v>

1985
02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:53.590
<v 0>Rick Risk Score.
La was last seen on the 10th floor,</v>

1986
02:01:53.591 --> 02:01:58.360
going back up into the building to do a final check and make sure that everyone

1987
02:01:58.361 --> 02:02:03.361
was out to and the tower collapsed at 9:59 AM and he saved a lot of lives that

1988
02:02:07.541 --> 02:02:07.930
day.

1989
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:12.250
Not only through his actions on the day of but through his actions in preparing.

1990
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:16.793
<v 2>Now</v>

1991
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.670
<v 0>the Vietnamese calm,
the north Vietnamese come and
they bring it.</v>

1992
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.823
Here we go.

1993
02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:29.300
The first rush by at least 300 north Vietnamese was beating off in less than 10

1994
02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:32.240
minutes by small arms machine guns and artillery fire from the alert and

1995
02:02:32.241 --> 02:02:33.380
well-prepared.
Bravo company.

1996
02:02:33.381 --> 02:02:37.310
Second Battalion troops at 4:31 AM 20 minutes later they came back.

1997
02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:42.120
Did your ex said the intensity of their attack increased and I was under the

1998
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:47.290
under assault aimed at my three left platoon sectors.

1999
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.370
Screams,

2000
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:54.110
shouts and whistles split the night as Nva swept down the mountain straight into

2001
02:02:54.111 --> 02:02:55.700
the smoke clouded killing ground.

2002
02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.560
Now all the mortars of my battalion and Talise were turned loose.

2003
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:06.370
Adding there 81 millimeter high explosive shells to the general mayhem rifleman.

2004
02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:09.860
John Martin who is into Derek's lines,

2005
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:14.330
says we kept pouring rifle and machine gun fire and artillery on them and they

2006
02:03:14.331 --> 02:03:18.350
broke and ran.
I don't think we had any casualties,

2007
02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:22.490
but they were catching hell.
So,
so now it's totally different story.

2008
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:25.130
These guys are dug in.
They have all their artillery dialed in,

2009
02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:28.280
they've got their fields of fire set up and the tax calm,

2010
02:03:28.281 --> 02:03:31.570
well organized sacks with 300 people there.
Did you,
can't they?
They,
they,

2011
02:03:31.571 --> 02:03:35.000
they don't make it happen.
The Vietnamese don't make it happen.
Yeah.

2012
02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2013
02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:39.980
<v 0>Back to the book.
Over on the perimeter,</v>

2014
02:03:39.981 --> 02:03:44.981
a scoreless men fought on our [inaudible] switch to direct fire fire delivered

2015
02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:49.770
to a visible target and lob rounds out between 75 and 100 yards.
Still,

2016
02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:51.600
the shadowy clumps moved closer.

2017
02:03:51.601 --> 02:03:56.601
Rpgs and machine guns crackled as they blasted us from the dark line of ground

2018
02:03:57.041 --> 02:04:00.480
cover across open fields.
They came in a ragged line.

2019
02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:03.330
The first groups caught down after a few yards,

2020
02:04:03.570 --> 02:04:08.570
a few surge right on sliding down behind their dead comrades for cover and

2021
02:04:08.581 --> 02:04:11.700
amazing highly disciplined enemy.
A trooper,

2022
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:15.600
Kirsten pleaded in a high pitched voice.
God stopped the bastards.

2023
02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.580
So here they are,
they're attacking and when the,

2024
02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.380
when the north Vietnamese soldiers get hit,
they're,

2025
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:23.760
their buddies are coming up behind them taking cover behind their bodies and

2026
02:04:23.761 --> 02:04:27.030
continuing to assault.
So this is an indicator,
you know,
like I said,

2027
02:04:27.031 --> 02:04:30.810
this was early in the ward since 1965 and you know,

2028
02:04:30.811 --> 02:04:33.810
we didn't know that that's determined enemy yet.
We didn't understand that yet.

2029
02:04:34.110 --> 02:04:36.420
And here we're seeing it for the first time.
This is what,
this is what,
uh,

2030
02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.960
this is how these guys are.
They are going to attack.

2031
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:42.030
They're going to attack through whatever we put at.

2032
02:04:48.190 --> 02:04:49.780
Here's another situation.
Settle in.

2033
02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:54.430
This is a steadily been whispered orders to his squad telling men on either side

2034
02:04:54.431 --> 02:04:55.750
of him to hold their fire,

2035
02:04:55.751 --> 02:04:58.930
not to shoot until the enemy stepped out into that open space right in front.

2036
02:04:59.110 --> 02:05:02.710
Suddenly a flare into booby trap went off and they were there in the grass

2037
02:05:02.711 --> 02:05:05.380
shooting at us.
I took around just above the elbow,

2038
02:05:05.410 --> 02:05:08.500
nothing really just a stitch or two and a piece of tape.
After the flight,

2039
02:05:08.890 --> 02:05:12.700
nobody shot back.
Then they stepped into that open area.

2040
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:16.210
The flares were burning,
they were lit up and it was easy.

2041
02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:19.270
We opened up and picked him off.
It was a light attack.

2042
02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:24.430
They then they hit us harder 30 minutes later blowing bugles blowing whistles.

2043
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:25.840
We killed them all.

2044
02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:30.310
Then some white phosphorous came in about 15 front of in front of my whole and I

2045
02:05:30.311 --> 02:05:34.930
lost most of my web gear and my shirt had about eight burns on one arm.

2046
02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:36.190
John's stet.

2047
02:05:36.190 --> 02:05:40.890
Lynn sat there under the light of the flares and use the point of his band net

2048
02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.680
to quickly dig the still burning Willy Pete fragments out of his flesh.

2049
02:05:44.681 --> 02:05:48.220
So white phosphorous is a type of munition net that we use and it's,

2050
02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:51.070
it's white phosphorous in it,
hits and blows up and it's on fire.

2051
02:05:51.490 --> 02:05:53.950
It's a little pieces of burning hot metal

2052
02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:57.430
and he's picking it out of his arm

2053
02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:03.310
during the two and a half hours of the attack against a direct sector.

2054
02:06:03.311 --> 02:06:06.130
The rest of the x ray prone or had been quiet too quiet.

2055
02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:09.970
Dylan and I discussed the possibility of conducting a reconnaissance by fire to

2056
02:06:09.971 --> 02:06:13.450
check for presence of the enemy w elsewhere on the line,

2057
02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:18.010
we had plenty of ammunition and what the hell the enemy knew where we are.

2058
02:06:18.011 --> 02:06:20.950
Our lines were by now as well as I did.

2059
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:26.650
We pass the word on the battalion net at precisely 6:55 AM every man on the

2060
02:06:26.651 --> 02:06:31.510
perimeter would fire his individual weapon and all machine guns for a full two

2061
02:06:31.511 --> 02:06:36.070
minutes on full automatic word was to shoot up trees,
ant hills,

2062
02:06:36.071 --> 02:06:40.660
bushes and high grass forward of the Ford of and above the American positions.

2063
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:44.410
Gardeners would shoot anything that worried them by now.

2064
02:06:44.411 --> 02:06:48.640
We had learned to our sorrow that the enemy used the night to put snipers and

2065
02:06:48.641 --> 02:06:50.770
trees ready,
do damage at first light.

2066
02:06:51.970 --> 02:06:55.180
Now is the time to clean up out front.

2067
02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:57.190
At the state of time,

2068
02:06:57.370 --> 02:07:02.370
our perimeter or rob did in earsplitting uproar and immediately a force of 30 to

2069
02:07:02.621 --> 02:07:07.621
50 north Vietnamese rose from a cover 150 yards forward of Joe's [inaudible]

2070
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:13.480
Alpha company.
Second Battalion Lines and began shooting back.

2071
02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:16.810
The mad minute of firing triggered their attack prematurely.

2072
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.100
Artillery fire was instantly brought in on them and the attack was beaten off

2073
02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.260
when the shooting stopped.

2074
02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:27.650
One dead sniper dangled by his rope from a tree and Ford have to Derek's left

2075
02:07:27.651 --> 02:07:28.484
most position,

2076
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:32.740
another drop dead out of a tree almost immediately forward of John Heroes.

2077
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:34.420
John Herons,
Bravo Company,

2078
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:40.080
First Battalion Command Post a third view north Vietnamese sniper was killed an

2079
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.030
hour later when he tried to climb down for from history and run for it.

2080
02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:49.300
Sergeant steadily Steadman's arm speckled with white phosphorous burns began

2081
02:07:49.301 --> 02:07:49.751
hurting him.

2082
02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:54.430
Now I was sent back to the aid station where my arm was bandaged and I was

2083
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:57.670
waiting to be medivaced out.
The more I sat there,

2084
02:07:57.671 --> 02:08:00.580
the more I realized I couldn't in good faith,

2085
02:08:00.581 --> 02:08:03.970
get on a chopper and fly out there and leave those guys behind.

2086
02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:08.380
So I took the sling off my arm and went back out.

2087
02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:10.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2088
02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:14.860
<v 0>Somebody asked where you going?
I said,
back to my foxhole.</v>

2089
02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:17.920
Nobody said anything else.

2090
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:20.833
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2091
02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:25.400
<v 0>so obviously these guys now have gained some,</v>

2092
02:08:26.210 --> 02:08:29.030
some good fire superiority.
The upper hand in the battle.

2093
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:32.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2094
02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:33.540
<v 0>Back to the book risk Orlin.</v>

2095
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:36.100
His men had been watching the air show appreciatively.

2096
02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.140
We gathered for the last sweep.

2097
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:41.350
Suddenly a fighter bomber plowed down on us from above.

2098
02:08:41.351 --> 02:08:45.550
We buried our noses in the holes and express train screamed down and the

2099
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:49.480
explosion shook the earth.
The bomb landed 30 yards from our holes.

2100
02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:54.010
We came up cursing in the dust and debris.
The call came to move out.

2101
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.300
Every available trooper,
including Colonel Moore,
push the perimeter out.

2102
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.880
This time it was no contest at all.

2103
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.970
We killed 27 more enemy and crushed all resistance.

2104
02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:09.550
I looked over the field littered with enemy dead sprawled by ones and twos and

2105
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:12.040
heaps across a torn,
gouged land,

2106
02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:16.660
blood body,
fragments,
torn uniforms,

2107
02:09:16.661 --> 02:09:21.130
shattered weapons littered the landscape.
It was a sobering site.

2108
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:25.750
Those men are enemies,
had mothers too.

2109
02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:27.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2110
02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:29.360
<v 0>But we had done what we had to do</v>

2111
02:09:31.050 --> 02:09:35.730
aside from wanting to make certain that Derek and his men did a clean,
safe job.

2112
02:09:35.731 --> 02:09:38.880
I had one reason for joining the final assault personally.

2113
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.670
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2114
02:09:40.670 --> 02:09:43.720
<v 0>this is,
this is Colonel Moore talking and then it goes to Rick [inaudible].</v>

2115
02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.270
Rick Ross scroller watched Colonel Morin.
Our sector was rushing up.

2116
02:09:47.271 --> 02:09:49.010
The clumps of body's pulling them apart.

2117
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.550
What the hell is the kernel doing up there?
Sargent Thompson asked,

2118
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:54.680
I shook my head Beta.

2119
02:09:54.681 --> 02:09:59.681
We saw him coming back at the head of men carrying ponchos by 10:30 AM colonel

2120
02:10:00.291 --> 02:10:01.700
Moore had found what he was looking for.

2121
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:06.740
Three dead American troops were no longer Michigan action.
Now,

2122
02:10:06.741 --> 02:10:09.440
there were on their way home to their loved ones.

2123
02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.370
By now,
late morning,
Tuesday,

2124
02:10:19.371 --> 02:10:23.840
November 16th the personality of landing zone x ray had changed what previously

2125
02:10:23.841 --> 02:10:26.390
had been a killing field,
had become something else.

2126
02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:30.560
We moved without impunity in places where movement had meant death on the hours

2127
02:10:30.561 --> 02:10:35.390
before,
except for our own and air.
There was nothing to be heard.

2128
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:39.170
It was just too quiet too sudden and it made me uneasy.

2129
02:10:40.150 --> 02:10:40.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2130
02:10:40.690 --> 02:10:43.960
<v 0>That old principle,
nothing was wrong except that nothing was wrong.</v>

2131
02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.680
Where was the enemy headed?
Back to Cambodia,

2132
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:49.960
still on the mountain preparing to attack again,

2133
02:10:50.170 --> 02:10:54.890
headed north to the I drank and it's precious water.
And again,

2134
02:10:54.891 --> 02:10:56.870
the old question,
where were the enemy?

2135
02:10:56.871 --> 02:11:00.020
12.7 millimeter heavy antiaircraft machine guns.

2136
02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:03.260
If the enemy commander brought those weapons to bear on us from the mountain

2137
02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:06.740
above Lz x Ray with three American battalions crowding the clearing would

2138
02:11:06.741 --> 02:11:08.150
present a beautiful target.

2139
02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:13.830
I told Dillon to step up the harassing artillery fire and to keep the airstrikes

2140
02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.440
coming in and the slopes above us.

2141
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:20.720
I told him I wanted a picture perfect helicopter extraction covered by all the

2142
02:11:20.721 --> 02:11:22.400
firepower we could bring to bear.

2143
02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.120
So yeah,
tides have turned completely and in fact,

2144
02:11:28.121 --> 02:11:32.020
they've turned so completely that a Chinuch,

2145
02:11:32.021 --> 02:11:35.860
which is the big helicopter flies in with a bunch of photographers and

2146
02:11:35.861 --> 02:11:40.120
television crews and reporters and they surround

2147
02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.310
the surround Colonel Morin.
Here we go back to the book,

2148
02:11:45.311 --> 02:11:47.050
the other reporters now clustered around me.

2149
02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:50.050
I told them that this had been a bitterly contested battle,

2150
02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.360
that clearly we were up against a brave,

2151
02:11:52.361 --> 02:11:56.020
determined and very tough enemy in the north Vietnamese soldiers,

2152
02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:58.390
but that American firepower,

2153
02:11:58.630 --> 02:12:03.520
disciplined guts and will to win had carried the day at Lz x Ray.

2154
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.810
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2155
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:10.520
<v 0>brave American soldiers and the m 16 rifle,
one of victory here.
I said,</v>

2156
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:13.520
my voice choked in my eyes filled with tears.

2157
02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:17.570
As I told the reporters that many of my men who had been killed in this place,

2158
02:12:17.571 --> 02:12:20.720
we're only a matter of days away from completing their service in the army,

2159
02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:22.550
but they fought and died bravely.

2160
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:24.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2161
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:25.570
<v 0>As I stood there,</v>

2162
02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:30.280
I knew that the telegrams that would shatter the hearts and lives of scores of

2163
02:12:30.281 --> 02:12:33.640
American families were already being drafted.

2164
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:41.000
Now came the body count and if you remember,
we've talked about this before.

2165
02:12:41.001 --> 02:12:44.390
Everyone was always,
they wanted to talk about the body count in Vietnam,

2166
02:12:44.391 --> 02:12:48.860
even at this early stage and he was thinking about that back to the book.

2167
02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:50.720
Now came the body count from the beginning of the fight.

2168
02:12:50.721 --> 02:12:54.080
I had known that higher headquarters would eventually want to know what damage

2169
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:58.460
we had done to the enemy.
So after each major action in this battle hating it,

2170
02:12:58.490 --> 02:13:03.090
I asked my company commanders for their best estimates of enemy killed with the

2171
02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.450
battle raging back and forth over three days and two nights.

2172
02:13:05.451 --> 02:13:06.740
It was anything but orderly.

2173
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:09.620
There was no referee to call time out for a body count.

2174
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.910
We did the best we could to keep a realistic count of the enemy dead.

2175
02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:20.260
In the end it added up to 834 dead by body count with an additional 1,215

2176
02:13:22.641 --> 02:13:26.990
estimated killed and wounded by artillery air attacks and Ariel rocket attacks.

2177
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:29.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2178
02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:34.260
<v 0>On my own I cut the 834 figure back to 634 a personal allowance for the</v>

2179
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:40.041
confusion and fog of war and let the hundred 1,215 estimated stand

2180
02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.370
we captured in evacuated six enemy prisoners

2181
02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.930
on our side.
We had lost 79 Americans killed in action,

2182
02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.420
121 wounded

2183
02:13:55.530 --> 02:13:56.363
<v 1>and none missing,</v>

2184
02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:02.253
and

2185
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:08.240
<v 0>at this point they get extracted off the battlefield and including Colonel</v>

2186
02:14:09.361 --> 02:14:10.740
Moore.
He's the last man to leave

2187
02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:16.670
from his battalion and here we go back to the book.
It was a short,

2188
02:14:16.671 --> 02:14:21.320
fast ride to landing zone Falcon,
just five and a half miles east of x-ray.

2189
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:25.370
As we landed among the artillery pieces,
I saw 75 yards away,

2190
02:14:25.371 --> 02:14:28.370
a group of my troopers off in the Northwestern edge of the Lz.

2191
02:14:29.370 --> 02:14:29.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2192
02:14:29.970 --> 02:14:31.250
<v 0>Dean breathless.</v>

2193
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:36.860
An NBC News correspondent was in Lz Falcon that afternoon.

2194
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:41.190
He captured the scene in his 1967 book,

2195
02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:46.020
the face of South Vietnam.
And here's what [inaudible] wrote.

2196
02:14:46.290 --> 02:14:47.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2197
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:50.130
<v 0>How Maura was the last man to come out of the battle.</v>

2198
02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.290
It was the biggest battle he had ever fought.

2199
02:14:54.730 --> 02:14:57.970
He was a lieutenant colonel and he carried himself like a proud man.

2200
02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:01.590
Is Sergeant Major,
was at his side.

2201
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:06.270
It would need a Shakespeare to describe what happened then,

2202
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:11.130
but it was something that was love and manliness and pride.

2203
02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:12.960
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2204
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.940
<v 0>it was the moment of the brave.</v>

2205
02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:21.130
How more turned and went from group to group of his men and only a few bothered

2206
02:15:21.131 --> 02:15:24.550
to get up because there was no exclusivity.
Now,
no rank.

2207
02:15:24.970 --> 02:15:29.800
And how more did not want them to stand and salute.
He was saluting them.

2208
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:33.270
He talked with them,
he thanked them,

2209
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:38.490
he was not solemn and he did not bring too is greetings and salutations of a

2210
02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:39.840
political of a politician.

2211
02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:45.110
There was no poverty of spirit in his hand.
Shook,
shake,

2212
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:47.300
and he shook every man's hand.

2213
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:53.280
It was a union of men who had met and defeated the enemy.
Not Forever,

2214
02:15:53.850 --> 02:15:58.260
not in a victory that ended the war,
but it a victory over their uncertainty.

2215
02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:01.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2216
02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:02.460
<v 0>When their hour had come,</v>

2217
02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:08.040
they had done their job and it was this thought too that Al Moore,

2218
02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:10.830
how more had in his mind,

2219
02:16:12.690 --> 02:16:16.680
and he said that if they had one,
no one else has gratitude.

2220
02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:20.020
They had his

2221
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:29.980
<v 1>and I,
and I think</v>

2222
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.170
<v 0>that these men,</v>

2223
02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:36.370
all these men have,
are absolute

2224
02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.653
gratitude

2225
02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:48.030
for fighting,
for freedom,
for fighting,
for each other,
for fighting for us.
And,

2226
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:50.560
and actually the,
the story doesn't end there

2227
02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:54.970
nor does the book

2228
02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:00.400
and we're going to save it for the next podcast,

2229
02:17:00.401 --> 02:17:03.160
but we're going to hear about the story of l z Albany,

2230
02:17:03.161 --> 02:17:06.670
which is a few miles to the north in still inside the eye.

2231
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:11.671
Drang valley where second battalion of the seventh cav moved in and fought.

2232
02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:19.230
And
it's,

2233
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.770
there's so much that I didn't cover in this,
in this what I just covered.

2234
02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:27.930
There's so much I didn't cover me,
didn't even cover the loss platoon.

2235
02:17:27.931 --> 02:17:32.880
Who does eventually get recovered?
Uh,
read the book.
I should have left that out.

2236
02:17:32.970 --> 02:17:37.950
Spoiler alert.
But sure,
there's so much in there.
There's so much,

2237
02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:45.420
so many lessons learned.
So much action,

2238
02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:50.690
so much good description and so many heroes in so much sacrifice.

2239
02:17:51.541 --> 02:17:52.980
I don't even think gratitude.

2240
02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2241
02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:00.730
<v 0>I even did gratitudes enough.
I think we owe them more than just gratitude.</v>

2242
02:18:00.731 --> 02:18:02.770
We owe them our best.

2243
02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:04.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2244
02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:09.790
<v 0>We owe them our lives,</v>

2245
02:18:09.791 --> 02:18:12.370
our best lives every day.

2246
02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:15.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2247
02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:16.043
<v 0>Every moment.</v>

2248
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:22.700
Remember this sacrifice

2249
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:29.570
and what we owe them as we owe them to live our best lives.

2250
02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:41.790
Then I think that's all I've got for tonight.
So

2251
02:18:43.510 --> 02:18:47.880
Echo.
Um,
yeah,
yeah.
Well I decompress over here.
Maybe you can

2252
02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:53.970
give some input on how to support this podcast or support yourself if you want

2253
02:18:53.971 --> 02:18:54.804
to.

2254
02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.410
<v 3>Sure.
Yeah.
If you want to.</v>

2255
02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:03.830
So of course the first way is supporting your joints.

2256
02:19:04.081 --> 02:19:08.940
I always talk about supplements.
Jacqueline is supplements best kind.

2257
02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:10.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2258
02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:14.660
<v 3>Jocko,
joint warfare and supercrew Krill oil.
Omega threes.</v>

2259
02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:18.650
Very good for you.
If you want some of that,
get it@originmain.com.

2260
02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:19.660
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2261
02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.690
<v 3>right there on the front where you just click on labs.
It's right there.
Also,</v>

2262
02:19:22.691 --> 02:19:26.860
there's some good,
uh,
gies,
but before that,

2263
02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.650
give a new product.
We do a new product,

2264
02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:37.050
a new class of product,
class of product.

2265
02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:42.340
I bring workout now you're all in England right now?
Yeah.
Buzzing on Irina.

2266
02:19:43.690 --> 02:19:47.310
So discipline,
it's a pre workout,

2267
02:19:47.670 --> 02:19:51.240
just saying that's a cool word.
Or that's the name of both.
Both.

2268
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:54.950
So it's called discipline,
right?
So it's pre,

2269
02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:59.110
technically they call it a pre workup or we're calling it a preadmission.
Yeah.

2270
02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.130
Supplement.
Well preworkout would help you with your physical activity,

2271
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:09.140
but the discipline has cognitive enhancers in it as well.

2272
02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:12.440
Because when you're on a mission you just don't need physical strength.

2273
02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:17.120
You need mental strength.
Yeah.
So this gives you both.
Yeah.

2274
02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:20.420
So if your mission is the workout,
boom,
there you go.
It's a pre workout.

2275
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:23.690
Your mission is a s exam.

2276
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:27.440
It's a pre exam.
Yes.
Supplement.
If your,

2277
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:32.360
if your mission is a mission and what you're good to go.
There you go.

2278
02:20:32.361 --> 02:20:34.760
Boom.
Oh yeah,
get down.
Um,

2279
02:20:34.761 --> 02:20:39.761
I too can vouch for this because I'm on it too cause it should perform well to

2280
02:20:41.031 --> 02:20:43.610
you know,
display it's affects.
Um,

2281
02:20:43.611 --> 02:20:48.320
also Giza in rash guards at origin Maine,
all made in America.

2282
02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:54.470
The more I think about that,
the more of a big deal that is a real big deal.
Yeah.

2283
02:20:54.471 --> 02:20:58.260
Cause it's from the little like,
oh we say the cotton to the g,

2284
02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:02.840
the g or the,
you know,
the other stuff that this is a lot of cool stuff on there.

2285
02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:03.950
GIES rash guards,

2286
02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:08.210
even apparel all made in America or didn't mean I'll come to this spot to get

2287
02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:12.950
them.
If you want them.
I want them.
I like them.
It's funny,

2288
02:21:12.951 --> 02:21:16.910
like every once in a while I'll find myself just wearing all origin stuff.

2289
02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:18.500
Not on purpose too.
It's the kind of,
okay,

2290
02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:22.610
my favorite shorts even though they don't have them.
I know I'm wearing that.

2291
02:21:22.611 --> 02:21:25.790
It were every other day approximately.
And um,
you know,

2292
02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:28.970
you just find yourself in this stuff because it's so good.
That's my opinion.

2293
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:33.320
Also for fitness gear,
cool fitness gear,
she want to,

2294
02:21:34.430 --> 02:21:36.680
even if you're just doing kettlebells,
icy,

2295
02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:41.760
get artistic kettlebells from on it on it.com/jocko that's where you get them.

2296
02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:47.060
It was all other creative workout stuff on their maces and cool jump ropes and

2297
02:21:47.211 --> 02:21:50.480
battle ropes and,
and whatnot.
Um,
pretty much anything.

2298
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:55.600
If you're getting bored with the workout and you want to enhance it in some

2299
02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:59.900
creative way,
go there on a.com/jocko uh,

2300
02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:02.300
don't get addicted to the website because a lot of good information.

2301
02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:06.590
So it's kind of a catch 22 good.
You can get info on there.
A lot of good Info,

2302
02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:09.200
interesting info,
but he might spend a lot of time there.

2303
02:22:09.201 --> 02:22:14.201
So be careful also when you buy this book,

2304
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:18.650
we were soldiers once and young by general.

2305
02:22:18.651 --> 02:22:22.820
Hal Moore and Jill Galloway.
No,
what I was thinking,

2306
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:27.270
I have no idea what you're thinking.
So something tells me,

2307
02:22:27.271 --> 02:22:30.420
I'm about to hear though.
If you watch the movie,
a few good men

2308
02:22:32.450 --> 02:22:36.250
think Demi Moore.
Yes.
She plays,
uh,

2309
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.590
like she plays a Jaguar lieutenant.
Yeah,
I seen the movie.
Her name,

2310
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:45.510
the character name is Jo Ann Galloway,
but colored Jill.

2311
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:47.100
So her name is Joe Galloway.

2312
02:22:48.390 --> 02:22:53.380
I noticed that anyway,
when you buy this book,
we were soldiers in there.

2313
02:22:53.410 --> 02:22:58.200
Is there some layers?
Those are interpreted.
The layers are not layers.

2314
02:22:58.230 --> 02:23:02.460
Walls are coincidences.
There's a big difference.
It's a fine line.

2315
02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.720
Charlie Beckwith that formed up Delta Force.
Sure.

2316
02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:11.430
Being in this book,
that's layers.
Layers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would,

2317
02:23:11.490 --> 02:23:14.950
I would confirm those layers for ferret layers for sure.
I don't know.

2318
02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:19.610
I still feel like joke is a layered somewhere negative.
I Dunno.

2319
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:24.680
What if they negative no of this negative stories and they named the girl they

2320
02:23:27.901 --> 02:23:32.100
could have negative,
maybe,
maybe not.
And if they did,
they failed.

2321
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:36.700
They failed.
Yeah.
Cause after it.
Yeah.

2322
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:40.770
So we'll Juliet Galloway kind of got it.
No,
no,
not really.

2323
02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:45.870
Which she convinced
either way.

2324
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:50.050
I still think slayers.
Either way.
When you,
um,
when you buy this,

2325
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.910

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:56.400
You don't see what I look like.
If you care about that sort of thing.
Boom.

2342
02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:59.760
Most people don't care what we look like.
No I don't.
I don't think

2343
02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:03.270
it makes sense that they don't care because it doesn't matter.

2344
02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:09.030
They just care about the content of your character.
Subscribe to Youtube.

2345
02:25:09.031 --> 02:25:12.870
That's the point.
If you do care about what we look like,

2346
02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:14.850
also does excerpts on there.

2347
02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:19.230
Good way to get little bits of lessons,

2348
02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:24.350
messages from Jocko shareable so you don't have to share the whole and a half

2349
02:25:25.210 --> 02:25:30.100
ish our podcast.
You can just share the,
the excerpts,
pass them on,

2350
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:34.300
you know,
let someone else,
uh,
learn these lessons with you.

2351
02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:37.570
Also,
chuck was a store called Jocko store

2352
02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:41.080
named after him,
John Glassdoor,
door.com.

2353
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:44.320
That is where you can get the cool shirts.

2354
02:25:44.410 --> 02:25:49.410
I think they're cool and I think it goes beyond just my opinion because people

2355
02:25:49.601 --> 02:25:51.760
have emailed me in and been like,
hey,

2356
02:25:51.761 --> 02:25:56.350
these are cool because I made sure they're not the low quality,

2357
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.950
you know,

2358
02:25:56.950 --> 02:26:00.460
people and they started shirt brand or if they're printing shirt they're like,

2359
02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:03.160
hey,
let me get the cheap ones so I don't have to spend a lot of money,

2360
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:07.510
play it safe,
all this stuff.
I didn't do that.
I got the good ones,

2361
02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:12.450
stuff that I would actually wear regardless of what's printed on like wearable,

2362
02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:15.730
they're wearable.
So I put it anyway.
That's how I know they're good.

2363
02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:19.420
I'm wearing one right now.
Yeah,
correct me to boom.

2364
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:23.140
See I wouldn't wear it if I didn't want to wear it.
So anyway,

2365
02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:25.150
they're a very good,
that's where you can get the shirts.

2366
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:26.710
There's women's stuff on there.
Uh,

2367
02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:31.330
also this rash guards in there for activities such as surfing,
Jujitsu,
warrior.

2368
02:26:31.331 --> 02:26:35.790
Could rash guard out there or he could rush card should be restarted.

2369
02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:40.120
There.
Should be on there.
Good.
I vowed to get them in,

2370
02:26:40.121 --> 02:26:45.070
in time to ship for Christmas.
So that would be like today.

2371
02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:48.600
So go on there and you know,
that's the,

2372
02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:53.080
my vow is that the right word vow.
I vow to do this.

2373
02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:57.620
That means you better succeed.
Yeah.
You know,
that's one of,
okay.
So anyway,
yeah,

2374
02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:01.030
some rash guards doesn't there for Jujitsu,
surfing and kind of cool activity,

2375
02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:04.780
cycling,
whatever,
anything you want.
Range of motion to be maintained.

2376
02:27:04.781 --> 02:27:09.781
100% and performance be increased by 19% I think it's up to 21% back from the

2377
02:27:12.341 --> 02:27:16.150
field.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I kind of average cause some people a little bit more,

2378
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:19.210
you know,
so those people that they pushed the average up,

2379
02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:23.770
I think that's how it works.
Anyway.
Cool stuff on there.
Check it out.

2380
02:27:23.771 --> 02:27:25.810
I'm not saying get something,
but if you want something

2381
02:27:27.210 --> 02:27:30.390
then you get something and,
and it supports podcast.

2382
02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:34.050
Good way to support what he's on there as well.
Thicker ones.

2383
02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:39.450
They might be running lab,
might have to get some more.
It is winter,
I get it.

2384
02:27:40.170 --> 02:27:42.750
But they're the,
they're the uh,
the thicker ones.

2385
02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:46.500
Like how you said also psychological warfare,
what that is.
If you don't know.

2386
02:27:46.530 --> 02:27:50.390
I know we all know what it is already.
It's been number one and I two.
Well,

2387
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:54.450
it might not be number one anymore.
That's a long story.
Anyway,

2388
02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:55.740
if you didn't know what it is,

2389
02:27:55.741 --> 02:27:58.170
the unlikely event that you didn't know what it is,
is what it is.

2390
02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:01.380
It's an album with tracks,
chocolate tracks.

2391
02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:03.660
Each track is designed

2392
02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:09.760
to help you through moments of weakness.
When you're on your path,

2393
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.280
when you're on your warpath.
Haven't used that word yet.
Wait,
maybe I have.

2394
02:28:15.281 --> 02:28:18.610
I Dunno.
Nonetheless,
when you're on the path of discipline,
right,

2395
02:28:18.611 --> 02:28:21.830
you're on the program,
you're on your campaign against weakness.
You,

2396
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.940
you hit little,

2397
02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:27.940
it's not just one smooth road and it's not a one straight road either and it's

2398
02:28:28.521 --> 02:28:32.720
riddled,
riddled
every day,

2399
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:38.870
probably every minute.
Literally riddled with distractions.

2400
02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:44.030
Every once in a while you'll hit moments of weakness,
whether it's a speed bump,

2401
02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:47.960
distraction,
lack of energy,
boredom,

2402
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:53.960
repetitiveness,
tediousness,
tediousness,
that's order.

2403
02:28:56.330 --> 02:29:00.800
That's what psychological warfare is for.
It's a little spot for those moments.

2404
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:04.010
You don't want to wake up early every single day.
Ah,

2405
02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:07.760
we got the solution for that.
He listened to the little track Jocko,

2406
02:29:07.761 --> 02:29:09.230
pragmatically telling you,

2407
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:13.700
I can get over that little moment of weakness.

2408
02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:16.790
Same thing with wanting to skip the workout for the day.
That was mine.

2409
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:21.440
That was mine.
Not Anymore.
Check and yeah,

2410
02:29:21.470 --> 02:29:23.030
there's a bunch of them for all kinds of stuff.

2411
02:29:23.031 --> 02:29:26.570
Skipping on the Diet and it's a good one.
That's what psychological warfare is.

2412
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.620
Very effective.

2413
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:29.370
<v 0>Percent effectiveness.</v>

2414
02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:32.910
That's a bold statement and you can get Jocko white tea on Amazon,

2415
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:38.010
which will make you deadlift 8,000 pounds factually confirmed,
confirmed.
Uh,

2416
02:29:38.011 --> 02:29:41.760
you can get some books on their way.
The warrior kid,
good Christmas gift.

2417
02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:47.520
It's also a good whatever gift.
So get all kid on the path,

2418
02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:50.850
get them on the path.
You've got so much great feedback on that.

2419
02:29:51.330 --> 02:29:52.111
Extreme ownership.

2420
02:29:52.111 --> 02:29:56.460
This is from leading at every level in combat,

2421
02:29:56.580 --> 02:29:58.860
in business and in life.
Extreme ownership.

2422
02:29:58.861 --> 02:30:00.960
Written meet by me and my brother Leif Babin.

2423
02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.720
Also from an individual perspective,

2424
02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:08.520
if you want to get yourself on the path,
there's no better gift than discipline.

2425
02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:12.420
The discipline equals freedom field manual.
Everyone that asks me for workouts,

2426
02:30:12.450 --> 02:30:16.110
that's where they are.
Everyone asks me what I eat.
That's where it is.

2427
02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:19.590
You haven't asked me how much I sleep.
That's where it is.
So get that.

2428
02:30:19.591 --> 02:30:22.890
If you want the audio version,
the audio version is not on audible.

2429
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:27.330
The audio version of discipline equals freedom field manual is on iTunes,

2430

Echo is at Echo,

2458
02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:16.320
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and thanks to those people,

2459
02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:20.550
those soldiers,
sailors,
airmen and marines that sign up

2460
02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:27.380
that sign up and volunteer to make the ultimate sacrifice.

2461
02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:33.260
Thank you all for protecting us and our freedoms and to police and law

2462
02:32:34.561 --> 02:32:35.394
enforcement.

2463
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:41.150
Thanks for protecting us from crime and criminals and terrorists right here at

2464
02:32:43.471 --> 02:32:45.660
home to paramedics.

2465
02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:50.820
Thanks for coming to us in our time of need when we call and to the firefighters

2466
02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:54.270
right now out there on the line,

2467
02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:58.440
especially in our state right here of California,
cal fire.

2468
02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:03.810
Thanks for your service and your sacrifice and my condolences to those who have

2469
02:33:03.811 --> 02:33:05.760
fallen in recent days and weeks.

2470
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:11.060
And our thoughts are with the families of the fallen and for everyone else

2471
02:33:12.871 --> 02:33:14.100
that's listening.

2472
02:33:14.101 --> 02:33:19.101
When you see what men can do when pushed beyond the limit of human capacity,

2473
02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:24.960
