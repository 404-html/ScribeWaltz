00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.760
This is Jocko podcast number 98 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480
They asked us to take off our head scarves and loosened any buttons to reveal

4
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.380
our chests.

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.550
That courtyard became the marketplace where Isis men came and chose girls.

6
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.600
They liked bill.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
They first sent all the older women to another place and the women with babies

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.660
and other children to another place.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.270
We do not know the whereabouts of these women and that includes my mother and my

10
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:43.880
sisters.
I had my period that night,

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.200
but no matter how much I told him I have my period,
he did not believe me.

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.450
He ordered me to strip naked in his room.

13
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420
Then he stuck his finger in my vagina and saw that I was indeed bleeding.

14
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.750
Only then did he believe,

15
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.730
<v 1>okay,</v>

16
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.550
<v 0>but that did not mean he left me alone.
Instead,</v>

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.430
he put the air conditioner on a really high volume,

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.780
said that I am to sit still in my new to d the whole night and he molested me

19
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:20.690
throughout the night.
By the time morning arrived,

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.590
I was frozen both physically and psychologically.

21
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
Nothing mattered after that point.
I didn't know.

22
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.440
I had not seen the worst of it yet.

23
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.390
He would put on horrible sexual movies and we do all kinds of things.
To me.

24
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.650
They all had long hair and long beards,

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.620
but the worst of all is there smell.

26
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.180
I've never smelled such awful smell in my life.

27
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.080
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.150
<v 0>they do not bathe.</v>

29
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.690
They feel more like beasts than human.

30
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.790
Only Yazidi women are taken as slaves.

31
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.270
She a women,
they burn alive.
We saw one,

32
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.970
she,
a woman burned alive in front of us.

33
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.730
Christian women.

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.930
They leave on the condition that their family must pay a fee for Isis,

35
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.680
for being Christian in Isis territories

36
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.520
and Sunni women are left alone as long as they follow isis orders.

37
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.510
If they don't,
they are whipped and tortured.

38
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.260
<v 0>Some of them are the wives of our captors,
some of the wives,</v>

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.630
whereas helpless as we were at,

41
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.890
some were very mean women who encouraged their men to rape us.

42
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.093
<v 1>Okay?</v>

43
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.060
<v 0>As long as a girl has some breast,</v>

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.650
she's considered a woman and that entitles them to rape her.

45
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.660
Some girls are as young as 10 and 11 years old.

46
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.530
I have no past and no future.
At the moment,

47
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.590
I am stuck in my anger and pain at what Isis did to my family,

48
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.750
my community,
and myself.

49
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640
I have a new behavior that I can't stop including washing my mouth over and over

50
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.403
again.

51
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.100
There are nights I wake up more than one time to wash my mouth as I remember

52
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.190
what they did to me and how they forced themselves on me.

53
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.790
I am a dead person now.

54
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.390
I have no life.

55
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I only hope that my mother comes back from capture so my life can resume.

56
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.100
So those are excerpts from an article that was in the New York Times by Zeynab

57
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.580
Salbi and the quotes are from
Layla,

58
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.880
which is a pseudonym who was a [inaudible] woman captured by Isis and obviously

59
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.080
kept as a slave.

60
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.950
And she eventually escaped and gave that interview in a camp in Earl Beal,

61
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.810
which is in northern Iraq,

62
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.170
which at the time was an Iraqi government controlled city.

63
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.290
And I would say this,
if you think that evil

64
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.300
does not exist in the world,

65
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.330
you are wrong.
It does.

66
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.760
And it's not just individuals scattered around.
These are groups of,

67
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.880
suppose it human beings that are systematically implementing heinous and evil

68
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:11.250
acts on totally innocent people.

69
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.010
And I have obviously talked about evil before on this podcast

70
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.900
20 years ago during the genocide in Rwanda

71
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.960
50 years ago in Vietnam during the me Lai massacre,

72
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.620
75 years ago,
a Nazi Germany 80 years ago when Nan king

73
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.060
under the Imperial Japanese army.

74
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.000
And those things are in the past.

75
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.390
But it is important to remember that evil is still happening now.

76
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.460
And I know that it is hard for us to see that,

77
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:06.461
especially here in America in this unbelievably well protected bubble that we

78
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:13.031
live in a bubble that is provided and protected by young and brave men and women

79
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.320
who volunteer to go out and hold the line.

80
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.490
But the evil is out there.
It always is.

81
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.523
And tonight

82
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.220
we have a guest on the podcast that I think has a very clear understanding of

83
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.761
evil,

84
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.530
of where it comes from and how it manifests itself in the world.

85
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.560
And he also has an incredible understanding of the good

86
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.950
and what we as people can do

87
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.630
to live our lives better for ourselves,
for our families,
for our communities,

88
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.740
and for the world.

89
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.820
His name is Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson.

90
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960
And I'm not exactly sure when I her Dr. Peterson for the first time,

91
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.240
but as I dug into the content online,
what really struck me

92
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.070
was that what he was saying,

93
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.040
<v 1>okay.</v>

94
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.480
<v 0>And he was an academic on unbelievably smart,
unbelievably well read person.</v>

95
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.790
And yet when he said things,

96
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.930
they aligned almost perfectly with things that I believed in,

97
00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:39.880
things that I had learned in my life.

98
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.240
And so here we were,

99
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:48.260
these two radically different people from different backgrounds.

100
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:51.230
One highly educated college professor,

101
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.650
the other a military veteran,

102
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.040
and a certified knuckle dragger.

103
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.860
And yet our thoughts were very aligned.

104
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.300
And the way that

105
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.970
I would hear him tie history and fought around human psychological evolution

106
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:20.280
into the social structure and to societal structure

107
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.840
and the way he laid out the maps of meaning behind the way we think it was very

108
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:28.284
useful.

109
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.750
And it's helped me realize that the way I feel in my gut,

110
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.050
my instincts about people and about the world,

111
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.900
they're there for a reason.
It isn't random.

112
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.140
There is some reason behind the way that I think and the way that we think.

113
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.403
So

114
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.850
<v 2>Jordan,
thank you for coming on the show.
Very glad to be here.</v>

115
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.340
That's uh,
that's quite the beginning.

116
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.780
<v 0>Yeah.
I think,
um,
like I said,</v>

117
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:12.250
it's very easy for people to lose track of the fact that while you're sitting in

118
00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:14.170
an air conditioned space somewhere,

119
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.630
thinking about your next Netflix movie that you're gonna Watch,
there's PR,

120
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.440
there are people that are in the most horrible and heinous situations that are

121
00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:28.441
being put on them by other human beings and it doesn't really stop.

122
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.410
<v 2>Yeah.
Well it's a hard thing for people to,
to contemplate.
I mean,</v>

123
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.010
there's two elements to life that are hard to contemplate.
I mean,

124
00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:43.990
one is that the suffering that's attendant on life fundamentally and then the

125
00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:45.820
other is the malevolence of people.

126
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.420
And we're not in the modern world.

127
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:53.320
We don't really think about those as fundamental realities in some sense now

128
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:57.640
because we,
we tend to think about material situations as fundamental realities.

129
00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:01.570
But the metaphysical realities,
the ethical realities are more real.

130
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.790
And it's necessary to know that in order to orient yourself properly in life.
I,

131
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:09.400
you know,
I never really took the idea of good,

132
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.310
seriously transcendent good,
let's say,

133
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:17.140
or ultimate good until I convinced myself of the existence of,
well,

134
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.070
if it wasn't the ultimate evil,
it was sufficiently ultimate for me.
You know,

135
00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:24.910
cause I immersed myself in a study of the Nazi Holocaust and,

136
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.080
and of what happened in down king and what happened with unit seven 31 which is

137
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.260
the most horrifying,
that's the most horrifying material I've ever read,

138
00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:36.370
which is really saying something because there's plenty of horrified material to

139
00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:37.870
read and,

140
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.130
and what happened in the Soviet Union and what happened in Mao's China,
which,

141
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.120
you know,
so few people know about now.
And I,

142
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.430
I guess what I found most striking,

143
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.460
especially with regards to what happened in the Soviet Union was well and,

144
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.210
and,
and in Germany for that matter,

145
00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:58.090
was that there were a number of people who were writing about it,

146
00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:01.480
like Viktor Frankl,
psychiatrist who wrote man's search for meaning,

147
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.200
and also Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote the Gulag archipelago,

148
00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:08.920
which should be required reading for every,
I think for every American citizen.

149
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.280
Um,
that,

150
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.710
that there was some integral relationship between the moral failings of

151
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:18.190
individuals and a catastrophic moral failings of the state.

152
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.830
And that that was directly causally related.
You know,

153
00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:25.630
so social knits and made a great case in with regards to the analysis of the

154
00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:28.660
Marxist catastrophes in the Soviet Union,

155
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:33.460
that they were tied integrity not only to,
to that dogma,

156
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.640
but also to the willingness of the typical citizen to swallow endless lies and,

157
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:43.430
and act them out.
And he included himself in that,
in that set of,
of,

158
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.170
of deceitful people,
let's say.
And it was really struck me that

159
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.100
because there were,
those writings are so profound.

160
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:52.750
Viktor Frankl is another good example.

161
00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:55.990
You can't read that without it really punching you.
You know?
Um,

162
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.560
it really struck me that it really struck me that it was possible that there was

163
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:06.460
some direct integral relationship between the individual moral choices that

164
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:10.450
people made in their day to day lives and the broad scale social movements that

165
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.620
happened around them.
And I think I've come to believe that that's the case.

166
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:15.890
And um,

167
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.300
<v 1>yeah,</v>

168
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.220
<v 2>well certainly the story that you read,</v>

169
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:26.050
the person who was written about the rapist was making all sorts of individual

170
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:28.730
choices.
Right.
And you know,

171
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.780
he might've been convincing himself that he was on some kind of holy mission
man,

172
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.950
but I guess that would be in part so that he could stand looking at,

173
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.760
at himself in the mirror in the morning without running away screaming if he saw

174
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.040
what was really there.
So.

175
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.470
<v 0>Well,</v>

176
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.470
one of the things in in Frankel that kind of in a man's search for meaning that

177
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:57.280
definitely two points that really hit me hard when I was reading it was,

178
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:01.060
one is I,
I didn't understand the extent to which the Kappos,

179
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.870
which were the Jewish prisoners that got taken on board to help and would,

180
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.840
would get special treatment.
Number one,

181
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:10.300
I didn't realize the extent to which they were in existence.

182
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:12.910
I knew that I knew what they were,
but I didn't realize that they were,

183
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.530
they were as aggressive as they were.
And the other thing that hit me is,

184
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.010
is the the paragraph or the lines where he's saying that

185
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.230
the best of us didn't make it out and that if you were going to live,

186
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:32.560
you had to do things that you wouldn't want to maybe do.

187
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:37.270
And maybe if you were a a better person,
maybe you wouldn't do them.

188
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.300
And to me that was harsh.
I mean,

189
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:45.301
this was his admitting that that if you wanted to survive as a person in that

190
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.620
situation,
you might have to take someone's piece of bread,

191
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.270
you might have to move a number on a list to get someone else sent down to the

192
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.860
down to the,
uh,
execution area a day earlier than you.

193
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:03.550
And that happens to postpone your execution long enough that you can make

194
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.430
another move.
And that's a scary thing.

195
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.180
<v 2>Yo,</v>

196
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.780
you saw the same thing with social Knutson's description of the gulags because

197
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:12.820
they were running in large part by the inmates.

198
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.390
But I think that that's a really good metaphor for totalitarian states in

199
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:17.051
general.
You know,

200
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:21.400
because we like to think that a totalitarian state is made up of innocent,

201
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:25.440
oppressed individuals who are under the thumb of a,
uh,

202
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.450
an evil tyrant and that all of the catastrophes are cascading from the top down.

203
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:32.020
But I don't think that that's true.

204
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:36.190
I think that it's more like a holographic structure where the tyranny exists at

205
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:37.150
every single level.

206
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:41.140
So it exists psychologically and it exists within the family and it exists

207
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:45.460
within the mid level organizations.
And so,
well,
you know,

208
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:47.200
when eastern Germany for example,

209
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.810
one out of every three people was a government informer.

210
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.350
So what meant is if you had a family of six people that two of them you couldn't

211
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.880
trust and you can't,

212
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.980
you can't just say that that's a consequence of the top down structure at

213
00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:03.140
tyranny is something that exists everywhere simultaneously.
Once it,

214
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.730
once it gets a grip and it's easy for people to say things like,
well,

215
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.520
I was just following orders and you know,
I'm not,

216
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.890
I'm not trying to put myself in a position where I'm claiming that if I was in

217
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.620
that position,
I wouldn't have followed orders in the same way.
I mean,

218
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:22.640
God only knows till you get there.
Right.
That's for sure.
But,

219
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.190
but what that did to me was focused my attention more and more on,
on,

220
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.310
uh,
the necessity of individual responsibility.

221
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:34.910
I thought if it was individuals in the final analysis who were responsible for

222
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:36.800
the great evils of the 20th century,

223
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.130
which I think is a reasonable way of conceptualizing it,

224
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:44.900
then it might be individuals who could be responsible for whatever good there

225
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:49.670
might be in mankind that could help us avoid those situations in the future.

226
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.470
And I thought of that as a alternative in some sense too.

227
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.160
Nihilistic,
disbelief and ideological possession,
you know,

228
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.410
cause if your group identity is too tight,

229
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:04.910
then you start acting like they like the uh,
like,
like uh,

230
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.940
like a cog in a mob,
not a very bad thing.

231
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.340
But then if your group identity disappears completely,

232
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:14.360
well then you're left alone and bereft.
And so those are bad alternatives,
right?

233
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.840
You're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't.
And it,
it was,

234
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.890
it was very difficult to understand that there might be a third path between

235
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.950
those two.
I couldn't see the,
the existence of anything.

236
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.760
Cause people need belief systems in order to exist,
right.

237
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:33.230
To maintain psychological stability and to main maintain sociological stability

238
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.064
as well.

239
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:39.020
But then if the beliefs get too rigid and they turn into a raging totalitarian

240
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:42.920
mob,
so maybe you let that go because you don't want to play that game,

241
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:46.190
but then you dissolve because you have no identity.
That's not,

242
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.700
that's not acceptable either.
When I first laid that out,

243
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.440
that clearly it was really hard on me because I couldn't see a third path to

244
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:59.210
that.
But then I started to realize,
and this was a consequence all of reading,

245
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.890
the sorts of things that we already talked about,

246
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:05.210
but also I'm starting to understand the underlying structure of mythology and

247
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.330
what the heroic path meant essentially.

248
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:13.190
And that meant adoption of supreme moral responsibility as an individual.

249
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.670
Now there's,
there's this,
there's this idea in the new testament,

250
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:19.060
which is a really interesting idea.
You know,
it's,

251
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.450
it's one of these bottomless ideas and I mean that literally you could study it

252
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:25.040
forever and never get to the bottom of it.

253
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:30.490
And the idea is that Christ is the person who takes the sins of mankind on

254
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:33.470
himself and there's something redemptive about that.

255
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:38.330
And that's actually a really dark idea because what it means as far as I can

256
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:40.610
tell what it means,
at least what it means psychologically,

257
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:43.220
is that when you read these terrible things,

258
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.190
you have to understand that you're reading about you.

259
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.650
If you don't understand that you're reading about you,

260
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:52.080
then you don't actually understand the stories,
you know,
because you,

261
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.620
you put yourself in the position where you're automatically the good person who

262
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:59.130
would never do anything like that.
And then these other people are,
well,

263
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:01.270
they're devils in some sense,
right?
And,

264
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.990
and it's very easy for people to make that division,

265
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.400
but it's a horrific realization when you think that the devil that you see

266
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:10.260
outside is the same thing that's inside.

267
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.350
And that you don't know until you're put in a situation like that what you might

268
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:17.070
do.
And then it's even worse because if you look at the historical evidence,

269
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.830
you know,
um,
it's,

270
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.890
it was ordinary people in some sense that produced the catastrophes of Nazi

271
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:29.130
Germany and the Soviet Union and Maoist China.
I mean,

272
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.690
they might not have originated it,

273
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.520
but they certainly had the option to say no at different parts,

274
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.970
different steps along the way.
And they didn't,
you know,

275
00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:42.060
and these things do happen.
One horrible thing at a time.

276
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:45.630
There's this great book called ordinary men,
um,
which,

277
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.580
which describes the descent of,

278
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.470
of a German police force from ordinary Bursch wall,
middle class men,

279
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:57.270
essentially just ordinary policemen who actually were raised before the Hitler

280
00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:01.110
youth.
They weren't indoctrinated,
you know,
as young people.
Um,

281
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.363
and they were,

282
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.150
they were brought into Poland to sort of mock pop after the Germans had walked

283
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:06.930
through.

284
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.040
And it describes how they descended into the sort of people who would take naked

285
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.210
women out,
naked,
pregnant,

286
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.150
pregnant women out into the middle of fields and shoot them in the back of the

287
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:19.440
head.
And what's horrifying about the book is that the author,

288
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.460
um,
Browning,
uh,
details,

289
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.020
the stages by which this occurred and it's,
it's all,

290
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:28.860
for example,

291
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.040
the commander of this unit told the men that they were going to have to do

292
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.770
terrible things,
but that they could go home if they wanted to.

293
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.070
And then you think,
well,
there is a,
there's an out.
But,

294
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.990
but then if you really think about it,
you think,

295
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:47.991
well there are a tight tightly knit cause I military organization and one of the

296
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:51.780
natural thoughts under that circumstance would be,
well,

297
00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:55.230
I'm not going to leave my comrades to do all the dirty work.

298
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:58.350
That would just be a matter of cowardice.
And so you can see that,

299
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.920
you know that there's an ethical requirement that would keep you there to begin

300
00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:05.580
with.
And then they were doing what you just said,

301
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.870
which is taking the burden of this sinful activity on yourself.

302
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:12.870
If you let everyone else do it,
then you're not,
you're not acting heroically.

303
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:17.400
Well.
Right.
And,
and so it was easy for the men to get entrapped into that.

304
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:18.600
And then,
you know,

305
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.680
the requirements for their horrific action kept ramping up.

306
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.400
And like each time the accepted the requirement of doing one horrific thing,

307
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.450
the probability that they would accept the next requirement increased.

308
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.390
And what is also really interesting about that book,
uh,

309
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.080
ordinary men is that it's not like these men didn't suffer.

310
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.560
Like they were suffering terribly.
They were physically ill,
they were vomiting,

311
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.890
they were,
they were tearing themselves apart psychologically,
you know,

312
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:47.010
but they didn't quit.
So that's a,

313
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.210
that's a great book because if you want to know how you walk down,
the,

314
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.210
how you,
how you can be enticed to walk down a terrible path.

315
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:56.350
That's the book to read.

316
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.360
And it's very frightening because if you read it properly,
then you know,

317
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.260
you have to read it again,
as I said,

318
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:06.400
is if you're one of the people to whom this is happening and not the victim but

319
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.660
the oppressor,
you know,
and I mean,
you can also read it as the victim.

320
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:11.800
That's fair enough.
But,

321
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.930
but it's ordinary people who participate in these things and that's a very,

322
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:18.190
very terrifying thought.

323
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.750
<v 0>We actually covered that book on this podcast.
Both of them.
Yeah.</v>

324
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.550
Both Viktor Frankl and,
and uh,
ordinary man,
Huh?
Yeah.
Um,

325
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.810
it's interesting because I,
as I as I,
you know,

326
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:34.980
I've watched all your stuff read and one of the things that I was thinking about

327
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.790
is,
you know,
you talk about where the,
the,
the hero comes from,

328
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:43.791
where this idea comes from and how we ended up looking at these types of people

329
00:21:43.981 --> 00:21:44.671
as they're good.

330
00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:48.330
And it happens over ages and ages and generations and generations of saying,

331
00:21:48.331 --> 00:21:49.980
well that's a good quality and that's a good quality.

332
00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:53.310
And there's these 10 people that are all considered good people and they all

333
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:55.110
have this couple of qualities in common.

334
00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:59.220
So those are good qualities and eventually that becomes elevated to the point

335
00:21:59.221 --> 00:22:03.290
where we say that's a hero.
And when I was thinking of until that,

336
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.111
so that's what happens.

337
00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:07.890
And now we all have this elevated thing to look at and say that's something we

338
00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:10.320
could aspire to.
That's where we want to go.
That's where we wanna be.

339
00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:13.890
We wanna we want to help and we want to support who we want to make sacrifices

340
00:22:13.891 --> 00:22:14.724
for the tribe.

341
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.360
<v 2>W W W how do we end up?</v>

342
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.390
Or who ends up saying I see something evil and I'm going to follow in that

343
00:22:23.721 --> 00:22:25.160
direction?
Well,

344
00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:30.161
I think that that the story of Cain and Abel is really very tightly constructed

345
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.120
representation of,
of that process because I mean,
it's,
it's,

346
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.810
it's a very strange story because,
well,
for a variety of reasons,
first of all,

347
00:22:38.811 --> 00:22:40.760
it's very ancient.
Second of all,

348
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:45.761
it's the first story about human beings mythologically speaking within the Judeo

349
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.730
Christian Canon,
let's say,
because Adam and eve aren't real people,
right?

350
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:51.530
Because they are formed by God.

351
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.550
Cain enabled are the first people and they're a pair of hostile brothers.

352
00:22:55.551 --> 00:23:00.551
And so the first thing that says is that sibling tension within families is a

353
00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:03.410
universal truth.
And that can get murderous.

354
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.830
And if you don't know that and you can't see that,

355
00:23:06.831 --> 00:23:09.860
then you're not watching your children carefully enough.
So,

356
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:14.270
because what siblings can torment each other too,
to a great degree.

357
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.300
And it's something that you should strive diligently to observe and to quail.

358
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.660
Um,
but then there's this,

359
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.300
the next part of it that's so interesting is the idea of sacrifices is

360
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.330
introduced and that it took me a long time to understand what sacrifice meant,

361
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.240
um,
because on the surface of it,
especially the way it's acted out,

362
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.720
like burnt offerings and that sort of thing,
it just seems like,
well,

363
00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:42.890
it seems so archaic and distant from us that it's not really comprehensible.

364
00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:47.240
But partly from reading John,
I started and Nicha for that matter,

365
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:50.810
I started to understand that people often acted out conceptions before they

366
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:52.610
understood what they meant.
You know,

367
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:55.730
and we act out a lot of things we don't understand because we're much more

368
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:57.770
complex than we can represent.

369
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.930
So we're always acting out things we don't understand.

370
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.470
But so there's this idea in Cain and Abel that you have to make sacrifices in

371
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:10.600
order to stay on the good side of God.
And so I thought about that.
Um,

372
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.270
practically say,
not so much metaphysically but practically,

373
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:18.440
and realized that that was equivalent to the discovery of time of the future.

374
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.410
Because we do,
we do act and it,

375
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.020
and this is a peculiar discovery of human beings.

376
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:27.440
Maybe a consequence of our expanded intelligence is that we're actually aware of

377
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:31.160
the future and we actually treat the future as if it's something that you can

378
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:32.330
bargain with.
Now,

379
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:36.650
partly it's because the future is other people and they remember your
reputation,

380
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:39.740
they remember your past actions.
And if you do someone a favor,

381
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:43.280
then that favor is in some sense stored up in the future.

382
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.420
So you can think about the future as a place of judgment about your moral

383
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:47.990
actions.

384
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.610
And it's not that far from that to imagining a god who's keeping track of that

385
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:55.460
or who even is that.
But in any case,

386
00:24:55.461 --> 00:25:00.461
the idea of sacrifice emerges in the story of Cain and Abel and Cain and Abel

387
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:05.540
both make sacrifices to God.
And in order to stay on his good side,
let's say.

388
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.980
And what a sacrifice means is that you give up something of value in the present

389
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.540
so that you can be so that you can improve the future.
And you know,

390
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:18.350
that's no different from what we call discipline.
It's exactly the same thing.

391
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.610
It's just that concretely acted out version of that.
And so,
you know,

392
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:27.611
the idea basically was that well God was in the transcendent heavens and,

393
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.540
and the first question would be,
well,
why is that when it's like,
well,

394
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.020
if you go out and I'm really dark night and look up at the sky,

395
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.880
you have a sense of what's beyond you,
what,
what's transcendent,
what's infinite?

396
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:41.960
And,

397
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.790
and so to associate that with the highest of values is a reasonable association,

398
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:49.370
right?
From,
from a say,
from an emotional point of view.

399
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.030
So it's not particularly primitive.
It's a smart,
um,

400
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:58.010
metaphor or it's a smart intuition that,
that,
and it's above you.

401
00:25:58.011 --> 00:25:58.461
And you know,

402
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:01.670
we tend to think of when you're moving towards an ideal that you're moving up,

403
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:04.220
that you're moving above,
you're moving to the mountain top,
right?
You're,

404
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:05.750
you're going up,
not down.

405
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.230
And so it all sits within that same framework.

406
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:11.600
And it's partly because when you go up,
like on a mountain,

407
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:14.300
you can see for long distances,
right?
So those,

408
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.180
all those things are tangled together.
So anyways,

409
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.490
so the idea is that you have to give up something of value now so you so that

410
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:23.810
you make the future better.

411
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.040
And sometimes it's even something you love now and not,

412
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.480
that's a good example too,

413
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:33.050
because often the things that stop us from moving forward,
our,

414
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:37.370
our attachments to things that we should no longer be attached to.
Right?

415
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.450
And in fact,

416
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.830
you can almost make that definitional if you're not moving forward in your life.

417
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:47.310
There's a high probability that you have some idea or some mode of action or

418
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:52.020
some habit that you're so in love with that you won't let go of it.
So,

419
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.930
all right,
so Cain and Abel Cain enabled make sacrifices.

420
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:59.931
And there's kind of a hint in the story that it's just a hint that cane

421
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:05.010
sacrifices,
they're sort of second rate.
But in any case,
it's ambivalent tape.
But,

422
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.990
but Abel,
he just does wonderfully well and everything works out for him.

423
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.090
And everyone knows people like that,
you know?

424
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.400
And so God accepts his sacrifices.
But for some reason he rejects canes.

425
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.970
And maybe it's the arbitrary ness of God or maybe it's cause Cains heart isn't

426
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:26.610
in the right place when he's making his sacrifices,
which is more likely.

427
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.410
And so cane goes and has a chat with God and he says basically what he says is

428
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.244
something like,

429
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.990
how in the world can you possibly justify this universe that you created?

430
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.250
You look at me and I'm breaking myself and half trying to adapt and to make

431
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:43.920
things right and it's not working.

432
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.990
And then there's this able character and things come easy to him and everything

433
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:51.870
is flourishing for him.
And so like what the hell?

434
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.320
And if you don't understand that question,

435
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.630
then you're not thinking because it's very,

436
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:02.631
very frequently the case when a serious catastrophe besets you in life that you

437
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:06.060
essentially ask exactly that question.
What's the meaning of life?

438
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:08.790
What's the purpose of the world?
How come they're suffering?

439
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.750
And it's easy to become resentful and vengeful as a consequence of that.

440
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:17.751
And so you got to think about what state of mind having your sacrifices rejected

441
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:19.051
puts you in,

442
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:22.260
especially when you see someone who's successful because that's where the

443
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.440
jealousy and resentment starts to starts to what faster is probably the right

444
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:29.544
word.

445
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.320
And so God says to Cain exactly what he doesn't want to hear,
which is,

446
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.020
well,
yeah,
okay,

447
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:40.530
but you have made lots of mistakes in your life.

448
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:45.510
So he basically says sin is at your door like a predatory and sexually aroused

449
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:46.021
animal,

450
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:49.530
and you've invited it into your house to have its way with you and produce

451
00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:53.850
something creative as a consequence.
So he was used as sexual metaphor,
you know,

452
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.680
and so that you've willingly gone down the negative path and you've allowed that

453
00:28:58.681 --> 00:28:59.630
to enter into you and,

454
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.470
and to operate in a creative manner and you've spun off all these terrible

455
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:07.650
thoughts and,
and this justification for not acting properly.

456
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.750
And that's why things aren't going well for you.

457
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:11.640
And so don't lay that at my feet,

458
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.360
which is the most brutal possible message he could have got.

459
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.650
And so then he leaves the presence of God,
let's say.

460
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.770
And it says in the story that his countenance fell,

461
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:25.440
which meant he was basically enraged.
And so what does he do?

462
00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:28.650
He goes out and kills Abel.
And then that's,

463
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.390
that's a very fascinating idea because Abel is his ideal.

464
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.930
So it kills is ideal and when you kill your ideal,
you're lost.

465
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.340
And then he does that to take revenge on Abel but also to take revenge on God,

466
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:46.000
which I think is extremely interesting.
And,
and a deep,
deep idea.

467
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.850
Like these kids who shoot up high schools for example,

468
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.740
you cannot understand what they're doing unless you understand the story of Cain

469
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:54.101
and Abel.

470
00:29:54.101 --> 00:29:59.101
You cannot understand what possesses them until you can understand that someone,

471
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.750
even someone who doesn't believe it doesn't matter.

472
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:05.680
It's the psychological state of mind that matters is they're out for revenge on

473
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.700
being itself.

474
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.630
And that's why they produce as much mayhem as possible in the shortest period of

475
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:11.380
time.

476
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.380
That's why they sacrifice an innocent people because it's much more vengeful

477
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.900
and,
and demonstrative to kill innocent people then to kill guilty people,
right?

478
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.890
Cause it's a worse sin,
so to speak.
And then they killed themselves.

479
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.360
And they killed themselves as a final demonstration of their belief in the,

480
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.050
in nihilism and the horror of existence.
Because you might say,
well,

481
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:38.410
why don't they just kill themselves first and save everyone the trouble?

482
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.720
You know?
And there's narcissism in not too,

483
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:43.440
because they know their names are going to be splashed across the page.

484
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.050
That's their notoriety instead of their accomplishment.
And of course,

485
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:50.080
the media is unbelievably complicit in that.
Um,

486
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:55.420
but well,
so when you're talking about motivation for evil,

487
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:58.690
then you have to understand what it is that's driving it.

488
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:03.691
And it is a deep resentment about the structure of being for being what

489
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:07.030
saturated with suffering,
but also for rejecting.

490
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.390
You're rejecting your sacrifices and that,
you know,

491
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:14.800
that produces the bitterness of failure.
And I'll stop with this.

492
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.280
One of the things that's really interesting about the old testament is that,

493
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.800
and the Jews in the Old Testament is that they don't take the path of cane every

494
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:28.420
time they're walloped by God,
which is like fairly frequently.
They say,

495
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.430
we must have done something wrong and we have to set herself right.
And that's,

496
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:33.970
uh,

497
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.970
an unbelievably heroic attitude because that's the alternative cursing fate.

498
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.080
It's like you take the responsibility for failure onto yourself and you think,

499
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:48.340
well,
if I was just,
maybe if I just had my act together a little bit more,

500
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.880
if I took advantage of every opportunity that was put in front of me,

501
00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:53.560
if I wasn't resentful and bitter,

502
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.240
then I could have done something that would have tilted the situation in a

503
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:01.240
different direction.
And like that's almost inevitably true.

504
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.170
<v 0>Well,
it's interesting and again,</v>

505
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:07.580
this is kind of where when I would hear you say things like that.
So as you know,

506
00:32:07.581 --> 00:32:10.970
I wrote a book called extreme ownership that the opening chapter of the book is

507
00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:14.900
a horrible situation with a fratricide happens on the battlefield.

508
00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:19.190
So friendly forces,
killing friendly forces,
some of those forces being mine.

509
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.050
And you know,

510
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:25.940
it's all these people I could blame and all these little incidents that happened

511
00:32:25.941 --> 00:32:26.870
that I could have said,
well,
you know,

512
00:32:26.871 --> 00:32:31.130
we had this radio cryptographic change that happened in the middle of operation

513
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.290
and it had people weren't able to talk to each other.

514
00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:36.920
And we had these Iraqis that we didn't speak English and we had these units that

515
00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.890
we hadn't worked with before and they did things we didn't expect.

516
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.380
And there's plenty of blame to go around.
And,

517
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.300
and essentially I said,
hey,
you know who's fault this is,
this is my fault.

518
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:50.900
I'm the commander.
And so when I hear you say things like that,

519
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.140
it strikes me that you uncovered this through your study of history and,

520
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.420
and philosophy and religion.
And I learned it,
you know,

521
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.930
as like I said,
a certified knuckle dragger out on the battlefield that realized,

522
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.300
you know,
if you're going to exist as a leader and as a human,

523
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.850
then you need to take responsibility for what happens around you.

524
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.940
And that's again to

525
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.100
<v 2>take,
well now the religious notion in some senses that you have to take ultimate</v>

526
00:33:20.101 --> 00:33:24.270
responsibility.
And that in some sense,
the things that happen around you,

527
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.643
I mean this is

528
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.560
Dostoyevsky I think said something like every man is responsible for everything

529
00:33:31.561 --> 00:33:35.280
that happens to him and everything that happens to everyone else.
And that's,

530
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.960
you know,
that,
that's,
that's,
it's a crazy statement,
right?
It's a crazy statement.

531
00:33:39.961 --> 00:33:43.770
And he was a pretty extreme person in many,
many ways.

532
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.960
But there's a level at which that's metaphysically true,
you know,

533
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.610
because what happens is that it's,

534
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:55.110
it's failure to act often that's the most catastrophic,
you know,

535
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.550
I mean it's,
it's,
it's to not do the right thing when the,

536
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:04.410
when the situation presents itself and it's very specific.

537
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.281
You know,

538
00:34:05.281 --> 00:34:10.140
you're constantly in situations where you could do the right thing.

539
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:15.170
If you are willing to take a risk that's actually a relatively moderate size and

540
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:19.650
you know that you could take the risk and you know that you should take the risk

541
00:34:19.651 --> 00:34:22.800
and you don't.
And that happens to people all the time.

542
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.240
And then what happens is the thing that they didn't oppose grows a little bit

543
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.130
and they shrink a little bit and that starts a loop pay.
And so,

544
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:37.020
and you say,
well,
how do you take responsibility for the world?
And the answer is,

545
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:37.201
well,

546
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:40.380
you also have to do it with a certain degree of humility because what do you

547
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:41.220
know?
You know,

548
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.590
and this is part of the reason that I'm so opposed to the activist culture on,

549
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.620
on college campuses.

550
00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:51.540
You don't teach 18 year olds to go and demonstrate about capitalism,
you know,

551
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:53.310
because they don't know anything.

552
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:56.820
And they have problems in their own life that needed to be solved that are
local.

553
00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.900
And the local problems aren't trivial.
You know,
they're not disciplined.

554
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.080
They're there.
They're not looking at the world in a straight way.

555
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.010
They're not taking responsibility for themselves or for their actions,

556
00:35:08.011 --> 00:35:09.840
their sexual actions among others.

557
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.480
They're not taking responsibility for their family.

558
00:35:12.481 --> 00:35:14.880
They're not looking at how they could contribute to the community.

559
00:35:14.881 --> 00:35:17.310
They don't understand the fact that they don't know anything.

560
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:22.790
And so they should be taught to start locally and to put things together that

561
00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:24.720
they could put together,
you know,

562
00:35:24.721 --> 00:35:28.800
to make their bed and to clean up the room and to attend their classes with

563
00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:32.040
regularity if they're going to university because that's part of the implicit

564
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:36.630
contract and to straighten up the things around them that are actually within

565
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:40.500
their to straighten up.
And then what happens is that if you do that,

566
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.510
let's say religiously,

567
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.450
which I suppose would be the same as in a discipline manner,

568
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:50.700
that your realm of influence starts to grow,
but it grows in a positive way.

569
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:52.980
Just like you can go,
you can take,

570
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.690
you can end up in hell one step at a time and that's extraordinarily well

571
00:35:57.691 --> 00:35:58.524
documented.

572
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.650
You can end up at the opposite place of that one step at a time.

573
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:05.970
But it's also that same gradual process.

574
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:09.030
You don't get to leap from being a 17 year old,

575
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:13.320
not head who doesn't know anything and who isn't disciplined to the critic of

576
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:17.070
Judeo Christian society.
You just don't know enough to do that.

577
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.460
Especially when you can look at your own life and think about how many things

578
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:23.610
that you're doing that you know are wrong,
that you could fix,

579
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:28.110
that you aren't fixing.
And that's the crucial thing.
It's,
it's this isn't this,

580
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:32.010
this mode of thinking isn't asking people to stretch themselves beyond what

581
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:32.910
they're capable of.

582
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.350
It's just asking them to stretch themselves to the point that they are capable

583
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:40.890
of and seeing what happens.
And that works.
It works.

584
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.510
I've had many people write me over the last year and this is a great thing,

585
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.650
really.
It's a great thing.
Who said that they stopped,
started to tell the truth,

586
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:52.620
or at least not to lie,
because who can tell the truth?
Right?

587
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.330
But at least you can not lie.

588
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.410
And that they started to put things in order around them that they could put an

589
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:02.010
order in that,
you know,
the positive things just started to happen,

590
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:05.910
like mad and they're not nihilistic and they've got a purpose in their life.

591
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:09.480
And so,
you know,
thank God for that.
And it does work.

592
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:14.810
So I was trying to think of how to stop the loop of my sacrifices have been

593
00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:17.340
rejected.
And,

594
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:21.550
and the way that you stop that loop is instead of saying the sack,

595
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.290
my sacrifices were rejected.
So my hard work,
my effort,

596
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.820
my everything that I'm doing to try and move forward,
it's not working.
And,

597
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.160
and if you want to go towards hell,
you keep saying,
well,
it's,

598
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.950
it's not working,
but it's,
but it's because of everyone else.
It's,

599
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.840
they're rejecting me.
They're not accepting what I've done.

600
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.250
Whereas if you say to yourself,
oh,
it didn't work,
okay,
it's my fault.

601
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.220
What can I do better?
And that's how you start moving in the other direction,

602
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.310
which is,
yeah,
well,
at least you have control.
And you know,

603
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.670
you don't even necessarily have to think it's your fault,
although that's,

604
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.800
that's a reasonable way of looking at it.
You could,

605
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.760
you could minimally just accept the fact that it's your responsibility.

606
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.200
You're stuck with it,
and you could actually change it.
And once you know too,

607
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:08.110
that if you're failing repeatedly,
um,

608
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.070
then there's probably something wrong.

609
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.920
It's possible that there's something wrong with the way that you're

610
00:38:13.921 --> 00:38:16.590
conceptualizing the world.
Cause you have a choice,
right?
If,

611
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.220
if you keep making sacrifices and they don't work,

612
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.380
there's a binary choice and one is,

613
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:26.310
well there's something wrong with the structure of reality.

614
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.850
And the other is there's something wrong with your approach.

615
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.420
And so then you might say,
well let's take the first idea.

616
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:35.410
There's something wrong with the structure of reality.

617
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.540
It's like you're really going to say that are you?

618
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.890
He really gonna come out and say,
I know enough to judge the nature of being.

619
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.140
And then the alternative is also quite frightening because then you know you,

620
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.700
it's you that's making the mistakes.

621
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.590
And you might be wrong at a really deep level.

622
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:55.210
And that might mean that a lot of you has to burn off and be transformed.

623
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.810
Maybe even things about yourself that you think are admirable than that you like

624
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:01.090
because your position,
you know,
you're yourself.

625
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.470
Conceptualization is so warped and wrong and that's really daunting.

626
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.190
But you know when people set themselves up as the judge of being,

627
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.740
I mean I've written about this a fair bit in my new book,

628
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:13.870
which is called 12 rules for life.

629
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.930
When people set themselves up as the judge of being,

630
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:21.520
then they take on what can only be described as a kind of satanic arrogance

631
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:26.790
because they've actually taken to themselves the moral right to criticize the

632
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:28.780
structure of existence itself.

633
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.260
It's like you better be careful when you do something like that because you're

634
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:36.970
setting yourself up as the judge of being in the Columbine kids did that.

635
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Like if you read what they wrote,
it's,

636
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.380
that's exactly what happened and that's exactly what they say is that I've taken

637
00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:48.400
onto myself the task of the judge of being unfounded wanting and so I'm going to

638
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:53.320
cause as much mayhem as I possibly can before I,
you know,
before I depart.

639
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.310
And that's a very common story among people who do that sort of thing.
It's,

640
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.030
and it's so interesting because every time something like that happens,

641
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.000
people go,
well,
we don't understand.
It's like,
no,

642
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.540
you won't understand because they write about what they're doing.

643
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:09.130
They tell you why they're doing it,

644
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.780
but it's so it cuts too close to the bone for people.
And so they think,
well,

645
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.830
we don't understand how that can happen.
You know,
like there was a while back,

646
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:21.220
I think it was in Connecticut where there a bunch of elementary school kids
shot,

647
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:21.700
right?

648
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.020
Because this is kind of a one upmanship game and it's bad enough to shoot high

649
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:26.621
school kids,

650
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:29.740
but it's even worse to shoot kindergarten and elementary kids because they are

651
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:33.160
even clearly more innocent.
It's like,
well that's,

652
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.880
that's part of that vengeful spirit,
you know,

653
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.320
better to punish the innocent and the guilty.

654
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:40.270
If you're trying to make a statement about your,

655
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.660
your hatred for the structure of reality and these things,

656
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:45.910
you have to understand these things really,

657
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:49.720
you have to understand the matter religious level of analysis because there's
no,

658
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.260
well,

659
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.700
that's what happens when you encounter evil is that you're in to the domain that

660
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:58.660
can only be described by religious ideation.
And I,
I don't say that lightly.

661
00:40:58.661 --> 00:40:58.841
You know,

662
00:40:58.841 --> 00:41:02.820
I'd had many veterans come to talk to me now and there are people who had post

663
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.940
traumatic stress disorder and they've said that listening to my lectures has

664
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:10.420
helped them out a lot because it's provided them with a Philips philosophy of

665
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:13.300
good and evil.
And if you have post traumatic stress disorder,

666
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:16.720
you need a sophisticated philosophy of good and evil because otherwise you don't

667
00:41:16.721 --> 00:41:20.680
have any place to put your experiences and that fragments and shatters you.
It's,

668
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:21.723
it's no,

669
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.940
it's no trivial matter to be touched by malevolence or to have it manifest

670
00:41:27.581 --> 00:41:31.810
itself within you unexpectedly.
You know,
it,
it,
it,
it,
it,

671
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.600
it's physiologically destructive.
It,

672
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:39.620
it shatters people and you have to move from a naive interpretation of the world

673
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:44.210
to a very deep interpretation of the world if you're ever going to dig yourself

674
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.140
out of that hole.

675
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.530
<v 0>No,
that's,
that's interesting.
In one of the,</v>

676
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.440
one of the things that I was going to tell you or ask you about,

677
00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:53.080
so when I was a kid,

678
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.560
I wanted to be a commando.

679
00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.100
Like I don't really remember wanting to do anything else.

680
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:04.120
When I realized that there was that role that you could play in life.

681
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.950
That's what I wanted to do.
And,

682
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.630
and a lot of my friends in the seal teams were the same way.

683
00:42:10.631 --> 00:42:13.750
That's what they wanted to do.
And as soon as they figured out like,
oh that's,

684
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:14.680
that exists,
oh,

685
00:42:14.681 --> 00:42:17.950
I can do that and I just have to sign this piece of paper and go do this stuff

686
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:19.300
and then that's what I'll be.

687
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.170
<v 2>Where does that come from?
Well,</v>

688
00:42:25.171 --> 00:42:30.060
I mean that,
that's a very good question.
I mean,
I would say it's temperamental.

689
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.540
You know,
people differ tremendously in their temperaments.

690
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:37.470
And to think that there's a warrior temperament is a perfectly reasonable thing

691
00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:39.780
to think.
I mean,
there's been whole cultures,
many,

692
00:42:39.781 --> 00:42:44.230
many cultures who are devoted to fostering that warrior mentality.
You know,

693
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.770
where if you weren't like that you were the outlier.

694
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:51.120
I would say that's probably true of most human cultures across most of time.

695
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.800
You know,
we've been fortunate enough to live in relatively peaceful times,

696
00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:59.460
at least the vast majority of us.
So the necessity for that,

697
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:05.250
like right at the edges of actual warfare is much less than it might be under

698
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.630
other historical circumstances.
But,
but it's,
it's,

699
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.440
it's a deep part of,
of,
of many people's nature.

700
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.300
And so the question is what do you do with that?
Right.
And I mean,

701
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:23.100
one alternative potential potentially is criminal behavior.
And you know,

702
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:27.840
the fact that so many people like watching movies about bad guys,

703
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.500
you know,
is an indication of how attractive that is to people.

704
00:43:31.501 --> 00:43:33.020
And I think the reason for that is,

705
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:37.680
is that while Nietzsche observed at one point that most of what people regard as

706
00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:39.330
morality is just cowardice.

707
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:43.260
And what he meant by that was that people don't do bad things,

708
00:43:43.261 --> 00:43:46.740
not because they're good,
but because they're afraid to do the bad things.

709
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.280
And then when they see people do the bad things that are actually really deeply

710
00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:51.360
attracted by that,

711
00:43:51.361 --> 00:43:54.930
because it speaks to part of them that could go beyond the rules.

712
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.530
And that's actually a necessary part.
It's a really necessary part.

713
00:43:58.531 --> 00:44:02.640
Like you don't make men safe by making them weak.
In fact,

714
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.520
they're much more dangerous when they're weak because they'll stab you in the

715
00:44:05.521 --> 00:44:08.910
back when they get the chance or take advantage of you when you,

716
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.460
when they get the chance you make men safe,

717
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:16.090
let's say by making them strong and then by making sure that they're

718
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.450
disciplined.
And so,
you know,

719
00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:23.451
you've got people like you've got this let's say warrior mentality.

720
00:44:23.551 --> 00:44:25.440
That's a deep part of their temperament.

721
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.380
And then you have some choices about what you might do with that.

722
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:33.030
You might try to discipline it and bring it under control and integrated into

723
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:37.770
your character in which it then it can make you someone who stalwart and

724
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:41.010
indomitable and,
and who will move forward,
you know,

725
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.620
in the face of tremendous risk.

726
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.170
And while that's the optimal,

727
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:51.080
that's the optimal pathway,
if you have that kind of temperament.
I,

728
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.910
and I,
I think like it's the men that have the most,

729
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.770
what would you call it?
It's not aggressive exactly.
But we'll,
we'll,

730
00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:01.270
we'll leave it at that aggressive and fearless temperaments.

731
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:05.980
That can be the best man,
but it's like having a very powerful dog.

732
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:07.780
You better civil,

733
00:45:07.781 --> 00:45:10.720
you better discipline it because otherwise it's going to be a monster.

734
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.450
<v 0>Yeah,
well I had the F I was a rebellious kid,
right.</v>

735
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.770
And I could have easily gone down the path of crime.

736
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:25.580
And as a matter of fact,
many of my friends that I,
you know,

737
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.870
left when they stayed in the house at home,

738
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:33.260
they did end up as criminals and having big trouble with the law or going down

739
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:37.680
even paths of drugs and everything else that you can get into.
But,

740
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.090
but when we were kids or younger,
everyone kind of had the same thing.

741
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.740
But like you said,
I kind of,

742
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.120
I so lucky because I just signed that piece of paper and I,

743
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:52.980
and I saw that I could do something and I could take all that aggression in all

744
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:54.510
that energy.

745
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.780
I could do something that was good and positive.
And,

746
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.580
and we joke about that in the seal teams that many guys,
you,
you,

747
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:04.830
you actually to be a good seal,
you sort of,

748
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.110
you sort of have this criminal mindset that you've,

749
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:14.120
you've somehow harnessed and you keep under control most of the time.
Yup.

750
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.550
And occasionally it does get out of hand and we got guys that get in trouble and

751
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.620
that happens.
And if we,

752
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.650
if we only took guys that would never get in trouble,

753
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.080
we wouldn't have any one in the ranks really well.
Well you

754
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.240
<v 2>also see too in the classic hero stories,</v>

755
00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:30.310
I mean you see this with Harry Potter for example,

756
00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:34.690
which I'm making reference to because it was such a phenomenon.
I mean,
when,

757
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:39.780
when when something makes a welfare mother richer than the queen of England,

758
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:44.750
you shouldn't take note,
right?
When,
when kids are reading 500 page books and,

759
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.470
and,
and standing in line waiting for the next one.

760
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.840
And when you produce a whole movie empire around something,

761
00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.550
you should take note of that.
Well,

762
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:56.200
Harry Potter's little team aren't the delinquents,
right,

763
00:46:56.201 --> 00:46:58.930
who have no discipline,
but they're also not the good kids.

764
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.440
They're the kids who will break rules when necessary.
And that's,

765
00:47:02.441 --> 00:47:06.670
that's the issue.
Break rules when necessary.

766
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.220
Now the question is,
when is that necessary?
Well,

767
00:47:09.221 --> 00:47:13.960
that's sort of the ultimate ultimate ethical choice.
But you know,

768
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:17.530
your,
why did that work for you?
Do you think?
You know,

769
00:47:17.531 --> 00:47:21.100
like what,
why was it,
well,
two questions.

770
00:47:21.101 --> 00:47:26.101
One would be why did you decide to step into a discipline structure be,

771
00:47:28.091 --> 00:47:31.150
I mean that's obviously difficult and why do you think you did that?

772
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:35.170
And some of the other kids that you knew that were like,
you didn't,

773
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.380
<v 0>it was really one of the most rebellious things that I could do was to join the</v>

774
00:47:43.281 --> 00:47:45.860
military.
So I come from a small new England town.

775
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.850
People get done with high school,
they go to college,
they get a job as whatever.

776
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.420
People get jobs as they follow that very normal path.

777
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.420
And I didn't even know anyone that joined the military.
And,

778
00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:02.060
and so that was the most rebellious thing I could do.
Oh,
college,

779
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:06.580
no education.
No,
I'm going to go be a commando.
That's what I'm going to do.
And,

780
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.720
and it was the most rebellious thing I could do.

781
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.850
I think that's one of the reasons why I did it.

782
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.680
It was also a complete break away from family.
Okay.
I have,

783
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.250
I love no reliance on you.
You know,
I'm going,

784
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.230
you don't have to worry about me anymore.
I'm done.
Um,

785
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.840
I will not rely on anyone else.
I will be self-reliant,
which I wanted to do.

786
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.680
And so I think those are the main things that that got me there.

787
00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:33.410
And then what's great about it for me was when I got there,

788
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:38.770
you have a completely blank slate and you have very clear directions of what you

789
00:48:38.931 --> 00:48:42.850
need to do to,
to ascend the,

790
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:47.540
the dominance hierarchy.
You do this,
you do this,
you follow these rules.
You,

791
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.750
you literally fold your underwear in this way when you're going through bootcamp

792
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:54.740
and you get a better grade on your military performance.

793
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.130
So they give you very clear rules that you're supposed to follow and very clear

794
00:48:58.131 --> 00:48:59.770
tasks that you had to do.
And,

795
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.270
and it was great for me because it was a blank slate because when I was in high

796
00:49:02.271 --> 00:49:06.860
school,
I was,
uh,
I was a screw up.
Not Bad,
but not good.
And,

797
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.420
and so I hadn't really set myself up properly and now all of a sudden,

798
00:49:11.421 --> 00:49:12.830
all I had to do that,
that was all gone.

799
00:49:12.831 --> 00:49:14.900
It didn't matter that the past did not matter at all.

800
00:49:14.901 --> 00:49:18.200
I had a completely blank slate.
If you do this stuff properly,
you'll,

801
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.170
you'll do well at,
you'll ascend that.

802
00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:25.440
<v 2>That's a very interesting thing because then it's not merely a matter of</v>

803
00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:27.180
following a set of arbitrary rules.

804
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.410
It's following a set of rules that have a clear path to success.
Right?

805
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.600
That's a very different thing.
And,
and that,

806
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.110
that's also something that's honest because the rules of the game are well

807
00:49:37.111 --> 00:49:39.720
established and then if you play it properly,
you get to win.

808
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.480
And that's a big deal as well.
You know,
and you mentioned,
um,

809
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:48.420
the seal types and I've met a number of people like that.
Um,
you know,
they're,

810
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.840
they're,
they're capable of breaking rules,
let's say,

811
00:49:51.841 --> 00:49:55.370
or maybe even inclined to break them.
But I also think that,

812
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.610
that this is part of the reason that I'm an admirer of Carl Young because young

813
00:49:59.611 --> 00:50:01.800
makes it very clear that,
see,

814
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.760
he was very interested in the barriers to enlightenment because if there's,

815
00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.280
if there's such a thing as being enlightened,
let's say,

816
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.670
then why isn't everyone enlightened?
If it's just a matter of,

817
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.590
of taking the glorious,
um,
uh,
route.

818
00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:20.820
And,
and following your bliss,
let's say.
It's like,
well,
that sounds pretty easy.

819
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:25.080
Why isn't everyone enlightened?
But Young's thinking isn't like that at all.

820
00:50:25.081 --> 00:50:28.640
You know,
he,
he believed that in order transform your personality,

821
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.220
that first of all,
you had to be disciplined,
that's for sure.

822
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.080
But you also had to integrate that part of you that was terrible and capable of

823
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:40.220
breaking rules and make it part of you.
And so then,
and I really liked that idea.

824
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:43.340
Well here,
here's an example.
So about 20 years ago,

825
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:48.341
I would say there was a newspaper headline in one of Canada's major newspapers,

826
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:52.820
and it was the minister of foreign affairs at that time,
Lloyd Axworthy.

827
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:56.330
And he was talking about what had happened with,
uh,
Milosevic in,

828
00:50:56.331 --> 00:51:00.590
in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the atrocities that were being

829
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:02.990
committed.
And he said that he,

830
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.830
that he was caught unawares by that because he didn't have the imagination for

831
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:10.460
that kind of evil.
And I thought,
well,
you know,

832
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:14.990
you think that what you're doing is signaling your virtue by making a statement

833
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:16.970
like that.
But from my perspective,

834
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:21.080
all you're doing is stating your cowardice and your historical ignorance.

835
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:23.270
Because if you're going to be minister of foreign affairs,

836
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.480
you bloody well better have imagination for that kind of evil.

837
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:31.470
Because if you don't,
then anyone who does wins,
they beat you.
And so you,

838
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.750
you know,
and again,
in the Harry Potter stories you see he's touched by evil,

839
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:40.340
right?
He actually has a soul fragment that's embedded within them.

840
00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:45.140
That's as black as anything can possibly be.
That's why he could talk to snakes.

841
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.530
But without that he wouldn't be able to have any victory.

842
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.600
And that's exactly right.
Psychologically,

843
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:54.230
unless you can think the way that an evil person thinks,

844
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.310
then you're defenseless against them because they'll go places you can't imagine

845
00:51:58.311 --> 00:52:01.130
it and then they win.
And so the best man I've met,

846
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.370
it was interesting even when I was in junior high and high school because most

847
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:08.480
of my friends dropped out.
You know,
by the time they are grade 10 thereabouts.

848
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.000
And a lot of them were guys who develop physically.

849
00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:13.760
They're pretty powerful and they're just damn sick and putting up their hand to

850
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:17.990
go to the bathroom.
I was like,
you know,
there are not doing that anymore.

851
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.380
One of my friends got kicked out when he sort of challenged the gym teacher,

852
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.980
you know,
physically and the gym teacher,
he could do an iron cross.

853
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.030
He was a tough guy and so it was no trivial matter for my friend to stand up to

854
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:32.990
him.
But he got expelled anyways.
But you know,
I noticed that it wasn't,

855
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.730
it was often the kids whose character I admired that either quit or got expelled

856
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:42.731
and they were the tougher guys who were just sick and tired of following rules

857
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:45.260
that didn't take into account their character.

858
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:48.150
And then they'd go off and work in the oil rigs or whatever.
You could do that.

859
00:52:48.151 --> 00:52:50.990
And Alberta at that time,
that was really hard work,
you know?

860
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.410
So it wasn't like they were necessarily taking the easy path,

861
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.430
but like a harmless man is not a good man.

862
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:03.740
A good man is a very,
very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control.

863
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.630
And you know,
you also see that,
um,

864
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.400
like one of the central female stories,
let's say,
um,

865
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.510
if the hero archetype is the central mail story,

866
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.510
there are variants of hero archetypes that are relevant to women.

867
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:19.910
And one of them is beauty and the beast.
And you know,

868
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:24.260
beauty isn't interested in the guy who isn't the beast.

869
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:25.980
She's interested in the

870
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.560
<v 3>guy who's the beast.
And that's exactly right.</v>

871
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:32.580
But she's interested in the guy who's the beast that can be civilized and

872
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:33.690
disciplined,
right?

873
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:36.660
And who can use that in the service while let's say of a family.

874
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.190
And that's exactly,
well that's exactly how it should be.

875
00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:46.020
So I gave a speech,
uh,
one of my very good friends got married,
uh,

876
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.800
a few years ago and I gave a speech and at this speech he was a friend of mine

877
00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.213
seal.

878
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:59.290
And at the speech I was talking about what it was to be a man and what,

879
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.100
when I felt like I was a man.

880
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.880
And I said there was three things that I,
that I felt,

881
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.640
let me transition from being,
you know,

882
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:16.470
mentally insecure about who I was as a person to being,
okay,

883
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:18.450
I'm actually good with who I am.

884
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.590
Number one was learning how to fight and you know,

885
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:26.620
I got into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and mixed martial arts and I,

886
00:54:26.621 --> 00:54:30.180
and I learned how to fight and now all of a sudden when I looked at other
people,

887
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:34.390
I didn't,
I wasn't posturing.
I wasn't trying to pretend that I was tough.
I was,

888
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.890
I knew that most people that I would encounter,

889
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.760
I could defeat in a physical altercation.
That was number one.

890
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.990
Number two was going into combat because even though you might be tougher than

891
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:47.680
him,
you know,
street fight or a no,

892
00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.850
a fistfight with someone when you're facing death.

893
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:55.530
Well that's a whole nother level.
And for me going into combat,
well,

894
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:57.840
what was I going to act like?
Was I going to be scared?

895
00:54:57.841 --> 00:55:00.360
Was I going to be a coward?
Was I going to be scared of death?

896
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.450
And when I went into combat,
I wasn't,
I was fine.

897
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.030
I was okay with the fact that I could die and,

898
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.820
and I was okay with that and I made good decisions and,

899
00:55:09.821 --> 00:55:12.990
and did what I was supposed to do.

900
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.800
And the last one was I got married and had kids because all of a sudden all of

901
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:19.710
these things,

902
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:24.711
these being aggressive and working to fight and be able to destroy in an

903
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:29.400
efficient way.
Well then I took that and combined it with,
okay,

904
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:30.570
now I'm going to take care of these,

905
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.270
my wife and our children and that's what I'm going to do.

906
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.900
And my point in giving this speech was he was a guy that had learned how to

907
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:37.141
fight.

908
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:41.520
He was a guy that had been in combat and now there was one more step to take,

909
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.211
which was,
okay,

910
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.040
now you're going to get married and you're going to take care of these people.

911
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:47.570
So it's interesting that once again,
that dichotomy that,

912
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.080
that you talk about,

913
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:53.550
it fits perfectly into the way I figured things out.
As a,

914
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:57.060
as a guy that went to high school and joined the military.
It's kind of,

915
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.290
it's kind of crazy,
but it reinforces what you always say,
which is that there's,

916
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.930
there's deeper meaning.
There's a reason why I'm thinking that.

917
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:05.460
And the reason is because I've,

918
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.210
because of the things that you talk about in the way these things are overlaid

919
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:12.330
throughout history for human beings to have gotten to this point.
Yeah.

920
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:15.420
Well you acted it out,
you know,
which is what you're supposed to do.

921
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:19.590
And it's also,
it's better to act it out and to understand it,
you know,
that's,

922
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.220
that's best.
It's better.
It's better to understand it and not out then to not

923
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.330
<v 2>understand it at all.</v>

924
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:29.830
But the best is to act it out and understand it and cause then you can,
you know,

925
00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:33.400
then then the way that you represent the world and yourself is in accordance

926
00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:36.310
with the way that you act.
And that's,
that's,
that's optimized.

927
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.510
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's,
it's something that I was kind of acting out again.
No,</v>

928
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.570
no real guy.
Like my guidelines where like I was raised in the seal teams.
Yeah.

929
00:56:45.571 --> 00:56:47.850
That was sorta my guidelines.
And,
and here's a good example.

930
00:56:47.851 --> 00:56:51.150
When I first gotten the seal teams,
there's no war going on.
So what did,

931
00:56:51.151 --> 00:56:52.500
what did a good seal?
Do you know what you did?

932
00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:55.550
You went out and drank and got in bar fights.
That's what a good seal did.
So,

933
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.680
you know what I did,
went out and drank,
gotten bar fights.
That's what,
okay,

934
00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:01.260
that's what I'm supposed to do.
It took me awhile to figure out,
oh,

935
00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:02.730
there's actually something more than that.

936
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:07.320
Like we're actually supposed to be preparing for war and,
and,
and so now,

937
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.880
like you said,

938
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:13.770
I definitely acted things out and sort of was on a decent path.

939
00:57:13.771 --> 00:57:18.050
But as I got older and more mature and to this day,
as I can look around and,

940
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.240
and actually overlay the understanding on the way of carried out,

941
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.810
my life is very,
it's very helpful to me.

942
00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:29.330
And it's also helps me explain it to other people that see the path at Alma go.

943
00:57:29.331 --> 00:57:32.160
They,
they liked that path.
They would like to join me on that path.

944
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.230
And I get guys that when I was in,
I,
I,
you know,
I Kinda,

945
00:57:37.231 --> 00:57:39.780
I look like a serial killer for all practical purposes.

946
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:44.250
That's the way I come across right now.
There was creepy enough,

947
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:49.560
there's,
there's guys that would,
um,
you know,

948
00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:52.350
guys that would work for me are guys that would be around me and they'd see me

949
00:57:52.351 --> 00:57:56.980
and they'd kind of latch on to the fact that I was tough and aggressive and,

950
00:57:57.050 --> 00:58:00.120
and,
and some of those guys,
they wouldn't catch the other part,

951
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.870
which was that I was politically savvy and I was working and I was maneuvering

952
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:04.860
it.
I was,
you know,

953
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:09.180
figuring things out and talking to my boss in such a way that we could get where

954
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:12.060
we needed to be.
And I was doing that whole other side.

955
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.170
And so I'd get these guys that would end up not doing as well as they should do

956
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.740
because they were just,
hey,
Jocko is just ultra aggressive and he gets after it.

957
00:58:19.741 --> 00:58:21.570
And so that's what I'm going to do.
And I'll be in the same place.

958
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:23.940
The guys that would do well with the guys that said,
Oh yeah,

959
00:58:23.941 --> 00:58:26.280
Jack was awesome and he's aggressive and he gets after it.

960
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.790
He's also working and he's also maneuvering.

961
00:58:28.791 --> 00:58:31.800
And he's also massaging the egos of the people around him.

962
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:34.800
So it makes sure that they get positioned in the right spot where they can go to

963
00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:39.720
war policy in the right way.
And,
and so as I've gotten older,

964
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:42.030
I've been able to tell people that more clearly.
Like,
Hey,

965
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.530
it's not just about that side of the ultra aggressive.
You gotta be aggressive.

966
00:58:46.531 --> 00:58:48.480
You've got to be willing to fight,
you got to be a willing to kill,

967
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.610
and you've gotta be willing to die at the same time,

968
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:55.670
you gotta be able to tamper and temper all those things in such a way that they

969
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:57.540
can be controlled and disciplined.

970
00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:01.130
<v 2>Well,
I also think that that's part of what makes a world peaceful in the,</v>

971
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:02.410
in the final analysis,

972
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:07.210
because if you're around people who are dangerous but disciplined,

973
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.860
then everyone watches their step.
And that's exactly what should happen.

974
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.720
Everybody should watch their step.
And if you do,
if there's no reason for that,

975
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:19.990
then while there's no,
there's no sanction for,

976
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:22.790
for poor behavior for example,
like I mean if you,

977
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.980
if you're going to discipline a child,
the child has to be convinced that you're

978
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.320
a force that's worthy of paying attention to,
you know,
I see kids,
I,

979
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.150
there's a chapter in my book called don't ever,

980
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.000
don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

981
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:40.580
And I'm pretty happy about this chapter,

982
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:43.520
although I suspect it will be rather controversial.

983
00:59:43.521 --> 00:59:48.521
And it's predicated first on observation that many people hurt their children

984
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:51.380
physically and psychologically,
you know,

985
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:54.680
cause everyone gets sentimental about the relationship between parents and

986
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:59.000
children.
But that's especially in relationship to themselves because they think,

987
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:01.820
well,
you know,
of course I'm going to be a good parent.

988
01:00:01.821 --> 01:00:05.180
It's like it's not so bloody obvious that you're going to be a good parent,

989
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.680
you know?
And so,

990
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.520
and then what I see happening with people who don't know how to discipline their

991
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:15.110
children is that the children run roughshod over them in there,

992
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:19.670
let's call them a hierarchical disputes because children push for position and

993
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:23.660
hierarchy and they do that behaviorally to sort of feel out the contours of the

994
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:27.920
social structure.
So you know your kid whacked perfectly fine at home,

995
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:29.600
let's say at the dinner table,

996
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:32.570
but then you take them to a stranger's dinner table and all of a sudden they act

997
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:35.330
out and you think,
what's up with you,
your little monster.

998
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.230
And what's up is that they're trying to figure out what the power structure is

999
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:40.880
in the new,
they don't know this of course,

1000
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:44.480
but they're acting this out there trying to figure out if the same rules apply

1001
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:47.150
in this new situation as apply in the old situation.

1002
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.990
And they can't ask that and they don't even know that they are rules.

1003
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:53.450
Exactly there regularities that they've learned.

1004
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:57.170
And so they'll test and test and then you have to show them that.
Yeah,

1005
01:00:57.171 --> 01:00:59.840
it's the same here.
It's the same in this situation,

1006
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:04.340
but lots of parents are very uneasy with disciplining their children.

1007
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.330
Partly because there they believe that if you give a child infinite freedom

1008
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:11.210
that's best for them and that constraints are inappropriate,

1009
01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:12.620
which is really just,

1010
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.420
well I don't know what to say about that except it's so untrue that that it's

1011
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:20.090
very difficult to think of anything that's more untreated now.

1012
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.960
But also the thing is,
is if you let your children take advantage of you,

1013
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.790
if you have an ounce of spine and an ounce of aggression,
which you do,

1014
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.980
especially if you don't admit it,
then you will take revenge on your children.

1015
01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:34.791
You know?

1016
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:38.060
So if they have a temper tantrum in the grocery store and embarrass you,

1017
01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.480
which child who's county can do quite effectively,
you know,

1018
01:01:41.481 --> 01:01:45.560
because you wouldn't let them have that pack of crayons or a chocolate bar and,

1019
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.760
and then you know,
you,
you tell yourself it's okay and that you still,
you know,

1020
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.280
that that really didn't make you that angry and it's okay,

1021
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:56.120
but you're fuming inside and then you go home and half an hour later maybe the

1022
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:59.120
child is doing some interesting little bit of work,

1023
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.840
maybe artwork or something or does something good and comes up for a reward.

1024
01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:06.890
It's like the probability that you're going to reward that child properly under

1025
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.540
those circumstances,
zero,

1026
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.450
you're going to take the opportunity to take your revenge.

1027
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.420
And if you don't know that,
then you're not much of a parent.

1028
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:19.690
And so part of the trick with kids is that if your child is doing something that

1029
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:21.840
makes you dislike them,

1030
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:24.990
that you have to figure out how to stop them from doing that and teach them how

1031
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:25.790
to do it properly.

1032
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:29.040
And you have to talk to your wife to make sure that you're not being too much of

1033
01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:32.580
a monster,
you know,
on the same with her.
But that,

1034
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.890
that discipline is partly what enables you to continue to like your child.

1035
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.980
Well you love them.
And even more than that,
you know,

1036
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.480
parents talk about fostering self esteem and fostering creativity in all of that

1037
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:49.030
in their kids.
And I think that's misbegotten uh,

1038
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:52.200
it's shallow for a variety of reasons.
First,

1039
01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:56.040
it's not that easy to foster creativity because it's rare and self esteem is a

1040
01:02:56.041 --> 01:03:00.060
very badly defined concept and mostly it's been used for harm.
Not Good.

1041
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.480
What your job is as a parent is to help your child learn from between two years

1042
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:11.880
old and say four years old how to act in the world so that when people encounter

1043
01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:16.500
them,
people smile and are happy they're around.
Because then,

1044
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.310
you know,
I've seen kids who behave badly and everywhere they go,

1045
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:22.950
people were false smiles and everywhere they go,

1046
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:24.570
people are relieved when they leave.

1047
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.170
And that means you think about that world from the child's perspective.

1048
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:33.030
Everyone's lying and all,
everyone hates them.
That's their world.

1049
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.880
And then if you have your child,
you know,

1050
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:40.740
capable of adhering to minimal social requirements,

1051
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:44.940
like maybe being able to sit at the table in a civilized manner for an hour and

1052
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.340
being grateful for being fed,
let's say,

1053
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:51.930
and knowing how to share and knowing how to pay attention to adults and,

1054
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:55.590
and not having that,
you know,
that kind of

1055
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.190
terrible cynicism and,

1056
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.510
and arrogance that can develop even in a four year old child who's always had

1057
01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:07.980
its way then then they'll interact with adults in a manner that bring out the

1058
01:04:07.981 --> 01:04:10.290
best and the adults.
And every year they go,

1059
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.480
everyone smiles at them and pats them on the head,

1060
01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:15.090
maybe even tells them useful and interesting things.

1061
01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:17.040
And so the whole world opens up for them.

1062
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:21.630
And that's all a consequence of you having enough courage to admit to yourself

1063
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:26.640
that your child can do things that you don't like and that you will take it out

1064
01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:28.440
on them if you don't straighten it out.

1065
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.860
And people don't like that idea because they think,
well,
I'd never do anything.

1066
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.910
You know,
I love my child,
I'd never do anything to hurt them.
It's like,
yeah,
God,

1067
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:40.560
right?
You know,
you're so,
you're so asleep.
If you think that,
that,

1068
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.780
that there's almost no hope for you.

1069
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.840
You have to think I'm way bigger than this child and I'm way meaner and I'm way

1070
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:51.420
trickier and I'm way more unpredictable.

1071
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:56.690
And so I better be very careful in my relationships with this child so that the

1072
01:04:56.971 --> 01:04:58.290
worst of me doesn't come out.

1073
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.170
And then that gives you enough intelligence to make a disciplinary framework

1074
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:08.130
that's minimal and enforce it properly and carefully and then you can have an

1075
01:05:08.131 --> 01:05:11.340
unbelievably good relationship with your kids.
So,

1076
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.950
and this idea of discipline,

1077
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:16.920
obviously I talk about discipline a lot and one of the,

1078
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.250
you were talking about earlier

1079
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.250
<v 3>with regards to veterans and people that have listened to your lectures.</v>

1080
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:28.220
And it's the same thing with me.
People that listen to this podcast or,

1081
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.270
or read the books.
And,

1082
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:34.630
and one of the things that I've noticed and I've talked about and I've gotten a

1083
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:39.310
lot of positive feedback on is,
you know,
when you're in the military,

1084
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:41.830
you have this discipline and beyond that,

1085
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.320
beyond the discipline that's imposed on you,

1086
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:47.710
you also have a lot that you have to just hold the line yourself.
I mean,

1087
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.780
when you're in the military,

1088
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.740
sure you go through boot camp where there's a drill instructor that yelling and

1089
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.420
all that.
But once you're in the military,
you're doing what you have to do.

1090
01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:58.300
It's self discipline that you learn that and you become self disciplined.

1091
01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:03.420
And what happens is guys get out and that's,

1092
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.610
that's gone.
And that hurts them.

1093
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:11.770
And the other thing that hurts them is they don't know what their mission is

1094
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:13.010
anymore.
And,

1095
01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:17.200
and my big thing with people that I've been telling vets now is find what your

1096
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:20.770
next mission is.
Go find whatever your next mission.
And I don't care what it is,

1097
01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:22.060
but it has to be something.

1098
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.830
And I was listening to you talk on something the other day and,
and you were,

1099
01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.150
you were talking about how

1100
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:33.310
not doing anything when people are not going anywhere,
when they're,

1101
01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:36.550
when they're failing,
when they're,
when they don't have the drive,

1102
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.070
it's because they're not accepting responsibility for anything.
And,

1103
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.750
and so my way of saying that is like you need a new mission,

1104
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:48.670
you need to be responsible for something and you need to go and move towards

1105
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:52.000
some new mission and,
and do you encounter people that,

1106
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.840
or you see people that's very problematic in the civilian side as well,

1107
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:57.590
where people,
they just don't know what they're doing.

1108
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:59.080
They don't take any responsibility for it.
Yeah.

1109
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.180
<v 2>That's part of this nihilism is that because first of all,</v>

1110
01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:07.710
you learned that truth is relevant relative and that there's no real moral order

1111
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.770
and you know,
that alleviates,
you have responsibility.

1112
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.610
And that's why that's such an attractive message to people.
But the problem is,

1113
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:19.150
is that it kills you.
It kills your soul,
so to speak.
Because,
well,

1114
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.310
when we can talk about this technically.
So you know,
there are systems,

1115
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.910
neurological systems that underlie your experience of negative emotion.

1116
01:07:26.911 --> 01:07:30.300
And there are neurological systems that underlie your experience of positive

1117
01:07:30.301 --> 01:07:33.090
emotion.
And there are separate systems.
They obviously interact,

1118
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:37.980
but they're separate systems.
So,
but the positive emotion system,

1119
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:39.030
while there's two of them,

1120
01:07:39.031 --> 01:07:42.630
but one of them sort of kicks in when you get something that you want.

1121
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:44.980
So you know you're hungry and you eat and that feels good.

1122
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:47.810
And so that's kind of the simple one.
Um,

1123
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:52.020
but there's a more sophisticated one that I think is even more active in people.

1124
01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:57.150
Um,
and it's the one that tells you that you're moving forward towards something

1125
01:07:57.151 --> 01:07:57.984
worthwhile.

1126
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.550
And that's actually the one that gives people that sense of meaningful

1127
01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:07.080
engagement in their life on a moment to moment basis.
So,
and,

1128
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.280
and it's also,
it's also something that doesn't have to go away.

1129
01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:14.070
Like if you're hungry and you eat well,
that's good,

1130
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.320
but it's over and you're onto the next thing,
right?
It's not exactly sustaining,

1131
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:21.230
it's just necessary.
That's called consumer Tory reward.
By the way.

1132
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:25.790
There's other reward system has incentive reward and the incentive reward system

1133
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:28.310
works on dopamine.
This neurochemical dopamine,

1134
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:33.200
which is also the neurochemical tracks that opiates and cocaine and

1135
01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:33.861
amphetamines,

1136
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:37.960
the drugs that people really like to abuse alcohol often for some people,
um,

1137
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:42.020
activate.
And so you might say if you don't have enough meaning in your life,

1138
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:45.530
then you're more prone to addiction.
And that's definitely the case.

1139
01:08:45.531 --> 01:08:46.400
Even with rats.

1140
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:49.610
If you take a rat and you put them in a cage by himself and he has nothing to
do,

1141
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.650
and then you give him access to cocaine,

1142
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:54.620
he'll get addicted to the point where he won't do anything but take cocaine.

1143
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.770
But if you throw the rat back in with a bunch of other rats and he gets to do

1144
01:08:57.771 --> 01:09:01.160
rat things,
then it's very hard to get them addicted to cocaine.

1145
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:04.880
And so the purposeless rat is prone to addiction.
Well,

1146
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:08.510
it's the same with human beings.
Now here's a corollary to that,

1147
01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.440
which is really cool.

1148
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:14.441
So the magnitude of the reward you experience as you're moving towards a goal is

1149
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:18.320
proportionate to the importance of the goal.

1150
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:21.650
So that means the more important the goal you pick,

1151
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:26.150
the more possibility there is for the kind of reward.

1152
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:27.050
Let's say it's,

1153
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:31.730
it's really a state of being that is life affirming and it is directly life

1154
01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:34.640
affirming in that,
you know,
like if you're in a football game and you're,

1155
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:39.050
and it's an important football game and maybe you break a finger and you know,

1156
01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:40.520
normally that's,
that's a problem.

1157
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.740
It hurts and you're going to stop doing whatever you're doing.

1158
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:44.480
But if you're right in the middle of the game,

1159
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:49.460
then you'll be so amped up on this reward system that it's analgesic,

1160
01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:52.250
it stops the pain,
it also suppresses anxiety.

1161
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:56.990
So if you have a purpose,
then it's analgesic.

1162
01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.640
It takes some of the pain out of life.

1163
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.510
It's very positive in that it motivates and energizes you and focuses you and

1164
01:10:02.511 --> 01:10:07.280
makes you able to remember and pay attention and it quells fear.

1165
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.210
And so those things are all direct.
And so then you might think,
well,

1166
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:15.680
what's the best possible goal while in that's,
that's the purpose I would say,

1167
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:17.900
of religious training and philosophical training.
It's like,

1168
01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:21.230
just what the hell are you doing in the world?
You know,
when I would say,

1169
01:10:21.231 --> 01:10:25.770
well that's actually fairly easy to also,
um,

1170
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:27.770
to also lay out,

1171
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.320
and this is why nihilism is a much weaker philosophical position than it might

1172
01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:35.690
appear to be.
It's like,
well,

1173
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:39.200
there are lots of terrible things happening in the world.
If you're not,

1174
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:44.300
I don't care if you're a believer and atheist or,
or cynic of the highest sword.

1175
01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.350
You listened to his story,

1176
01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:47.630
like the one that you wrote read at the beginning of the,

1177
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.060
of this podcast and no one says,
well,
in 100,000 years,
who the hell cares?

1178
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:56.480
So why does it matter?
No one says that they listened to that,

1179
01:10:56.570 --> 01:11:00.050
not if they're human,
they listened to that store and they think that's not good.

1180
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.230
It's like,
that's right.
That's not good.
It's not good.

1181
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.360
You should do something about that because it's,
it's,
it's,
it's self,

1182
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:11.330
evidently not good.
So you might say,

1183
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:14.550
well at least you can start your self organization

1184
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:18.990
<v 4>by improving those things around you that are self evidently not good.</v>

1185
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.460
And that's easy,
man.
Anybody can do this.
You can sit down for 10 minutes,
say,

1186
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:26.640
well,
I'm going to be honest with myself.
Like,
oh,
that's a horrible thing to do.

1187
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.220
I'm going to be honest with myself.
Okay,

1188
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:34.250
I'm probably doing a dozen stupid things that I could quit doing that are making

1189
01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:39.030
my life less,
more wretched and also the people around me.

1190
01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:41.880
And so you think,
okay,
what are those things?
And you know,

1191
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.350
if you really want to know,

1192
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.070
you have to want to know and you're going to get a bunch of information that you

1193
01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:47.910
don't want to hear,

1194
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.360
but you'll know it's true and you already knew it in some sense.

1195
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.550
And then you can ask yourself,
okay,

1196
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:58.110
that's sucks and it's miserable and it's not very self affirming.

1197
01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.430
Um,
is there one of those things?
I would,

1198
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.180
I would be willing to do something about that.

1199
01:12:06.181 --> 01:12:09.900
I would actually do something about that.
I could do something about that.

1200
01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:11.340
I would do something about,

1201
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.240
which is also another horrible question because soon as you get an answer to

1202
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:18.870
that,
then you have a responsibility,
right?
It's like,
Oh God,
I have to go do that.

1203
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:21.690
And it's something you don't want to do.
You don't want to do it.

1204
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.010
That's why you've been avoiding it.

1205
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.600
And so then it's right in front of you and it's like,
it's some little trivial,

1206
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:30.330
horrible thing that you're not going to get a pat on the back for.

1207
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:33.960
No one's going to give you an award for it.
And,
and most people would just say,

1208
01:12:33.961 --> 01:12:37.560
Jesus,
you should have done that a long time ago.
You're more on and,

1209
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:40.560
but then you go do it.
That's kind of humility I would say.

1210
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:45.980
And then you keep doing that and it's like there's this injunction in the new

1211
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:49.650
testament against praying in public,
you know,

1212
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:51.840
and it's like virtue signaling.

1213
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:57.180
So like you don't pray in public because then you go out and you show everybody

1214
01:12:57.181 --> 01:13:00.660
just what a great believer you are and how good you are.
It's like,
well,

1215
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:04.260
that's what you're doing.
You're not trying to get your act together.

1216
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.110
That's something you do in private at home.
You think,
okay,

1217
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:10.380
what kind of Moron am I and what stupid things it might do it.

1218
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:15.120
And then what could I possibly do to get rid of one of those a little bit now?

1219
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.160
Well,
anybody can do that.
And that's associated with these great evils,
you know,

1220
01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:22.200
in,
in this way that we've already described.

1221
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:26.010
It's like you're constraining your improving your character and you're

1222
01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:30.070
constraining the kinds of actions and perceptions that you have that are going

1223
01:13:30.071 --> 01:13:34.020
to make you sick of life and work against it.
Because failure does that.

1224
01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:37.530
That's the cane story.
It's like,
keep screwing up,
man.

1225
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:40.650
See what happens if you think that isn't going to make you bitter.

1226
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.930
And if that isn't going to make you vengeful,

1227
01:13:42.931 --> 01:13:46.170
and if that isn't gonna make you work to hurt people around you,

1228
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:48.840
or at least not to help them,
which is the same thing,

1229
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.770
then you're just not paying attention.
Everyone knows that's true.

1230
01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:56.910
So while that's responsibility,
right?
And then,

1231
01:13:57.150 --> 01:14:00.570
so you take on this great task of putting yourself together,

1232
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:01.560
it gives your life meaning.

1233
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:05.340
And that also helps you be brought trust against the fact that there's lots of

1234
01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:08.610
suffering in life.
And there's lots of malevolence.
It's like,
yeah,
true man.

1235
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.130
Absolutely.
It's worse than you think even.
But

1236
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.680
<v 2>you can do more about it than you think.</v>

1237
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.650
And there's nothing in it except good.

1238
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.390
But you also have to take responsibility.
So that's the thing.

1239
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.220
You got to decide if that's what you're going to do,

1240
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:28.000
but you don't get to whine about it if you don't because you haven't tested it.

1241
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.890
<v 0>People don't even have to look for some grand,
uh,</v>

1242
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.520
goal in the sky.
Some elevated goal of what they're going to do,

1243
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:39.990
whether it's a financial goal,
whether it's uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1244
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.650
a nonprofit goal and they're gonna they could look around their bedroom and

1245
01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:48.710
figure out what they're going to do right now to improve things.
Things

1246
01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:52.400
<v 2>I learned from reading soldier knits is he talked about his moral transformation</v>

1247
01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:56.780
in the camps and he said the first thing that transformed him to some degree was

1248
01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:02.260
looking at people in the camps who did refuse to do immoral things no matter

1249
01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.880
what he said.
He ran into people like that.

1250
01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:07.580
And that just blew him away because you already laid that out.

1251
01:15:07.581 --> 01:15:08.870
It's like these are,

1252
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.410
he said they were continually choosing between their life and their conscience

1253
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:15.590
and they chose their conscience like,
and,

1254
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.040
and he tells some amazing stories in the Gulag archipelago about,
you know,

1255
01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:21.980
dozens of people.
He meant like that,
Matt like that.
And they're just,

1256
01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:25.310
they're stories that of heroism,

1257
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:29.960
moral heroism under absolutely vicious conditions there.

1258
01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:33.500
You just can't believe them,
you know,
so,
so that's pretty amazing.

1259
01:15:33.501 --> 01:15:37.670
But he said that once he kind of figured out that there was a difference between

1260
01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:42.200
attending to your conscience and doing whatever was necessary to prolong your

1261
01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:43.250
miserable existence,

1262
01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:47.930
that he started to think about that deeply and that he went over his life with a

1263
01:15:47.931 --> 01:15:51.500
fine tooth comb and tried to figure out everything he did that he knew was
wrong.

1264
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.100
And then to try to figure out what he could do in the present to rectify that.

1265
01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.160
You know,
you wouldn't necessarily be able to,
to a tone that's the right,

1266
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:03.420
that's the right way of thinking about it.
You know,
you,

1267
01:16:03.421 --> 01:16:07.640
you do something wrong and well maybe you can't even fix it with the person you

1268
01:16:07.641 --> 01:16:08.760
did the wrong tube.

1269
01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:11.420
But maybe there's something else you could do that would be good enough so that

1270
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.680
you know,
you can think,
okay,

1271
01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:17.120
well at least those balance out and maybe I'm a little bit on the side of the

1272
01:16:17.121 --> 01:16:19.600
positive.
So we did that,
you know,

1273
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:22.940
and that he said that straightened them out a lot.
And then he wrote this book,

1274
01:16:22.941 --> 01:16:24.920
this amazing book that,
you know,

1275
01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.600
cut the communist intellectuals off at their knees and,

1276
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.370
and change the world.
Really.

1277
01:16:31.371 --> 01:16:34.270
And that's a hell of a thing for someone to do who's,
uh,
you know,

1278
01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:39.380
miserable Zach and in a concentration camp,
that's a hell of a story man.

1279
01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.460
And it's not the only one like it.
So you don't know how much power you have,

1280
01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:45.920
where you stand,
even if you look weak and,
and,

1281
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:50.330
and if what's around you is terrible.
Well then you've got lots of things to do,

1282
01:16:50.331 --> 01:16:54.760
that's for sure.
And they're announcing themselves right there so and

1283
01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:56.991
well,

1284
01:16:56.991 --> 01:17:01.730
and it's tying it in with evil and suffering that is best for me because it's so

1285
01:17:01.731 --> 01:17:06.560
real.
You know,
it's like you can be skeptical about the existence of the good,

1286
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:08.323
but if you,

1287
01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.080
if you open eyes and you do any amount of studying and even any amount of self

1288
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:15.410
examination,
you can't be skeptical about the existence of evil.

1289
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.420
I don't believe that you can,

1290
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:21.590
there are things that read about unit seven 31 and then see how skeptical you

1291
01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:24.850
are about evil.
I wouldn't recommend that by the way,
because that's,

1292
01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:28.460
that is so horrible that you can't really read it without being traumatized.

1293
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:32.900
It is unbelievably horrible.
You read that and then you say,

1294
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:34.820
well morality is relative.

1295
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.350
It's like see if you can utter those words after reading that and then if

1296
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:42.260
mortality isn't relative and there is evil,
then there is good.

1297
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.710
It's at least whatever isn't evil.
Right.

1298
01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:47.540
You can whatever doesn't cause that is good.

1299
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.980
It's sort of defining it by its opposite,
but that's okay.
It doesn't matter.

1300
01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:52.814
It's good enough.

1301
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.850
<v 0>And so how do,
how do guys,</v>

1302
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.750
going back to the PTSD conversation a little bit,

1303
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.800
how do you guys that sort of experienced this evil part of not only of the world

1304
01:18:06.851 --> 01:18:10.030
but of themselves because they had to do some things that they didn't want to do

1305
01:18:10.031 --> 01:18:13.870
or they didn't like doing and things that made them feel like,
oh,

1306
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:18.580
there's a dark part of me that I don't really like too much.
What's the,

1307
01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:22.120
what's the,
you know,
from what I've said is you got to embrace that,

1308
01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:25.450
that the fact that there's darkness in the world and that there's darkness in

1309
01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.990
you,
you got to embrace that and get a hold of it.

1310
01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.350
Not try and disguise it,
not try and make it seem like it's not there.

1311
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:34.790
That's the same thing you're saying,
right?

1312
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.770
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
you know,
when you're in really,</v>

1313
01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.380
they say there's no atheists in foxholes,
you know,
and,
and that's,
that's,

1314
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.140
you know,
it's a bit of a cliche but,
but there's,
there's a deep truth in that,

1315
01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:48.470
which isn't,
there's some circumstances that you find yourself in four,

1316
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:52.720
which only religious language works.
And if you happen to do,

1317
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:57.590
observe yourself doing something that's highness enough to damage you

1318
01:18:57.591 --> 01:19:00.170
psychologically,
then you're in the realm of good and evil.

1319
01:19:00.171 --> 01:19:02.230
Archetipal good and evil.
And,

1320
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.930
and unless you can start to conceptualize the world in that manner,

1321
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:10.850
you're never going to make sense out of it.
And so partly it depersonalizes it,

1322
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.150
you know,
it's,
it's you that did this,

1323
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:19.810
but it's like the capacity for evil isn't just you.

1324
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:24.590
It's,
it's part of humanity.
Maybe it's part of the structure of the cosmos.

1325
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:28.910
And you happened to stumble over it naively.
And so it hurt you.
You know,

1326
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.380
there's this old Egyptian story about a god named Horace and he's the god of

1327
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:37.010
attention.
So he's represented by the Egyptian I,
so he pays attention.

1328
01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.270
He's also a falcon.
And Falcon has great vision and flies above everything,
right?

1329
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.330
And,
and,
uh,
he's also the,

1330
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.770
the forest that revitalizes the dead father in,
in Egyptian mythology,

1331
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.920
but he has a fight with his evil uncle set,

1332
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.500
who's a precursor to the idea of Satan.

1333
01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.250
And then you can tell by partly because the words are quite similar and he has a

1334
01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:02.760
terrible battle with set who's taken over the kingdom and is a terrible tyrant,

1335
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.630
is killing everyone and everything's going to hell.

1336
01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:08.730
And he has a battle with him to regain control of his kingdom.

1337
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.610
And that's fine.
And he's a God.

1338
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.330
And so as Seth and they have a fight and it's a terrible fight,

1339
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:19.320
and during the fight,
Seth tares out one of his eyes.
When you think,
well,

1340
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:22.440
that's a God,
right?
And nonetheless,

1341
01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:25.500
he ends up with his vision damaged,
his consciousness damaged.

1342
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:29.740
Now he gains a different kind of sight.
He gains insight,
right?

1343
01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:33.270
Because now he knows the nature of evil,
but he pays a big price for it.

1344
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:36.330
And so you think,
well,
if that's the case for God,

1345
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:41.250
how much more is it the case for a man to be damaged?
It's like absolutely right.

1346
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:43.320
It's no joke to encounter malevolence.

1347
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.600
And I've seen that in my clinical clients too.

1348
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:50.601
I had a client who was terrified into nightly convulsions for four years by the

1349
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:53.520
look on her boyfriend's face when he attacked her.

1350
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.810
It took me a long time to unpack that.
It was like a three month process,

1351
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:02.070
but it was the,
it was,
see,
she was very naive,
very,
very,

1352
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:06.660
very naive because her parents had raised her in a world where the evil queen

1353
01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:09.630
was not allowed to visit like the parents and sleeping beauty.

1354
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:14.430
So she was way too sheltered and she thought that human beings were only good,

1355
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.391
you know?

1356
01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:20.391
And then she saw the look on his face that indicated that he was out to

1357
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:25.590
consciously harm her and he,
he couldn't,
they had a fight,
a physical fight,

1358
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:29.310
and she was strong enough to,
to prevail.
He wasn't that big,

1359
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.870
but that wasn't the point is shattered her world because she didn't understand

1360
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.650
until that point that someone could actually consciously want to hurt you.

1361
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.270
You know,
that that wasn't just,

1362
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:42.870
they weren't just in a bad mood and it wasn't just because of the way they were

1363
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:43.740
raised.
And you know,

1364
01:21:43.741 --> 01:21:47.250
all those excuses that people come up that he was not only going to hurt her,

1365
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:48.600
but he was going to enjoy it.

1366
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:52.200
And if you don't understand the part of you that's capable of that,

1367
01:21:52.201 --> 01:21:55.980
then well you're,
you're,
uh,

1368
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.360
dangerously,

1369
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:00.900
dangerously naive and dangerous as well because you don't know what you're

1370
01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:02.580
capable of.
So

1371
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:10.070
<v 0>a lot of these things that you bring up are about leadership and,</v>

1372
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:11.911
and you know,

1373
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:16.620
I talk about leadership all the time and one of the things that,

1374
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.420
you know,
I heard you say,
um,
and you've talked about with,

1375
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.860
with chimpanzees and other hierarchies that are out there,

1376
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:30.810
including lobsters,
which I know you like quite a bit.
Uh,
and you know,

1377
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.230
even lobsters have a,
a dominance hierarchy,
which is,

1378
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.630
which is definitely incredible since how big is their brain?

1379
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:41.130
<v 2>It's not like it's mostly distributed through their bodies.
I mean,</v>

1380
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.940
it's not that big.
And Yeah,
it is absolutely unbelievable to,

1381
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:48.280
to know that the hierarchical arrangement,
like it's a,

1382
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.190
the reason it's a symbolic reality.
So that would be the great father.
Let's say.

1383
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:56.910
The reason that's a symbolic reality is because he can't see a hierarchy.

1384
01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.640
Like if you look at the world,
it's,
you don't see a hierarchy.

1385
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:04.290
But chimps know exactly where each chimp is in the hierarchy.
So for example,

1386
01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.773
a,

1387
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.390
<v 4>a low ranking,</v>

1388
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:12.840
mature chimp won't attack a high ranking juvenile even though he could tear them

1389
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:18.430
apart because he knows that that juvenile is actually an illusion.

1390
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:23.980
The juveniles juvenile plus all the other chimps that will come to his rescue,

1391
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:28.060
right?
So he can't perceive the hierarchy with his eyes,

1392
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:31.810
but he can perceive the hierarchy with his emotions.
Okay.

1393
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:33.970
So that hierarchy is essentially eternal.

1394
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:38.830
It's at least 350 million years old and it's,
and we perceive that all the time.

1395
01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.840
We look at hierarchical posturing,

1396
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:44.950
we look at we and we live in hierarchies of competence mostly.

1397
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.660
So that's,
that's a,
that's a universal truth.

1398
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:52.810
And the fact that you have to struggle with the fact of the hierarchy is also

1399
01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:56.590
universal truth that you actually see this being played out to some degree in

1400
01:23:56.591 --> 01:24:00.730
the leftist feminist arena.
Because really what's happening is they,

1401
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.750
they look at the hierarchy,
let's say the male hierarchy,

1402
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:09.520
they don't attribute it to it
competence.

1403
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:15.270
They attribute to it power and they make the presupposition that you get to the

1404
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:19.240
top by being the meanest,
most exploitive creature possible.

1405
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.620
And so these are often damaged women who've never had a good relationship with

1406
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:27.940
Matt,
with a man and who can't distinguish between competence and power.

1407
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.320
There's a big difference because a hierarchy that's only based on power is a

1408
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:36.640
tyranny.
But a hierarchy based on competence is something that gets things done.

1409
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:40.990
Like not exactly what you want in a hierarchies that the competent people climb

1410
01:24:40.991 --> 01:24:45.230
the hierarchy.
So you can tell who's competent out the top and you,

1411
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.740
you made reference to the chimpanzee work.

1412
01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:52.741
I mean friends to wall has showed quite clearly that unstable chimp power

1413
01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:57.850
hierarchies are based on territory.
So it is that the ugliest,

1414
01:24:57.851 --> 01:25:00.910
meanest brute of the chimp gets to the top.

1415
01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:04.510
But like as soon as he has a bad day,
then two,

1416
01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:09.260
three quarter as strong chimps tear them into pieces and the chimps that manage

1417
01:25:09.261 --> 01:25:12.010
to maintain power at the top,
or let's say authority,

1418
01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:14.590
because that's a better word,
cause we gotta get her words right.

1419
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:17.290
That's a chimp that has friends.

1420
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.190
And that engages in reciprocal grooming and that pays reasonable attention to

1421
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:21.941
the females.

1422
01:25:21.941 --> 01:25:25.660
And so it's so interesting to see that because it shows that even at that level

1423
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:29.740
of biological organization,
there's already a morality of leadership.

1424
01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.940
<v 3>Yeah.
And that was where,
that strikes me as so interesting.</v>

1425
01:25:32.941 --> 01:25:37.590
And I try to explain this to people all the time because,
well,
in the seal teams,

1426
01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:41.190
again,
you,
you might think the same thing.
Well,
the biggest,

1427
01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:46.220
toughest seal that can destroy everyone else is going to be the leader that

1428
01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:50.100
everyone looks to.
And it's just not true.
And in fact,

1429
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.820
a lot of times those guys that might be the biggest and the strongest and the

1430
01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:58.140
fastest,
they're,
they're actually arrogant as well because they've,

1431
01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:02.310
they think they can beat everyone and no one wants to work for those people.

1432
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:06.470
And so,
uh,
it happened when I first started my consulting business and,

1433
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:08.960
and I would have,
you know,
a CEO say,

1434
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:14.030
I can't wait til you come in and just whip my people into shape.
And I'd say,

1435
01:26:14.031 --> 01:26:14.420
well,

1436
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.450
you need to find somebody else that's going to whip people into shape because I

1437
01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:18.680
don't do that.

1438
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:24.430
And they couldn't quite put together that me would,W wasn't into whipping people

1439
01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:28.160
into shape and know what I wanted to actually do is teach people to lead and to

1440
01:26:28.161 --> 01:26:32.000
lead people myself.
And when you're leading,
you're not having to whip people.

1441
01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:35.770
In fact,
that's an indication that you're not leading.

1442
01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:38.270
Exactly that as a leader,
where I,

1443
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:41.600
the the place where I usually found myself was I'm actually having to pull the

1444
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:43.310
reigns back on people because they're,

1445
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:47.960
they're going far and away above what I actually would even want and expect them

1446
01:26:47.961 --> 01:26:51.230
to do.
They want to go even more than do more to accomplish the mission.

1447
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:55.230
Then that's where you want to get.
And I find it interesting that,
you know,

1448
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.110
you talk about that all the time,
that it's,

1449
01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.050
that it's not the person with the biggest club.

1450
01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:04.250
It's not the person that's the meanest and the most aggressive.
Sure,
they might,

1451
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.950
they might rise for a minute,
they might get some control.

1452
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:10.220
And that happens in any organization.
Oh,
if you've got a CEO that really,

1453
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:12.470
he's just a tyrant and everyone's scared of him,

1454
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:17.240
he can make some things happen for a little while and then all of a sudden

1455
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:19.550
someone says,
I'm,
I'm,
oh,
he wants us to do it that way.

1456
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.120
I'm going to do a little sabotage.
Right?

1457
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:26.230
Just a little sabotage your project that you want us to get done by October 31st

1458
01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:30.200
oh it got delayed boss.
And you can go nuts and you can yell and scream,

1459
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:33.020
but you should have listened to me when I said we needed more time and now guess

1460
01:27:33.021 --> 01:27:35.600
where we are.
We didn't deliver the product we were supposed to deliver.

1461
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.220
So you can yell and scream all you want.

1462
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.900
It's not going to get that product delivered

1463
01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.430
<v 2>well in a few Tierra.
Nice people badly enough,</v>

1464
01:27:41.431 --> 01:27:44.760
they'll actually hurt themselves to hurt you.
So,
you know,

1465
01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:49.410
they're willing to take a,
they'll willing to take a hit to,
to reclaim justice,

1466
01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:51.990
let's say.
So yeah,
that's really worth knowing.

1467
01:27:51.991 --> 01:27:55.830
And so one of the things that John Piaget pointed out and cause he was,

1468
01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.620
he's a very interesting psychologist and,
and,

1469
01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:02.100
and he's never taught properly because you know,

1470
01:28:02.101 --> 01:28:06.330
most of these great thinkers were very strange people and the strangeness Gets

1471
01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:07.710
Edited Out of their stories.

1472
01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.620
And it's really too bad because they're way more interesting when you know how

1473
01:28:10.621 --> 01:28:11.490
strange they were.

1474
01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.880
And so Piaget was obsessed with the disjunction between religion and science.

1475
01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:21.630
And his goal as a thinker was to reconcile the two.

1476
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:25.530
And so to some degree he was looking for a biological basis of morality.

1477
01:28:25.531 --> 01:28:27.180
That might be one way of thinking about it,

1478
01:28:27.181 --> 01:28:30.720
or at least to reconcile the idea of a biological substrate with an emergent

1479
01:28:30.721 --> 01:28:35.430
morality.
And one of the things he said is,
okay,
imagine two systems.
All right?

1480
01:28:35.431 --> 01:28:38.430
So both systems are moving towards a goal,

1481
01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:42.930
any old arbitrary goal and in one system,
the,

1482
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.490
the people within interacting under compulsion and in the other system that

1483
01:28:47.491 --> 01:28:51.780
people within it are acting voluntarily said the people who are acting

1484
01:28:51.781 --> 01:28:54.480
voluntarily will defeat the people acting under compulsion.

1485
01:28:54.481 --> 01:28:56.790
Because in order to use compulsion,

1486
01:28:56.791 --> 01:29:01.791
you have to spend a fair bit of time and energy force.

1487
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.020
And so it makes you inefficient.
Whereas if everybody is together on the project,

1488
01:29:07.021 --> 01:29:07.980
then they'll,

1489
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.600
you don't have to spend any time on compulsion because people are compelling

1490
01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:15.900
themselves.
And so that's what he called an equilibrated state.

1491
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.830
So nyquil [inaudible] state was,
well,
we sit down and we have a negotiation.

1492
01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.180
It's a real negotiation.
So it,
it has to be honest and we say,
okay,

1493
01:29:24.181 --> 01:29:25.870
well what the hell are we doing?

1494
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.080
And everyone hashes that out and we decide what we're doing and then we decide

1495
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:35.280
how that would be good for all of us.
But each of us singularly as well.

1496
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:37.590
So if you got your family put together properly,

1497
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:42.270
then the whole family moves together.
But everybody inside moves ahead as well.

1498
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:45.950
And so then everybody's pushing in the same,
you know,
you know how it is within,

1499
01:29:45.951 --> 01:29:46.830
in a negotiation,

1500
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.390
you actually want your interests to align with the interests of the other person

1501
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:54.330
because then you don't have to worry about the integrity of the deal.

1502
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:58.680
It's like everybody has reasons to keep it,
to keep it thriving.

1503
01:29:58.681 --> 01:30:03.681
And the idea that capitalism in somehow is somehow is predicated on the tyranny

1504
01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:08.460
of the people at the,
at the pinnacle that happens when it gets corrupt,

1505
01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:12.240
but it doesn't happen at all when it's working properly because deals that

1506
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:17.241
aren't based on mutual self interest and group interest simultaneously have to

1507
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:21.350
be enforced usually with lawyers and then you're done,
right?

1508
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:22.710
You're done at that point.

1509
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.230
<v 3>That's,
that's actually incredible.
So I would,
when I worked with companies,</v>

1510
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:29.180
everyone's working with a company is a couple of years ago,

1511
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:32.040
maybe even three or four years ago,
and you know,

1512
01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.450
they were talking about how they needed to hold their salespeople accountable

1513
01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:36.800
and that's what they needed to do.

1514
01:30:36.801 --> 01:30:39.230
And they needed more accountability in the sales leadership underneath them,

1515
01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:42.800
needed to hold all their frontline sales leaders accountable for everything and

1516
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:45.560
follow these rules and make these numbers of calls and do these follow up things

1517
01:30:45.561 --> 01:30:48.260
and send the followup emails and they need to get this accountability thing

1518
01:30:48.261 --> 01:30:52.700
going.
And this was the when,
when I heard this guy saying,

1519
01:30:52.701 --> 01:30:54.950
this was the first time I said,
because I'd heard this a lot.

1520
01:30:54.951 --> 01:30:56.690
This is word accountability and leadership.
You hear,

1521
01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.850
oh well we just need better accountability,
better accountability.

1522
01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:03.410
And it's a trick because you think about it and you say to yourself,
well,

1523
01:31:03.411 --> 01:31:07.250
if I'm in charge of you guys and I'm going to hold you accountable to make sure

1524
01:31:07.251 --> 01:31:08.300
you do everything you're supposed to do,

1525
01:31:08.301 --> 01:31:11.660
well then we will successfully do what it is you,
you will do.

1526
01:31:11.690 --> 01:31:14.870
Because I held you accountable.
I made you do it.
The problem is,

1527
01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.400
in any organization,

1528
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.740
there's too many people to hold everyone accountable to everything that they're

1529
01:31:18.741 --> 01:31:22.970
supposed to be doing.
So it just doesn't work.
And so you could take one group,

1530
01:31:22.971 --> 01:31:23.900
and this is what I said to him,
I said,

1531
01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:26.150
if you've got one group where you have to hold them accountable for each and

1532
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:29.300
everything that you do and you and you try and do that versus a group where

1533
01:31:29.301 --> 01:31:32.660
people know what they're supposed to do and they want to go and do it,
I go,

1534
01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:35.300
which,
which team is gonna win?
And he said,
well,
a group that wants to do them.

1535
01:31:35.301 --> 01:31:37.420
So I was like,
oh,
that's what you need to do is get them to want to do with them.

1536
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:40.970
So that's leadership too.
Well,
exactly the exact same thing you just described.

1537
01:31:40.971 --> 01:31:41.690
Exactly.
Right.
Yep.
I

1538
01:31:41.690 --> 01:31:44.900
<v 2>mean,
look,
if you get people to track everything they do,</v>

1539
01:31:44.901 --> 01:31:48.770
it takes them longer to track and then to do it.
Plus they hate it.

1540
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.520
They hate it because they're not being trusted and it's the most terrible,

1541
01:31:52.521 --> 01:31:53.810
dull administrative work.

1542
01:31:53.811 --> 01:31:57.590
And it just kills people who are actually productive because they're driven

1543
01:31:57.591 --> 01:32:02.290
crazy by that.
It's,
leave me the hell alone so I can do my work.
You know?

1544
01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:06.340
And so,
yeah.
So,
so there,
there's something that,

1545
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.900
here's an interesting little fact that,
that I think is really cool.

1546
01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:14.590
I found this out.
This is from the psychological literature.

1547
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:19.270
So I'd been interested in how to increase people's motivation for a long time,

1548
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:23.120
you know,
and um,
and there's a nice literature on that and,

1549
01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.160
and part of it was as was created by a late late them and lock carry late them

1550
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:31.900
and Edwin Locke.
And they are looking at goal setting.

1551
01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:36.820
That's how they described it as a means to improve business productivity.

1552
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.120
And so what they imagine that you have two teams and you get them to set goals,

1553
01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:42.531
say,

1554
01:32:42.531 --> 01:32:47.531
and one team sets goals for their corporate productivity and another team sets

1555
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:52.540
goals for their life and then you match them head to head over some period of

1556
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:54.280
time and see which one comes up ahead.

1557
01:32:54.281 --> 01:32:58.330
And what happens is that the people who set goals for their life beat the people

1558
01:32:58.331 --> 01:33:00.920
who set goals for the company.
And so that's free.

1559
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:05.140
And then there's a variety of other literatures that support that kind of

1560
01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:07.870
hypothesis.
But it's,
it's a very,

1561
01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:11.560
very worthwhile thinking that through because what you want,

1562
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:16.000
if your company is structured properly,
he want people in it who have a life,

1563
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.631
right?

1564
01:33:16.631 --> 01:33:19.270
So they're aiming at things that they think are valuable because they're just

1565
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:20.620
not going to be motivated,
period.

1566
01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:23.050
Unless they're aiming at things they think are valuable.

1567
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:28.330
And then you want their loyalty to the company to be nested inside that.

1568
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.750
So they have to see that working there,
no matter what it is that they're doing.

1569
01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:36.350
And,
and you know,
often jobs are repetitive and Dell and difficult and,

1570
01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:39.940
and challenging and all of that,
or you wouldn't be paid to do them,
right?

1571
01:33:39.941 --> 01:33:42.040
They're not all fun and games.
Um,

1572
01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:47.460
but if you can see that the less intrinsically interesting things that you're

1573
01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:53.581
required to do are related in some directly intelligible way to goals that you

1574
01:33:53.741 --> 01:33:54.820
regard as valuable,

1575
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:59.500
then that tags those activities with this dopaminergic kick that we were talking

1576
01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:02.560
about earlier.
So you need this hierarchy of values,
right?
Just like,

1577
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.730
here's what I'm doing with my life.
Here's why my job is important to that.

1578
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:09.670
Or maybe it isn't.
And then you have to quit and go find a new job.

1579
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:12.490
But that's fine.
But you know,
cause you might discover that too.

1580
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:15.200
And so we started,
um,

1581
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:20.340
trying to formalize this when at the same time that I also realized something

1582
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:24.880
that I've never recovered from realizing I think.

1583
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:28.960
So I teach students usually for this class,

1584
01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:30.610
it was third and fourth year students.

1585
01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:33.640
And so this is at the University of Toronto.
They're pretty smart kids.

1586
01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:36.280
It's a hard university to get into and they're pretty disciplined and they're

1587
01:34:36.281 --> 01:34:39.750
actually quite conservative,
all things considered.
And uh,

1588
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.050
I was teaching them about stories and about the fact that our life is a story

1589
01:34:44.051 --> 01:34:48.550
with a goal and a purpose and a beginning point.
And,
and,
um,

1590
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:51.370
I was encouraging them to develop their own stories.

1591
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.110
So I had them write an autobiography and they really got into that.

1592
01:34:56.111 --> 01:34:58.790
That was quite amazing to identify,
you know,

1593
01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:02.480
to break their life into eat parks and then to describe the important episodes

1594
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:03.314
in each epoch,

1595
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:07.850
both positive and negative and what they might do to reduce the possibility of

1596
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:10.910
the negative in the future and to capitalize on the positive,

1597
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:13.220
which is the purpose of memory,
by the way.

1598
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:15.740
And then also to write a plan for the future.

1599
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.780
And so we s we formalize that.
So the plan is okay,

1600
01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:21.591
first of all,

1601
01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:26.591
you have to get yourself in the right mindset and the mindset is you're trying

1602
01:35:26.901 --> 01:35:31.280
to take care of yourself like you would care for someone that you cared for.

1603
01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:35.360
That's a hard mindset to get into because people like their pets better than

1604
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:36.680
they liked themselves often.

1605
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:42.500
And then you have to have a vision and so the vision would be,
well,
okay,

1606
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.180
three to five years down the road,

1607
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.500
if your friendship networks were configured properly,
what would that look like?

1608
01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:54.220
If you were pursuing the career that would be appropriate for you and sustaining

1609
01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:56.900
for you,
what would that look like?
How are you going to educate yourself?

1610
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:59.690
How are you going to take care of yourself mentally and physically?

1611
01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.180
What do you want for an intimate relationship?

1612
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:06.290
And how are you going to handle temptations like alcohol and drug abuse?

1613
01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:08.150
Cause they take people down pretty frequently.

1614
01:36:08.151 --> 01:36:09.890
So all you have to do is think about,
okay,

1615
01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:15.680
what could that be like if you had what you needed,
not some wild fantasy but,

1616
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:20.300
but realistic in what you needed.
So that's the first part.
And then,

1617
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:21.711
okay,

1618
01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:25.370
now write for 20 minutes about what your life could be like three to five years

1619
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:29.780
down the road if all of this came together.
And then now do the opposite.

1620
01:36:29.781 --> 01:36:34.781
So imagine all your weaknesses and all the ways that you can go down the wrong

1621
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:37.700
path.
And then imagine that gets the upper hand.

1622
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:42.290
Then imagine where you are in three to five years.
So then you get a polarity,
a,

1623
01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:46.460
it's like not this and that.
And yes,
this.

1624
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:50.480
So you can run away from the things you don't want and you can run towards the

1625
01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:54.590
things you do want.
That gets your anxiety behind you instead of in front of you.

1626
01:36:54.591 --> 01:36:54.861
Right?

1627
01:36:54.861 --> 01:36:58.760
Because maybe you're going to go do something difficult and you're afraid of it.

1628
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:02.510
And then you think,
well,
if I don't do this,
I'm going to end up there.
It's like,

1629
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:06.620
oh,
okay,
that's so terrible that this little terrible is nothing.

1630
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.350
So,
and then in the next part of the exercise,

1631
01:37:09.351 --> 01:37:11.540
you turn that into an implementable plan,
you know,

1632
01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:14.540
and you write about why your life would be better and why your family's life

1633
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:16.760
would be better and while your community's life would be better.

1634
01:37:16.761 --> 01:37:21.761
So it's like fully articulated and we've tested about 10,000 university students

1635
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:27.020
with that now in three different locales and we've increased the probability

1636
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:30.680
that they'll stay in university by about 30% and raised their grade point

1637
01:37:30.681 --> 01:37:31.760
average about the same.

1638
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:35.960
And it's worked best for men who are most,

1639
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:39.540
who were doing the least well.
So in Holland,

1640
01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.940
those word nonwestern ethnic minority men and they improve their port

1641
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:48.620
performance enough to actually slightly exceed the Dutch national women who are

1642
01:37:48.621 --> 01:37:51.680
at the top otherwise over two years.
Yeah,
it was unbelievable.

1643
01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:52.700
It just blew us away.

1644
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:56.730
Psychological intervention to cure in hypothetically

1645
01:37:56.730 --> 01:38:00.750
<v 4>a sociological problem.
And so and so that,</v>

1646
01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:02.790
that's a good example of how,

1647
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:07.230
and it did what blew me away when I was first considering this as I had all

1648
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:10.860
these students,
21 years old and I realized that no one had ever sat them down,

1649
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:14.700
not even once in their entire career in education and said,
okay,

1650
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:20.280
who do you want to be like,
what sort of person is it that you want to be?

1651
01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:24.780
Not,
not job.
It's like character.
What do you want your life to be like?

1652
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:27.240
What should it be like and what shouldn't it be like?

1653
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:29.100
And like write about that seriously,

1654
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:32.270
like your life depends on it because it does.
And,

1655
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:35.040
and then I thought,
well that's so weird.

1656
01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:39.120
Why in the world isn't our education system set up to help people with that?

1657
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.910
Cause it's like that's kind of obvious,
you know,
it's like,

1658
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:44.400
what are you doing and why?

1659
01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:49.020
And then I did some reading partly from John Gatto whose done some interesting

1660
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:51.420
work looking at the history of the education system.

1661
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:56.070
And it was a derivation of the Prussian education system back in the late 18

1662
01:38:56.071 --> 01:39:00.870
hundreds and it was designed to produce obedient,
obedient,

1663
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.950
well it was partly soldiers,
but it was partly workers.

1664
01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.600
Oh I was going to say it definitely with soldiers.

1665
01:39:06.601 --> 01:39:08.130
Cause that was the transition when they,

1666
01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:10.680
they had the transition take place at that time as well,

1667
01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:14.730
where they moved away from centralized command to after they got beat by

1668
01:39:14.731 --> 01:39:16.920
Napoleon and they never,

1669
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:20.790
they were constantly trying to fight towards that direction where the soldiers

1670
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:24.210
would not just be obedient because they realize that that is not what they

1671
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:26.150
actually wanted.
They don't,

1672
01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.670
they finally started to do at the end of World War One and,

1673
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:32.340
and if they would've done it earlier,
it might have turned the tide of the war.

1674
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:36.780
But that was what,
you know,
that's what World War II,
the blitzkrieg and,

1675
01:39:36.781 --> 01:39:41.130
and total decentralized command and elements just going out and making things

1676
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:44.880
happen and finding gaps in the defenses and attacking them as opposed to you're

1677
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:47.730
just gonna wait until you're told what to do.
Right.
And that was the,

1678
01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:51.900
the German way and decentralized command.
Well,

1679
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:54.600
a competence beats obedience,
right?

1680
01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:59.310
So you unite people under a goal and then you let them act autonomously.

1681
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:03.720
You got to get them,
you got to not sell them the goal.
That's not right.
You know,

1682
01:40:03.721 --> 01:40:07.950
what you have to do is you have to go in and talk to them and discover what the

1683
01:40:07.951 --> 01:40:11.190
goal is of the enterprise and what it is that fires people up.

1684
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.190
And that really does work,
you know,

1685
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.670
and the idea that capitalism is essentially crooked and it's the people who are,

1686
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:22.140
who are pulling the wool over other people's eyes who when it's like,
well,

1687
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.161
you know,

1688
01:40:23.161 --> 01:40:28.161
now and then there's a criminal action and the person gets away with it,

1689
01:40:28.291 --> 01:40:31.260
so to speak.
Although people get away with a lot less than they think,

1690
01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.680
but most of the time within a functional company,

1691
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:38.730
you better have your people on board or they will do exactly what you said

1692
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.350
they'll do.
They'll spend 80% of their time sabotaging the company.
Yeah.
And I,

1693
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:44.191
again,

1694
01:40:44.191 --> 01:40:47.430
something I learned working with a corporate world and it was working with a

1695
01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:51.090
corporate world where I reflected on what I did.
And,

1696
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.600
and it was talking to a a leader or business leader at some point.
And I said,

1697
01:40:55.601 --> 01:40:57.580
well,
you know,
your people can understand why they're doing what they're doing.

1698
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.790
And so when he absorbs that and says,
okay,
that's makes sense.

1699
01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:03.460
And so then he gets up in front of his team and he says,
you know,

1700
01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.890
well the reason why we're doing this,

1701
01:41:04.891 --> 01:41:08.020
this is we want to improve our profitability as a company.

1702
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.340
And you know,
he sat down and we talked afterwards and you said,
did I,

1703
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:15.160
did I do good job?
Because now they understand that I said,
oh no,

1704
01:41:15.161 --> 01:41:16.720
actually doing cubist it.

1705
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:20.830
And then I started explaining to them better because I learned that what you

1706
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:21.670
have to explain,

1707
01:41:21.671 --> 01:41:26.470
there has to be a thread of why that goes all the way through the corporate

1708
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:30.970
reason.
But that why it has to come back down to the individual contributor.

1709
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:35.560
So they realize that when,
when we do better as a company,

1710
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:38.920
when we're more profitable as a company,
we can put more money in art,

1711
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:39.820
in marketing,

1712
01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.360
and we can produce stuff cheaper because we'll do it on a more mass scale,

1713
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:46.450
then we can lower prices and then we can actually hire more people.

1714
01:41:46.451 --> 01:41:49.120
And that's going to make you move up in this command here and you're gonna make

1715
01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:49.540
more money.

1716
01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.430
We're going to sell more stuff and you're going to get a bigger bonus.

1717
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:52.720
So you doing this,

1718
01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:55.190
the reason why you're doing it just because then you can achieve those life

1719
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.600
lessons because you want to buy that house,
that car and send your kid to school.

1720
01:41:58.690 --> 01:42:00.100
So there's a big difference.

1721
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:02.680
You need to make sure that the people understand why they're doing it,

1722
01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.890
not for the corporate reason,
not for the mission reason,
but for,

1723
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:08.890
for why it's going to help them.
The exact same thing you just said.

1724
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:12.610
It's also really helpful too if you,
you know,
your corporation has,

1725
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:16.450
I hate to use the word vision because that's,
you know,
it turned into a Buzzword,

1726
01:42:16.451 --> 01:42:17.284
but you know,

1727
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:21.280
it's often that you're working in a company where worthwhile things are

1728
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:24.700
happening,
exciting and worthwhile things you know,
and you're,
you're,

1729
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:28.660
you're trying to well make something better at a lower price,
let's say.

1730
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.770
And so there's the,
the,
the heroism,
let's say,

1731
01:42:32.771 --> 01:42:36.130
of producing a product that's going to have a positive impact on the world and

1732
01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:41.290
you need to know how your small actions are tied with that greater goal.

1733
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:45.280
And then there's this financial self interest as well.
And,
and the thing is,

1734
01:42:45.281 --> 01:42:49.420
if you don't,
if you can't tell your workers that story,

1735
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:53.740
then either your company is fundamentally corrupt because that isn't the true

1736
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:54.221
story.

1737
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:57.850
It's like you're actually working so that I can rape and pillage the company

1738
01:42:57.851 --> 01:43:00.940
over the next four years and take all the value out of it and run.

1739
01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:04.150
Because you know,
CEOs do that from time to time.
Yes.

1740
01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:08.050
Or you don't understand how the company works and you can't tell the story,

1741
01:43:08.051 --> 01:43:12.250
which means you're basically and competent.
So,
but well,

1742
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:17.550
people are not wired up so that they will work without knowing why unless you

1743
01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.110
beat them.
And then if you beat them,
you don't.

1744
01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:24.520
Don't be thinking that that's victory.
So it's a temporary victory.

1745
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:27.550
It's,
that's also something really good to know about marriage.

1746
01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:30.340
It's like you can never win an argument with your wife.

1747
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.810
Like you could if you only lived with her for one day.
Right?

1748
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:37.720
It's like I one see you later.
It's like,
no,
no,
she's there the next day.

1749
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:41.440
And then she's been,
she remembers that.
She does.
She does remember that.
Yeah.

1750
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:43.690
Maybe even more than you remember it.
You know?

1751
01:43:43.691 --> 01:43:48.580
And it also might be that she was right and you just out argued her.
So you know,

1752
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:51.650
and that's something that's really worth knowing too,
because sometimes you know,

1753
01:43:51.651 --> 01:43:54.290
you'll have an argument with,
well let's say with your wife,

1754
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:57.740
and she's got something to say and it's not very well articulated.

1755
01:43:57.850 --> 01:44:01.520
Same could be true for you.
And so you can just brush it aside.

1756
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:05.600
But you don't want to brush it aside because maybe there's something there and

1757
01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:08.540
if you don't address it,
then it's not like it's going to go away,
man.

1758
01:44:08.541 --> 01:44:12.590
It's going to grow.
So maybe you have to help her formulate her argument,

1759
01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:14.970
which is really annoying cause you want to win.

1760
01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.080
You have in this dispute like I want to win.
It's like,
well,

1761
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.460
you're not winning that game.
You're winning the game.
Well,

1762
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:24.530
I think about it as the game of games.

1763
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:29.180
You want to win the set of games that stretch across time,
the long war.
Yeah,

1764
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:30.260
that's right.
Exactly

1765
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.160
<v 3>the long that little battles knocked,
no matter.
And in fact,
I don't,</v>

1766
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:37.730
you should not try and be right.
If you're right,
everybody knows it's fine,

1767
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:38.800
but there's the worst thing.

1768
01:44:39.090 --> 01:44:42.810
<v 4>Rub It in and say I'm right and you're wrong.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1769
01:44:42.811 --> 01:44:45.540
You do that a hundred times and then like,
well,
you're the,

1770
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.050
you're the winner and she's the loser and then that's great because now you're

1771
01:44:49.051 --> 01:44:52.380
married to a loser.
I mean,
you know,
that's,

1772
01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:56.340
if you do that 100,000 times,
then your marriage is over and then,

1773
01:44:56.341 --> 01:44:59.160
and then there'll be hell to pay.
You can be sure of that.

1774
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.070
<v 3>I got asked the other day,
um,</v>

1775
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:08.050
what is the biggest problem in America?

1776
01:45:08.890 --> 01:45:11.470
And I thought about it,
I hadn't been asked that question lately.

1777
01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:13.570
I've been getting some good questions.
A lot of times like you,

1778
01:45:13.571 --> 01:45:15.280
I get the same questions over and over and over again,

1779
01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.560
but I got to ask what's the biggest problem in America?

1780
01:45:17.561 --> 01:45:20.680
And I thought about it for a second,
and this may or may not be right,

1781
01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:23.800
but I thought it was at least thought provoking.

1782
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:29.910
I said that the biggest problem that we have in America is that we don't have

1783
01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.280
any big problems.

1784
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:39.040
And if you look at us in World War Two during the depression,

1785
01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:43.030
during times where we've got major,
major problems,

1786
01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.180
the country kind of unifies and it,

1787
01:45:46.181 --> 01:45:51.130
and it gets behind itself and joins together.
And you know,

1788
01:45:51.131 --> 01:45:55.540
I,
I talked about,
you know,
that we,
we,
we live in a bubble here.

1789
01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.020
I kind of opened up with that as well.
And,
and that's good.

1790
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:03.400
Like I want there to be a bubble just like I want my family to live in a bubble

1791
01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:04.930
and I almost want,

1792
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:09.430
I almost want my daughter to really,

1793
01:46:09.431 --> 01:46:14.431
really think it's a real problem that there's not a strong wifi signal in her

1794
01:46:15.281 --> 01:46:19.300
bedroom.
And so sometimes it takes longer to do.
I,
I,

1795
01:46:19.301 --> 01:46:22.860
I've kind of succeeded as a dad if that's her problem,

1796
01:46:22.861 --> 01:46:27.400
if she sees that as a problem that,
you know,
it takes a little extra.
There's a,

1797
01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:30.430
there's a longer buffering time on some of her Netflix,
right?

1798
01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:33.670
I've done a good job if that's a problem because you know,

1799
01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:37.420
God can only imagine what kind of problems people really have.

1800
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:42.990
But sometimes I feel like in America and really in the West as a whole,

1801
01:46:43.210 --> 01:46:47.110
the problem is,
is that we don't have any major problems.

1802
01:46:47.111 --> 01:46:51.070
So now it's the Wifi in our bedroom.
We're getting crazy about and,
and,

1803
01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:53.190
and wanting to lash out about.

1804
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.820
And I guess my point here is that do we as individuals,

1805
01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:04.761
do we need to struggle there to keep us focused on the right things and as a

1806
01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.460
country or as a culture,

1807
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.620
do we need to have some level of struggle before we start looking at things that

1808
01:47:13.621 --> 01:47:18.300
don't matter and turning them into things that we perceive as actually
mattering?

1809
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:18.640
Yeah.

1810
01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.220
<v 2>Well you know a couple of things about that.</v>

1811
01:47:21.221 --> 01:47:26.221
Kierkegaard wrote about that back in the late 1850s there abouts and he said

1812
01:47:26.741 --> 01:47:30.850
there will come a time when the best thing that you could do for people would be

1813
01:47:30.851 --> 01:47:32.920
to make things more difficult.
Right.

1814
01:47:32.921 --> 01:47:35.950
And that's the thing because everyone's working so hard and making things
easier.

1815
01:47:35.951 --> 01:47:39.430
That will be,
they'll come a time when there's a felt sense for difficulty.

1816
01:47:39.431 --> 01:47:41.020
And I think we're at that point now.

1817
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:45.220
And I think that that's why this message of responsibility and truth is echoing

1818
01:47:45.221 --> 01:47:48.610
so nicely among,
particularly among young men.

1819
01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:53.020
Cause every time I talk about that in my public talks,
the room goes silent.

1820
01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:56.680
And that's really interesting.
And you know,
people are dead focused on it.

1821
01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.430
And so like enough rights and freedom.
It's like truth and risk,

1822
01:48:00.431 --> 01:48:02.410
low time for truth and responsibility.

1823
01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.910
And there's something noble about that and we haven't been able to talk about no

1824
01:48:05.911 --> 01:48:08.080
ability for God only knows how long,
you know.

1825
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:13.470
So I do think that's the case and I think it's a I and W and William James said

1826
01:48:15.431 --> 01:48:20.410
that what we need is a moral equivalent to war.
So something that's as serious,

1827
01:48:20.411 --> 01:48:22.480
but that is hopefully not as destructive.

1828
01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:25.870
And so I really liked that idea as well.
And so,

1829
01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.530
but I think that we are at that cake at that point,

1830
01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.160
if people would open their eyes a little bit because we have this unbelievable

1831
01:48:33.161 --> 01:48:33.994
culture,

1832
01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.020
this technological culture that does provide the degree of protection that you

1833
01:48:38.021 --> 01:48:41.680
described,
that's an ongoing miracle,
right?

1834
01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:45.670
It's absolutely unbelievable that any of this works at all.

1835
01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:48.910
And it could easily not work.
And if it didn't work,

1836
01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.890
there would be hell to pay and,

1837
01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.790
and to keep it working and to keep it moving forward,

1838
01:48:54.791 --> 01:48:58.600
especially with what's going to come over the next 10 years with,
with,

1839
01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.690
with artificial intelligence and the sorts of things that we're,

1840
01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:05.650
we're learning and inventing.
We better have our acts together.

1841
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:11.310
And so I think that you can get that warlike sense if you start to,

1842
01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:15.010
if you start to understand that you can take on your life like that.

1843
01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.030
That's also why I think it's so necessary to see the world as a battleground in

1844
01:49:19.031 --> 01:49:22.540
some sense between good and evil.
But you don't put the evil outside.

1845
01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:26.470
Like some of it's outside obviously,
but that's not your initial concern.

1846
01:49:26.471 --> 01:49:29.560
Your initial concern is to get your act together right,

1847
01:49:29.561 --> 01:49:33.340
to take on the burden of being,
to bear the suffering.
Like you said,

1848
01:49:33.341 --> 01:49:36.400
you found that when you went out into combat that you know,

1849
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:40.690
you might've been wary of death,
which is perfectly reasonable,

1850
01:49:40.691 --> 01:49:44.380
but that you weren't afraid of it to the point where it would paralyze you.

1851
01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.010
Well that's a useful thing to know,
you know,
because it means that you're

1852
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.570
<v 4>different than you thought you were.
You know,</v>

1853
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:53.470
because people are afraid of suffering and death and especially if they've been

1854
01:49:53.471 --> 01:49:57.880
completely and constantly sheltered from it.
But you can discover,

1855
01:49:57.881 --> 01:50:01.930
and lots of people do that if they actually confronted that they can tolerate it

1856
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:03.100
far better than they thought.
I mean,

1857
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:06.970
think about all the people who work in like palliative care wards,
you know,

1858
01:50:06.971 --> 01:50:08.920
or in funeral parlors for that matter,

1859
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:13.570
like they're confronting death on an ongoing basis and yet every day they go to

1860
01:50:13.571 --> 01:50:15.310
work.
So people are tough.

1861
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:20.170
And so I think there is a responsibility that everybody can take up.

1862
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:23.020
And I think the responsibility is something like,
well,

1863
01:50:23.021 --> 01:50:27.550
we need to decide if we're going to collectively and individually tilt the world

1864
01:50:27.551 --> 01:50:29.650
towards heaven are tilted towards hell.

1865
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.260
We saw what hell was like in the 20th century.

1866
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:36.940
I could be back at our doorstep in no time flat and we should have learned that.

1867
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:41.140
And it's necessary for people to understand the relationship between their

1868
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:45.310
individual actions and the direction of culture as a whole.
You know,

1869
01:50:45.311 --> 01:50:48.670
look at that guy in charge of Charlottesville,
you know,

1870
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:53.700
that was one guy and he probably increased polarization in the United States by

1871
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:55.750
like 5% or something.
You know,

1872
01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.250
it doesn't take very many individual actions of that pathological sort to tip

1873
01:51:00.251 --> 01:51:01.900
things in a very terrible direction.

1874
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:07.740
So one of the things I've been telling the people who've been watching my videos

1875
01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:13.441
and in the live conversations is that you have to take yourself seriously.

1876
01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:18.130
You have to know that you're a monster and that you're capable of terrible

1877
01:51:18.131 --> 01:51:19.840
things and that it's,

1878
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:24.160
and that you have a responsibility to understand that,
to incorporate it,

1879
01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:25.850
to constrain it and to discipline it.

1880
01:51:25.851 --> 01:51:30.851
And then to work for the alleviation of suffering and the constraint of

1881
01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:34.030
malevolence.
And if you understand that,

1882
01:51:34.031 --> 01:51:39.031
then it can turn your life into a noble enterprise and then you have some self

1883
01:51:40.601 --> 01:51:44.920
respect,
which beats the hell out of self esteem in my estimation.
So,

1884
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:48.730
and I don't think that that's a difficult message for people to understand.

1885
01:51:48.731 --> 01:51:50.530
I think they know that at a fundamental level.

1886
01:51:50.531 --> 01:51:53.620
And I think at the moment they're starving to death for it.

1887
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:56.603
The

1888
01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:01.140
<v 0>subordinate principles.
So the,
the,
the thing</v>

1889
01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.560
when you talk about this elevated state,
this elevated thing,

1890
01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.340
I think I've figured out that what you're talking about is essentially truth.

1891
01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:17.250
That is that to you sort of the,

1892
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.400
what we need to do is deal in truth on a daily basis in our own lives and,

1893
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.580
and in the lives with people around us.

1894
01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:29.700
<v 4>Well I think it's two things like in,
in a,
in,
in,</v>

1895
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:31.920
in sort of classical Christian morality.

1896
01:52:31.921 --> 01:52:36.270
And I bring it up cause it's sort of at this substructure of Western ethics,

1897
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:39.510
there's two things.
There's truth and love and,

1898
01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:43.980
and you know both of those words or even hard to say because they'd be mouth to

1899
01:52:43.981 --> 01:52:44.814
death but,

1900
01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:49.010
but they have in some sense they have a deep technical meeting and if you know

1901
01:52:49.011 --> 01:52:49.371
that,

1902
01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:54.371
then it kind of reignites their power and love is the decision that being is

1903
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:58.550
worthwhile and should and that you should struggle to support and improve it.

1904
01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:03.770
And that's not a trivial thing because being is rife with suffering and I,

1905
01:53:03.771 --> 01:53:07.520
everyone dies,
everyone gets sick.
Like,
it's,
it's brutal,

1906
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:10.010
it's brutal and it's easy to turn against it.

1907
01:53:10.011 --> 01:53:15.011
And so the idea that you're going to voluntarily accept responsibility for that,

1908
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.760
assume that it's good or act as if it's good and try to improve it.

1909
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.500
It's no trivial matter.

1910
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:25.520
And that means you have to scour out the resentment and the arrogance and the

1911
01:53:25.521 --> 01:53:28.200
deceit.
And primarily,
and,
and,

1912
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:32.360
and it's sort of based on this idea I would say is like,
well,

1913
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:34.520
life is very hard obviously,

1914
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:38.990
but we're not doing everything we could to make it better.

1915
01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:42.080
And we're often doing things to make it worse.

1916
01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.100
So even if it is suffering,
which is true,

1917
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:50.450
we have no idea how much we could ameliorate that if we all put our efforts into

1918
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:54.050
it.
And so that's a genuine question.
It's like,
yeah,

1919
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:57.380
there's reasons to shake your fist and curse God.
I mean,

1920
01:53:57.381 --> 01:53:59.180
everyone ends up in a situation like that.

1921
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:02.600
Someone they love gets a terrible illness and disintegrates before their eyes,

1922
01:54:02.601 --> 01:54:02.871
you know,

1923
01:54:02.871 --> 01:54:06.440
and maybe they're a really good person and they've done nothing you would think

1924
01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:10.340
of to deserve that.
And you know that terrible fate is visited upon them.

1925
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:14.300
It's very difficult not to get cynical and angry under such circumstances.

1926
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:18.410
But then while that takes you down a very bad road if you do that,

1927
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.760
but it doesn't,
it doesn't,
it doesn't change the fundamental question.

1928
01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:26.330
It's like if your life isn't everything you think it should be,

1929
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:30.920
you have to ask yourself if you're doing everything you can because you actually

1930
01:54:30.921 --> 01:54:34.280
don't get to make a judgment about the structure of being until you do

1931
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:38.510
everything you can.
And I would say that's love.
Essentially that's the decision.

1932
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.430
And then truth is the best,

1933
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:46.510
the best strategy with regards to that attainment and how could it be otherwise.

1934
01:54:46.971 --> 01:54:49.190
Like if you're going to contend with reality,

1935
01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.470
you bloody well better know what it is.

1936
01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:57.140
In truth isn't your grandmothers,
you know,
you're,

1937
01:54:57.141 --> 01:55:01.280
you're,
you're too tight laced grandmothers moral finger wagging.

1938
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.060
It's like the truth of existence is brutal and bitter.

1939
01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:10.660
And so to be able to face that and to admit to the things that you are and to,

1940
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.210
and to communicate them with other people,

1941
01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.480
especially in an intimate relationship,
it's like that's,

1942
01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.480
that's no cowardly morality.
That's not the morality of cowardice.

1943
01:55:23.481 --> 01:55:24.800
Quite the contrary.
You know,

1944
01:55:24.801 --> 01:55:29.390
Nisha said you could assess the spirit of a man by determining how much truth he

1945
01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:32.390
can tolerate.
It's like that's,
that's the right,

1946
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:34.580
that's the right way of thinking about truth.
Well,

1947
01:55:34.581 --> 01:55:39.050
you opened this whole podcast with some truth.
It's like,
who wants to hear that?

1948
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:43.710
You know,
and people think,
oh,
that's so terrible.
And they don't think,
well,

1949
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:45.840
could I be one of those isis guys?

1950
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:50.160
It's like I can tell you if you're bitter enough,
especially if you hate women,

1951
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:50.401
you know,

1952
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:54.030
cause they've rejected you because you're such a so goddamn useless that no

1953
01:55:54.031 --> 01:55:57.240
woman in their right mind would look at you twice.
You know,

1954
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:00.030
that'll generate plenty of bitterness in your soul.

1955
01:56:00.031 --> 01:56:03.180
And if you don't think that you could act like that under those conditions,

1956
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:07.860
then you're not even watching your own fantasies.
So

1957
01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:11.910
truth in the service of the betterment of being.

1958
01:56:11.911 --> 01:56:14.340
It's something like that and that's,

1959
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:18.570
that's enough to give your life.
Meaning I don't care where you start.

1960
01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:23.520
Like I had this kid come and visit me while back and he had never left his home

1961
01:56:23.521 --> 01:56:25.320
state and he was,

1962
01:56:25.321 --> 01:56:29.850
I think he was 19 and he was overprotected and over sheltered and he was a smart

1963
01:56:29.851 --> 01:56:30.121
kid.

1964
01:56:30.121 --> 01:56:34.470
And so of course he also thought that the world really hadn't appreciated his

1965
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:38.970
gifts,
which is very common feeling for smart kids who,

1966
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:42.240
who aren't getting anywhere.
Right.
They get really angry about that.

1967
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:47.340
And then he decided that he was going to move out of his house and he took a job

1968
01:56:47.341 --> 01:56:51.150
as a dishwasher and he said he tried to do a good job as a dishwasher.

1969
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:54.990
It's like good.
That's some humility.
It's just a dishwashing job,
but you know,

1970
01:56:54.991 --> 01:56:59.580
you can be a good dishwasher and then the restaurant runs better and then it's

1971
01:56:59.581 --> 01:57:02.820
kind of fun.
As long as the people you're working with are half decent,

1972
01:57:02.821 --> 01:57:06.240
you can make good social relationships and then you can learn to be social which

1973
01:57:06.241 --> 01:57:10.680
was happening to him.
And then maybe they let you be a short order cook,
you know,

1974
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:13.410
and you got a bit of a clue and then you have a bit of money and you have a

1975
01:57:13.411 --> 01:57:18.300
little independence and it's a lot better than being at home and being bitter

1976
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:22.320
and resentful and immature.
You know,
it's just a dishwashing job.

1977
01:57:22.321 --> 01:57:25.170
Well that's the wrong way of thinking about it.
It's like it's,

1978
01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:30.360
it's the first door that's open to you,
you know,
and then he came up to Toronto,

1979
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:33.720
he had never been out of his home state so it was a big deal for him to come to

1980
01:57:33.721 --> 01:57:36.000
another city.
And when he first came to talk to me,

1981
01:57:36.001 --> 01:57:38.220
it was outside of one of my lectures.
He couldn't even speak.

1982
01:57:38.221 --> 01:57:41.190
He was so nervous cause he had pretty high levels of social anxiety.

1983
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:45.540
So it was tongue tied and I invited him to come over to my house to talk to him

1984
01:57:45.541 --> 01:57:48.720
cause I knew there was something up with him and he told me the story,
you know,

1985
01:57:48.721 --> 01:57:53.130
and I thought,
well you know,
that's the beginnings of a heroic journey.

1986
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.390
He was able to humble himself enough so that you know,
if you're low,

1987
01:57:57.690 --> 01:57:59.160
if you're in a low place,

1988
01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.810
it's a low door that's going to open and you might think I'm too high to crawl

1989
01:58:03.811 --> 01:58:07.770
through that low door.
Young said,
Carl Jung said people,

1990
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:10.440
modern people don't see God cause they don't look low enough.

1991
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:13.290
I really liked that idea,
but that's it.
If you're in a low place,

1992
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:18.600
the opportunity that presents itself to you is going to be low and it's going to

1993
01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:21.300
be very tempting to you cause you're arrogant,
resentful to say,

1994
01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.970
well that's not good enough for me.
It's like,

1995
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:29.610
well do you have an alternative?
If you don't have an alternative,

1996
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:34.170
then an in shop is up and it's the right trajectory.
You know?

1997
01:58:34.171 --> 01:58:38.100
And so that's humility.
That's humility.
It's like you're low,

1998
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:44.470
you take what you take,
what's given to you and you see if you can make it work.

1999
01:58:44.471 --> 01:58:46.810
And the thing is that works way faster than people think.

2000
01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:49.360
Even because I worked as a dishwasher when I was a kid,
you know,

2001
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.520
for you for a year or so.

2002
01:58:51.521 --> 01:58:54.520
And it was really hard to begin with because I didn't know what I was doing in

2003
01:58:54.521 --> 01:58:56.260
the German chef who is kind of a tough guy,

2004
01:58:56.261 --> 01:58:59.920
just let me flounder around for two weeks to see if I would quit.

2005
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:03.280
So I was there till like three in the morning and I was 13 I think.

2006
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:06.610
I couldn't wash all these damn dishes.
I thought it was impossible.

2007
01:59:06.611 --> 01:59:09.220
I told my dad at one point,
I said,
I don't know if I can do this.

2008
01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:12.910
It's like I'm working as hard as I can and they keep piling up,
you know?

2009
01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:17.040
But I didn't stop.
And then the German cook,
you know,

2010
01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:19.780
who had been treating me pretty harshly at one day he said,
okay,

2011
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:21.340
I'll show you how to do this.

2012
01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:24.340
And then he showed me how to organize the dishes and everything.
And it was like,

2013
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:28.690
that was not no problem,
I can do it.
And like 10% of the time.

2014
01:59:28.691 --> 01:59:31.600
So then I cleaned up the rest of the kitchen and I had a good time mark and boat

2015
01:59:31.601 --> 01:59:33.790
with the chefs and we played around a lot back there.

2016
01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:37.180
And I ended up working as a short order cook and I learned to cook and all of

2017
01:59:37.181 --> 01:59:41.560
that.
And that was a good part of my adolescence.
But,
but the thing is,

2018
01:59:41.561 --> 01:59:44.770
so the thing is,
is that those trivial jobs,

2019
01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:49.600
it's the conception of their triviality that makes them trivial.

2020
01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:53.020
They're not trivial,
not if you do them right.

2021
01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:55.840
And if you're around people who have any sense,
you know,

2022
01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:59.170
sensible people are always looking around for other people who can do things

2023
01:59:59.171 --> 02:00:02.380
right.
And if they see you trying to do things right,

2024
02:00:02.381 --> 02:00:07.330
the probability that they'll open a door for you is virtually 100% cause it's

2025
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:12.130
kind of rare,
you know,
so they're going to be skeptical to begin with to see,

2026
02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:16.360
you've got to prove your mettle,
let's say.
But as soon as you do,
they'll think,

2027
02:00:16.361 --> 02:00:16.661
okay,

2028
02:00:16.661 --> 02:00:19.840
well we'll give this kid a little bit more opportunity and see what happens.

2029
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.950
And you know,

2030
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:24.430
to not think that's how the world works is to be extraordinarily cynical because

2031
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:27.130
that is how it works in,
in a functioning society.

2032
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:32.190
I mean I work with businesses all the time and there is the they,

2033
02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:36.300
anybody that is just above normal competency in anything,

2034
02:00:36.301 --> 02:00:39.450
even that that's going to try it.
I mean that's going to put effort in.
They,

2035
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:42.820
they love those people and those people are going to do well and you're

2036
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:43.511
absolutely right.

2037
02:00:43.511 --> 02:00:47.710
The doors are absolutely going to open for them if they do what they're trying

2038
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:50.290
to do to the best of their ability and doing a competent job at it.

2039
02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:53.860
Well the other thing that's interesting is what happens to people who aren't

2040
02:00:53.861 --> 02:00:58.861
trying because what happens to them is like they're in a place where there's a

2041
02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.930
thousand doors in front of them that are invisible.

2042
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.130
They don't know the doors are there and they could either be opened or closed.

2043
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:10.150
And so if they're one of these people who is going above and beyond the call of

2044
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:13.420
duty,
unless the organization is entirely corrupt,
right?

2045
02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:14.530
And that happens sometimes.

2046
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:17.980
Then there are people who are watching and they'll start to open these invisible

2047
02:01:17.981 --> 02:01:22.180
doors and then all of a sudden the person has opportunities in front of them and

2048
02:01:22.181 --> 02:01:25.930
they don't even know why some of the time,
right?
Because someone said,
you know,

2049
02:01:25.931 --> 02:01:28.450
gave a positive word to someone else and said,
well,

2050
02:01:28.451 --> 02:01:31.660
you could take a look at this kid.
And,
and so these doors open.

2051
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:36.130
And then the people who are in their grudgingly and bitterly,

2052
02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:40.880
it's like people watch that and they're the people who are the gatekeepers and

2053
02:01:40.881 --> 02:01:44.990
they just closed the doors and then the person looks up and there's nothing in

2054
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:47.630
front of them.
There's no open doors at all.
And they,
and then,

2055
02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:52.400
then they curse God,
you know,
for making such a miserable cosmos.
It's like,
no,

2056
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:54.860
you just don't understand what you just don't understand.

2057
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:58.760
What happened is like the fruits of your bitterness,

2058
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:05.210
your bitterness manifested fruit.
You don't even know it.

2059
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.980
You've delimited your options in a terrible way and you've closed,
you know,

2060
02:02:09.981 --> 02:02:11.600
you're,
you're,
you're walking down,

2061
02:02:12.110 --> 02:02:15.080
you're walking between cliff walls and they're getting closer and closer and

2062
02:02:15.081 --> 02:02:18.410
closer together,
and then you'll be stuck and you'll think,

2063
02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:21.530
how the hell did this happen?
And it happened because

2064
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:24.170
you didn't,

2065
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:31.210
you didn't avail yourself of the opportunities that presented themselves to you.

2066
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:36.950
So,
you know,
that's horrible.
But that's,
that's how it is.

2067
02:02:37.150 --> 02:02:39.850
<v 3>I get asked a quite often,
um,
you know,</v>

2068
02:02:39.851 --> 02:02:42.910
this guy got promoted and I should have gotten promoted.
What should I do now?

2069
02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:47.280
Or this person isn't carrying their load and,
and,
and they're,

2070
02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:51.070
they think I should do their work.
What should I do now?
And you know the answers.

2071
02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.610
Yeah.
Something,
someone wants you to do their work.
Do they want to do the work?

2072
02:02:54.611 --> 02:02:58.390
Yes.
I'll do that all day long.
Yeah.
You,
you,
you don't want to do your job.

2073
02:02:58.391 --> 02:03:00.970
That's fine.
I'll do it.
And actually I got,

2074
02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:02.780
I just answered a question where somebody said,
today,

2075
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.130
the guy's a friend of mine and he's not carrying as load.
What should I do?

2076
02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:09.700
And I said,
well,
how about you help him?
What's going on at home?

2077
02:03:09.701 --> 02:03:12.640
Or is he going through a divorce as he got issues,
kids sick?

2078
02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:15.130
How about you help them and say,
Hey,
let me,

2079
02:03:15.131 --> 02:03:18.460
let me take that off your plate right now because it two months or six months,

2080
02:03:18.461 --> 02:03:19.690
you might be the person that needs help.

2081
02:03:19.930 --> 02:03:23.200
You might be the person with a sick child,
but regardless of that,

2082
02:03:23.201 --> 02:03:25.960
maybe he's just is lazy and maybe he shouldn't be your front and maybe

2083
02:03:25.961 --> 02:03:29.350
eventually you won't be your friend.
But nonetheless,
the solution is the same.

2084
02:03:29.351 --> 02:03:32.520
If you don't want to do your work,
that's fine.
I'll do it.
That's such a funny,

2085
02:03:32.521 --> 02:03:32.830
funny thing.

2086
02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:33.850
<v 4>That's exactly right.</v>

2087
02:03:33.970 --> 02:03:38.020
Because you know what you want to do and in your job is make yourself

2088
02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:39.640
indispensable.
Right?

2089
02:03:39.641 --> 02:03:43.030
And the way you make yourself indispensable is by being indispensable.

2090
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:46.990
And the way you do that is by doing a bunch of things that if they're not done,

2091
02:03:46.991 --> 02:03:49.330
catastrophe occurs.
And that's exactly right.

2092
02:03:49.331 --> 02:03:53.450
So if there's someone around you and they're abdicating your their

2093
02:03:53.670 --> 02:03:57.760
responsibility and you can pick it up,
it's like what an opportunity.
You know,

2094
02:03:57.761 --> 02:04:00.940
it's,
you think,
well,
I'm not going to get credit for it.
It's like,
well,

2095
02:04:00.941 --> 02:04:04.630
first of all,
there's lots of different forms of credit,
but you learn.

2096
02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:09.400
And then when the company shrinks and they're looking at who to keep,
you know,

2097
02:04:09.401 --> 02:04:13.510
they think,
oh,
it turns out you're doing all sorts of,
so we can't do without you.

2098
02:04:13.511 --> 02:04:16.480
That's not what we expected.
We can't do without you.

2099
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:18.580
Here's some more things you could do.
You know?

2100
02:04:18.581 --> 02:04:22.500
And then you're also in a position to bargain.
You can say,
well look,
you know,
um,

2101
02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.520
in order for me to keep doing this level of responsibility,
you know,

2102
02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:32.350
I needed to be paid more because I have other options or,
or because it's just,

2103
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:36.580
or because that will make me more efficient.
But then you've got some power too,

2104
02:04:36.610 --> 02:04:38.130
because they need you.
And

2105
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.270
<v 2>so indispensability and that's power.
Indispensability as power,</v>

2106
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:43.223
not tyranny.

2107
02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:45.920
<v 3>So now,
um,</v>

2108
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:52.200
obviously we started off talking about some very negative stuff with,
with Isis.

2109
02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:56.340
And you've touched on this a little bit already,
but I,

2110
02:04:57.010 --> 02:04:59.610
I want to make sure we hit this hard enough.

2111
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:02.100
And that is for people to,

2112
02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:07.350
to live a better life,
to live a life that they're proud of,

2113
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:10.470
to live a life that they,
that,
that when they die,

2114
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:14.090
they don't regret the life that they lived.
And for me,
I mean,
I,

2115
02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:18.090
I tell people discipline equals freedom.
That the,
the hard work,

2116
02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:20.850
the doing the right thing.
Um,
you know,

2117
02:05:20.851 --> 02:05:25.050
I tell people to write down what you're supposed to do the next day before you

2118
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:28.170
go to bed and then you wake up and do the things that you're supposed to do.

2119
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:30.420
The things that you said you were supposed to do,

2120
02:05:30.421 --> 02:05:35.421
the things that you actually know are going to make you healthier and faster and

2121
02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:39.640
smarter and stronger and,
and make you more money and,

2122
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:41.310
and move you forward and help your family.

2123
02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.160
You just write those things down and then you go do them.

2124
02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.400
And that's essentially,

2125
02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:51.270
you've drawn that out on a large scale with,

2126
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:54.390
and you've described this somewhat with the experiment that you did with,

2127
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:58.170
with people writing down what they're supposed to do,
not just tomorrow,

2128
02:05:58.290 --> 02:06:02.790
but what their life,
that's the future offering program.
And that's,

2129
02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:06.950
that's really,
um,
been immensely beneficial for people.

2130
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:08.860
<v 2>It certainly seems to have been.
Um,</v>

2131
02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:14.080
it's that self authoring.com and we put up a discount code for your,

2132
02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:21.260
for your listeners.
It's willing,
um,
and so they can get 20% off it.

2133
02:06:21.261 --> 02:06:22.710
And it,
it,

2134
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:27.410
this system allows you to write an autobiography and to analyze your personality

2135
02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:31.760
flaws and virtues and to write a future plan and you can do all of those are one

2136
02:06:31.761 --> 02:06:36.350
of them.
Um,
but yeah,
it's,
it's extremely useful because,
um,

2137
02:06:36.530 --> 02:06:39.950
one of the things you can be virtually certain of in life is that you don't get

2138
02:06:39.951 --> 02:06:41.180
something you don't aim at.

2139
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:46.010
And one of the things that's interesting about that is often people will keep

2140
02:06:46.011 --> 02:06:48.560
their goals fuzzy because the,

2141
02:06:48.561 --> 02:06:52.280
one of the problems with specifying your goals as you specify your failures,

2142
02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.870
right?
If the goal is really fuzzy,

2143
02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:57.020
you're not sure when you fail and that then you can fool yourself,
you know,

2144
02:06:57.021 --> 02:06:59.360
really,
but you can kind of keep it foggy,

2145
02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.830
but you make your goal sharp and clear then well,
first of all,

2146
02:07:03.831 --> 02:07:06.860
then you know what to aim at.
And what's interesting is,
you know,

2147
02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:11.060
your brain is set up so that it reorganizes the world around your aims.

2148
02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:11.991
And that's not,

2149
02:07:11.991 --> 02:07:15.200
I've also written about this in 12 rules for life quite extensively.

2150
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:16.430
And that's not a metaphor.

2151
02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:20.240
Like we don't see much of the world because there's a lot of the world and there

2152
02:07:20.241 --> 02:07:24.500
isn't much of us.
And so we see what we aim at,
we aim with our eyes.

2153
02:07:24.710 --> 02:07:25.640
And here's an example.

2154
02:07:25.641 --> 02:07:29.810
So a great apes don't really have much of a white in their eyes,

2155
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:31.490
but human beings do.

2156
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.130
And the reason for that is that we've evolved to detect where else is looking.

2157
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.910
And so if I can't tell where you're looking,
I don't know what you're up to.

2158
02:07:40.090 --> 02:07:45.090
And then well over time that means I can't read you as well and we're more

2159
02:07:45.131 --> 02:07:48.700
likely to get in a dispute and one or the other of us is more likely to get

2160
02:07:48.701 --> 02:07:53.650
killed.
But it also means that your,
your probability of findings,

2161
02:07:53.651 --> 02:07:57.400
a successful mate decreases.
So we've evolved to have this very,

2162
02:07:57.401 --> 02:08:01.390
very visually evident.
I,
and so when we're looking at each other,

2163
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.040
we're always looking at our,
ah,

2164
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:07.660
our eyes because then we can tell where someone has pointed and then we can tell

2165
02:08:07.661 --> 02:08:11.440
what they're up to.
And so we're hunting creatures,

2166
02:08:11.441 --> 02:08:14.710
like we're aiming at a moving target and trying to track it all the time.

2167
02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:17.260
And so you have to specify your aim.

2168
02:08:17.261 --> 02:08:21.150
And the future authoring program helps people specify the Raymond.
It's,

2169
02:08:21.151 --> 02:08:24.370
it's more than one name.
It's like you have a highest aim,

2170
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:28.350
which you might say is to be a good person.
And then I would say,
well there's a,

2171
02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.580
there's a more elaborated aim than that.

2172
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:34.900
It's like you wanted to be able to constrain malevolence and work to decrease

2173
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:39.550
suffering.
It's something like that.
That's the highest aim.
And,
and then,

2174
02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:44.860
and then you have to decompose that into the things you do each day so that

2175
02:08:44.861 --> 02:08:49.300
there's a definite connection between all the micro-actions and the macro aim.

2176
02:08:49.301 --> 02:08:53.350
And then that gives dignity to what you're doing,
you know?
So,
you know,

2177
02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:56.410
if your race at home with your kids,
what,
what are you trying to do?

2178
02:08:56.750 --> 02:09:00.850
Where you're trying to raise them to be the kind of moral agents that will work

2179
02:09:00.851 --> 02:09:04.450
to constrain the evil in the world and to reduce suffering.
It's like,

2180
02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:06.730
and so that's what you're doing when you're changing a diaper.

2181
02:09:06.731 --> 02:09:09.910
If you're doing it carefully and with some respect and some love,

2182
02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:14.110
like it's a major league deal to be doing that and God knows who your kid is

2183
02:09:14.111 --> 02:09:15.310
going to be.
You know,

2184
02:09:15.311 --> 02:09:19.060
he could be the kid that shoots up Columbine or it could be stolen.

2185
02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:20.740
That wouldn't be so good.

2186
02:09:21.190 --> 02:09:25.300
Or he could be someone or she could be someone who is a positive benefit to the

2187
02:09:25.301 --> 02:09:30.280
world,
you know?
And so every child is a whole new realm of,
of,

2188
02:09:30.610 --> 02:09:34.180
of possibilities.
And so there's dignity in that if you understand that.

2189
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:39.310
So the future authoring program anyways helps people lay out a plan.

2190
02:09:39.311 --> 02:09:43.930
And I always suggest to people that they do it badly because you're not going to

2191
02:09:43.931 --> 02:09:47.680
do it perfectly.
And if you get perfectionistic,
it's going to stop you.
You know,

2192
02:09:47.681 --> 02:09:51.940
when you first start to plan,
you're probably only going to be about 20% right?

2193
02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:56.210
But zero,
the difference between zero and 20% is immense.

2194
02:09:56.230 --> 02:09:59.620
And we found with our research that even people who only spend an hour on it

2195
02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:05.070
benefits substantially in their ability to stick to what their next plan is now.

2196
02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:10.450
And you now,
you mentioned something earlier too,
just just a bit of Oh yes.

2197
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:13.180
About about scheduling.
Yeah.

2198
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:16.120
So one of the things I tell people,

2199
02:10:16.121 --> 02:10:18.940
so you say write down what you're going to do the next day before you go to bed.

2200
02:10:18.970 --> 02:10:20.210
That's good.
Because then you,

2201
02:10:20.211 --> 02:10:23.650
you've got a direction set when you wake up in the morning.
Hey,
so,

2202
02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.150
but I've told people to learn to use a schedule and people often hate schedules

2203
02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:30.360
because they act as their own tyrants,
right?

2204
02:10:30.370 --> 02:10:34.210
They say we have to do this unpleasant thing and then here's another unpleasant

2205
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:34.971
thing you have to do.

2206
02:10:34.971 --> 02:10:38.390
And then you have to do this unpleasant thing and you do that for about three

2207
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:41.470
days and you think tail with this,
I'm not doing that.
You know,

2208
02:10:41.471 --> 02:10:43.070
and you fall off the wagon.

2209
02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.650
That isn't what you're supposed to do with the schedule.

2210
02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:50.570
You're supposed to use it to design the days that you would like to have if you

2211
02:10:50.571 --> 02:10:54.020
were taking care of yourself.
And so some of that is,
you know,

2212
02:10:54.021 --> 02:10:55.520
you wake up in the morning and you think,

2213
02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:00.380
here's five things I have to do that if I don't do my life will be worse.

2214
02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:04.550
It's like paying bills for example,
or,
or,
or taking out the garbage.

2215
02:11:04.551 --> 02:11:07.370
It's like you have to do those because otherwise things degenerate.

2216
02:11:07.730 --> 02:11:09.650
So you've got to put some of those in the schedule.

2217
02:11:09.651 --> 02:11:13.430
Cause otherwise tomorrow is worse than today.
And that's a bad trajectory.

2218
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:16.400
But you also want to build in things.
You know,

2219
02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:19.940
you've got to act in some sense like you're dealing with a relatively

2220
02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:24.200
recalcitrant nine year old.
It's like so,
well here's some things you have to do.

2221
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:28.580
But here's some things that if you do,
you could reward yourself with.

2222
02:11:28.581 --> 02:11:32.390
And if you get the balance there between obligation and reward,
right,

2223
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:35.120
then you'll find that you're motivated to do the things.

2224
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:37.100
And that's what you want to do.
You want to do that.

2225
02:11:37.101 --> 02:11:40.910
So it's sustainable across days and weeks and months.
And so you gotta,

2226
02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:46.220
you gotta treat yourself like a good boss would treat a valued employee and not

2227
02:11:47.361 --> 02:11:51.770
like a tyrant would treat a slave because the slave will rebel.
And you know,

2228
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.220
people say,
well,
I don't follow through on my plans.
It's like,

2229
02:11:55.221 --> 02:11:56.930
well a,

2230
02:11:56.931 --> 02:12:00.740
they're probably not very well formulated and maybe you're doing them because of

2231
02:12:00.741 --> 02:12:04.730
an external moral obligation or something,
not really your plans,
right?

2232
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:08.000
And B,
you're acting like a tyrant and a slave,

2233
02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:10.460
and that's a bad relationship to have with yourself.

2234
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.230
So you want to treat yourself with some,
well,
the same way,

2235
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:16.880
that's the golden rule,
right?

2236
02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:22.160
It treat yourself as you would treat other people as you would have them.
Sorry,

2237
02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:25.970
treat other people as you would like to be treated.
It works both ways.

2238
02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:29.540
You also treat yourself like you treat other people properly.

2239
02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.990
So that's a necessary thing.
And often people don't do that.

2240
02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:36.150
But the scheduling is really important.
Actually,

2241
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:40.170
<v 3>I,
when I tell people,
because when I first started talking about this,</v>

2242
02:12:40.171 --> 02:12:43.250
people would start scheduling their day and they would just go,
you know,

2243
02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.070
minute by minute everything will be sculpted.

2244
02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:47.400
And you can't maintain that for multiple reasons.

2245
02:12:47.401 --> 02:12:51.420
Number one is no one wants to have a day like that where everything that you do

2246
02:12:51.450 --> 02:12:55.290
throughout the day,
minute to minute sucks.
It's things that you don't want to do.

2247
02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:58.860
So guess what?
After three days you say,
I'm not doing this anymore.
It's,
it sucks.

2248
02:12:58.861 --> 02:13:03.660
It's not fun.
And,
and so,
and the same thing with the task list.

2249
02:13:03.661 --> 02:13:06.390
People would push those off if they're not on the schedule.
So yeah,

2250
02:13:06.391 --> 02:13:09.300
I'd say put it on the schedule,
but then the thing I ended up telling people is,

2251
02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:13.980
you need to,
you need to number one,
schedule empty space in there where,

2252
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:16.510
because things are going to take longer and then you're gonna be off scheduled.

2253
02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:17.370
Then you'll be frustrated.

2254
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.680
So you scheduled that things are going to be just empty.

2255
02:13:19.681 --> 02:13:23.760
You're not going to do anything for,
for this hour before lunch.

2256
02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:25.860
You don't schedule anything.
You're not going to do anything.

2257
02:13:25.861 --> 02:13:26.694
You're not going to do anything there.

2258
02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:30.000
And the other thing is you schedule things that you actually want to do in there

2259
02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:31.860
and then you go and execute things that you want to do.

2260
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.770
You want to work out every day,
you know you should,
well maybe,

2261
02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:37.140
maybe if it's something you enjoy,
then you schedule it in there.

2262
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:38.370
If you enjoy going,

2263
02:13:38.371 --> 02:13:41.460
picking your kids up from school on Tuesdays and Thursdays because that's when

2264
02:13:41.461 --> 02:13:42.360
they do their running club,

2265
02:13:42.361 --> 02:13:45.120
then you schedule that in there so you can go and do that thing that you want to

2266
02:13:45.121 --> 02:13:47.520
do.
So you don't just schedule the things that suck.

2267
02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:50.520
You schedule the good things too.
And discipline equals freedom.

2268
02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.740
I say this all the time.
If you want to have more free time,

2269
02:13:52.741 --> 02:13:55.560
which is what people want,
then you need to have more discipline.
Time management,

2270
02:13:55.570 --> 02:13:58.650
you will end up with more free time.
I promise you.
I promise you you will.

2271
02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.620
The other thing I was thinking about and I,
I couldn't,
I,

2272
02:14:02.650 --> 02:14:07.400
I just kind of occurred to me now is people always tell people,
you know,

2273
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.900
come up with a goal and then write it down and then you're going to get there.

2274
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:12.540
And I was,
you know,
as you were talking about future authoring,

2275
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:15.780
what you had said earlier when you were describing the program in its infancy,

2276
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:19.590
what became future offering is I was saying,
well,

2277
02:14:19.591 --> 02:14:21.300
how do you get people to actually do this?
Well,

2278
02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:25.800
what's you've embedded in the program is the fear of what happens if you don't

2279
02:14:25.801 --> 02:14:27.660
do these things and where you're going to end up.

2280
02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:31.500
And people forget that people forget where they end up if they don't do what

2281
02:14:31.501 --> 02:14:35.070
they're supposed to do in life.
And I've explained this to my kids,

2282
02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:39.270
that when you look around and you see people that are doing things which are

2283
02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:43.740
self evidently not desirable things to be doing in life,

2284
02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.500
whether you're a bomb or whether you're doing a,
you know,

2285
02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:49.500
I was a dishwasher as well and I have an interesting story about that.

2286
02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:53.280
And I'll tell that at some point about a Scottish girl named Rosalind.

2287
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.040
She was older than me.
I was 13 and after you know,

2288
02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:03.140
several weeks of washing dishes and she was like maybe 17 or 18 and and anyways,

2289
02:15:04.141 --> 02:15:05.940
to make a long story short,
eventually I said,
hey,

2290
02:15:05.941 --> 02:15:08.490
do you want to like go to a movie or something with me?

2291
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:12.540
Cause I'd like to go to a movie with you.
And she looked at me and she said,

2292
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.580
Jocko,
you have a serious mental problem.

2293
02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:20.820
So Roslyn,
I know you're out there somewhere.
You broke my heart sister,

2294
02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:26.660
but I washed dishes and that's a good thing for a 13 year old to do.

2295
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:29.070
But when you're 18 okay,
now it's a little bit,

2296
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:31.560
you want to have moved up to be the short order cook.

2297
02:15:31.561 --> 02:15:35.370
And by the time you're 25 you want to be in charge of the whole kitchen.

2298
02:15:35.371 --> 02:15:39.390
And by the time you're 30 you want to maybe run the nighttime shift and,

2299
02:15:39.730 --> 02:15:42.540
and that's a good progression.
And that's good.
What?

2300
02:15:42.541 --> 02:15:47.370
You don't want to be 35 and 40 40 years old out at the dishwashing stage.

2301
02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.530
You don't want to be there.
And I explained to my kids,

2302
02:15:49.531 --> 02:15:53.700
cause you can see people that are at that stage in their life and sure there's a

2303
02:15:53.701 --> 02:15:58.701
chance that maybe they had some hardship that came along that that that hit them

2304
02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.370
and it put them in this position and now they have to build back up again and

2305
02:16:02.371 --> 02:16:04.920
they're waiting for those windows of Harburg doors of opportunity to open up.

2306
02:16:04.921 --> 02:16:08.940
And that's okay.
But a lot of times it's because they didn't work,

2307
02:16:08.941 --> 02:16:12.840
they didn't make good decisions,
they didn't do the best job that they could.

2308
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:17.790
And so they end up in these positions that they shouldn't be in.
And it's,

2309
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:22.710
and I tell my kids that those are real people that are in those positions.

2310
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.880
Like we're going to leave this restaurant and we're going to go home and we're

2311
02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:30.160
going to do what we do.
That guys going to be there for five

2312
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.950
<v 4>more hours because it's nine o'clock he's got to clean everything.</v>

2313
02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:35.350
When they get done,
he's going to be there for five more hours.

2314
02:16:35.351 --> 02:16:37.600
Then he's got to mop the floor and you know what he's doing tomorrow.

2315
02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:40.000
The same thing he was doing the night after that.
The same thing.

2316
02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:43.870
It's a real person and I hope it's a 14 year old.
I hope it's a 16 year old.

2317
02:16:43.871 --> 02:16:47.410
I hope it's even an 18 year old,
but I hope it's not a 48 year old,

2318
02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.230
but there are 48 year olds that end up in that position.

2319
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:53.230
And what you do in this program is you,

2320
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.190
you explained that you can end up there and actually being a 48 year old

2321
02:16:57.191 --> 02:17:00.540
dishwasher is actually pretty positive too to where some of the Canada oh

2322
02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.110
definitely.
Which is addicted to drugs,
addicted to alcohol or,
or,
or whatever.

2323
02:17:05.290 --> 02:17:08.860
Well then everybody kind of has a sense of where they would end up if they let

2324
02:17:08.861 --> 02:17:13.670
things auger down,
you know,
and everybody has their,

2325
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:18.640
their specific weaknesses that,
that their faults would exploit.
You know,

2326
02:17:18.641 --> 02:17:21.400
and some people would end up homeless and some people would end up with a

2327
02:17:21.401 --> 02:17:24.910
physical illness or a psychiatric illness and some people would end up addicted

2328
02:17:24.911 --> 02:17:26.830
and some people would end up cruel.

2329
02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.970
But everybody kind of knows where they would had,
cause they've seen it,

2330
02:17:30.971 --> 02:17:32.350
they've seen it rise up.

2331
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:36.460
And it's really useful to be terrified of that as if it's a possibility,

2332
02:17:36.610 --> 02:17:39.280
you know,
that's a heaven and hell essentially.
It's like,
okay,

2333
02:17:39.281 --> 02:17:42.640
well how do you mean as if it's a possibility?
It's a possibility.
Yeah,

2334
02:17:42.641 --> 02:17:45.720
definitely.
Absolutely.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,
and,

2335
02:17:45.730 --> 02:17:47.950
and all you have to do to get there as do nothing.

2336
02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:50.290
I kill just drift there all by yourself.

2337
02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:54.100
So not only is it a possibility to actually rather high possibility,

2338
02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:57.160
and so you have to make that realistic enough,

2339
02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.570
which means that you have to take an inventory of your weaknesses.
Let's say.

2340
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:05.110
You have to make that realistically enough so you're actually terrified of it

2341
02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:09.400
because then that's a great motivation.
And in my clinical practice,

2342
02:18:09.401 --> 02:18:13.000
people are often faced with tough decisions like,
well,
you know,

2343
02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.920
I'm not happy at my job and I'm afraid to leave it.

2344
02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:21.610
Fair enough.
You know?
That's a big deal.
Okay.

2345
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.250
How afraid are you of not leaving it?
Let's lay that out.
Because you know,

2346
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:32.280
one of the peculiarities of human thought is that you do get used to the devil,

2347
02:18:33.281 --> 02:18:36.040
you know,
and then you,
you downplay it,

2348
02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:41.940
but it's very often that's staying in the same place will do you in.

2349
02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:45.070
It's much worse than the risk that you'll take.
You know?
And I mean,

2350
02:18:45.071 --> 02:18:48.550
I'm practical with us.
I say,
look,
if you're going to stop your job,
let's,

2351
02:18:48.551 --> 02:18:53.260
let's have a clue about this,
right?
Get your CV together,
right.

2352
02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:57.250
Start seeing what other options you have because you don't want to just step off

2353
02:18:57.251 --> 02:18:59.590
a cliff that's not helpful.
Um,

2354
02:19:00.610 --> 02:19:03.970
organize yourself so that you've got enough strength to go through the process

2355
02:19:03.971 --> 02:19:05.500
of finding a new job.
You know,

2356
02:19:05.501 --> 02:19:06.960
you're going to have to get used to be an interview.

2357
02:19:06.961 --> 02:19:09.070
Do you got to think that through?
Maybe we can practice that.

2358
02:19:09.071 --> 02:19:10.540
So you've got to set yourself up for it,

2359
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:14.050
but you really want to think through the cost of inaction.

2360
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:16.240
And that's something people generally don't do.

2361
02:19:16.241 --> 02:19:21.241
And this is also one of the useful features of having a tragic view of life,

2362
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:26.500
let's say.
Because most of the time,
often you're screwed either way,

2363
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:30.260
but you get to pick which one and that's a big deal.
It's like there's,

2364
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:33.410
there's risks on both paths and their major risks.

2365
02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:38.270
And that's actually freeing because you know,
well,
there's trouble both ways.

2366
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:41.180
So that frees you up because if you think,
well,

2367
02:19:41.181 --> 02:19:43.790
this is the safe path and this is the dangerous path,

2368
02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:46.760
well then you're not going to take the dangerous path.
But if you think,
well,

2369
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:51.860
I've got danger a or danger be,
and this is where I would rather bet my future,

2370
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:54.860
while that's way better,
and I've had many,

2371
02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:58.370
many clients that I've helped with their careers and we do exactly doubt,

2372
02:19:58.371 --> 02:20:00.770
it's like,
you know,
okay,
what's our goal?

2373
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:03.620
Our goal is to triple your salary in four years.
They think,

2374
02:20:03.621 --> 02:20:07.400
well that's not possible.
It's like,
well,
we'll try for doubling,

2375
02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:09.410
but you don't know it's possible.
You got to,

2376
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:13.100
let's get it together and you've got to get over being afraid of looking for a

2377
02:20:13.101 --> 02:20:15.620
job.
You got to get over being afraid of being interviewed.

2378
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:20.240
You have to put yourself together so that you've got options and then you got to

2379
02:20:20.241 --> 02:20:24.070
start to push.
You don't know you might be able to do it.
Well,
it's,
it's,

2380
02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:28.490
it's quite surprising how frequently that works,
you know?

2381
02:20:28.491 --> 02:20:32.390
And that assumes that people are trying,
right.
They're competent,
you know,

2382
02:20:32.391 --> 02:20:32.930
it's not,

2383
02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:37.190
this isn't me waving a magic wand or anything like that and it takes a lot of

2384
02:20:37.191 --> 02:20:40.610
work.
You know,
like if you're going to switch jobs,
you might have to,

2385
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:45.440
I figure 50 to one failure to success.
It's something like that.

2386
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:47.870
And it's useful to know the baselines as well,
right.

2387
02:20:47.871 --> 02:20:49.380
Because looking for a job is,

2388
02:20:49.410 --> 02:20:53.690
can be very disheartening unless you know the baselines.
It's like,
well yeah,

2389
02:20:53.691 --> 02:20:57.290
50 inch,
50 resumes for one interview.
Don't take it personally.

2390
02:20:57.770 --> 02:21:00.980
It's just how it is.
So it's not that you're a screw up,

2391
02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:06.110
it's that there are way more resumes than there are jobs and,
and,

2392
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:08.750
um,
that can also,
and then,
you know,

2393
02:21:08.751 --> 02:21:11.900
don't look for a job for eight hours a day because you only be able to do that

2394
02:21:11.901 --> 02:21:16.490
for three days and then you'll die.
You look for a job an hour a day.

2395
02:21:16.491 --> 02:21:20.150
If you already have one for an hour a day or half an hour a day for three
months,

2396
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:25.160
two resumes a day,
three resumes a day,
you'll find a job.
It'll take awhile.
I,

2397
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:28.400
one of my clients took like three years,
you know,
to get her first break.

2398
02:21:28.850 --> 02:21:32.150
But then right after that she got another one and then right after that she got

2399
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:34.310
another one.
But she stuck it out.
And you know,

2400
02:21:34.311 --> 02:21:37.080
it was brutal cause she had interviews and they didn't go,
you know,

2401
02:21:37.081 --> 02:21:39.570
they get the job that she didn't like at the time.
Yeah.

2402
02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:41.600
But I also say to people like,
you know,

2403
02:21:41.601 --> 02:21:46.340
generally stay in your job because you're way more likely to get a new job when

2404
02:21:46.341 --> 02:21:48.040
you have a job.
Yeah.
So

2405
02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:53.090
<v 0>I always tell people,
yeah,
cause I get the same exact thing.
Hey,
I'm in this job,</v>

2406
02:21:53.091 --> 02:21:56.000
it's miserable.
I don't like it.
Uh,
want to leave tomorrow,

2407
02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:00.800
but I don't have the courage.
And I've said,
actually,

2408
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:03.950
it's going to take you more courage to stay in your current job,

2409
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:07.490
formulate an exit strategy,
save up money,

2410
02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:09.650
start putting together a better resume,

2411
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:12.200
get some technical skills that you might not have right now.

2412
02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:15.440
Do all that while you're suffering in this job that you don't like.

2413
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:19.550
So that when you make the transition,
which will come,
it'll be the right way.

2414
02:22:19.610 --> 02:22:22.490
And you won't end up,
like you said,
jumping off of a cliff.
Yeah.

2415
02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:26.670
<v 4>Well,
it also makes you hopeful,
even in the terrible,
because you know,</v>

2416
02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:29.520
then you've got some hope and hope is a big deal.
You can,

2417
02:22:29.521 --> 02:22:31.980
you can put up with a lot of misery if you've got hope.

2418
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:37.340
But if you think I'm miserable today and I'm going to be miserable Mauro,

2419
02:22:37.441 --> 02:22:41.900
and next year I'm going to be older and just as miserable.
It's like,
that's,

2420
02:22:41.930 --> 02:22:46.200
that's not good.
But if you think,
well,
I've got a plan,
you know,
that's,

2421
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:50.790
that's a whole different story and it's a good idea of for those veterans that

2422
02:22:50.791 --> 02:22:55.710
are out there,
don't just get out,
formulate a plan,

2423
02:22:55.711 --> 02:23:00.270
figure out where you're going to go and have that in place.
And then you get out,

2424
02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:01.051
you step into,
yeah,

2425
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:05.100
well I'd really like to see the military use this future authoring program for

2426
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:08.910
people who are decommissioning because you need,
you know,

2427
02:23:08.911 --> 02:23:12.450
your idea that you need the next mission is that,
that's exactly right.
You know,

2428
02:23:12.451 --> 02:23:15.630
life is like a series of missions forward,
you know,

2429
02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:19.890
and nested in something greater than that I think.
But you do,

2430
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.080
you need to have a plan and you know it,

2431
02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.380
you've got to kind of hold the plan loosely,
you know,

2432
02:23:25.381 --> 02:23:28.230
so because you're gonna make mistakes formulating it.

2433
02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:32.490
But the way it works basically is the aim at something in the future.

2434
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:36.990
And so then you start moving forward and as you move forward,

2435
02:23:36.991 --> 02:23:39.960
you accrue more experience and more information.

2436
02:23:39.961 --> 02:23:41.910
Sometimes that's through failure,
doesn't matter,

2437
02:23:41.911 --> 02:23:44.460
but you're not staying in the same place.
So you're actually growing.

2438
02:23:44.461 --> 02:23:48.150
Even if you're,
even if you're doing badly,
if you learn from those mistakes,

2439
02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:53.480
and so then you move towards the goal and your perspective shifts and then you

2440
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:56.610
might have to modify the goal a bit because now you're a little smarter.

2441
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:58.950
You think,
well,
that other goal wasn't helpful.
It's like,

2442
02:23:58.951 --> 02:24:03.270
yes it was because it moved you an inch farther ahead.
And so you know,
you,

2443
02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:08.280
you kind of approached the final goal in a zig zag manner and the zigs and zags

2444
02:24:08.791 --> 02:24:12.240
get less extreme as you get closer to the final goal.

2445
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:14.460
But you have to do a lot of zigzagging to begin with.

2446
02:24:14.461 --> 02:24:16.830
So you've got to give yourself that space for error.

2447
02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:22.100
That's why there's an archetypal idea that the fool is the precursor to the

2448
02:24:22.591 --> 02:24:25.620
savior,
which is a really,
and you see that with comedians.

2449
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:29.680
Comedians are fools and they tell the truth,
right?
So,
so in the court gestures,

2450
02:24:29.730 --> 02:24:33.510
the only person who gets to tell the truth and a fool,
it'll take a risk as well.

2451
02:24:33.511 --> 02:24:36.420
And you need to take risks in order to progress.
So that's the idea.

2452
02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:41.130
But it also means that you have to allow yourself to make the mistakes that are

2453
02:24:41.131 --> 02:24:44.610
necessary while you progress and not beat yourself to death about it.

2454
02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:48.210
And so that's also really helpful because it means that when you're formulating

2455
02:24:48.211 --> 02:24:51.240
your plans,
you can say,
well,

2456
02:24:51.241 --> 02:24:54.510
this is the best I can do now subject to revision.
It's like,
great,

2457
02:24:54.511 --> 02:24:56.490
that's good enough.
Really it's good enough.

2458
02:24:56.491 --> 02:24:58.380
It just has to move you to the next place.

2459
02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:02.790
That's interesting because obviously I've done a ton of military planning and I

2460
02:25:02.791 --> 02:25:06.030
would see guys that would get so wrapped around trying to make the perfect plan

2461
02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:10.050
and it would take them so long to plan that by the time they're ready to

2462
02:25:10.051 --> 02:25:12.960
actually get the plan for the whole target had shifted and things had moved in

2463
02:25:12.961 --> 02:25:15.120
the battlefield of change and they're not ready to do this anymore.

2464
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:16.830
So you need to come up with,
like you said,

2465
02:25:16.831 --> 02:25:20.250
you need to come up without good idea of what you're going to do and how are you

2466
02:25:20.251 --> 02:25:23.980
going to do it.
And then you start to move and,
and,
and as you move,

2467
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.800
you start to see things from a different angle and you gain more intelligence

2468
02:25:26.801 --> 02:25:29.080
than you get another report and all of a sudden the target shifts a little bit,

2469
02:25:29.081 --> 02:25:32.710
but you're adapting and you're closer to the target anyways.
Very,

2470
02:25:32.711 --> 02:25:37.480
very interesting.
It's also the idea that you're gaining information,

2471
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:40.300
cause you might say,
well I don't know what to do with my life,

2472
02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:43.420
so maybe I should just stay here and figure it out.
It's like,
no,
no.

2473
02:25:43.421 --> 02:25:46.720
If you stay there,
then all you know is what you know.

2474
02:25:46.721 --> 02:25:49.780
Well you're there and you don't know enough because you can't make a plan.

2475
02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:52.290
So make a bad plan.
Even if the,

2476
02:25:52.291 --> 02:25:57.291
even if it's actually a plan that works out so that it's opposite of what you

2477
02:25:57.821 --> 02:26:00.460
want.
If you move towards that plan,

2478
02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:03.550
you're going to know more clearly that it's opposite of what you want.

2479
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:05.470
And as soon as you know that it's opposite,
you know,

2480
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:08.980
or I should be going in the other direction.
So like that's,
that's not,

2481
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:10.420
that's not a retreat.
That's,

2482
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:15.220
that's an advance and thing is people were active creatures and we're always

2483
02:26:15.221 --> 02:26:20.020
navigating through territory.
Right.
We can't be sitting in one place and waiting,

2484
02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:24.880
well you can't cause you get old.
So you,
even if you're sitting in one place,

2485
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:28.870
the place is changing on you.
And that's just what you said that when you said,

2486
02:26:28.871 --> 02:26:29.081
you know,

2487
02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:32.680
people make a detailed plan and then the environmental shift on them and on

2488
02:26:32.681 --> 02:26:33.740
future authoring.
Yeah.

2489
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:38.180
Do you go back in and adjust your goals?
Yeah.

2490
02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:41.200
So it's something that you continually update.
Yeah.

2491
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:43.720
And I would say don't update it too often.
Right?

2492
02:26:43.721 --> 02:26:46.540
Because then you end up in the situation you were just describing.

2493
02:26:46.541 --> 02:26:47.780
But the idea would probably,

2494
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.750
it's something like make your damn plan implemented for four months or six

2495
02:26:52.751 --> 02:26:56.650
months and then go back and see what needs to be updated,
you know?

2496
02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:58.990
And you'll find that you'll,

2497
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.990
you've done a lot of what you said you would and so then it'll need to be

2498
02:27:01.991 --> 02:27:03.820
reformulated.
So,

2499
02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:09.090
and that's also very self affirming I suppose is the right,

2500
02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:12.820
it helps you understand that there's more to you than you think,

2501
02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:14.740
which is actually the case.
You know,

2502
02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:18.370
there is more to people than they think that that's one thing that's interesting

2503
02:27:18.371 --> 02:27:20.680
about human beings.
And so you can put yourself,
you can,

2504
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:24.670
you can stand up to things you're afraid of.
Um,
you know,

2505
02:27:24.671 --> 02:27:28.810
in measured doses and you find that you grow to be larger than the thing that

2506
02:27:28.811 --> 02:27:30.850
you're afraid of.
And you know,
that's like,

2507
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:33.520
that's like one of the basic rules of clinical therapies.

2508
02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:35.560
Like if people are afraid of something,

2509
02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.060
you break it down into pieces and you have them encounter the things they're

2510
02:27:40.061 --> 02:27:44.980
afraid of and they don't get less afraid.
They get braver and more competent,

2511
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:49.390
which is way better cause there's plenty of things to be afraid of.
Once again,

2512
02:27:49.391 --> 02:27:54.160
here's just a total alignment.
I wrote this kid's book,
it's called wave.
Okay.

2513
02:27:54.161 --> 02:27:59.050
I read it.
I didn't know about this,
but I knew what I did with my kids.

2514
02:27:59.290 --> 02:28:02.260
And in the book,
you know,
the kids scared of water and he has not a swim.

2515
02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.100
So he starts off waiting in the water and then he eventually he dunks his head

2516
02:28:06.101 --> 02:28:09.550
in the water and then eventually he covers up to his neck in the water and then

2517
02:28:09.551 --> 02:28:13.210
eventually he swims a little bit and then he finally jumps off the page.

2518
02:28:13.211 --> 02:28:17.740
But that's when I heard you describing that process and in some interview that

2519
02:28:17.741 --> 02:28:20.890
you are on or,
or one of your podcasts,
I said,
ah,
I put that in my,

2520
02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:23.570
but I didn't even know it.
It's progressive exposure.

2521
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:27.530
And so what you want to do and what you want to do is you can do this for

2522
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:31.580
yourself.
You think,
okay,
here's something I'm afraid of doing.
Okay.

2523
02:28:31.581 --> 02:28:34.970
And so I won't do it cause I'm actually afraid of,
it's okay,
fine.
Decompose it.

2524
02:28:34.971 --> 02:28:38.210
Like let's say you're afraid to go on a subway,
you have agoraphobic.
It's like,

2525
02:28:38.211 --> 02:28:42.950
okay,
are go online and look at a bunch of pictures of a subway.
Can you do that?

2526
02:28:43.350 --> 02:28:44.300
Um,

2527
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:49.510
go to the subway station and look at the subway station and then go home or go

2528
02:28:51.051 --> 02:28:54.530
into the subway station and opened the doors and go in and then go home.

2529
02:28:54.531 --> 02:28:56.900
But don't,
don't play tricks on yourself,
right?

2530
02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:59.840
If you say that you're going to go and just look,

2531
02:29:00.170 --> 02:29:02.630
then just go and look and then go home,
you know,

2532
02:29:02.631 --> 02:29:05.090
because otherwise you won't trust yourself the next time you do it.

2533
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:07.550
So you have to keep the bargain in tact.
But,

2534
02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:11.870
and what you want to do is you want to push yourself a little farther than you

2535
02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:15.770
want to go,
but so that you would go,

2536
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:19.180
that's all you have to do.
And that's,
that's kind of a rule for,

2537
02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.560
for learning in life.
So this happens.

2538
02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:24.860
The reason it works is because this is actually how human beings learn.

2539
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:26.960
And so if you watch a kid,

2540
02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:31.310
maybe let's say a kid that's a little inhibited because some kids will just take

2541
02:29:31.311 --> 02:29:33.290
off,
but we'll use the kids that's literally inhibited.

2542
02:29:33.530 --> 02:29:37.970
So they're around their mom and they're in the playground and there's strange

2543
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:40.820
kids there.
Maybe they're like four years old,
something like that.

2544
02:29:40.821 --> 02:29:43.880
And so they're thinking about maybe that,
that they'll go out and play.

2545
02:29:43.881 --> 02:29:47.180
And so they hang around mum for a while and they check out the situation and

2546
02:29:47.181 --> 02:29:49.940
then they'll go out a little bit and check it out a bit more.

2547
02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:53.150
And then they come back and maybe they need a little pact or something like
that,

2548
02:29:53.151 --> 02:29:55.070
you know,
cause they're coming back to home territory.

2549
02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.380
Then the next time they go out a little farther,

2550
02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:00.980
then they'll come back and the next time they go a little farther and then

2551
02:30:00.981 --> 02:30:04.070
they'll come back because they want to know they can come back and they're

2552
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:08.720
checking to see how far out they can go.
And if you're patient and encouraging,

2553
02:30:08.721 --> 02:30:12.350
even with kids that are quite nervous,
you know,
you encourage them to,
to,

2554
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:14.840
to keep going out and exploring,

2555
02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:17.810
then they'll habituate and well what they do is learn.

2556
02:30:17.811 --> 02:30:19.430
They're competent and the way they go.

2557
02:30:19.970 --> 02:30:23.930
And so it's not surprising that graduated exposure works because that is

2558
02:30:23.931 --> 02:30:26.390
actually how human beings learn to confront the world.

2559
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:29.900
But it's a great technique.
And,
and the story in the book,

2560
02:30:29.901 --> 02:30:32.180
it wasn't by my daughter was had stage fright,

2561
02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:33.980
but you want it to be in the school musical.

2562
02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:37.880
And so it was started with her and her room singing by herself.

2563
02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:40.760
But I was outside the door with the door shut.
Yeah.
And then it was okay,

2564
02:30:40.761 --> 02:30:42.830
you sing what?
The door is open.
And this happened over,
you know,

2565
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:46.460
a couple of weeks.
Now the door's open.
Now I'm going to stand in the doorway.

2566
02:30:46.461 --> 02:30:48.380
Now mom and I are going to stand in the doorway.

2567
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:50.330
Now we're actually gonna come in and sit down and watch you saying.

2568
02:30:50.331 --> 02:30:52.820
And then it was the family's going to watch you sing and then the neighbors are

2569
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:54.860
going to come watch you.
I'm,
and eventually she has no,

2570
02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:59.360
no issues whatsoever right now.
Very confident kid.
But that was,
yeah,

2571
02:30:59.361 --> 02:31:04.280
that's perfect.
I translated it into the water for the story for whatever reason.

2572
02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.680
But yeah.
Yeah.
Well that also means that,

2573
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:10.310
see what I like about that story too is that you established an individual

2574
02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:12.410
relationship with your daughter.
You know,

2575
02:31:12.411 --> 02:31:15.890
because kids have different temperaments.
So like some kids,

2576
02:31:15.891 --> 02:31:18.200
if you take them to the playground,
it's like they're like pop.

2577
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:21.220
You put them down on the ground,
they're like puppies over water.

2578
02:31:21.250 --> 02:31:24.420
Their fetal be going before they hit the ground and they're just gone,
right?

2579
02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:25.680
They're out there playing with the kids.

2580
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.310
Those are extroverted kids who don't have very high levels of negative emotion

2581
02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:34.140
and your problem is going to be that they'll run off too far,
you know,
so,

2582
02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:35.730
but then other kids are more,

2583
02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:39.090
they're more inhibited and often they're a little more introverted.

2584
02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:40.620
They're little higher negative emotion.

2585
02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:44.070
So then what you want to do is calibrate and you have to watch.
It's like,
okay,

2586
02:31:44.071 --> 02:31:47.910
how much can this kid tolerate?
It's like,
we'll push it and you can,

2587
02:31:47.970 --> 02:31:50.610
you can figure that out.
It's like it.
It has to be,

2588
02:31:50.611 --> 02:31:53.070
you have to push them enough so that if they accomplish it,

2589
02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:56.700
they feel that that's an accomplishment.
It can't be too easy,

2590
02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:00.030
but it can't be too hard.
You want to put them right on that edge.

2591
02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:02.310
That's the edge between order and chaos,
right?

2592
02:32:02.311 --> 02:32:05.310
Fundamentally you want to put them on that edge and let them experience what

2593
02:32:05.311 --> 02:32:08.820
it's like to be there.
Then they also learned that they can be there.

2594
02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.620
Cause you know,
you taught her to things,

2595
02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:14.040
you taught her that she could sing in front of a group,

2596
02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:18.690
but you also taught her that she could learn to do something she was afraid of

2597
02:32:18.691 --> 02:32:22.980
doing.
And that's a way better lesson.
Right?
That's a killer lesson.
So,

2598
02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:24.900
so that's good that that means,

2599
02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:29.870
and you can do that with kids too with graduated reward,
like,
um,

2600
02:32:30.030 --> 02:32:33.330
you can watch them and if they do something,
well,

2601
02:32:33.331 --> 02:32:35.220
I'll tell you how I did this with my daughter.

2602
02:32:35.221 --> 02:32:39.630
So my daughter had arthritis and it was really bad and she had to learn to give

2603
02:32:39.631 --> 02:32:42.210
herself an while.
She had to take injections every day.

2604
02:32:42.810 --> 02:32:47.790
And so I think that started when she was like seven.
And so,
um,

2605
02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.680
we could give her the injections,

2606
02:32:49.681 --> 02:32:52.980
but she was pretty skittish about that and no wonder because they hurt and

2607
02:32:52.981 --> 02:32:56.730
everything.
So I thought,
all right to hell with this,
we'll,

2608
02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:59.870
we'll get her to do her own injections.
And,
uh,

2609
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.060
so I sat her down and I said she was pretty motivated by money.

2610
02:33:03.061 --> 02:33:06.300
She's always been kind of a capitalist kid day.

2611
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:10.650
So we found her outside once when she was four selling all her child books on

2612
02:33:10.651 --> 02:33:14.880
the street,
which was quite funny.
I think she was maybe five,
but whatever.
I said,

2613
02:33:14.881 --> 02:33:16.440
look Kiddo,
um,

2614
02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:21.420
I'm going to give you this needle and if you can give you,

2615
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:25.050
if you can inject this yourself in 45 minutes,

2616
02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.820
I'll give you 50 bucks.

2617
02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:31.200
And so I let her sit and she likes struggled with that.

2618
02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:36.200
She struggled with that a and but by about 30 minutes she did it and I thought

2619
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:39.510
that could work math,
good work.
So then the next time I said,
okay,

2620
02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:43.440
this time it's 30 bucks,
but you got 10 minutes to do it.

2621
02:33:43.890 --> 02:33:47.700
And so she did it and you know,
soon we got it down so that it,

2622
02:33:47.730 --> 02:33:50.040
cause I wanted to get it down so there was no hesitation,
right,

2623
02:33:50.041 --> 02:33:53.460
because actually the anticipatory anxiety is worse than the needle,

2624
02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:56.490
so you want to push it.
So it's like,
okay now,

2625
02:33:56.491 --> 02:33:58.950
and we got to the point where it was,
um,

2626
02:33:59.310 --> 02:34:01.500
if you can do it in five seconds we'll give you 10 bucks.

2627
02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:03.150
And so she got to the point,

2628
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:06.630
took about a week where she could do it in five seconds and I kept paying or

2629
02:34:06.631 --> 02:34:10.500
because,
well for obvious reasons,
you know,
I mean it was kind of unfortunate.

2630
02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:14.070
She was very sick and she had these needles and we had to do some things that

2631
02:34:14.071 --> 02:34:18.250
would sort of perk her up,
you know,
to some degree.
But that was a hard

2632
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:19.720
<v 2>thing for a kid to learn.
You know,</v>

2633
02:34:19.810 --> 02:34:21.610
it's not an easy thing to give yourself a needle,

2634
02:34:21.611 --> 02:34:25.330
but you can use that graduated exposure and careful reward.

2635
02:34:25.331 --> 02:34:29.230
You can get kids to do very brief things and then they also learn how tough they

2636
02:34:29.231 --> 02:34:31.840
are.
It's like hike.
And she was proud of that man.
You know,

2637
02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:35.500
she that she could go and do it by herself cause that was a big deal.

2638
02:34:35.501 --> 02:34:39.520
It also gave her some control over your illness.
So competence,

2639
02:34:39.521 --> 02:34:42.670
that's what you want to instill in your kids.
Less.
You're jealous of them.

2640
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:46.180
So now you also talked about,

2641
02:34:46.181 --> 02:34:49.780
you started talking about some various personality traits and how those come

2642
02:34:49.781 --> 02:34:53.800
through and you just released what a month ago,
a new program,

2643
02:34:54.490 --> 02:34:58.900
understand yourself,
understand myself doors,
call myself.com.
Yeah.

2644
02:34:58.901 --> 02:35:01.870
And I also put up a discount code for your people for that too.

2645
02:35:01.871 --> 02:35:06.460
So it's willing again,
and it's 20%.
It's,
that would make it about seven 95.

2646
02:35:06.461 --> 02:35:10.080
So it's pretty cheap.
Um,
what you do is it,

2647
02:35:10.090 --> 02:35:13.360
you answer a hundred questions,
the questions are pretty standard,

2648
02:35:13.361 --> 02:35:16.870
like they've been derived from the standard scientific literature.
Um,

2649
02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:20.990
partly from a test that I designed that my students designed about,
uh,

2650
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:23.050
in 2007 Colon de Young,

2651
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:27.970
who's now a professor at the University of Minnesota and Wi wi Wi wi

2652
02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:33.040
statistically analyze this question set so we could break out five major

2653
02:35:33.041 --> 02:35:34.180
personality traits.

2654
02:35:34.181 --> 02:35:37.720
And those are the standard traits that psychologists believe are reliable and

2655
02:35:37.721 --> 02:35:41.020
valid.
And they'd been working on that since about 1960.

2656
02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:46.240
And so that's extroversion.
And that's,
uh,
um,
it can,

2657
02:35:46.410 --> 02:35:51.070
it breaks into two aspects.
So extroverted people are assertive and enthusiastic.

2658
02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:52.840
It's the positive emotion dimension.

2659
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:55.750
They're talkative a and they like to be in social groups.

2660
02:35:55.751 --> 02:35:59.000
They like to plan parties,
they like,
they like to talk,
um,

2661
02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:03.880
and they're smiley and so forth.
Um,
and then there's a negative emotion,

2662
02:36:03.881 --> 02:36:04.301
dimension.

2663
02:36:04.301 --> 02:36:08.770
Neuroticism and people who are high in neuroticism are that can be broken into

2664
02:36:08.771 --> 02:36:11.450
withdrawal and volatility and people who withdraw.

2665
02:36:11.451 --> 02:36:15.340
I have a lot of anticipatory anxiety so they might shy away from doing something

2666
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:20.290
and volatile people are kind of touchy,
you know,
they're easily set off.
So,

2667
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:24.970
um,
agreeableness,
agreeable people are compassionate and polite.

2668
02:36:24.971 --> 02:36:29.650
Disagreeable people are tough and blunt and so women are higher in agreeableness

2669
02:36:29.651 --> 02:36:32.050
than men and they're higher in negative emotion as well.

2670
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:36.940
Conscientiousness,
which is the best long term predictor of life.

2671
02:36:36.941 --> 02:36:39.100
Success after intelligence.

2672
02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:43.870
Conscientious people are dutiful and uh,
so they're industrious and orderly.

2673
02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:48.370
And orderliness is a good predictor of conservative political philosophy by the

2674
02:36:48.371 --> 02:36:51.070
way or political affiliation along with low.

2675
02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.120
The last dimension is openness and open.

2676
02:36:55.121 --> 02:36:59.350
People are interested in ideas,
so that's intellect and creative.

2677
02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:02.530
And we call that openness.
Its openness to experiences.

2678
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:06.580
The main trade and the creativity trade is o is openness proper.

2679
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:12.030
So this report gives you a comparative description so you compared to other

2680
02:37:13.361 --> 02:37:16.100
people on all five of those dimensions plus all of those

2681
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.330
<v 4>10 aspects and that can help you understand who you are.</v>

2682
02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:24.290
And that's very useful because one of the things you want to do in life is

2683
02:37:24.291 --> 02:37:29.291
figure out what your temperament is so that you can find a niche in the economy

2684
02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:34.400
or in the social world that you're suited to.
So like if you're an introvert,

2685
02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:35.800
while computer programming stone,

2686
02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:38.720
a bad idea or accounting or something like that.
But if you're extroverted,

2687
02:37:38.721 --> 02:37:42.050
you got to be out with people you know.
And if you're high in negative emotion,

2688
02:37:42.051 --> 02:37:45.230
you're going to want a job that's not too stressful and it's fairly secure.

2689
02:37:45.470 --> 02:37:48.530
And if you're open,
then you're an entrepreneurial or creative type.

2690
02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:49.400
And if you're agreeable,

2691
02:37:49.401 --> 02:37:52.130
you should be working with people and if you're disagreeable,

2692
02:37:52.131 --> 02:37:56.780
you should be working with things.
And so the,
anyways,
the reports detail,

2693
02:37:56.781 --> 02:37:57.614
all of that.

2694
02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:00.440
<v 3>And so then once people see where they fall out,</v>

2695
02:38:00.441 --> 02:38:03.540
they can kind of put themselves into a better position,
like you said it

2696
02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:08.130
<v 4>job that suits them.
And that's going to be,
yeah,
well,
yeah.
Well that's,</v>

2697
02:38:08.490 --> 02:38:10.710
well that's it.
You know,
it's,
you,
you,

2698
02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:15.540
you do have a temperament and there is a place for each temperament in the

2699
02:38:15.541 --> 02:38:18.030
economy,
in the world because otherwise they wouldn't exist.

2700
02:38:18.031 --> 02:38:22.110
And so the issue is what is your temperament?
So if you're high in openness,

2701
02:38:22.410 --> 02:38:23.130
you need,

2702
02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:26.820
you need to engage in something creative because you won't be healthy if you

2703
02:38:26.821 --> 02:38:28.320
don't cause it's like a major,

2704
02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:30.900
probably if you're like a tree with different trunks,

2705
02:38:30.901 --> 02:38:33.870
it's like that's one of the trucks.
It might be the major one.

2706
02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:37.440
You can't let that thing die because it'll take a big part of it with you.

2707
02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:38.790
And if you're disagreeable,

2708
02:38:38.791 --> 02:38:42.360
say you're a competitive type and so you're going to need some of that in your

2709
02:38:42.361 --> 02:38:46.050
life.
And if your conscientiousness,
if you're conscientious,

2710
02:38:46.051 --> 02:38:50.580
that's a pretty good predictor of military,
uh,
um,
uh,
performance by the way,

2711
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:54.060
then you need a routine and you need to be,

2712
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:57.630
you need to be locked on to some task,
you know,
cause otherwise you'll,

2713
02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:02.700
you'll consume yourself with guilt.
Um,
so,

2714
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:06.380
so it's very important to understand who you are in that way.
And it's also,

2715
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:08.220
<v 3>that's interesting because that's,</v>

2716
02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.830
I can tell you that that's sort of the middle of the bell curve and even like

2717
02:39:13.831 --> 02:39:18.520
towards the higher end of the bell curve of military performers are,
you know,

2718
02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:21.090
people that are can concentrate on the task.

2719
02:39:21.091 --> 02:39:25.050
They're going to be relatively obedient.
But when you get to either end,

2720
02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:29.010
either high end,
either the low end of bad performance,

2721
02:39:29.011 --> 02:39:32.640
but also the high end or the people that no one to break the rules that are

2722
02:39:32.641 --> 02:39:35.850
slightly rebellious,
that will rebel look,
that will tell,
you know,

2723
02:39:35.851 --> 02:39:37.110
one of the big ones,
you know,

2724
02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:41.430
I don't want to be surrounded by people that are telling me that I'm right all

2725
02:39:41.431 --> 02:39:43.110
the time.
I don't want my subordinates.

2726
02:39:43.111 --> 02:39:45.630
I don't want to have people that are working for me that are going to,

2727
02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:48.480
when I say go charge at machine gun nest,
so they say,
okay,
and they go do it.

2728
02:39:48.930 --> 02:39:52.350
You might think that that's what I want and that might be the,

2729
02:39:52.351 --> 02:39:54.330
the overall perception of people in the military.

2730
02:39:54.390 --> 02:39:57.150
I want a robot that's going to follow my orders.
I actually don't,

2731
02:39:57.690 --> 02:40:00.630
if I tell you to go charge that machine gun nest and it's not and it's going to

2732
02:40:00.631 --> 02:40:03.300
get you and your men killed,
I actually want you to say,
Hey Jocko,

2733
02:40:03.301 --> 02:40:06.090
that doesn't sound like a good plan to me.
Let's do something else.

2734
02:40:06.091 --> 02:40:10.140
Let's come around to the flank.
So,
so it's interesting that yeah,

2735
02:40:10.141 --> 02:40:13.530
you'll be good in that middle part and you might even get towards higher end.

2736
02:40:13.531 --> 02:40:14.040
But the guys

2737
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.000
<v 4>that are really valuable in the military are the guys that also have that</v>

2738
02:40:18.001 --> 02:40:23.001
openness and that creativity and are and at the same time are able to discipline

2739
02:40:23.441 --> 02:40:28.190
it and harness it so that they can conform when they need to.
They need to be,

2740
02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:31.680
which I actually had to do as I got older,
the older,
when I first got in,

2741
02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:33.960
you know,
I was the guy pushing the envelope,

2742
02:40:33.961 --> 02:40:36.900
I long hair and so everything that I could do with maxed out to,

2743
02:40:36.990 --> 02:40:41.040
to stay within the bounds of what we are supposed to be doing.
And,

2744
02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.410
and then as I got older I realized like,
oh,
that stuff's not important.

2745
02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:46.830
What's important is that you're able to do your job good and you have
creativity,

2746
02:40:46.831 --> 02:40:49.800
not with how you have your stupid haircut,

2747
02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:52.360
but in how you come up with a mission plan.
Right?

2748
02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:55.530
That's where I express my creativity,
not through,

2749
02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.550
not through pushing the envelope of uniform standards,
which is,

2750
02:40:59.790 --> 02:41:04.280
which is what a lot of immature young military guys do.
Right?
Well,

2751
02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:06.410
the thing about,
uh,
um,

2752
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:09.900
the people who will stand up and tell you what they think is that they tend to

2753
02:41:09.901 --> 02:41:12.600
be disagreeable types as well.
And you know,

2754
02:41:12.601 --> 02:41:15.990
you hear a lot about emotional intelligence in the business world these days,

2755
02:41:15.991 --> 02:41:19.830
but emotional intelligence is really indistinguishable from trait agreeableness.

2756
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.010
And so agreeable people are polite and compassionate and that's great,

2757
02:41:23.011 --> 02:41:24.570
especially if you're taking care of people,

2758
02:41:24.930 --> 02:41:28.500
but you want some disagreeable people around because they'll tell you what they

2759
02:41:28.501 --> 02:41:31.980
think and they're blunt.
Well this isn't an emotional intelligence though.

2760
02:41:32.250 --> 02:41:34.030
Can't you be agreeable but not be able to re.

2761
02:41:34.031 --> 02:41:37.200
I always think of it as me being able to read people like I understand,

2762
02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:41.340
oh that person's got events going on.
That's their agenda is in the background.

2763
02:41:41.370 --> 02:41:42.930
So even though I might be agreeable,

2764
02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:46.350
but I'm also understanding where you're coming from.

2765
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:50.400
That's what emotional intelligence is,
if it's anything valid.

2766
02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:54.330
But the tests that test at tend to correlate very highly with agreeableness.

2767
02:41:54.331 --> 02:41:58.320
And so actually agreeable managers don't make better bit managers.

2768
02:41:58.530 --> 02:42:00.810
Disagreeable managers make better managers.

2769
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:04.520
Well they have to be conscientious as well cause a disagreeable person who's

2770
02:42:04.530 --> 02:42:08.400
conscientious is actually relatively easy to work for it because they'll tell

2771
02:42:08.401 --> 02:42:12.400
you what they think,
but they'll do what they say,
you know,

2772
02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:13.800
and they can make tough decisions.

2773
02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:18.630
And you often have to make decisions that are somewhat harsh in order to move

2774
02:42:18.631 --> 02:42:21.770
things ahead in the long term.
Right.
Because if you're soft,

2775
02:42:21.771 --> 02:42:25.570
it means you'll sacrifice the sh the long term for the short term.

2776
02:42:25.970 --> 02:42:29.190
And if you're tough,
but,
but have your head screwed on straight,

2777
02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:32.670
it means you'll make tough decisions in the present that might ruffle feathers

2778
02:42:32.671 --> 02:42:36.030
and hurt people's feelings,
but they make the medium to longterm better.

2779
02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:38.910
And so that's absolutely true.
I see that all the time,

2780
02:42:38.911 --> 02:42:40.350
especially with younger companies.

2781
02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:44.130
They go through that expansion phase and all of a sudden they got up,

2782
02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:47.360
they go through the attraction phase and they got to fire people and,

2783
02:42:47.361 --> 02:42:52.361
and they wait because the leader is too agreeable and too soft and so they wait

2784
02:42:52.651 --> 02:42:55.350
and all of a sudden they're upside down financially and it's a real problem.

2785
02:42:55.351 --> 02:42:57.270
Whereas if they would have been aggressive and said,
you know what,

2786
02:42:57.271 --> 02:42:59.670
here's the decision we've got to make.
I know it's going to hurt right now,

2787
02:42:59.671 --> 02:43:00.780
but long term it can be good for us.

2788
02:43:00.781 --> 02:43:03.630
We've got to get rid of this division or this department are these people.

2789
02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:06.520
And if they don't have the ability to do that,
it really hurts them in the long.

2790
02:43:06.530 --> 02:43:09.750
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
that's the sacrifice of the future for the present.

2791
02:43:09.751 --> 02:43:12.010
And that's generally a bad.
The other thing

2792
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:14.280
<v 2>with the understand myself,
uh,
uh,</v>

2793
02:43:14.410 --> 02:43:19.410
system is that you can also use it to like if you do the program and get your

2794
02:43:21.251 --> 02:43:24.670
results in someone else,
does someone you're close to say you can compare them.

2795
02:43:24.671 --> 02:43:29.020
And that's really useful because you think you understand people but you don't

2796
02:43:29.021 --> 02:43:32.140
understand them as well as you think.
So for example,

2797
02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:37.300
my daughter was fairly,
well,
she,
she was quite ill,
so it was complicated,

2798
02:43:37.301 --> 02:43:39.730
but she was,
um,
touchy,

2799
02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:43.360
let's say when she was a teenager and I thought it was because she was

2800
02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:44.230
rebellious,

2801
02:43:44.290 --> 02:43:48.910
but she did the personality test and my son by contrast was very easy to get

2802
02:43:48.911 --> 02:43:49.744
along with.

2803
02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:53.170
But then we had them do the personality test and it turned out she was very high

2804
02:43:53.171 --> 02:43:56.890
in agreeableness and compassion,
but also pretty high in negative emotion.

2805
02:43:57.490 --> 02:43:58.690
Whereas he was the opposite.

2806
02:43:58.691 --> 02:44:02.730
He was very disagreeable but very low and negative emotions.

2807
02:44:02.730 --> 02:44:06.640
So he wasn't easy to get along with.
He just never got upset.

2808
02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:09.220
But if you ever tried to get them to do something he didn't want to do,

2809
02:44:09.221 --> 02:44:10.360
that was like impossible.

2810
02:44:10.361 --> 02:44:14.090
And he was like that from the time he was two years old.
Whereas my daughter,

2811
02:44:14.091 --> 02:44:17.950
it wasn't rebellious ness,
it was that she was easily made anxious and upset.

2812
02:44:17.951 --> 02:44:20.380
And so I learned at least somewhat.
So if she,

2813
02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.330
if she sort of flared up instead of interpreting that as,
as rebelliousness or,

2814
02:44:25.331 --> 02:44:27.520
or,
or,
or,
or conflict,

2815
02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:31.000
I just saw it as nervousness and that helped a lot.
You know,

2816
02:44:31.001 --> 02:44:34.300
it didn't make me able to deal with it 100%,
but it helped a lot.

2817
02:44:34.301 --> 02:44:38.660
It was quite shocking to me because,
you know,
I thought I knew my kids and uh,

2818
02:44:38.770 --> 02:44:42.940
and I did I think,
but that was very useful.

2819
02:44:42.941 --> 02:44:47.230
And then it was really funny because then as she started to date,

2820
02:44:47.231 --> 02:44:50.680
she had every boyfriend she ever went out with take the personality test first.

2821
02:44:50.681 --> 02:44:53.620
So I thought that was really comical.
Not Actually worked out quite well.

2822
02:44:53.790 --> 02:44:57.860
<v 3>Well,
the thing is,
you know,
you,
you want to be boys,</v>

2823
02:44:57.870 --> 02:45:01.350
not smart enough to like manipulate the answers so they don't necessarily know

2824
02:45:01.351 --> 02:45:05.400
what she wants.
So,
you know,
I would at least assume like,
okay,

2825
02:45:05.401 --> 02:45:07.320
I'm going to try and sound agreeable and I'm going to try it.

2826
02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:09.950
I remember I had to take a psychological tests too,

2827
02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:12.840
and this was in the 90s they give us ones.

2828
02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.080
You'd think they had some big battery of psychological examinations in

2829
02:45:16.081 --> 02:45:19.860
interviews to get in the seal teams?
No,
it took like a one task during bootcamp.

2830
02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:23.550
And it was funny because I was really hungry when I was in bootcamp because the

2831
02:45:23.551 --> 02:45:27.090
food sucks and,
and I just thought,
man,
I want to pass this test.

2832
02:45:27.091 --> 02:45:32.091
And I knew I had some things in my brain that weren't going to be smiled upon by

2833
02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:37.740
whatever analyst was going to read these things.
So,
and was complete the sent.

2834
02:45:37.741 --> 02:45:40.860
These are the things I remember it was complete the sentence.
So it said,

2835
02:45:41.010 --> 02:45:42.000
for instance,

2836
02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:47.660
I hate when my mom and you fill in the blank and obviously it's real easy to go

2837
02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:52.020
sideways on that.
Then right.
I mean if you're a psychopath,
but for me,

2838
02:45:52.021 --> 02:45:54.630
every answer that I gave was,
you know,
for me it was,

2839
02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:58.740
I hate when my mom doesn't cook enough noodles with the Spaghetti.

2840
02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:01.020
Every single day I gave were just about food.

2841
02:46:01.021 --> 02:46:03.990
They must have thought I was a food psychopath.

2842
02:46:05.970 --> 02:46:08.610
They were getting nothing out of me,
nothing.
Um,

2843
02:46:08.611 --> 02:46:12.770
I think the tested my daughter used was one I designed that people couldn't
fake.

2844
02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:17.810
So it wasn't quite as accurate with regards to the individual personality
traits,

2845
02:46:17.811 --> 02:46:20.210
but it was,
it was more difficult to fake good on,

2846
02:46:20.211 --> 02:46:22.490
which is better for hiring people.
For example.

2847
02:46:22.491 --> 02:46:25.720
What kind of question can you not fake in?
Oh,
well,

2848
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:30.550
are you hardworking or are you easy to get along with?
Right.

2849
02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:33.560
Are you creative?
Are disciplined.
Oh,
right,
right.

2850
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:36.800
Yeah,
exactly.

2851
02:46:36.801 --> 02:46:41.801
Are you neurotic and anxious or are you a inhibited and and awkward with people?

2852
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:48.910
Can you go in between,
is it a one to 10 it's either or.
Yeah.
Without,

2853
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:50.750
with that particular pairing.
It is.

2854
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:53.840
And then you've paired all these questions so that eventually you get,

2855
02:46:54.250 --> 02:46:56.070
that's right.
That's right.
Well or,

2856
02:46:56.071 --> 02:46:59.990
or maybe here's 10 negative statements which five applied to you.

2857
02:46:59.991 --> 02:47:03.170
Most people hate those particularly,
but they're quite accurate.

2858
02:47:03.171 --> 02:47:05.960
So we use those for personnel selection for awhile.

2859
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:09.590
So for me it would be are you agreeable of disciplined,
hungry?

2860
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:16.330
Yeah.
Now before we close that you are,
you also have,
um,

2861
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:18.030
the book maps of meaning and,

2862
02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:22.430
and for those people that were expecting me to do the book maps of meaning on

2863
02:47:22.431 --> 02:47:24.320
this podcast and review it in depth,

2864
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:29.360
there is literally no reason because you have already done that online on

2865
02:47:29.361 --> 02:47:32.510
Youtube and on your podcast you go through in great detail,

2866
02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.250
better detail than I would have been able to in one podcast because you have a

2867
02:47:37.251 --> 02:47:41.540
series of podcasts about maps of meeting.
It's fascinating.
It's awesome.

2868
02:47:41.541 --> 02:47:46.160
Everything that you kind of touched on today is in there in great depth.

2869
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:50.390
Um,
and you know there's many worshipers of Marduk out there now,

2870
02:47:50.391 --> 02:47:53.270
thanks to you and,
and I'm sure that will expand.

2871
02:47:53.271 --> 02:47:54.950
And if you want to get into that,

2872
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:58.370
the book is called maps of meaning the architecture of belief.

2873
02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:01.640
It's very interesting.
I also like that you have the,
the,

2874
02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:04.400
you talk about some of your clients as which,
by the way,

2875
02:48:04.401 --> 02:48:06.980
I didn't talk about you at all in the opening.

2876
02:48:07.070 --> 02:48:09.800
I realized that about halfway through this podcast that I didn't actually

2877
02:48:09.801 --> 02:48:10.880
explain who you were.

2878
02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:15.350
So is there anything you'd need to say about yourself that I should have said?

2879
02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:18.460
I mean,
what,
well,
there's just the bare basics.

2880
02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:22.940
<v 2>Cologists I've practiced for about two and a half decades.</v>

2881
02:48:22.941 --> 02:48:26.690
I've done a lot of business consulting,
um,
uh,

2882
02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:27.980
as well as clinical work.

2883
02:48:27.981 --> 02:48:32.330
I'm a professor at the University of Toronto in psychology and I might domains

2884
02:48:32.331 --> 02:48:33.021
of expertise,

2885
02:48:33.021 --> 02:48:37.310
our personality assessment and neuroscience and the study of belief systems,

2886
02:48:37.311 --> 02:48:41.930
like religious belief systems.
And,
and I,
that's basically the,

2887
02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:43.970
and I,
I,
I have a family.

2888
02:48:43.971 --> 02:48:48.380
I'm married and have been for just about 30 years and I've got two kids and a

2889
02:48:48.381 --> 02:48:50.840
new grandchild.
And so that's,

2890
02:48:50.930 --> 02:48:55.520
and I've become somewhat notorious on youtube over the last year.
Really.

2891
02:48:55.570 --> 02:48:59.120
It's been that.
And so that's been quite bizarre.

2892
02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:01.400
A trip you might say,

2893
02:49:01.790 --> 02:49:05.200
<v 3>so.
So everyone can go and explore that.
Yeah,
you're pretty.
Um,</v>

2894
02:49:05.530 --> 02:49:08.160
I guess the other thing I should say,
because my publicist

2895
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.820
<v 2>will be on my case if I don't as that I have another book coming out,</v>

2896
02:49:11.821 --> 02:49:15.150
which is much more straight forward than maps of meeting,

2897
02:49:15.151 --> 02:49:16.530
which is quite a technical book

2898
02:49:16.690 --> 02:49:20.850
<v 0>and that button's is going to be called 12 rules for life.
Yeah.</v>

2899
02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:23.410
An antidote to chaos.
Yeah.

2900
02:49:23.411 --> 02:49:26.440
And it's available for preorder on Amazon already.

2901
02:49:26.441 --> 02:49:29.310
So January 23rd that's when it comes out.
Yep.

2902
02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:31.960
And I'm hoping that now that one,

2903
02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:34.600
maybe you come back on here and we could talk a little bit about that book.

2904
02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:38.770
That'd be good.
That would be,
that would be good.
Um,
that book will be right up.

2905
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:40.170
I mean,
you've touched on it a little bit.

2906
02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:43.930
You've mentioned a couple of the 12 rules today.

2907
02:49:43.931 --> 02:49:47.770
I think you mentioned two of the 12 rules today and that would be awesome to

2908
02:49:47.771 --> 02:49:50.230
have you come back on.
And again,
I think people after they hear this,

2909
02:49:50.231 --> 02:49:52.130
if they didn't already know who you are,
they'll,

2910
02:49:52.210 --> 02:49:56.050
they'll go and research or you are,
and they're going to want to get that book.

2911
02:49:56.051 --> 02:49:57.370
And it'd be great to have you back on there.

2912
02:49:57.371 --> 02:50:01.030
And then obviously you've got your own podcast.
Yup.

2913
02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.840
The Jordan B.
Peterson podcasts.
Yes.
You've got

2914
02:50:05.660 --> 02:50:10.100
<v 2>your youtube channel.
Yep.
Jordan [inaudible],
Jordan Peterson videos</v>

2915
02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:12.550
<v 0>and Jordan Peterson clips.</v>

2916
02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.660
You just put out echo wasn't that crafty to come out with a thing,

2917
02:50:16.661 --> 02:50:20.430
like a separate thing to channels.
Yeah.
So he's got two James,

2918
02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:22.450
he's the one that's supposed to make the clips.

2919
02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:25.770
<v 2>Yeah.
Well one of the things that's been so strange,</v>

2920
02:50:25.771 --> 02:50:30.750
I mean learning to use Youtube,
um,
people have been clipping my work like mad,

2921
02:50:30.751 --> 02:50:32.160
which is not something I expected.

2922
02:50:32.161 --> 02:50:36.570
Like I would say right now there's probably 40 new clips a day being put on by

2923
02:50:36.571 --> 02:50:39.030
people,
which is really good,
you know,
I mean,

2924
02:50:39.031 --> 02:50:40.530
I've got no problem with that at all,

2925
02:50:40.890 --> 02:50:44.610
but I thought I might as well see what would happen if we also did it.

2926
02:50:44.611 --> 02:50:47.240
And so I put my,
my,
my uh,

2927
02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:49.860
son's fiance on that and my daughter as well.

2928
02:50:49.861 --> 02:50:53.070
So they've been doing that clipping.
And so,
but yeah,

2929
02:50:53.071 --> 02:50:57.330
it's cool that youtube videos are so interesting as well as the podcasts because

2930
02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:02.630
people can can do their own thing with them to some degree,
you know,

2931
02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:05.010
not can be bad depending on how they do the editing.

2932
02:51:05.011 --> 02:51:09.660
But so far people have been responding very positively to what I've been doing,

2933
02:51:09.661 --> 02:51:14.610
which is quite a shock to me.
Um,
but I think it,
I think it,

2934
02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:18.730
and you've made reference to this as well,
in,
in the,

2935
02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:23.100
in the fact that you've found a ready audience is like people are ready for a

2936
02:51:23.101 --> 02:51:27.270
message that's not all freedom and,
and writes,
you know,

2937
02:51:27.271 --> 02:51:30.840
it's like Jesus,
enough of that,
like really seriously,

2938
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:34.260
we'd been walking down that road for 60 years.

2939
02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:39.350
It's time to look at the alternative ethics and responsibility.

2940
02:51:39.541 --> 02:51:43.770
That's a big one.
Especially when it is the case that you know,

2941
02:51:43.771 --> 02:51:47.580
you think freedom gives you life more meaning that's true if you're under a

2942
02:51:47.581 --> 02:51:49.650
tyranny.
But if you're not,

2943
02:51:49.651 --> 02:51:52.700
then it's responsibility that gives your life meaning and you,
you,

2944
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:55.170
your life has to have meaning.
It has negative meaning,

2945
02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:58.890
whether you want it or not,
you choose whether or not it has positive meaning.

2946
02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:01.620
And you'd choose that by adopting responsibility.

2947
02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:05.920
And so and like there's a ready market that,
because

2948
02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:11.520
<v 4>we've,
we've ignored that reality for too long.
So [inaudible]</v>

2949
02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:16.570
are now at the point where they realize that being free,
free,
free,

2950
02:52:16.571 --> 02:52:19.360
free isn't getting them anywhere.
Yeah.
Well,
I always think it's like,
you know,

2951
02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:21.220
you okay,
you want to be free,
all right,

2952
02:52:21.221 --> 02:52:22.960
I'll take you and drop you in the middle of the ocean.

2953
02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:27.970
It's like you can swim in any direction.
It's like,
that's not helpful.
You know,

2954
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:31.600
you,
you gotta be swimming,
be different.
If I dropped you near an island and said,

2955
02:52:31.601 --> 02:52:35.320
well,
swim to that.
It's like,
yeah,
I can do that.
That's,
that's got meaning.

2956
02:52:35.321 --> 02:52:38.740
I won't drown.
I won't die.
But too much.

2957
02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:41.590
There's no difference between too much freedom and chaos.
Right.

2958
02:52:41.591 --> 02:52:46.390
And you drown in chaos.
You need the right balance of freedom and order and,

2959
02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:51.550
and,
and discipline.
Well,
as you said also,
which is a paradoxical thing,

2960
02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:56.560
the more discipline you have,
the more self disciplined,
the more freedom.

2961
02:52:56.590 --> 02:53:00.610
Even even putting in those hour breaks that you described.
You know,

2962
02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:05.350
sometimes when I've been too busy,
which has been fairly frequent,
um,

2963
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:07.450
I'll take an hour break,
you know,

2964
02:53:07.451 --> 02:53:12.430
and I can actually have a break because I've done the things that I was supposed

2965
02:53:12.431 --> 02:53:14.650
to do.
And so even though it's an hour long,

2966
02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:18.820
I can actually relax during that hour not being plagued by my conscience or

2967
02:53:18.821 --> 02:53:22.990
aren't things undone,
you know?
And so that's,
that's,

2968
02:53:23.140 --> 02:53:27.340
that's a really good thing to be able to attain when you feel that you've got

2969
02:53:27.341 --> 02:53:28.174
things,

2970
02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:32.530
you've got the right things reasonably under control and you're moving uphill,

2971
02:53:33.250 --> 02:53:37.060
that's better than anything else really.
Yeah.
Um,

2972
02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:40.410
speaking of getting things under control echo,
yeah.

2973
02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:45.540
Maybe could you tell people quickly how they could support this podcast?

2974
02:53:45.761 --> 02:53:48.690
I'll try to make it,
I kind of feel like we should keep talking about little,

2975
02:53:48.691 --> 02:53:53.440
we've been talking,
I hear you actually have a question.
Two questions.
Okay.

2976
02:53:54.130 --> 02:53:55.390
So with the recent,

2977
02:53:56.100 --> 02:54:01.090
everyone waits for in the podcast questions a little bit more,
you know,

2978
02:54:01.091 --> 02:54:04.690
with the rise of your,
uh,
exposure,
we'll call it.

2979
02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:08.950
Do people kind of flock to your class now?
Well,
no,

2980
02:54:08.951 --> 02:54:13.200
not so much to my class,
but they're definitely flocking to public talks.
Uh,

2981
02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.840
yeah.
So and,
and,
and my,

2982
02:54:16.841 --> 02:54:19.420
my class is generally being quite popular,
you know,

2983
02:54:19.421 --> 02:54:22.660
so that's so and makes sense.
Yeah.

2984
02:54:22.661 --> 02:54:26.140
And I'm on Sabbatical this year,
so we'll see what happens when I,

2985
02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:29.710
when I returned.
Was that luck or did you pre coordinate that?
Well,

2986
02:54:29.711 --> 02:54:34.090
it was actually the grace,
good grace of the university,
you know,
because,
well,

2987
02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:37.600
I had to get my act back together after all these things happened,
you know,

2988
02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:40.630
and I've also had some health problems over the last year that had been rather

2989
02:54:40.631 --> 02:54:45.130
severe,
which I think I have under control maybe.
Um,

2990
02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:47.230
but I,
I told them that,
look,
I,

2991
02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:52.240
I'm going to be much better if I take this year and do what's necessary for this

2992
02:54:52.571 --> 02:54:56.540
book that's coming out and re conceptualize what I'm going to be teaching.

2993
02:54:56.541 --> 02:54:58.210
Because the other thing is I have to do that.

2994
02:54:58.211 --> 02:55:01.450
I've got all these lectures recorded now they're on youtube.

2995
02:55:01.451 --> 02:55:04.740
It's like it isn't obvious to me why I should do them again.
I've done like,

2996
02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.380
there's three years of some of them online,
so I have to re,

2997
02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:13.670
I have to rethink what I'm doing as a university lecturer because with youtube,

2998
02:55:13.671 --> 02:55:15.200
you know you can do something new,

2999
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:17.540
like this Biblical series that I've been doing,

3000
02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:22.220
you can do something new and you can have it out in front of 150,000 people in

3001
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:24.560
one day.
It's like,
well you got to think about that.

3002
02:55:24.561 --> 02:55:29.450
That's a whole different universe.
And I like doing lectures on things that I'm,

3003
02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:31.100
I'm still learning about.

3004
02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:34.760
It's hard to do that at a university because you have to have the evaluation

3005
02:55:34.761 --> 02:55:37.730
structure.
People have to know what to expect and you know,

3006
02:55:37.731 --> 02:55:41.930
it has to be preplanned and that's not so good if you want to do something

3007
02:55:41.931 --> 02:55:42.770
that's novel.

3008
02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:46.340
So I've got a lot of thinking about that and I don't know what's going to happen

3009
02:55:46.341 --> 02:55:49.890
this next year in any case.
So do you find that like,
um,

3010
02:55:50.930 --> 02:55:55.220
like let's say you did a talk about something specific and people thought
online.

3011
02:55:55.700 --> 02:55:59.930
I think a lot of times people are more compelled to see that same one in person,

3012
02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:04.250
like a concert,
you know,
like,
Oh yeah,
I listened to,
I dunno,
Zz Top,

3013
02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:08.870
I'll listen to this easy.
And you know,
I have the CD or whatever,

3014
02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:11.090
but they're in town for a concert or their,
you know,

3015
02:56:11.091 --> 02:56:14.810
in the next day for a concert,
I want to go see the concert.
Well,
I think I,

3016
02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:19.220
I think that that works out okay for me because there are these underlying

3017
02:56:19.221 --> 02:56:22.250
themes that,
that permeate everything that I'm saying.

3018
02:56:22.251 --> 02:56:24.350
And I would say those are the archetypal themes.

3019
02:56:24.351 --> 02:56:28.580
So I have this sort of structured way of presenting information that's based on,

3020
02:56:28.850 --> 02:56:32.780
well,
the work I did for maps of meaning.
And so even if the lecture's knew,

3021
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:36.890
there's echoes of the,
of the other ones always,

3022
02:56:37.130 --> 02:56:40.760
I mean one of the things about archetipal stories is that an images is that

3023
02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.030
they're very expensive,
you know,

3024
02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:47.870
and so they're multifaceted and so you end up touching on the same themes over

3025
02:56:47.871 --> 02:56:50.640
and over,
but from different perspectives,
you know,

3026
02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:52.760
and one of the things people tell me all the time,

3027
02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:56.210
which is really interesting and this is really been the case for 30 years as

3028
02:56:56.211 --> 02:56:58.730
they come up to me after the lecture and they say,
you know,

3029
02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:02.450
you were telling me things that I already knew but I didn't know.
I knew that.

3030
02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:07.970
And that's,
that's definitely an archetypal experience because you know,

3031
02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:08.630
your,

3032
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:13.520
your experience does have a certain structure and that doesn't mean you can say

3033
02:57:13.521 --> 02:57:17.030
what it is,
but if you hear it being said,

3034
02:57:17.090 --> 02:57:19.010
then you know that that's what it is.

3035
02:57:19.310 --> 02:57:23.150
And so it's fun in front of a crowd because I can watch that happen to people

3036
02:57:23.151 --> 02:57:23.660
they,

3037
02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:27.320
cause I'm always speaking to individuals within the crowd and I'll say something

3038
02:57:27.321 --> 02:57:29.390
and someone will go like this.
Yeah,
your eyes are open,

3039
02:57:29.391 --> 02:57:31.820
a little bit of the jerk back a little bit.
And I think yes.

3040
02:57:31.821 --> 02:57:35.270
So that just clicked a couple of things to the other for you,
which is really,

3041
02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.470
well,
it's fun.

3042
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:41.020
<v 3>I get the same thing with uh,
with extreme ownership.
The book and you know,</v>

3043
02:57:41.021 --> 02:57:45.190
it's about leadership principles and we say in the book,
these are not new.

3044
02:57:45.250 --> 02:57:47.530
These are been around for hundreds and in some cases,

3045
02:57:47.531 --> 02:57:51.130
thousands of years of how militaries run organizations.

3046
02:57:51.131 --> 02:57:55.720
And therefore the military leadership principles are actually the same as all

3047
02:57:55.721 --> 02:57:56.501
leadership principles.

3048
02:57:56.501 --> 02:58:00.310
Cause you're trying to get a bunch of crazy human beings to do something that's

3049
02:58:00.311 --> 02:58:04.020
going to behind a mission and execute it in the most efficient way.

3050
02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:07.080
But people say,
Oh,
you know,
I kind of,
I always,

3051
02:58:07.081 --> 02:58:10.230
I always thought that I should do that.
I always,
I've always done that.
Yeah.

3052
02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:13.530
But it,
but yeah,
you captured it and it,
and it's a self awareness.

3053
02:58:13.531 --> 02:58:14.930
I think when people,
they,

3054
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:19.350
maybe they do have good natural leadership judgment and they've always taken

3055
02:58:19.351 --> 02:58:21.990
responsibility for things,
but they never really thought about it.

3056
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:23.940
They just kind of did it well.
Then once they know,
hey,

3057
02:58:23.941 --> 02:58:26.640
I need to take ownership of things,
well then then they really can do it.

3058
02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:29.460
And they also see it in their subordinate leadership and they call,

3059
02:58:29.461 --> 02:58:31.920
that guy is not taking ownership of things.
They're not doing a good job.

3060
02:58:31.921 --> 02:58:35.190
And it's the same thing with keeping things simple or decentralized command or

3061
02:58:35.191 --> 02:58:35.821
prioritize next,

3062
02:58:35.821 --> 02:58:39.900
because these are things that successful leaders do prioritize and execute.

3063
02:58:40.050 --> 02:58:43.350
If you get a leader that's going to try and accomplish 37 different things at

3064
02:58:43.351 --> 02:58:45.630
the same time,
they're not going to be successful.
So,

3065
02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:48.720
so leaders they know to prioritize and execute good leaders.

3066
02:58:49.140 --> 02:58:51.540
But when we say it to them,
you know,
they might still,

3067
02:58:51.541 --> 02:58:53.520
they might not do 37 things,
but they might do,

3068
02:58:53.521 --> 02:58:57.060
try and do eight things at the same time and they know that they should be doing

3069
02:58:57.061 --> 02:59:00.460
one or two.
And,
and when,
when they hear us say it and describe it,
they call it.

3070
02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:01.150
Yeah,

3071
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.520
<v 4>that's what,</v>

3072
02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:06.020
that's one of the things that characterized as a leader is that he or she knows

3073
02:59:06.021 --> 02:59:09.620
where they're going.
Right.
I mean that's,
that's,

3074
02:59:09.650 --> 02:59:13.040
that's the fundamental print middle to communicate it to.
But that's,

3075
02:59:13.430 --> 02:59:17.910
I worked for a UN committee at one point,
Tom,
oh no.
Uh,

3076
02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:22.250
economic sustainability,
economic and environmental sustainability.

3077
02:59:22.730 --> 02:59:26.450
And one of the problems with the first draft of the report,

3078
02:59:26.451 --> 02:59:29.620
and I would say the final draft to some degree is that,
you know,

3079
02:59:29.630 --> 02:59:33.290
it was all done by committees.
So there are a hundred priorities.
It's like,
no,

3080
02:59:33.530 --> 02:59:37.370
there aren't a hundred priorities.
That's a contradiction in terms.

3081
02:59:37.610 --> 02:59:41.450
It's like you start with one of these things and maybe you start with a small

3082
02:59:41.451 --> 02:59:42.890
piece of it and see if it works,

3083
02:59:42.891 --> 02:59:47.891
but it's two to have a hundred priorities is to make no one dissatisfied,

3084
02:59:48.770 --> 02:59:49.730
but you're not going to,

3085
02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:52.790
you're not going to move because you can't move in a hundred directions at the

3086
02:59:52.791 --> 02:59:55.790
same time.
So it's a real abdication of,
and,

3087
02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:57.740
and people do that in a sneaky way to,

3088
02:59:57.741 --> 03:00:01.520
because they're abdicating their responsibility,
right?
Say,
well,

3089
03:00:01.521 --> 03:00:04.580
we're going to move in a hundred directions and,
and everyone had input.

3090
03:00:04.990 --> 03:00:06.650
It's like,
well that's not the issue.

3091
03:00:06.651 --> 03:00:10.310
The issue is how you condense that down to an actual action plan and that

3092
03:00:10.311 --> 03:00:14.180
actually makes you accountable.
That's the thing.

3093
03:00:14.181 --> 03:00:16.550
And that's why people don't do it.
It's like,
well,

3094
03:00:16.551 --> 03:00:18.980
if you're going in a hundred directions and it's hard to see whether you're,

3095
03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:22.910
you're doing it well,
but if you're going to one direction that doesn't work,

3096
03:00:22.911 --> 03:00:26.000
it's like,
well that's pretty obvious.
So people are afraid to do that,

3097
03:00:26.001 --> 03:00:28.480
but if you don't do it,
it's failure.
Yeah.

3098
03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:30.520
<v 3>Yeah.
I get the same thing where I get people now,</v>

3099
03:00:30.820 --> 03:00:32.830
they asked me a question and I give them the answer next.

3100
03:00:32.860 --> 03:00:34.880
I know you're going to say that.
Yeah,

3101
03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:39.870
<v 4>I know.
I know.
I'm one of those people,
by the way,
he does that from time to time.</v>

3102
03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:44.250
Also,
how you were talking about kind of breaking the loop in your behavior,
like,

3103
03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:47.010
oh,
I want to make a change to that one thing,
you know,

3104
03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:49.590
to break the loo and then you start with something small and then it ends up

3105
03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:50.460
affecting more thing.

3106
03:00:51.210 --> 03:00:55.710
And you mentioned sometimes it's hard because you don't get pats on the back for

3107
03:00:55.711 --> 03:00:57.610
those little things,
you know?
Yeah.

3108
03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:01.660
Well and so small that then it's humiliating that you even have to do that.
Yeah.

3109
03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.220
Yeah.
But in a lot of time,
like to yourself,
it's like kind of big.
Like I'm like,

3110
03:01:06.221 --> 03:01:09.250
Oh,
I'm going to drink eight glasses of water a day now.
You know?

3111
03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:12.310
And then it's almost like you're seeking that pat on the back.

3112
03:01:12.311 --> 03:01:16.720
Like you want to tell your friend like,
hey,
I drink eight glasses of water now.

3113
03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:19.750
And they're just like,
yeah,
so yeah.
Right.
And you're like,

3114
03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:21.700
why do I even party use kind of like,

3115
03:01:21.701 --> 03:01:25.560
why do I even do it then if no one's going to care,
you know?
Well,
you know,
there,

3116
03:01:25.561 --> 03:01:29.470
there's a lesson to be drawn from that too in terms of relationships that's

3117
03:01:29.471 --> 03:01:31.230
really useful psychologically is,

3118
03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:34.180
and this is a big mistake that people won't make.

3119
03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:38.230
It's like if you want to have a good long term relationship with someone,

3120
03:01:38.770 --> 03:01:42.190
then you watch them constantly and when they do something that you like,

3121
03:01:42.250 --> 03:01:43.300
you let them know,

3122
03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:48.100
even if it's a small thing because they're way more likely to do it again,

3123
03:01:48.101 --> 03:01:48.311
you know?

3124
03:01:48.311 --> 03:01:51.970
And so sometimes a personal have kind of an inkling about what they might do

3125
03:01:51.971 --> 03:01:55.090
that's good or that would be good for your real,
their relationship with you.

3126
03:01:55.630 --> 03:01:58.420
Or that might even just be pleasing to you,
but they won't say anything.

3127
03:01:58.870 --> 03:02:01.830
They're like afraid because maybe they won't get attention for it and,

3128
03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.860
but then they do it and you notice it's like,
man,
that's super powerful.

3129
03:02:05.861 --> 03:02:07.510
Like you have to be really attentive though.

3130
03:02:07.511 --> 03:02:11.740
Cause the good things that people do don't stand out and mistakes.

3131
03:02:11.741 --> 03:02:15.040
They make stand out and then you say,
well you made a mistake.
It's like,
yeah,

3132
03:02:15.340 --> 03:02:19.700
but to,
to watch and to reward someone for doing something small.
Right.
That's,

3133
03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:23.950
that's a step in the right direction.
He's a killer strategy.

3134
03:02:23.980 --> 03:02:27.600
I found that to be true with my daughter.
She's four and a half.
No.
Oh yeah,

3135
03:02:27.601 --> 03:02:28.030
like that.

3136
03:02:28.030 --> 03:02:32.020
Some kids really like some kids are tough and they don't respond to punishment

3137
03:02:32.021 --> 03:02:35.410
at all.
So you can get,
you just can't,
you can't,
you can't,

3138
03:02:35.860 --> 03:02:40.150
you can't intimidate them.
My daughter,
if I just pointed at her,
she would stop.

3139
03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:43.750
But my son,
it was like,
that was just round one.
He just laughed.

3140
03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:46.330
He just laughed and ran away,
you know,
so,

3141
03:02:46.331 --> 03:02:50.440
but he responded to reward like mad if I watched him and he did something that

3142
03:02:50.441 --> 03:02:54.980
was good and I told him that it was like he was just yes.
So Dang,

3143
03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:57.940
that's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's reward is harder to use,

3144
03:02:57.941 --> 03:02:59.950
but it's more effective if you can manage it.

3145
03:03:00.910 --> 03:03:03.610
And then that's not like Kinda how you say we're,
you're like,

3146
03:03:03.611 --> 03:03:06.850
be careful with the reward when you give like too much for you word for these

3147
03:03:06.851 --> 03:03:07.950
small things,
you know?

3148
03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:10.930
And then the [inaudible] going to think that that's a problem with the self

3149
03:03:10.931 --> 03:03:15.640
esteem movement.
You know,
every,
every kid gets a trophy day.
It's no,

3150
03:03:15.641 --> 03:03:19.360
it's like inflating the currency.
If everything is good,

3151
03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:23.650
then nothing is good because their house,
there has to be a distinction.
So yeah,

3152
03:03:23.651 --> 03:03:27.880
you want to watch and you want to see when the person's made an effort and you

3153
03:03:27.881 --> 03:03:31.900
want to see when they've gone beyond the call of duty,
then you want to say,
Hey,

3154
03:03:31.901 --> 03:03:33.960
I noticed that.
That was really good.
Yeah.
And,

3155
03:03:34.170 --> 03:03:37.870
and it is scarcity really matters in those situations because otherwise it just

3156
03:03:37.871 --> 03:03:42.430
turns into noise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Patronizing noise even,
which is even worse.

3157
03:03:42.431 --> 03:03:46.750
It's like all you're doing well or doing well,
what's it like?
Leave me alone.
Eh,

3158
03:03:46.751 --> 03:03:51.450
you know,
it's such a lie.
I have a fun time with that actually.
I'll put like,
um,

3159
03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:54.130
if I have to judge and all through my kids' lives,

3160
03:03:54.131 --> 03:03:58.100
if I had to judge them and their friends and I have three daughters and one son,

3161
03:03:58.250 --> 03:04:00.920
<v 3>usually it was the daughters.
I was being some kind of a judge.</v>

3162
03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:02.600
I'm going to judge the dance,

3163
03:04:02.601 --> 03:04:06.020
I'm going to judge the little play that they put together.

3164
03:04:06.021 --> 03:04:10.580
I'm going to judge the,
uh,
acrobatic routine that they're doing in the backyard.

3165
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:15.020
And I always be judging these things and I would have so much fun because I

3166
03:04:15.021 --> 03:04:19.070
would say they'd do their little performance there,
one minute performance,

3167
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:23.630
and they'd come out table,
how was it?
And I say,
okay,
first of all,

3168
03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:28.100
presentation overall,
I'm giving you a 4.2.

3169
03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.640
I didn't see one smile until you actually got on stage.
That's raw.

3170
03:04:31.641 --> 03:04:35.760
And I would just go through and give them these really strong critique points.

3171
03:04:35.770 --> 03:04:40.730
Yeah.
And,
and they loved it.
They loved it.
That's mad.

3172
03:04:40.850 --> 03:04:42.170
They would be happy to,

3173
03:04:42.210 --> 03:04:47.210
and they'd go try it again and try to race that 4.3 to a 4.5 they'd be smiles

3174
03:04:47.571 --> 03:04:51.660
like you could see from a mile away.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I just got done,

3175
03:04:51.661 --> 03:04:52.100
it was at a,

3176
03:04:52.100 --> 03:04:55.640
at a pool party with a bunch of little kids running around and I ended up

3177
03:04:55.880 --> 03:05:00.880
judging the diving competition and all the parents were watching and they were

3178
03:05:01.430 --> 03:05:05.090
aghast at what I was doing.
Yeah.
That was in my house by the way.
Oh,

3179
03:05:05.091 --> 03:05:08.030
I did it there too.
You know,
I do it all the way,
but I did it at your house too,

3180
03:05:08.031 --> 03:05:12.530
right?
Yeah.
You've seen it in action.
I give the kids a little nicknames and then,

3181
03:05:12.890 --> 03:05:14.660
and then I say,
you know,

3182
03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:18.350
you were completely unbalanced when you left the board.

3183
03:05:18.351 --> 03:05:22.400
It was almost embarrassing for me to watch you go try it again.

3184
03:05:22.401 --> 03:05:24.220
I'm giving you a 2.2 yeah.

3185
03:05:24.560 --> 03:05:26.990
Go try it again and see if you can bump that up a little bit.
Yeah.

3186
03:05:27.170 --> 03:05:31.010
And the kids get all motivated to go up there.
And I give him a two,
2.5 year,

3187
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.890
treated

3188
03:05:31.890 --> 03:05:35.650
<v 4>them like someone who could improve.
True.
Right.
So that's a big deal.
That's,</v>

3189
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:38.940
that's better than,
that's better than a pat on the back.
It's like,

3190
03:05:38.941 --> 03:05:42.810
because everyone's flawed and everyone needs to improve.
Well,

3191
03:05:42.811 --> 03:05:46.500
so when my kids were little,
I taught them how to speak in public.

3192
03:05:47.010 --> 03:05:50.130
It took about an hour.
That was it.
So I had them,

3193
03:05:51.930 --> 03:05:53.610
they had to read something,
you know,

3194
03:05:53.611 --> 03:05:57.300
and so they'd read it and I was across the room and say,
well,

3195
03:05:57.360 --> 03:06:00.720
that's not loud enough.
It's like,
I can't hear Ya.
It's like belted out.

3196
03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:03.960
And they get a little louder and said,
no,
no,
no,
I,
that is what I mean,

3197
03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:08.910
read it way louder than you think you should.
And so they did that.
And I said,

3198
03:06:08.911 --> 03:06:09.721
well,
that's about right,

3199
03:06:09.721 --> 03:06:12.960
because there's nothing more appalling than listening to some speaker that you

3200
03:06:12.961 --> 03:06:16.140
can't hear.
It's like there's just no excuse for that.
And then like,

3201
03:06:16.410 --> 03:06:20.180
make it clearer,
put some passion into it,
you know?
And it was,

3202
03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:23.410
it was unbelievable how quickly they would pick that up,
you know?
And,
and uh,

3203
03:06:23.450 --> 03:06:25.050
that also made me sad because,

3204
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:30.600
because it took so little time to get them to do that and then they had it,

3205
03:06:30.690 --> 03:06:33.570
you know?
And so,
and that,

3206
03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:38.550
that like a critic is your best friend if the critic isn't destructive cause it,

3207
03:06:38.551 --> 03:06:41.190
what a critic does is say,
look,

3208
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:45.330
you did 10 things and like these five things,

3209
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:47.940
you need some work on those.
They're not good.

3210
03:06:47.941 --> 03:06:50.130
And here's some things you could do that would make them better.

3211
03:06:50.430 --> 03:06:52.410
And here's two things that you got.
All right,

3212
03:06:52.411 --> 03:06:56.280
and here's three things that you did pretty well at.
And so then,
well,

3213
03:06:56.281 --> 03:06:58.470
what's the message?
The message is,
hey,

3214
03:06:58.471 --> 03:07:03.000
you can handle some actual criticism so you're not some little,
you know,
useless,

3215
03:07:03.001 --> 03:07:04.380
wimpy thing that's going to die.

3216
03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:07.920
Just because someone isn't telling you that you're already wonderful,

3217
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:11.550
plus you're not already what,
not nearly as wonderful as you could get.

3218
03:07:11.551 --> 03:07:14.280
So let's keep that in mind.
And then you know,

3219
03:07:14.281 --> 03:07:17.670
you lay out a pathway for improvement and then you treat the kid with some

3220
03:07:17.671 --> 03:07:18.540
respect.
And,

3221
03:07:18.570 --> 03:07:22.920
and you also show that being an adult means that you know more than being a kid

3222
03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:25.830
cause you,
you know,
the kid does something,
you say,
oh that was really good.

3223
03:07:25.831 --> 03:07:28.170
It's like,
what are you saying?
Well as an adult,

3224
03:07:28.171 --> 03:07:30.210
I don't know any better than you do.

3225
03:07:31.050 --> 03:07:34.320
And that's pretty dismal message because the kid is going to be an adult for a

3226
03:07:34.321 --> 03:07:35.250
very long time.

3227
03:07:35.550 --> 03:07:39.450
And one of the things we do really badly in our culture is model.

3228
03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:43.950
Why being an adult is better than being a child because it is better.

3229
03:07:44.130 --> 03:07:47.460
You have freedom and you have responsibility and you have autonomy.

3230
03:07:47.880 --> 03:07:51.630
And so we're always so concerned about making our kids feel good about

3231
03:07:51.631 --> 03:07:52.141
themselves.

3232
03:07:52.141 --> 03:07:56.400
It's like they should feel good about becoming responsible adults because

3233
03:07:56.401 --> 03:07:59.250
they're going to be adults for like 80 years and they're going to be kids for

3234
03:07:59.251 --> 03:08:03.360
like 20 years.
So
the adults,
the goal.

3235
03:08:04.140 --> 03:08:06.900
So,
yeah,

3236
03:08:06.901 --> 03:08:09.990
those are interesting when you started doing that because the kids are like

3237
03:08:09.991 --> 03:08:14.000
seven years old and under and he's like letting them have it.
But you,

3238
03:08:14.001 --> 03:08:16.110
you're funny,
you have this kind of tone about too though,

3239
03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:17.550
when you talk to kids that it's like,

3240
03:08:17.551 --> 03:08:21.000
it's almost like live that much over theatrical that month.

3241
03:08:21.001 --> 03:08:24.780
So you can tell he's like playing a character.
Right.
And the kids love it.

3242
03:08:25.050 --> 03:08:27.690
It's so funny.
My daughter like loves him.
Um,

3243
03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:31.770
and the kids are just scrambling around wanting to do it again and they let me

3244
03:08:31.771 --> 03:08:35.430
do this.
Let me do it.
Your daughter's all youth do it.
She's like,
okay.
Okay.

3245
03:08:35.850 --> 03:08:39.510
That's so funny.
So funny kids though,
you know,
big Jocko legal ordering.

3246
03:08:39.511 --> 03:08:42.420
These kids love attention.
Yeah.

3247
03:08:42.450 --> 03:08:47.070
It's their currency and they want attention because adults actually know more

3248
03:08:47.071 --> 03:08:49.950
than they do.
And so if you pay careful attention,

3249
03:08:49.951 --> 03:08:53.100
like I get along really well with little kids and it's because I pay attention

3250
03:08:53.101 --> 03:08:55.020
to them and if they do something good,

3251
03:08:55.530 --> 03:08:59.430
then we had this kid over at our house once.
This is a sad story.

3252
03:08:59.550 --> 03:09:02.400
I told it in my new book.
Um,

3253
03:09:02.730 --> 03:09:06.600
so this kid was about four really cute kid,

3254
03:09:06.750 --> 03:09:09.360
really nice looking kid.
And,
uh,

3255
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:11.940
his nanny had been hurt in a car accident,

3256
03:09:11.941 --> 03:09:14.580
so he was kinda being shuffled around the neighborhood for,

3257
03:09:14.730 --> 03:09:17.610
for daycare for like a week or so away.
And I'd heard some,

3258
03:09:17.611 --> 03:09:21.210
not some rumors about this kid.
And so I was kind of curious.

3259
03:09:21.210 --> 03:09:24.530
And so anyways,
he came over to our house.
My,
my,

3260
03:09:24.570 --> 03:09:28.150
my wife was also taken care of some other kids at this time.
Um,

3261
03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:30.810
and I came home and he was standing,

3262
03:09:30.811 --> 03:09:34.530
the other kids were playing in the living room and he was standing in the porch,

3263
03:09:34.531 --> 03:09:37.800
sort of in the corner,
you know,
kind of just wandering around back and forth.

3264
03:09:38.430 --> 03:09:40.530
And I looked at him and I thought,
that's not so good.

3265
03:09:40.531 --> 03:09:42.060
So I kind of poked him a bit,
you know,

3266
03:09:42.090 --> 03:09:45.090
and I was poking them and trying to get him to play and he had this like really

3267
03:09:45.091 --> 03:09:49.800
mask of a face on unhappy and I poke him and he kind of jerk away and all that

3268
03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:53.560
and I couldn't get him to smile and I couldn't get them to play it.
I thought,

3269
03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.980
that's

3270
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:57.160
<v 2>not good.
That's not good.
Cause he's four,
like he should have</v>

3271
03:09:58.990 --> 03:10:02.770
acted unhappy for two or three pokes and then kind of laughed and then we would

3272
03:10:02.771 --> 03:10:06.970
kind of get into it,
you know,
so,
so that,
that wasn't so good.

3273
03:10:06.971 --> 03:10:11.971
So then we had lunch and the rule at our house was eat your damn lunch and say

3274
03:10:13.661 --> 03:10:17.380
thank you to the person who made it because otherwise they'll cook you horrible

3275
03:10:17.381 --> 03:10:21.670
things and you'll die.
So it's like,

3276
03:10:22.330 --> 03:10:25.570
it's hard to cook lunch for.
You have some gratitude,
you little monsters.

3277
03:10:25.930 --> 03:10:30.580
And so you ate what was there.
And so his mother,
when she dropped him off,

3278
03:10:30.581 --> 03:10:35.320
said he probably won't eat anything all day,
but that's all right.

3279
03:10:35.650 --> 03:10:38.080
And we thought,
well actually no,

3280
03:10:38.081 --> 03:10:41.240
that's not all right because he needs to eat and,
and it's,

3281
03:10:41.290 --> 03:10:44.290
and it's not all right that he doesn't eat wrong.

3282
03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:49.330
And so we'd learned how to feed recalcitrant children by that point.

3283
03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:54.640
And so all the kids were at the table and they were eating and my wife had made

3284
03:10:54.641 --> 03:10:59.080
some chicken stew and he wasn't eating.
And so she was trying to feed them.

3285
03:10:59.081 --> 03:11:03.940
And so we were watching him very carefully and so she bring up the spoon to his

3286
03:11:03.941 --> 03:11:07.150
mouth and he'd like move his head back and forth,
you know,
to refuse it.

3287
03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:10.330
And it was just like about a nine month old would do that a,

3288
03:11:10.390 --> 03:11:12.820
when you're trying to f that's there their first trick.

3289
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:15.670
And so that's a nine month old trick.
And we thought,
okay,

3290
03:11:15.671 --> 03:11:18.850
well something happened when he was nine months old and he never really got

3291
03:11:18.851 --> 03:11:22.330
beyond that.
And so,
um,
you know,

3292
03:11:22.331 --> 03:11:24.700
my wife was fairly persistent with the spoon and

3293
03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:28.160
he'd get annoyed and you know,
a squawk bit.

3294
03:11:28.190 --> 03:11:30.940
She'd put some food in and then he'd swallow it.
And then,

3295
03:11:31.210 --> 03:11:35.290
and then as soon as he took a little bit of food and she'd pat him and tell him

3296
03:11:35.291 --> 03:11:37.840
that he was being a good kid and she,
man today was not a game.

3297
03:11:37.841 --> 03:11:42.070
Like she was really intent on getting this kid to have lunch and so,

3298
03:11:42.700 --> 03:11:46.780
so that's fine.
And he's moving his,
his head back and forth.

3299
03:11:46.781 --> 03:11:49.640
But what was cool as she kept patting him on the head and telling him he was

3300
03:11:49.641 --> 03:11:51.460
good kid,
he was opening his mouth more often,

3301
03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:53.860
even though he was still moving his head back and forth.

3302
03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:59.020
And so it took about 10 minutes or so and she'd fed him the whole bowl of

3303
03:11:59.050 --> 03:12:02.860
chicken stew and she said,
she showed him and he said,
look,
you're a good boy.

3304
03:12:02.861 --> 03:12:06.720
You ate all of it.
And that horrible mask that he was wearing,
you know,

3305
03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:11.680
that mask of unhappiness,
it just fell off of.
And he had this great smile.

3306
03:12:11.681 --> 03:12:12.251
It was just,

3307
03:12:12.251 --> 03:12:16.540
it just made the hair on the back of my neck stand up because you could see that

3308
03:12:16.541 --> 03:12:21.340
was the first damn thing that he had been allowed to succeed at,
you know?

3309
03:12:21.610 --> 03:12:23.110
And so he was thrilled.

3310
03:12:23.530 --> 03:12:27.220
And then for the rest of the day he followed my wife around like a puppy dog.

3311
03:12:27.221 --> 03:12:28.840
Like he was one step behind her.

3312
03:12:28.841 --> 03:12:32.140
And then we went downstairs into the basement and we were watching TV and he

3313
03:12:32.141 --> 03:12:36.070
climbed up in her lap and he grabbed onto her just like there's this famous

3314
03:12:36.071 --> 03:12:39.400
experiment that Harlow did with monkeys and the monkeys could either have the

3315
03:12:39.401 --> 03:12:43.480
wire mother that fed them milk or the cuddly mother that they could claim two,

3316
03:12:43.481 --> 03:12:47.320
they were both artificial and the monkeys preferred the cuddly mother,
you know?

3317
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:50.440
And that's what it was like.
He was just wrapped around her,
you know,

3318
03:12:50.800 --> 03:12:55.490
and then his mother came home and she came downstairs and she took one look at

3319
03:12:55.491 --> 03:12:59.020
this kid wrapped around my wife and she said,
oh,
super.

3320
03:12:59.270 --> 03:13:02.540
And grabbed him and then walked out.
And I thought,
ew,

3321
03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:05.660
that was horrible.

3322
03:13:06.030 --> 03:13:10.670
That was a horrible thing to see because he was in one day with that kid,

3323
03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.250
you'd,
you'd fix him up,
you know,

3324
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:18.550
it was one positive experience was enough to bring them out of his shell and you

3325
03:13:18.681 --> 03:13:22.280
know,
it's okay that he doesn't eat.
It's okay that he stands in the corner,

3326
03:13:22.281 --> 03:13:24.200
doesn't play with the other kids,
you know,

3327
03:13:24.201 --> 03:13:27.380
it's okay that he's miserable and unhappy.
It's like,
Hey,
guess what?

3328
03:13:27.381 --> 03:13:30.080
That's not okay.
It's not even a little bit.
Okay.

3329
03:13:30.530 --> 03:13:33.950
So that's a good example of the use of reward.
You know,
it,
it just,

3330
03:13:34.220 --> 03:13:36.340
it was something to see.
I'll tell you.
Yeah.

3331
03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:41.420
<v 5>Well,
speaking of breaking the loops,</v>

3332
03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:47.510
we'll talk about origin.
So origin American made stuff,

3333
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:51.140
uh,
Jocko has his own line of supplements.

3334
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:56.030
So in the event of your joints,
because that's really the main one,
your joints,

3335
03:13:56.990 --> 03:14:00.500
Jocko,
Super Krill.
Krill oil better than fish oil,
by the way.

3336
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:06.920
What do you make of this when someone,
Kay,

3337
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:11.220
so krill oil back in the day,
my wife's Dad,
my father in law used to always say,

3338
03:14:11.221 --> 03:14:13.340
could take Krill oils for your joint.
It's good.

3339
03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:16.860
And he's one of these like health for lack of better term health nuts,
right?

3340
03:14:17.340 --> 03:14:20.780
I don't know if that's good or bad,
but,
and he'd be like,
yeah,
Krill oil.

3341
03:14:20.970 --> 03:14:25.310
It's even even better than fish oil.
I'm like,
cool.
Never listen,
never listen.

3342
03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:29.090
But then when Jocko,
for some reason takes,
doesn't even say to take it,

3343
03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:30.200
just like he takes it,

3344
03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:32.750
then I start taking it and I reaped the benefits of course.

3345
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:35.480
Cause Krill oil is dope.
But what do you make of that?

3346
03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:38.690
What of the Krill oil do for you?
Just it helped.

3347
03:14:39.020 --> 03:14:42.140
So you know how you get joint just from working out and doing stuff,
you know,

3348
03:14:42.141 --> 03:14:44.960
you can join,
get sore,
especially when you get older,
whatever.
In my experience.

3349
03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:49.130
Um,
so I started taking Krill oil and here's the example,
I said it before,

3350
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:51.620
I'll try to make it quick.
So my daughter,
she was four,

3351
03:14:51.621 --> 03:14:54.020
she was maybe three at the time,
three Sunday.
Um,

3352
03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:56.820
and in the morning how she'd wake me up,
issued,

3353
03:14:56.821 --> 03:14:59.450
she'd wake me up and then when I get up she jumped on my back,

3354
03:14:59.470 --> 03:15:02.000
kind of like she wouldn't let me walk downstairs without her and her bag on my

3355
03:15:02.001 --> 03:15:06.350
back.
So when she do that,
you know,
you just woke up,

3356
03:15:06.351 --> 03:15:09.950
you not warm,
but you may or may not have,
you know,
worked out,
did some training,

3357
03:15:09.951 --> 03:15:10.580
whatever.

3358
03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:14.690
So you kind of got an exercise like perfect form to stand up with this little

3359
03:15:14.691 --> 03:15:18.590
girl who's moving on your,
on your back,
otherwise you get get injured.

3360
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:23.600
So after it was about six days of taking Krill oil,
I didn't have to like,

3361
03:15:23.690 --> 03:15:27.800
it was like I was already warm.
That was the feeling.
That's what I did.

3362
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:28.663
That's cool.

3363
03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:33.720
But why do I listen to Jocko and take Krill oil and not my father in law?

3364
03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:35.950
He went,
oh,
he's telling me the same stove.

3365
03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:40.320
<v 2>Often having an example instead of being told is more effective,</v>

3366
03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:42.570
you know?
And there's a confidence,

3367
03:15:42.571 --> 03:15:46.050
I think that goes along with someone doing something and not telling you about

3368
03:15:46.051 --> 03:15:46.884
it.

3369
03:15:46.970 --> 03:15:51.560
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
You've been psychologically unwound.</v>

3370
03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:56.910
Well nonetheless.
So on top of that job was his own krill oil.
So you know,

3371
03:15:56.911 --> 03:16:00.420
that's the good ones.
Super Krill,
not just regular super,
by the way.

3372
03:16:00.970 --> 03:16:04.950
Also joint warfare,
which is a bunch of other ingredient.

3373
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:07.770
Is that Glucosamine Chondroitin?
Yup.
Yeah.

3374
03:16:09.020 --> 03:16:14.020
You got the perfect formula for joint sustainable joint maintenance and health

3375
03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:19.280
perfection.
That's from origin origin lab.

3376
03:16:19.281 --> 03:16:23.140
So origin main.com on the top menu labs.
Boom.
That's where you get it.

3377
03:16:23.580 --> 03:16:25.590
Is there like a,
I think there's like a,
anyway,

3378
03:16:25.591 --> 03:16:28.710
there's a link on the story anyway.
There needs to be like on our store there is,

3379
03:16:28.770 --> 03:16:32.070
yeah,
there has reads,
boom right there.
Whatever he need.

3380
03:16:32.490 --> 03:16:36.810
Also Giza and rash guards.
If you introduce the into Jujitsu Jordan Peterson,

3381
03:16:36.990 --> 03:16:41.610
I'm not resilient Jujitsu,
there's not much call for that as a professor.

3382
03:16:42.610 --> 03:16:47.610
Seemingly seemingly videos where you might've wanted [inaudible] in your back

3383
03:16:48.091 --> 03:16:49.070
pocket.
Yeah,
yeah.

3384
03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:53.160
Well we've got one coming up on November 11th to talk on free speech and I'm

3385
03:16:53.161 --> 03:16:57.030
afraid there's going to be plenty of trouble at it.
I hope not,

3386
03:16:57.031 --> 03:17:00.780
and I hope that everybody you need security.

3387
03:17:02.430 --> 03:17:07.320
I got crews.
Yeah.
Dang,
that happened.
Boom.
There you go.

3388
03:17:07.770 --> 03:17:09.090
Nonetheless,
if you are into Jiu Jitsu,

3389
03:17:09.091 --> 03:17:12.880
they get some good gies American made by the way for what are,

3390
03:17:12.881 --> 03:17:15.550
you know if you're into the American made stuff from beginning to end.
Yeah.

3391
03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:22.290
Actually I was born in Canada by the way,
where Victoria?
British Columbia.
Yeah,

3392
03:17:23.310 --> 03:17:26.300
but I moved back to Hawaii when I was like two months old.
It was kind of,

3393
03:17:26.301 --> 03:17:28.380
my mom lived in Hawaii.
She was from Canada.

3394
03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:32.370
Go back home to have the kids that between brothers will have us two months

3395
03:17:32.371 --> 03:17:34.230
later,
boom back,
do I,
so it was that kind of deal.

3396
03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:37.500
So you don't have many memories of Victoria.
They're not afraid.

3397
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:39.670
Not only the pictures,
but I've been back a few times.

3398
03:17:39.671 --> 03:17:44.370
I've been to Victoria and Toronto actually.
And worries roar.

3399
03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:48.900
Where is
over then the east coast for some film.
Anyway,

3400
03:17:49.140 --> 03:17:53.790
I digress.
No,
it was,
where did they speak French?
A lot.
Way,

3401
03:17:53.791 --> 03:17:58.270
way over there on the,
on the east coast.
Yeah.
I don't know why I can yeah,

3402
03:17:58.330 --> 03:18:01.200
my trail.
That was good.
That was really nice.
Materials.
Great City.
Yeah,

3403
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:06.370
Rory Macdonald.
And this was with,
anyway,
back to the Geezer and rash guards.
Um,

3404
03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:09.880
we got,
I ate so much at some restaurants,

3405
03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:14.670
a Geico was up there for UFC fighter cut weight and then it's time to go reload

3406
03:18:14.671 --> 03:18:15.930
Montreal,
Montreal.

3407
03:18:16.170 --> 03:18:21.170
And we ended up at this little Italian restaurant and it was insane how good the

3408
03:18:22.261 --> 03:18:25.980
guy was making the noodles.
He made everything,
everything he made himself.

3409
03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:30.480
And then we get done.
I'm,
you know,
just completely gluttonous.

3410
03:18:30.481 --> 03:18:34.020
Lee filled with food and you know,
he comes up,
would you like some dessert?

3411
03:18:34.021 --> 03:18:35.640
And I was like,
no,
anymore.

3412
03:18:36.120 --> 03:18:39.660
And he says it's the best Tiramisu in the world and I have

3413
03:18:41.230 --> 03:18:44.160
a weakness off the program for Tiramisu.

3414
03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:46.440
And he brought it out,

3415
03:18:46.441 --> 03:18:50.050
he made it and it took them 20 minutes to make and he brought it out.

3416
03:18:50.230 --> 03:18:54.130
And it was the best thing that I ever put in my mouth.

3417
03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:58.450
It was so good.
Yeah.
Tiramisu is pretty delicious in Montreal,

3418
03:18:58.451 --> 03:19:01.210
has excellent restaurants.
I wish I remembered the name of the place,

3419
03:19:01.211 --> 03:19:03.310
I'd go back there.
Yeah.
But I don't actually,

3420
03:19:03.311 --> 03:19:05.530
I did find that that month we went to a diner.

3421
03:19:05.890 --> 03:19:09.520
It was just a diner and it seemed like he was the same thing.

3422
03:19:09.521 --> 03:19:11.800
Like they put Carrie in everything,
all the fries or whatever.

3423
03:19:11.820 --> 03:19:16.690
Like it was Kinda like Atlanta by the way.
Yeah.
Yeah man,
it's good.

3424
03:19:17.080 --> 03:19:18.520
Uh,
nonetheless,
Brash guards.

3425
03:19:18.521 --> 03:19:22.360
We do have some new ones coming out from origin and we have our own new ones

3426
03:19:22.361 --> 03:19:26.170
coming out.
But uh,
Pete over there at origin,
he makes a warrior kid a rash.

3427
03:19:26.171 --> 03:19:29.080
Guards are coming out,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's going to be at in the store though,

3428
03:19:29.470 --> 03:19:33.430
which I'll talk about in a little bit.
Okay,
good story by the way.

3429
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:36.640
Also,
fitness gears it or fitness gear.

3430
03:19:36.820 --> 03:19:41.050
If you want to break the loop.
I think that's the theme.

3431
03:19:41.051 --> 03:19:43.480
That's what I'm alleviate.
One of the many things.
By the way,

3432
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:46.240
I'm going to leave here with break the loop so you know how people,

3433
03:19:46.241 --> 03:19:49.420
they want to get more in back into their fitness or improve their current

3434
03:19:49.421 --> 03:19:53.680
fitness.
They want to try kettlebells.
It can be intimidating.
I'm speaking,

3435
03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:57.860
I'm speaking from experience,
but break the loop.
Just get one kettle bell.

3436
03:19:58.570 --> 03:20:02.150
I think you should get the chimp kettle bell.
They're design.

3437
03:20:02.151 --> 03:20:05.570
You know it Kettlebell,
right?
We did talk about chimping.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

3438
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:09.760
Inner Gate and all that.
All the themes,
so you get these kettle bells on it.

3439
03:20:10.090 --> 03:20:13.450
It's the company called on it on it.com/jocko by the way,

3440
03:20:14.470 --> 03:20:16.120
you can get these kettlebells when there isn't.

3441
03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:20.010
They're not just a cannon ball with the handle there like a cannon ball shaped

3442
03:20:20.011 --> 03:20:23.710
like a champ or a werewolf.
They're pretty dope anyway,

3443
03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:28.330
on a.com/jocko check those out and break the loop,
man.
Get it.

3444
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:32.710
Get One,
get two.
I think I have like eight.
No,
legit.

3445
03:20:33.850 --> 03:20:37.600
Also self proclaimed legit.
You're not allowed to do that.

3446
03:20:37.980 --> 03:20:40.840
I'm not saying I'm legit for doing it even though I am,

3447
03:20:40.900 --> 03:20:42.160
but that's not what I'm saying.

3448
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:46.030
I'm saying proclaim yourself as legit.

3449
03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:49.960
It did.
It did.
So someone make that disclaimer.
That's not what I'm saying.

3450
03:20:49.961 --> 03:20:54.700
That's not the point.
The point is my set of kettle bells is legit.
Chimp,

3451
03:20:54.730 --> 03:20:59.680
double chimp,
where we'll double werewolf gorilla double grit.

3452
03:20:59.700 --> 03:21:04.700
These are go at escalation and weights and one a big foot,

3453
03:21:05.050 --> 03:21:09.520
90 pounds.
What's your heaviest one?
I know man.

3454
03:21:10.510 --> 03:21:14.040
Two pounds heavier.
Every rep to,
but where's the legit park?

3455
03:21:17.290 --> 03:21:21.250
Every rep though every set,
every rep,
two more pounds.
Boom.
Over time.

3456
03:21:21.310 --> 03:21:22.930
That is legit.
Also,

3457
03:21:23.320 --> 03:21:27.880
when you get maps of meaning by Dr. Jordan B.

3458
03:21:27.880 --> 03:21:32.050
Peterson all listed on the website talk,
podcast.com are listed on that website.

3459
03:21:32.140 --> 03:21:34.600
Books,
click through there.

3460
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:38.320
That's a good way to support and they come back to Amazon and 12 rules for life.

3461
03:21:38.380 --> 03:21:41.560
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
You can preorder that one.
Yes,
yes,
yes.

3462
03:21:41.650 --> 03:21:45.070
And it's doing pretty well in preorder.
Sold about 4,000 copies.

3463
03:21:45.180 --> 03:21:48.020
Preorders hey.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3464
03:21:48.420 --> 03:21:51.500
We'll double that number when this podcast comes out.
That'd be good.

3465
03:21:51.740 --> 03:21:54.400
That'd be good.
The there,
so yeah,
man,
if you want it.

3466
03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.080
What's cool is people that listen to this podcast,
they read,

3467
03:21:57.140 --> 03:22:01.690
we read books all the time.
They read the books,
they buy the books.
That's it's,

3468
03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:03.650
it's awesome.
Oh,
I should say too.

3469
03:22:03.651 --> 03:22:07.810
Then I have a book list on my website on Jordan B peterson.com yeah,

3470
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:10.600
that's your book of recommended readings and so if you want to,

3471
03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:13.940
well I mean the books,
that had a huge impact on me.
Well,

3472
03:22:13.941 --> 03:22:18.620
ordinary man is ordinary members.
One of them and the rape of Nan King as well.

3473
03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:23.240
Yeah.
Which is a,
we did a podcast and grouping a lot of man.

3474
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:26.240
You would be very interested in the fall one book to that,

3475
03:22:26.300 --> 03:22:30.530
which is called the woman who cared too much,
which is written by Iris Chang's.

3476
03:22:30.700 --> 03:22:34.550
Right?
Yeah,
I know I risk committed suicide.
Yeah.
Well,

3477
03:22:34.551 --> 03:22:37.670
no wonder after investigating that and being harassed for it,

3478
03:22:37.700 --> 03:22:38.600
it's not surprising.

3479
03:22:39.060 --> 03:22:43.420
And it seemed like her mom thought it was a lot to do with the drugs she had

3480
03:22:43.421 --> 03:22:46.850
been prescribed and going on and off drugs.

3481
03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:51.800
And apparently you shouldn't just stop taking one drug and start on some other

3482
03:22:51.801 --> 03:22:53.090
drug.
Apparently she would.

3483
03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:57.320
She was being directed to do that and it was negatively impactful,

3484
03:22:57.380 --> 03:23:00.290
at least according to what her mom thought.
So what a,

3485
03:23:00.291 --> 03:23:03.880
what a travesty that was Yemen.
Uh,
yeah,
I'm sure the,

3486
03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:07.770
your book list and our book list is probably has a lot of overlap.

3487
03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:10.310
Sounds like it's like basically all the books you were talking about,

3488
03:23:10.520 --> 03:23:13.460
we already covered,
like we already covered that.
I'm not saying that,

3489
03:23:13.461 --> 03:23:16.790
but you know,
like we're familiar with it because it's on the same list.

3490
03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:18.330
A lot of overlap.
But yeah,

3491
03:23:18.470 --> 03:23:22.580
I've looked at your list and it's actually not a lot of overlap.
There's a,

3492
03:23:22.690 --> 03:23:25.880
I mean you obviously have a ton of books on there that,
that um,

3493
03:23:26.450 --> 03:23:28.850
a lot of people would be interested in reading that I haven't covered yet.

3494
03:23:29.180 --> 03:23:33.890
So yeah,
perhaps what we'll do,
some of them actually.
Yeah.
So yeah.
But yeah.

3495
03:23:33.900 --> 03:23:35.900
Well these are going to be on that list again.

3496
03:23:35.901 --> 03:23:39.110
Go to [inaudible] dot com on the top little tab.

3497
03:23:39.350 --> 03:23:43.310
It's his books from the episodes and I've got it listed by episode,

3498
03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:47.460
sometimes multiple books per episode by the way.
So yeah,
go through that.

3499
03:23:47.461 --> 03:23:48.410
That's a good way to support.

3500
03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:51.680
Click through there and get those books from Amazon.

3501
03:23:52.400 --> 03:23:55.460
And if you can do other Amazon shopping,
hey,
carry on.
Do that too.

3502
03:23:55.820 --> 03:23:59.660
Good way to support.
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.

3503
03:23:59.661 --> 03:24:02.390
Seems obvious.
I know,
but if you haven't,
boom,
subscribe.

3504
03:24:02.391 --> 03:24:05.390
The good way to support also on youtube like we talked about,

3505
03:24:05.960 --> 03:24:10.730
we only have one channel,
Jordan B.
Peterson has to.
That's good.

3506
03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:14.240
Maybe a good idea though,
cause they go to certain channels for certain things.

3507
03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:15.320
You know what I mean?
Well,

3508
03:24:15.320 --> 03:24:19.010
it's not obvious to what the optimal length of a youtube video is.
You know,

3509
03:24:19.011 --> 03:24:22.520
different links serve different functions and different experts will give you

3510
03:24:22.521 --> 03:24:26.630
different answers with that.
Very interesting.
Hey,
do you ever listen?

3511
03:24:26.660 --> 03:24:28.640
You know how you,
you mentioned that people get your,

3512
03:24:28.641 --> 03:24:32.630
your like little clips of your talks and they'll make their own videos.

3513
03:24:32.631 --> 03:24:36.380
They'll put some music on that,
you know,
they do that with a lot.

3514
03:24:36.381 --> 03:24:37.400
They obviously they do that.

3515
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:40.010
Do you ever like go on there and just kind of watch them and be like,
hey,

3516
03:24:40.011 --> 03:24:44.050
I never really,
really felt it like that,
you know,
with that it music era,

3517
03:24:44.050 --> 03:24:48.150
<v 3>it's really interesting what people do with it.
Junk.
Watch mine.
Yeah,</v>

3518
03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:52.220
it's funny.
That good.
We made her,
he had this little thing about this,

3519
03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:55.200
the expression good.
So it was like,
all right,
let me,

3520
03:24:55.710 --> 03:24:59.400
let me make a video made one of those,
made them watch it,
but he liked it.

3521
03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:03.400
Somebody made a video where they put me through one of those,
uh,

3522
03:25:03.930 --> 03:25:08.280
gadgets that auto tunes your voice.
I was talking about cats and rats.

3523
03:25:08.281 --> 03:25:13.230
And so it's like this sort of rap video that's ridiculous.
No,
it's ridiculous.
But

3524
03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:21.950
I don't know what to think about 500,000 views.
So you know what,

3525
03:25:22.650 --> 03:25:25.620
me and my brother retweeted something as I was telling Michael about this,

3526
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:29.100
you retweet,
you retreated.
Uh,
it's some,

3527
03:25:29.130 --> 03:25:33.260
it's some computer sorting,
something sort of numbers.
It,

3528
03:25:33.480 --> 03:25:37.230
you can just watch this thing sorted and you'd be posted two or three of them

3529
03:25:37.470 --> 03:25:42.470
and I watched all three and it's just kind of funny that how do we get to a

3530
03:25:42.841 --> 03:25:46.050
place where we're watching a computer sort things and it's,
well first of all,

3531
03:25:46.051 --> 03:25:48.030
why is that on youtube or in the first place?

3532
03:25:48.360 --> 03:25:50.170
And I'm sitting there watching it and I'm a,

3533
03:25:50.171 --> 03:25:55.171
I'm a person that that constantly tells people don't waste your time on youtube

3534
03:25:55.501 --> 03:25:57.420
videos.
And there I was watching,
you know,

3535
03:25:57.421 --> 03:26:02.160
three 45 second youtube videos of numbers being sorted,

3536
03:26:02.460 --> 03:26:04.020
therapeutic grade like that,

3537
03:26:04.021 --> 03:26:08.880
kind of like to see things being sorted or like you ever seen those big domino

3538
03:26:08.881 --> 03:26:11.910
patterns,
you know,
that they've made and they just have a video of it.

3539
03:26:11.911 --> 03:26:15.200
And you're just watching the domino pattern,
you know,
it's kind of the same.
Well,

3540
03:26:15.210 --> 03:26:16.110
we've actually actually,

3541
03:26:16.111 --> 03:26:19.830
I feel bad now and we failed to talk about sort yourself out today.

3542
03:26:19.831 --> 03:26:22.710
We didn't even use the word sort until right now.
That's a real,

3543
03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:27.570
that's a real mistake on my part.
You know,
for those of you that will,

3544
03:26:27.571 --> 03:26:31.800
you'll find this as you get into Jordan's work,

3545
03:26:31.890 --> 03:26:36.270
you'll see that he talks about sorting yourself out and how that's what you need

3546
03:26:36.271 --> 03:26:39.590
to do is sort yourself out.
Yes,

3547
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:43.320
you can buy it on tee shirts and all sorts of things.

3548
03:26:43.321 --> 03:26:48.060
So to that and clean your room,
which is,
I really think that's so funny.
It's so,

3549
03:26:48.061 --> 03:26:51.180
it's so absurd.
So much of what's happened in the last year.

3550
03:26:51.181 --> 03:26:53.940
It's been surreal and absurd,
but that's certainly one of them.

3551
03:26:53.970 --> 03:26:56.640
You want to talk about absurd.
The other day I was,

3552
03:26:57.660 --> 03:27:01.880
had my daughter cleaning her room and I was playing a joke,

3553
03:27:02.050 --> 03:27:05.570
Jordan Peterson clip of you telling people to,

3554
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:10.140
I don't be calling her on her room.
She's getting so mad at me.

3555
03:27:11.130 --> 03:27:13.380
But I thought it was fun.
And then,

3556
03:27:13.410 --> 03:27:17.880
and then she told me yesterday that she had had a conversation with her friends

3557
03:27:17.940 --> 03:27:21.180
about torturous things and mean things that their parents had done.

3558
03:27:21.240 --> 03:27:22.300
And that is what she used

3559
03:27:24.390 --> 03:27:28.910
me as an instrument of torture.
You are there now?

3560
03:27:28.911 --> 03:27:32.430
Yeah.
I didn't understand that.
I can,
I can understand that.

3561
03:27:32.820 --> 03:27:37.770
But those youtube clips,
like how you say they made the rap video.
Right.

3562
03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:40.100
So I'll let that and like me and my brother would always talk,

3563
03:27:40.180 --> 03:27:42.100
he'd always say that what people

3564
03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:46.350
<v 5>do when they add the music to your voice,
it almost gives it like this.
Um,</v>

3565
03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:50.170
you know how like when it's might be a crude comparison,

3566
03:27:50.171 --> 03:27:51.100
but you know how like dogs,

3567
03:27:51.101 --> 03:27:54.140
you got to give them their medicine but you got to put in the food,
you know,

3568
03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:56.950
so it's kind of that,
you know,
like okay,
you know,

3569
03:27:56.951 --> 03:28:00.340
this University of Toronto professor,
I get it.

3570
03:28:00.370 --> 03:28:03.790
Maybe a other people might not get it cause it's just this quote unquote boring

3571
03:28:03.791 --> 03:28:06.310
lecture.
But then put some cool music behind it.
Yeah.

3572
03:28:06.311 --> 03:28:09.570
Well and I think people are doing that because they do find something,
you know,

3573
03:28:09.580 --> 03:28:13.330
they find a statement or two that hits them yesterday and they like to play with

3574
03:28:13.331 --> 03:28:15.700
it.
And as far as I'm concerned,
like more power to them.

3575
03:28:15.701 --> 03:28:18.310
It's really interesting to see how that multiplies out.

3576
03:28:18.311 --> 03:28:23.311
You know it's been fascinating to watch that into on artists are rap artists

3577
03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:27.520
made a song,

3578
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:32.670
the song is called two free and it's a guy rapping and I forget his name right

3579
03:28:33.821 --> 03:28:35.560
now.
I apologize.

3580
03:28:35.680 --> 03:28:40.680
But he's rapping and then the song like his rapping fades out and incomes me

3581
03:28:41.051 --> 03:28:43.540
talking about discipline equals freedom in the middle of this rap song.

3582
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:48.790
It's like the last minute of his rap song thing and I was going back and forth

3583
03:28:48.791 --> 03:28:51.250
with him on Twitter and he's like yeah man I really dug what you said.

3584
03:28:51.251 --> 03:28:54.160
I heard it on jre.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you're like a rapper

3585
03:28:56.850 --> 03:29:01.120
the rapper too though.
No you guys both are straight up rap artists,
poet,

3586
03:29:01.330 --> 03:29:02.163
author,

3587
03:29:03.120 --> 03:29:07.870
Badass Tang.
That's legit right there.

3588
03:29:08.230 --> 03:29:13.120
Nonetheless Youtube.
That's a good way to,
to support subscribed Jocko podcast,

3589
03:29:13.330 --> 03:29:17.350
the legitimate Jocko podcasts though.
Cause there could be fake accounts.

3590
03:29:19.270 --> 03:29:23.020
I remember there were Oh,
podcast,
youtube channel.

3591
03:29:23.021 --> 03:29:26.590
That's where you'll see actually it's not very hard to distinguish at this
point.

3592
03:29:26.890 --> 03:29:29.920
None the less good way to subscribe.
Also Jocko is a store.

3593
03:29:30.250 --> 03:29:33.100
It's called Jocko store.
That's a cool name.
Right?

3594
03:29:34.100 --> 03:29:38.980
It's also like direct drive,
right to the point.
The whole deal.
Yeah man.

3595
03:29:38.981 --> 03:29:42.070
Just like just like the name of the best ones to have the Jordan Peterson

3596
03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:46.870
podcast.
Go and see.
Feel creative.
You scored high on openness.

3597
03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:52.370
Have to scratch my head over that one.
You're doing the same boat,
you know,

3598
03:29:52.510 --> 03:29:55.900
but it is the legit store.
Nonetheless.
I'm still a basic store,

3599
03:29:55.901 --> 03:29:57.700
but what we've got on there and got some shirts,

3600
03:29:58.450 --> 03:30:02.140
some rash guards for digital and surfing actually for pretty much any physical

3601
03:30:02.141 --> 03:30:04.480
activity,
cycling,
whatever.
Um,

3602
03:30:04.840 --> 03:30:07.720
also some women's stuff on there and hats.

3603
03:30:08.170 --> 03:30:12.820
Hoodies are out for the winter,
so he's from Canada.

3604
03:30:12.821 --> 03:30:17.050
He needs legit.
He's from Hawaii.
He's not,
he's from Hawaii.

3605
03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:20.770
And last hoodies that he made were thinner than your shirt that you're wearing

3606
03:30:20.771 --> 03:30:24.910
right now.
They were inappropriate as hoodies.
So he beefed it up again this year.

3607
03:30:24.940 --> 03:30:27.880
Slight exaggeration,
but true nonetheless.
So yeah,
they're,

3608
03:30:27.881 --> 03:30:31.870
they're thicker hoodies for sure.
And they're in some patches on there.
Again,

3609
03:30:31.871 --> 03:30:36.010
some women's stuff for you,
you know the lady trooper after it.

3610
03:30:36.680 --> 03:30:40.520
Um,
so yeah,
should be all good on there.
Uh,
some new stuff coming out,

3611
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:45.300
going to let you guys wait on what those things are.
Anyway,

3612
03:30:45.320 --> 03:30:50.210
let's just go store.com.
That's a good,
I know.
Like it's this big thing,

3613
03:30:50.211 --> 03:30:54.860
you know,
there's four people that are waiting till the next day.

3614
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:57.440
I'm just saying that's the one talking to him.
Boom.
Anyway,

3615
03:30:57.500 --> 03:31:01.370
it's called [inaudible] dot com.
Easy to remember also.
Okay,

3616
03:31:01.730 --> 03:31:05.600
so psychological warfare tell you what that is.
Makes sense to.

3617
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:10.230
So when you're on the path,
that's what we're calling it,
right?
The Path.
Yeah.

3618
03:31:11.090 --> 03:31:14.210
Discipline.
Right.
And when you know how like,
okay,
I'm going to check,

3619
03:31:14.211 --> 03:31:16.490
you got to keep doing that stuff.
You know,
you can't just be like,

3620
03:31:16.491 --> 03:31:18.800
I'm going to quit drinking and then just quit drinking for one day.

3621
03:31:18.860 --> 03:31:23.840
You got to do it for,
for good.
But some days you find that it's like hard,

3622
03:31:24.440 --> 03:31:26.900
like with Seminole wake up four 30 in the morning every morning.

3623
03:31:26.930 --> 03:31:30.230
Now for the rest of my life,
one day it's going to be like I can't do,

3624
03:31:30.231 --> 03:31:33.620
I'm going to hit snooze.
But now psychological warfare,

3625
03:31:33.621 --> 03:31:38.060
it's an album with tracks you can get on iTunes,
whatever.

3626
03:31:38.180 --> 03:31:42.740
And each track is for each little weakness that might come up.

3627
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.730
See what I'm saying?

3628
03:31:43.730 --> 03:31:46.490
So let's say you're about to wake up you and hit the snooze instead of the

3629
03:31:46.491 --> 03:31:50.000
snooze.
Psychological warfare.
Get up and get after it.

3630
03:31:50.001 --> 03:31:50.834
That's the name of the truck.

3631
03:31:52.100 --> 03:31:56.570
It'll have Jocko telling you pragmatically why you shouldn't do that,

3632
03:31:56.960 --> 03:31:58.790
why you should stay strong,
stay on it.

3633
03:31:58.791 --> 03:32:03.170
Stay on the path you campaign against weakness.
And also,
you know,
it's,

3634
03:32:03.210 --> 03:32:05.000
it goes for a bunch of stuff.
Like,
um,

3635
03:32:05.780 --> 03:32:09.480
you want to skip the workout that day or you're procrastinating,
you know,

3636
03:32:09.490 --> 03:32:12.680
I'm gonna leave it for tomorrow.
Whatever.
Create a block,
all that stuff anyway.

3637
03:32:12.980 --> 03:32:14.810
It's called psychological warfare.
Check it out.

3638
03:32:14.811 --> 03:32:19.811
See if the it see if any one or more of the tracks addresses your potential

3639
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:24.620
weakness on your path.
That's what it's for

3640
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:26.370
<v 3>and that by the way,</v>

3641
03:32:26.371 --> 03:32:31.371
that that album was the number one spoken word album for something like nine

3642
03:32:31.771 --> 03:32:36.150
months and it was only recently,
and this is on iTunes.

3643
03:32:36.390 --> 03:32:41.390
It was only recently overtaken by another album that's called the discipline

3644
03:32:41.971 --> 03:32:45.720
equals freedom field manual.
What do aversion audio version,

3645
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:50.730
which is now on iTunes and Amazon music and Google play and other,

3646
03:32:50.760 --> 03:32:55.650
did you read it?
Yes.
You did?
Yes,
because I'd been thinking about reading my,

3647
03:32:56.280 --> 03:32:57.780
Oh you absolutely should.
I read this,

3648
03:32:58.500 --> 03:33:02.370
I read this with my buddy leaf and this book,
the kids book way,

3649
03:33:02.371 --> 03:33:04.650
the where your kid,
my son read,

3650
03:33:05.160 --> 03:33:10.160
he read the kid and I read Uncle Jake so I have fun with that kind of thing.

3651
03:33:11.220 --> 03:33:13.680
Also when you're an Amazon you can get Jocko white tea,

3652
03:33:14.370 --> 03:33:18.150
which you may want to try it.
Do you ever dead lift weights?
Okay.

3653
03:33:18.390 --> 03:33:21.900
This will give you a minimum dead lift of 8,000 pounds.

3654
03:33:21.901 --> 03:33:26.901
If you drink Jocko white tea and it's guaranteed it's work that is more than

3655
03:33:27.901 --> 03:33:30.150
I've ever been able to dead lift.
Well there you go.

3656
03:33:30.420 --> 03:33:32.280
You're stuck at that 7,000 pounds.

3657
03:33:33.330 --> 03:33:35.450
You need to get to [inaudible].

3658
03:33:36.420 --> 03:33:40.830
It will get you there 100% also on Amazon obviously we got the books,

3659
03:33:41.190 --> 03:33:45.810
Jordan's books,
maps of meaning and 12 rules for life.
Preorder it.

3660
03:33:46.200 --> 03:33:48.620
The thing that this is what's going to happen and I had to warn people that it

3661
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:52.200
was going to happen and it's going to happen to your book to your publisher

3662
03:33:52.201 --> 03:33:55.290
doesn't understand what's happening.
They don't understand youtube.

3663
03:33:55.291 --> 03:33:57.750
They don't understand your podcast.
They don't understand this podcast.

3664
03:33:57.751 --> 03:33:59.190
They can understand Joe Rogan's podcast.

3665
03:33:59.191 --> 03:34:02.280
They don't understand that and so they're printing books and they think,
Oh yeah,

3666
03:34:02.370 --> 03:34:03.420
we think it's going to do okay.

3667
03:34:04.050 --> 03:34:08.640
The book is going to sell out so people don't preorder the book.
They won't get,

3668
03:34:09.090 --> 03:34:10.080
there's two things.
First of all,

3669
03:34:10.081 --> 03:34:12.480
they won't get it when it comes out and second of all they won't get the first

3670
03:34:12.481 --> 03:34:16.350
edition copy,
which is kind of like if you're a book guy,
you want that thing.

3671
03:34:16.351 --> 03:34:21.150
If you want it to be first edition.
So if you want his book,
which you do,

3672
03:34:21.210 --> 03:34:25.200
preorder it,
do it now.
Um,
way the warrior kid,

3673
03:34:25.650 --> 03:34:26.880
if you want to put your kid,

3674
03:34:27.090 --> 03:34:30.720
if you want to sort your kit out and put them on the proper path,

3675
03:34:30.721 --> 03:34:35.670
the proper path,
get them book way.
The warrior kid,
you said you read it?
Yep.
Okay.

3676
03:34:35.930 --> 03:34:39.620
<v 4>Yeah.
It's funny.
I use that term too in my,
in my book the proper path.</v>

3677
03:34:39.920 --> 03:34:44.270
My editor asked me quite repair repetitively.

3678
03:34:44.271 --> 03:34:47.000
I'd say what exactly what I meant by that,
but it's,
you know,

3679
03:34:47.050 --> 03:34:50.330
sort of implicit in the book,
but proper is the right word for that.

3680
03:34:50.331 --> 03:34:54.890
For some reason it's,
even though it's kind of an old word in some ways,

3681
03:34:54.891 --> 03:34:56.480
old fashioned word,
that's okay.

3682
03:34:56.720 --> 03:34:59.750
There's a lot of old fashioned words that we could,
that we could use.
Again,

3683
03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:00.790
<v 3>I agree.
And I,</v>

3684
03:35:00.970 --> 03:35:03.700
I wrote this book because all the books that were out there for kids,

3685
03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:09.000
we're telling them that there was okay to be weak and that it was okay to do bad

3686
03:35:09.551 --> 03:35:12.040
in school and maybe they weren't smart enough to,

3687
03:35:12.250 --> 03:35:14.160
to know their times tables and all of these.

3688
03:35:14.161 --> 03:35:16.060
So maybe it's okay if you're scared of the water,

3689
03:35:16.061 --> 03:35:19.450
maybe should just stay away from the water.
It's like,
no,
no,
no and no.

3690
03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:23.020
Do you want,
yeah,
it's not okay to be like that,

3691
03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:27.730
but it is okay to be strong and it is okay to study hard and work hard.

3692
03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:31.360
It is okay to face your fears.
Yeah.
It's okay to stand up to the bully.

3693
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:35.390
It's okay to do those things.
It's proper to do this thing so far.

3694
03:35:35.810 --> 03:35:39.200
<v 4>Well,
that's the problem with that damn self esteem movement.
It's like,</v>

3695
03:35:39.201 --> 03:35:43.190
you know what you're supposed to be telling kids is that who you are is more

3696
03:35:43.191 --> 03:35:43.551
important.

3697
03:35:43.551 --> 03:35:47.760
Who you could be as more important than who you are because you're living it.

3698
03:35:47.761 --> 03:35:50.010
It's like,
what do you live in for your,
you know,
if,

3699
03:35:50.011 --> 03:35:53.540
if you're already everything you should be,
it's like,
well,
you know,
you're done.

3700
03:35:54.230 --> 03:35:58.820
So what good is it growing up?
That's not helpful.
It's like you say,

3701
03:35:58.821 --> 03:36:02.330
look man,
you're full of potential.
There's,
there's worlds out there to conquer.

3702
03:36:02.331 --> 03:36:05.240
There's things to do.
There's people to help.
There's things to put right.

3703
03:36:05.450 --> 03:36:09.770
Get the hell together,
get it together.
And don't let your fears stop you

3704
03:36:10.260 --> 03:36:13.740
<v 3>as opposed to everything's great and you're,
you're,
you're this wonderful child.</v>

3705
03:36:13.741 --> 03:36:17.090
Why would you want to then burden yourself with a bunch of responsibility?

3706
03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.730
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm already good to go.
Yeah,
you're right.
No,

3707
03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:21.653
unburdened me.

3708
03:36:22.220 --> 03:36:25.380
<v 4>No,
that's not true because they're not like ended.
Well,</v>

3709
03:36:25.381 --> 03:36:30.381
people in general notice because they're not satisfied with their life.

3710
03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:34.800
They have a feeling that there's gotta be more,
well,
there is more,

3711
03:36:34.830 --> 03:36:39.830
but the more isn't by radical self acceptance of all your pathetic floors,

3712
03:36:41.050 --> 03:36:41.883
right?

3713
03:36:43.970 --> 03:36:47.690
<v 3>Uh,
extreme ownership.
Another book you can get,</v>

3714
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:52.100
it's about personal responsibility and how that will make you win as a leader.

3715
03:36:53.300 --> 03:36:55.940
So get that book.
If you don't have it yet and if you don't have,

3716
03:36:55.941 --> 03:36:58.550
if you have it and you want your team to be better,

3717
03:36:58.551 --> 03:37:01.330
get the book for your team so that they start taking ownership of the problems

3718
03:37:01.340 --> 03:37:05.120
that and,
and then the problems start getting solved.
Discipline equals freedom.

3719
03:37:05.210 --> 03:37:07.490
Um,
field manual.
It's out.

3720
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:13.030
Thanks to everyone that bought it and made it into a bestseller on New York

3721
03:37:13.101 --> 03:37:16.250
Times bestseller or Wall Street Journal Bestseller.
Those things are cool.

3722
03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:21.000
Guess what?
Appreciate it.
Appreciate all you out there buying the book,

3723
03:37:21.001 --> 03:37:22.790
spreading a word.
All,

3724
03:37:22.791 --> 03:37:27.791
everyone that's sent pictures of 12 books stacked up that you're buying for

3725
03:37:28.580 --> 03:37:30.740
everyone on your team or everyone you know,

3726
03:37:30.741 --> 03:37:33.470
or you're buying them for Christmas and your dad and your uncle.

3727
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:35.640
Thank you for doing that.
Um,

3728
03:37:35.900 --> 03:37:39.530
because not only does it help the book do well and continue to help the book do

3729
03:37:39.531 --> 03:37:43.280
well,
it's also gonna help those people out in my opinion.
I agree.

3730
03:37:43.460 --> 03:37:45.220
Not that everyone's going to get it.
Some people are going to go,

3731
03:37:45.250 --> 03:37:50.090
this book is stupid.
Impossible.
You know,
and what we talked about earlier,

3732
03:37:50.091 --> 03:37:53.120
some people read the book and they go,
Oh,
I already knew that.
Well,

3733
03:37:53.121 --> 03:37:57.290
of course you did,
but why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you do it?

3734
03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:03.380
Because someone obviously thinks you need to do it.
So okay,

3735
03:38:03.381 --> 03:38:06.140
you get it.
That's fine.
Yeah.
You know what you're supposed to do.
Guess what?

3736
03:38:06.141 --> 03:38:07.220
We all know what we're supposed to do.

3737
03:38:07.340 --> 03:38:10.100
We all know what's going to improve our station in life and what's going to make

3738
03:38:10.101 --> 03:38:13.370
it worse.
Why aren't you doing the things that you're supposed to do?
Question.

3739
03:38:15.090 --> 03:38:18.210
I Dunno.
Now you've got a man.
You actually do you want to know why?

3740
03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:19.380
Because you lack the discipline.

3741
03:38:19.770 --> 03:38:23.780
You lack the discipline to do the things you know you're supposed to do.
Don't.

3742
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:28.620
<v 4>Oh,
you might also lack the fear so I could actually matters if you don't do it</v>

3743
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:31.140
matters.
If you leave things undone,

3744
03:38:31.141 --> 03:38:35.280
you leave the world in an uncompleted state and it hurts.
It hurts you.

3745
03:38:35.281 --> 03:38:38.700
It hurts your family,
it hurts your society,
and it hurts the world.

3746
03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:42.710
So if you're laying there being useless and not getting out at,

3747
03:38:42.750 --> 03:38:46.890
then you're contributing to the catastrophe.
And it's that simple.

3748
03:38:47.100 --> 03:38:49.230
So it actually matters if you do it.

3749
03:38:49.231 --> 03:38:52.140
And I think sometimes people don't do it cause they don't understand that,

3750
03:38:52.590 --> 03:38:55.740
you know,
they're,
they're down on themselves.
They don't think they matter.

3751
03:38:55.920 --> 03:38:58.290
It's like you matter a lot more than you think you,

3752
03:38:58.350 --> 03:39:01.380
you do an actually that's rather frightening,
you know,
because you think,

3753
03:39:01.381 --> 03:39:03.150
well wouldn't it be nice if everybody mattered?

3754
03:39:03.151 --> 03:39:06.630
It's like you got to think that through.
If what you do matters,

3755
03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:08.280
you better look out,

3756
03:39:09.090 --> 03:39:11.880
so get at it because you're going to pay for it if you don't.

3757
03:39:12.690 --> 03:39:13.523
<v 1>Sure.</v>

3758
03:39:17.640 --> 03:39:20.500
<v 3>No.
Thank you.
Yes.
I,
I obviously agree that and,</v>

3759
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:23.220
and a lot of people have been asking for the audio version and like I said,

3760
03:39:23.221 --> 03:39:27.660
it's on the MP three platforms.
It's on Google play,
iTunes,
Amazon music,

3761
03:39:27.690 --> 03:39:32.520
Spotify.
Yes.
Spotify,
I think you can ask Alexa to play it right.

3762
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:37.010
If you have digital thing in Europe that if it's on Amazon music,

3763
03:39:37.011 --> 03:39:41.250
I think it automatically does it.
I don't know for sure.
But you know,

3764
03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:42.350
um,

3765
03:39:42.350 --> 03:39:47.350
if you need some leadership support training at your team or Your Business

3766
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:52.370
Ashkelon Front,
that is the leadership consultant company.

03:39:55.490 --> 03:39:57.980
We'll come and get after it with you and your leadership team.

3769
03:39:58.430 --> 03:40:00.920
If you want to keep this conversation going,

3770
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:05.540

3771
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:10.130
Instagram,
and on the face.
Ball key echo is at echocharles.

3772
03:40:10.131 --> 03:40:15.110
I am at Jocko Willink and Jordan is Jordan B.

3773
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:18.500
Peterson on Twitter,
Jordan B.

3774
03:40:18.740 --> 03:40:22.460
and Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson on Facebook.
And like I said,

3775
03:40:22.461 --> 03:40:27.370
you also have the podcast as well echoed to

3776
03:40:27.450 --> 03:40:31.010
<v 4>Nico Vink closing thoughts.
That's it.
Thank you so much.
Hey,</v>

3777
03:40:31.020 --> 03:40:35.120
thanks for the invitation.
It's been great.
Yeah,
it looks like we're uh,

3778
03:40:35.580 --> 03:40:37.970
doing the same thing from different directions.
So that's,

3779
03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:43.620
and not so different even.
So that's pretty cool.
So yeah,
that's good.

3780
03:40:43.680 --> 03:40:47.780
Anything else from you?
Nope,
don't think so.
I appreciate it.
And we'll,
we'll,

3781
03:40:47.781 --> 03:40:52.470
we'll get you back on here before 12 rules comes out and we'll talk about that

3782
03:40:52.471 --> 03:40:56.130
book.
And a little bit more detail.
I'll get you an advanced copy.
Awesome.

3783
03:40:57.470 --> 03:41:02.090
<v 3>And thank you for coming on obviously,
but more important,</v>

3784
03:41:02.091 --> 03:41:06.740
thanks for being out there.
Thanks for spreading a positive message.
Again,

3785
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:10.730
very aligned with what I say.
You're coming at people from a diff,

3786
03:41:10.731 --> 03:41:12.590
totally different angle than I come from.

3787
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:16.430
But that message I think is gonna make people better,
which in turn,

3788
03:41:16.431 --> 03:41:19.670
as you just said,
is going to make the world a better place.
And I know,

3789
03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:25.120
I know that you are working hard to make this happen and I truly appreciate the

3790
03:41:27.261 --> 03:41:28.550
fact that you are doing that.

3791
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:32.980
<v 4>So it doesn't seem like there's anything better to do.
Good.
Well</v>

3792
03:41:35.580 --> 03:41:38.620
that's kind of,
it seems like a basic truth,
doesn't it?

3793
03:41:38.621 --> 03:41:42.790
It's like there are things that aren't so good we could probably fix most of
the,

3794
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:47.410
so like what you got something better to do than that.
It doesn't seem like it,

3795
03:41:47.740 --> 03:41:52.420
but let's at least have a good shot at it.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

3796
03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:56.550
<v 3>And to the people that make this podcast possible.</v>

3797
03:41:56.700 --> 03:41:59.460
And that is the soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,

3798
03:41:59.461 --> 03:42:04.461
and Marines on the front lines who protect our right to free speech.

3799
03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:11.240
Those folks that are living out the archetype of the hero,

3800
03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:15.300
they're out there fighting the dragon and killing the snakes and protecting us

3801
03:42:15.301 --> 03:42:16.134
from evil.

3802
03:42:16.470 --> 03:42:21.470
Thanks to all you service men and women for protecting us and to police and law

3803
03:42:21.721 --> 03:42:25.620
enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,
and other first responders.

3804
03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:30.420
Thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and to everyone else that is

3805
03:42:30.421 --> 03:42:34.860
listening.
Remember this,
there is evil in the world.

3806
03:42:36.420 --> 03:42:41.420
There are snakes and there are dragons and there are deprived human beings and

3807
03:42:42.060 --> 03:42:45.330
pathologies that can rip you apart.

3808
03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:53.040
But there is also your world that you control and you have the ability to stand

3809
03:42:54.911 --> 03:42:59.911
up against evil and against those snakes in your own way

3810
03:43:01.720 --> 03:43:05.290
and make your world a better place.

3811
03:43:06.490 --> 03:43:10.150
So stand up
and get after it.

3812
03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:13.420
So until next time,

3813
03:43:13.690 --> 03:43:18.690
this is Dr. Jordan Peterson and echo and Jocko out.
