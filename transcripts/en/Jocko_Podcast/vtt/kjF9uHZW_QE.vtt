This is Jocko podcast number one 50 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.590
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.550
And who are the young men we are asking to go into action against such solid

4
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.274
odds

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.530
<v 1>you've met them,
you know</v>

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.060
<v 0>they are the best we have,</v>

7
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.920
but they are not McNamara's sons or Bundys.

8
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.720
I doubt they are yours.
And they know,

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.440
they know they are at the end of the pipeline

10
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.050
that no one cares.

11
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.093
<v 1>They know.</v>

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.770
<v 0>And that right there is an anonymous quote from a general in Vietnam,</v>

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.660
two correspondent,
a war correspondent named Arthur Hailey,

14
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:09.661
who is actually himself a decorated tank commander in World War II who enlisted

15
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:15.370
in the army.
And there's a key word I said there.
You know,

16
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.430
a volunteer who voluntarily enlisted in the army in World War II and in Vietnam

17
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.520
and the Vietnam War.

18
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.620
You hear a lot about the draftees in Vietnam.
And in fact,

19
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.890
25% of the forces that fought in Vietnam were draftees.

20
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360
And draftees accounted for 30% of the deaths in Vietnam.

21
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.250
Now on this podcast,

22
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:51.730
we've heard from a bunch of those volunteers,

23
00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:55.300
a bunch of those career soldiers,

24
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.070
marines that fought in Vietnam.

25
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.770
But tonight we're honored to have as someone on the podcast

26
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
that was not necessarily a v a volunteer that was not necessarily looking to be

27
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.740
in the military for a career,

28
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.600
but who nonetheless a stepped up and did his job for our country.

29
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.260
And once he served his time,

30
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.950
he came home and lived his life and he had a son and his son is also joined us

31
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.100
on the podcast.
And his son took a different route.

32
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.510
He was guided by his dad,

33
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.130
but he was guided not to war but to the water.

34
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.660
So we have tonight,
Dave Hall,

35
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.910
Vietnam veteran tanker,

36
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.040
who's also the father of Josh Hall,
who's a surfer,

37
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.420
a craftsmen,
a surfboard,
and an entrepreneur.

38
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.870
And I think we're looking forward to this at least I am so welcome to the show,

39
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.570
both of you.
Thanks for coming on,
Josh.
Dave,
awesome to have you.
Yeah,

40
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.200
thanks for coming out here from Hawaii.
I know,
you know,

41
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.200
most people don't want to leave Hawaii.
No one new there.

42
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.590
But I'm glad we were able to drag out here.

43
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.180
<v 2>No,
it was a burden on me.</v>

44
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.480
<v 0>Yeah,
I love to see my son.
Awesome.
Awesome Josh.
Thanks for coming on.</v>

45
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.373
Thank you John.

46
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.710
I know we've been seeing each other in the water for awhile and at contests and

47
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.170
whatnot,
so it's good we linked up and,

48
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.300
and have this opportunity to come on and talk about it.

49
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.770
Talk about some of my favorite things,
Warren and surfing.

50
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.690
So Dave,
we've got to start with you and you know,

51
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.020
we always kind of try and take it back to the beginning and just kind of what

52
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.920
your background was and you know where you came from.

53
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.850
I know what you were born in,
born in Boston,
Massachusetts.

54
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.110
And what'd Your Dad do?

55
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.010
<v 2>My Dad was a,
my dad did many things.
A World War Two.</v>

56
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:15.011
He is a pilot and a [inaudible] 17 over in England.

57
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.570
And

58
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.980
<v 0>so that's one that just slipped under the radar because your dad was a B 17</v>

59
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:23.800
pilot in World War II.
Yeah.
Dang.

60
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.860
<v 2>And be 20 fours and,
uh,</v>

61
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.690
he always wanted to be a fighter pilot and he tried to go to the Pacific

62
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.590
minutiae.
That never happened.
So anyway,
he's married my mom.

63
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.250
Um,
and then,
uh,

64
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

65
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.650
<v 2>We ended up living in Boston for awhile.</v>

66
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.650
I mean we travel around the country cause he was still in the service and an air

67
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:52.310
force,
uh,
living in Texas and lived in Colorado.
Lived in [inaudible].

68
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.480
<v 0>Was He,
was he a career army guy?
Army Air Force Guy,</v>

69
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.320
<v 2>yes.
For a little while.
Okay.
I don't know exactly when he got out,</v>

70
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:04.090
when he did get out.
Um,
he started flying for United Airlines.
Okay.

71
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.220
And I know in the 50s and stuff he went to,
I don't think he went to Korea.

72
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.280
I,
I'm lost right now.

73
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.830
<v 2>Um,
but uh,
yeah,
he,
he uh,</v>

75
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.450
he did a multitude of things.
He was a teacher,
a lawyer,
a farmer,

76
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.700
a farm in Nebraska.
He was born in Nebraska,
had we had a big ranch back there.

77
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.190
And um,

78
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.760
he taught school in Nebraska and then,
uh,

79
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

80
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.010
<v 2>We had been living in Santa Ana till I was nine years old.
I went to visit,
uh,</v>

81
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.140
my grandfather in Nebraska and then that summer,
at the end of the summer,

82
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.760
my folks ended up coming out with all the kids and the,

83
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.010
the whole house and he decided not to fly for United Airlines anymore and become

84
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.720
a farmer again.
So yeah,
I was kind of different.
So anyways,
that's,
yeah,

85
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.700
like I said,
I lived in a lot of states and stuff because during this,

86
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.870
because of the service,
but a Nebraska was kind of like my favorite place.

87
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.160
I know from there

88
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.520
<v 0>now.
Did you work on the farm?</v>

89
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.130
Every kid grows up on a farm is like slave labor.
Exactly.
Oh absolutely.

90
00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:13.440
Yeah.
10 hours

91
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.590
<v 2>field plowing.
Uh,
you know,
we had a cow,</v>

92
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.380
we had to milk every day,
you know,
we called her six o'clock,

93
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.210
six o'clock in the morning,
six o'clock at night,

94
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.680
and a few other cattle and we had bigs and I raised 300 chicken,

95
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.810
you know,
and of course,
I mean,
you know,

96
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.760
I had my brother and sisters and stuff were there too.
They all helped out.

97
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.560
<v 0>And this is when you're what,
like 10,
11,
12,</v>

98
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.150
<v 2>11?
Yeah,</v>

99
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.670
I'm going to back there at Cannes and I was back there for like 43 summers,

100
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.380
you know,
so I was 12,
I think we ended up moving back to Connecticut.

101
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.120
And then how long were you out there for?
A year in Connecticut.
And then I,

102
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.960
then my dad,
um,

103
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840
he bought a business here in San Diego and hall and hall personnel and uh,

104
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.580
so we moved back out here and he found a place and we lived out in Spring Valley

105
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.580
and um,
he worked downtown,
has an office down there.
So yeah,

106
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.490
it was kinda different.

107
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.400
<v 0>That's the thing.
You spend your,
your high school years here in San Diego?</v>

108
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.370
I started

109
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.370
<v 2>great in San Diego,
went to Mt.
Miguel in high school and um,</v>

110
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.650
then I graduated and went to,

111
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.170
I was going to college for Awhile and then,
uh,

112
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.480
<v 0>that's drafted.
Did you,
did you start surfing in high school?</v>

113
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.380
<v 2>Actually,
when we lived in Santa Ana and said I didn't surf,
we,
we had mats,</v>

114
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.400
you know,
me and mad maps up there,
my mom.
Oh yeah.
So,

115
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.610
and I was young then and we'd always go down to a on take me every day,

116
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.550
you know,
down me and the kids and,
and uh,

117
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.160
to Laguna beach down there,

118
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.370
China coat down there and uh,
yeah,

119
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.690
broke my ear drum down there as a matter of fact.
Yeah.
But anyways,
yeah.
Uh,

120
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.440
and then I started,
I started surfing,
you know,
10th grade,
you know,

121
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.300
ninth grade and stuff.
But uh,
yeah,
we,
uh,

122
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.080
when we first came out here and stuff,
I'd love to,

123
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.360
I thought we were going to move to the beach.

124
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.090
We stayed at the San Diego Motel right down there on,
uh,
uh,

125
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.070
<v 0>it's across from in and out.</v>

126
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.370
And we stayed there until my dad found a house to live.

127
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.170
<v 2>Man,
you know,
so I,
you know,
I go to the beach then,
you know,
walk to the beat.</v>

128
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.260
<v 0>Oh yeah.
It was fun.
That's what everyone thinks.
Well,</v>

129
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.510
people that don't live in California,

130
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.200
think all of California is like Bay Watch.
That's the,

131
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.440
or realize that there's,
you know,
massive,
I mean,

132
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:44.470
obviously there's massive swaths of land,
but agriculture is huge.
You know,

133
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:48.220
you'd go up the,
you just drive by farm after farm,
after farm,
after farm.

134
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.620
So much in California is farming and,

135
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:55.470
but people think everything in California is just,
they watch,
it's not,

136
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.270
can come close sometimes.
But then you,

137
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.540
when you went to high school here and you,
you did surf,
but you weren't,

138
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.480
you weren't able to get to the water that much?

139
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.190
<v 2>Quite a bit.
Actually.
I had a,
I had a,</v>

140
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.060
my dad bought me a 53 Chevy [inaudible] 54 Chevy two door and stuff.

141
00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:19.860
So I ripped out the backseat,
so I get my boards in there.
And um,

142
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.330
then I got my sister's car.
If he had a,

143
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.640
a station wagon and it was a 57 Ford two door deluxe,
you know,

144
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:31.570
it was,
you know,
the whole thing that was a surf wagon.
Oh yeah.
I know.

145
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.950
So me and the boys,

146
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.360
<v 0>no.
So I was wrong.
Do you actually got to the water a lot?
Yeah.</v>

147
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.120
Yeah,
yeah,
quite a bit.
You,
you wrestled

148
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.100
<v 2>in high school?
Yeah,
a little bit of a wrestling.
Uh,
I was mostly on the,
uh,</v>

149
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.050
that was on the swim team.
I dove and I swam and,
um,
my fault,

150
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.440
you know,
somebody said,
nick,
can anybody do the butterfly and go,
yeah,
I can.

151
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.140
I know in early.
So you,
you're the butterfly guy.

152
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.280
<v 0>And then,
so during this time period,
were you paying attention,
I mean,</v>

153
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:07.190
obviously your dad was in the,
was,
you know,
out of the military,

154
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:09.470
but you had that connection to the military.

155
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.980
Were you paying attention in those years?
Because now we're talking,

156
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.780
this is like the mid sixties.

157
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.650
Are you paying attention to what's happening in Vietnam?
You're just,

158
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.090
you're focused on,

159
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.170
<v 2>yeah.
Right.
I know it was a kid,
but,
um,</v>

160
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.670
not that I can really recall.
It wasn't really on my radar.

161
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.010
<v 0>Yeah,
it,</v>

162
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.790
and then you graduate and your figure you're going to go to college for a bit.

163
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.170
Yeah,
junior college.
What year did you graduate high school?

164
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.770
66.
Okay.
Oh yeah.

165
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.680
So Vietnam was still relatively wasn't,

166
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.660
yeah,
I mean they started with the bow.
The,

167
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.050
I drank valley was in 1965 and that was kind of like the big first spike in

168
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.030
activity.
Not,
I don't want to say that,

169
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.390
but it was definitely a highlight and started hitting the news more.

170
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.050
And that was in 65 so you graduated in [inaudible] 66 yeah.

171
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.770
I mean there was talk draft and the draft and stuff like that,

172
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:09.740
but it wasn't like,
you know,
like I said it wasn't,

173
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:14.340
I didn't really pay attention to it.
Yeah.

174
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.870
Surfing can distract you from all kinds of the world's problems,

175
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.590
which is a good thing.
So then,

176
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.410
so then you role to a Grossmont college,
you're there.
Yeah.

177
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.190
And now are you,

178
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.580
are you starting to become more aware of the draft at this point?

179
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.370
<v 2>No.
No,
cause I,</v>

180
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.110
I snow skied a lot so I know there's a lot of activity and I belonged to the ski

181
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:43.950
club there at Grossmont and also we'd go to squaw valley heavenly and,
and,

182
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.140
and ski a lot.
So no,
I still didn't really think about it.

183
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.680
I didn't think about it until I saw my mom pulled a little envelope up,
you know.

184
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:53.531
And she said,
hey,

185
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:57.190
you got something from the government and what was your reaction to that?

186
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.190
I can't go to Mozza lawn.

187
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.110
<v 0>Yeah.
So I mean it was,</v>

188
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.370
it hit you that it was that unexpected for you when you got that,

189
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.170
when you got your draft notice.

190
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.750
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

191
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.330
<v 0>Did you know any other guys that had been drafted?</v>

192
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.910
<v 2>Oh yeah.
The class before me and stuff.
No,
I don't like Jim Thompson,</v>

193
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.350
a great guy.
Um,
he just 25th infantry over there and stuff.

194
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:25.350
They came back with all the war stories.
So I take that back.

195
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:29.010
I was aware of it because all these guys are coming back and talking about it,

196
00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:33.590
but I never thought I know me.
I didn't worry about gone.

197
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.890
So,
yeah.

198
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.030
<v 0>So then when you got it,
what was your reaction when you got it?</v>

199
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.920
<v 2>Well,
I'm going to go,
I guess.
Yeah,
it was either that,
you know,</v>

200
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:48.970
are run and hide and I thought,
well,
you know,

201
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.340
if we'd make it a muzzle on it,
it's not a bad place to be.

202
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.730
I know if I can survive there.
So,
and then I said,
well,
no,

203
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.250
I got to do it.
Yeah,
it was a little bit scary,
but you know,
I,

204
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.810
I was looking forward to things,
you know,
I mean,

205
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:07.850
I didn't look forward to going over there,
but I mean,
it's kind of.
