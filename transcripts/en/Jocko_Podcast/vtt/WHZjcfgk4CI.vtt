This is Jocko podcast number one 12 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.880
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.860
I had a friend

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.440
and someday when I can I will tell you all about him,

5
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.700
but until then.
For now,

6
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.640
<v 1>yeah,</v>

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
<v 0>I will say that I could not have asked for a better friend.</v>

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.930
Did he have faults?
Sure.

9
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.170
Don't we all
now?

10
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.740
Most of his faults weren't really that big of a deal,

11
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.890
but they were raw,

12
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.350
raw because he admitted to them all openly and direct the and naively to be

13
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:06.610
honest,
you know,
sort of pointed in a heavy handed self critique.

14
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:11.611
He would bear his weaknesses to the world and to me and to himself

15
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.190
and he would speak to me as if I had no faults

16
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.760
can,
I would try to explain otherwise,
but he wouldn't listen.

17
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.070
He would only judge himself.

18
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.380
I'm too emotional.
He would say

19
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.680
not really.
I tell them,
I don't know how to talk to people.
Right?

20
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.500
Sure you do.
All right.
Sorry.

21
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
<v 0>I make the same mistakes over and over and over again.
He would say we all do.</v>

23
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.813
I would tell them

24
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.150
I was better than him at some things.
We both knew that

25
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.620
there were other things he was better at than me,

26
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.510
but he always downplayed those things

27
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.800
and we both knew that too

28
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.940
when we were overseas.

29
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.980
<v 0>In a bad place,
in a wretched place.</v>

31
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.300
He never complained.

32
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.600
And I gave him every reason to.

33
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.600
I put him in the worst locations with the greatest possible chances for failure

34
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.780
and the highest probability for fire and fury and blood and death.

35
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.420
But despite the enemy and the heat and the living conditions and the fear and

36
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:03.580
the wounded men and the screams and the misery that was all around,

37
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.740
he did not complain.

38
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.300
<v 0>It seemed at times that God himself was trying to test the limits of my friend.</v>

40
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.303
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.800
<v 0>And it seemed like sooner or later,</v>

42
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.640
<v 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.610
<v 0>the bullets or the bombs would find him,</v>

44
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.340
but through some in comprehensible miracle,

45
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.830
he survived through that deployment.

46
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.860
Now I make no claim whatsoever to understand why things in life unfold the way

47
00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:51.314
they do.

48
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.193
<v 0>In fact,</v>

50
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.950
<v 1>yeah.</v>

51
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.660
<v 0>I must say that many of the things I've seen in the world make no sense to me at</v>

52
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:05.110
all.
Sometimes it's just utter confusion,

53
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.240
no rhyme,
no reason.

54
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.090
Some of the things that I've seen have left me downright disgusted.

55
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.260
<v 1>Jay did
repulsed</v>

56
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.880
<v 0>sick into by mankind and the awful and reprehensible things we are capable of.</v>

57
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.680
But there's another side to that.

58
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.580
There's another side and there are other people who do their best to redeem all

59
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:46.230
the evil our souls are capable of.

60
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.860
My friend was one of those people

61
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.680
after deploying with me and surviving that bloody and violent battlefield,

62
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.470
my friend,
like most of the guys in my old job,

63
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.540
he volunteered to deploy again.

64
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.460
<v 0>I fought and I told him prematurely and incorrectly that the enemy was done.</v>

66
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.390
I told him that the war was all but over.
I told them,

67
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:21.990
just do the deployment and sit tight over there and play the game and in a few

68
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.050
months we'll be back and we can go surfing and we can play guitar and we can

69
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:28.440
tell stories and we can cook steaks and we can serve some more.

70
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.290
I told them we could carry on when he got home.

71
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.290
<v 1>That was the plan.
It was a good point.</v>

72
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.833
Okay.

73
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 0>But the enemy gets a vote</v>

74
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.760
and there was intense violence during that deployment for him as well.

75
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.810
<v 0>It was similar to what we experienced together overseas and aggressive enemy.</v>

77
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.820
Hell bent on killing Americans mixed in an urban environment with a terrified

78
00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:10.020
local populace.

79
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.890
You told me that the enemy he was now facing wasn't as tactically skilled as the

80
00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:20.220
enemy we had faced,
but he said that they were braver

81
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.890
and more determined.

82
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.120
<v 0>That seemed to concern him a bit more.</v>

84
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.590
You seem to feel the odds were that he would die.

85
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.970
<v 0>He sent me his last will and testament.</v>

87
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.520
He was not morose about it.

88
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.150
Just stating the facts.
It's bad over here,

89
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.870
the enemy's aggressive casualty rates are very high.

90
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.630
The enemy has new weapons that are extremely capable.

91
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.000
It didn't look good.
I waited.

92
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.180
I waited the long and completely powerless.
Wait,

93
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.320
one known mostly by mothers and fathers and wives and children that are old

94
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.670
enough to understand.

95
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.570
<v 0>But a weight also made
by the brothers at home.</v>

97
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

98
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.450
<v 0>but no,
the risk all too well.</v>

99
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.770
<v 0>It was a long wait.</v>

101
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.990
<v 0>At my friend's memorial service,</v>

103
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.350
his brother told a story.

104
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.950
My friend had talked to his brother on the phone while my friend was on

105
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:03.784
deployment

106
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.700
and my friend had explained to his brother in no uncertain terms,

107
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:14.580
the situation that my friend was in
the enemy,

108
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:17.570
he was extremely hostile.
The battlefield was chaotic,

109
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.850
the attacks were frequent and furious.

110
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.610
It was violence that my friend had not experienced before.

111
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.620
This was war unleashed and it seemed to be heading to an inescapable conclusion.

112
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.930
And my friend's brother senseless,

113
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.220
even through the phone,

114
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:50.300
even thousands of miles away as his brother,

115
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.100
he sensed the darkness and the overwhelming [inaudible] of the situation.

116
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.400
And you said to my friend,

117
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.440
<v 1>okay,</v>

118
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.440
<v 0>do you need anything from me?
How can I help?</v>

119
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.020
<v 0>Is there anything that I can do?</v>

121
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.290
Okay.
My friend was quiet for a moment

122
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.700
and then my friend made one simple request.

123
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.120
<v 0>He said,
pray for my men.</v>

125
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.943
<v 1>No,</v>

126
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.260
<v 0>I want you to think about that.</v>

127
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.513
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.820
<v 0>I want you to think about that level of selflessness,</v>

129
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.990
that level of faith and of commitment and of care for others.

130
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.950
That dedication

131
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:12.350
in the face of fear and violence and death to at that moment put others before

132
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.983
yourself

133
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.210
to do good.

134
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.000
To be heroic and strong and brave.

135
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.670
And yet at the same time to be humble,

136
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.110
you have to be willing to sacrifice everything for your friends.

137
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

138
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.160
<v 0>that's a man.</v>

139
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.540
And I couldn't have asked for a better friend.

140
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.370
The world can be a horrible place.

141
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.510
It's filled with violence and treachery and sometimes it seems that the legions

142
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:12.821
of demonic powers have the upper hand in the battle between good and evil and it

143
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:15.290
can seem that all might be lost.

144
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.863
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.100
<v 0>And then
we remember</v>

146
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.920
we see the light and for me the light comes from the example of others.

147
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.730
In this case,
another person,
another human being.

148
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.170
<v 0>My friend who despite all the powers of darkness stood up and rejected all that</v>

150
00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.710
wickedness and proved that there is hope

151
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.420
and there is a path to light.

152
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.000
<v 0>And we can get on that path if we choose to do so.</v>

154
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.200
Like my friend did.

155
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.430
And that's life

156
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.030
at least as far as I can unravel the mystery.
That's what I see.

157
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.210
We are here and the best thing we can do is stand against the darkness and tried

158
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.320
to spread light in the world.

159
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.650
But that can be a very hard thing to do

160
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.720
because life is not easy.
In fact,

161
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.020
it is said and there are very few that would deny that life itself is suffering,

162
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.240
but there is a way

163
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.700
and there is a path.

164
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.300
And today I have someone on the podcast for a second time that I think can help

165
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.560
guide us down that path

166
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.680
away from darkness
and toward the light.

167
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.120
Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson.

168
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.420
[inaudible] welcome back to the podcast for a second time.

169
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.343
Thanks jargon.

170
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.250
You were on podcast number 98 last time and if anyone wants to stop right now,

171
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.590
go and listen to 98 if you haven't listened to it yet and that's a good place to

172
00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:41.850
start learning about you.

173
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.620
And then you could also just Google Jordan Peterson and go from there because

174
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:49.050
there's thousands.

175
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.130
You think there's thousands of hours of use of content of you on Youtube?

176
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.430
<v 2>Yeah,
there's,
there's probably a horrible as it is to contemplate.</v>

177
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.580
Yeah,
there probably is.
I mean,
I've contributed about,

178
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:04.920
<v 0>okay,</v>

179
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.650
<v 2>500 hours probably in lectures and so on,</v>

180
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:11.790
but people have been cutting it up and here's all the podcasts and youtube

181
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:13.200
videos that other people have made.

182
00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:17.100
And I think I looked the other day because people keep chopping up the lectures

183
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:18.780
in the interviews and making little videos.

184
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:21.360
And my son and I tried to estimate it last week.

185
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:26.100
It looked like 4,000 people have made videos last week.
In one week.

186
00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:29.850
Yeah.
It's really,
yeah,
it's crazy.
It's,
it's really,
yes.

187
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.220
<v 0>Okay.
So you've got a new book out and the book is called 1212 rules for life,</v>

188
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.160
an anecdote to chaos and w,
you know,

189
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.060
one of the key points in the book is life is suffering,
right.
And clearly,

190
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.920
um,
I think that isn't malevolence because the suffering is not enough.
You know,

191
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 2>we did a little bonus on top of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we need to inflict it.</v>

192
00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.570
You know,
obviously my old line of work,

193
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.210
we got to see that and we got to see it all the time.
Two things.

194
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.310
Number one,
where does that come from?

195
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.560
And you don't need to spend a bunch of time on that because you've,

196
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.090
you've talked about that so much,
but more important to me,

197
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.720
what happens when people miss that point?
Well,

198
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.250
the suffering seems to be built in in some sense.
And,
and,

199
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.330
and it's a very difficult thing to understand fully because the fundamental

200
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:31.880
question is does being justified suffering?
It's something like that.

201
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.140
And there's this old idea,
I read this,

202
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.260
it was a Jewish idea.
It's kind of a riddle.

203
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.380
And so it's a riddle about the nature of God.

204
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:47.381
And so the riddle runs what does a being who's omniscient,

205
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.510
omnipotent and omnipresent.

206
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:55.430
So those are the three classical attributes of God lack think,
well that's

207
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.280
nothing.
Coffee Asley it's no limitation.
And so,

208
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.600
and so that was the explanation for why God created everything but more

209
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.370
particularly white God created man.

210
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:12.371
It's that there's something about limitation that adds to completeness maybe

211
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:16.520
because it provides something to struggle against.

212
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.700
It's something like that in the book and 12 rules for life.

213
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.990
I talk about what happens to happen to superman in the 1980s it's like superman

214
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:27.170
got so powerful that you could bounce hydrogen bombs off his chest,
you know,

215
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:28.520
and he could move planets.
It's like,

216
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:31.750
and then he got boring at the same time because what he,

217
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.240
what are you going to do to him?
Nothing is like he,

218
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.240
he can just solve every problem instantly.
Well,

219
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:42.300
there's no story there and you might say,
well,
who cares if there's a story and,

220
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.190
and that's a reasonable objection.
Maybe there should just be no story at all.

221
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.770
Right?
That's the Memphis to feely an objection to life.

222
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.910
There should be no story at all,
but maybe that's not the right answer.

223
00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:57.620
Maybe it's better to have being,
even if it requires limitation,

224
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.100
even if the limitation necessitate suffering,

225
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.420
even if the limitation and the suffering necessitate evil and that that's a

226
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:09.590
separate issue,
perhaps there's a way of maneuvering through that,

227
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.880
a pathway that makes that all not only acceptable,

228
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.060
let's say at least acceptable.
That would be a good start,
but,

229
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.850
but fully justifiable.

230
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:23.570
Something that you would voluntarily accept if you had the opportunity,
niche.

231
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.830
Nature sort of cottoned on to that in some sense with his idea of the eternal

232
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.910
return.

233
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.150
He said you should try to live each moment of your life so that if you had to

234
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.360
live that moment recurring for eternity,

235
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.370
that you would find that desirable.
It's like that's a high standard man.
So,

236
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.490
but,
but,
but there's a very interesting point there,

237
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:47.840
which is that maybe you can say that despite the suffering and malevolence this

238
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:52.300
is worth it and I,
people have experiences like that in their life,
you know,
um,

239
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.180
and you can have more experiences if you live your life.
I would say according,

240
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.800
if you're on the proper path than maybe your life can consist of almost nothing

241
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:04.770
but experiences like that.
Now,
you know,

242
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.390
I say that knowing full well that people get cut off at the knees and that life

243
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:12.510
can be very arbitrary and hard and that everyone is,

244
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840
is prone to the negative consequences of deceit and betrayal.

245
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:20.100
All of those things.
I mean the book,

246
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.130
the book 12 rules for life in some senses a very dark book,

247
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.210
but it's not exactly because the darker the darkness,

248
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:30.870
the brighter the light appears.
It's something like that.
And you know,
you say,

249
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:34.290
well no,
life's not so bad.
You can be happy.

250
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.410
And I think no life really is bad.
It's really bad.

251
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.500
And no matter how bad you think it is,
it's actually worse than that.

252
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.370
You can't really get to the bottom of how terrible things can get.
You know,

253
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.510
people who have post traumatic stress disorder know that,
you know,

254
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.610
they've hit something so bad that they cannot live with it.

255
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.070
They have no idea how to live with it and it hurts them.

256
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:56.040
Not just psychologically,
but physiologically as well.

257
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.630
It's very difficult to recover.

258
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.650
So they have a sense of how bad it can be and then they can hardly live with it.

259
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.600
But I would say despite that,

260
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:08.601
and I would say also that this is the central idea in the in 12 rules for life,

261
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:12.210
is that despite that bottomless horror,

262
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:17.211
in some sense there is a way of being that's powerful enough to both transcend

263
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:21.810
and justify that in some sense.

264
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.550
And that has to do with with,

265
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.400
with the decision to act as if it would be better if things were better.

266
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.290
That's the first thing.
And you think,
well that's easy.

267
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.810
I'd like things to be better.
It's no,
no,
wait a second.

268
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.270
There's hatred in your heart and there's resentment in your soul and there's

269
00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:45.660
bitterness at your position in the world and there's the sense that you're a

270
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:49.590
victim and there's the anger that goes along with that and that desire to hurt.

271
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:52.740
Like you have all of that and maybe you have it in spades.

272
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.740
Maybe it's mostly what you are.
And because of that,

273
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:00.120
you do not want things to be better.
You want to spread some misery out of spite.

274
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:01.830
And that's what chapter six is about,
right?

275
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.470
And put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

276
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:08.010
It's about people like the Columbine high school shooters and exactly what they

277
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:11.130
were motivated by because I understand what they were motivated by.

278
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.020
And so to wish that things were better means that you have to make a real

279
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:16.681
decision.

280
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:21.150
That despite all the flaws of existence,

281
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:22.590
the suffering and the malevolence,

282
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.890
that it's best not to become embittered by that and to work for the betterment

283
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.120
of everyone.
You for sure your family,
for sure your community,

284
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.060
but perhaps even your enemies,
you know,

285
00:20:36.061 --> 00:20:39.780
if you have any sense you wish your enemies well,

286
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.240
it doesn't mean you wish the victory.

287
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.630
It doesn't mean you don't think they're wrong,
none of that.

288
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:50.631
It means that it would be better if the world was set up so that they didn't

289
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.870
have to suffer miserably and futilely and Evilee as well.
That would be better.

290
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.670
And so then you can aim at that now.
And the best way to aim it out as well,

291
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:04.030
first of all day Matt,
it to actually sort yourself out and think,
okay,

292
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:06.790
well if I could have things the way I wanted them to be,

293
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.010
that's what I would want.
Right?

294
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:14.250
And that takes a lot of psychological organization before you can state that

295
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:20.350
without,
without,
what would you say without holding anything back?
You know,

296
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.600
because there's that part of you,
that bitter part,

297
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:26.370
that wants vengeance and wants and wants to,

298
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.370
to wreak havoc that's there.
It's hard to constrain that.

299
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.850
And then while the other part along with this as well as aiming at the highest

300
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:38.590
good that's attainable,
let's say,

301
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:43.591
is to also decide that you're going to speak the truth in that endeavor and to

302
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:45.970
risk that.
You know,

303
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.630
and there's that and because I think those are the things that that help you

304
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:52.300
aren't yourself properly.
That's the message on the sermon on the mount,

305
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:52.691
by the way,

306
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:57.691
which is aim at the highest good that you can conceive of and act and tell the

307
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:01.060
truth in that pursuit.
Right?

308
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.530
The other element there is to focus on the day.
Once you've,

309
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.630
once you've aligned yourself with the heavenly star,
right?

310
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.610
Aim High and then focus on the day.

311
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.570
That's very good advice because it also imbues everything you do in your daily

312
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:20.290
life with significance.
It's the,
why am I doing this?
To avoid.
Hell,

313
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.920
that's a good one.
Let's start with that.
It's like to avoid hell,

314
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.040
and if you have any imagination at all,
if you lived in the world at all,

315
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.530
if you're not naive,
you know what that means.

316
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.270
It's not just the hell that you encounter.

317
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.660
It's the hell that you foolishly produce around yourself and are then

318
00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:37.750
responsible for.
That's a perfectly good sort of hell.

319
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.150
So you want to avoid that for sure.

320
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.890
And maybe you want to dare risking making things better.

321
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.540
It's like that'll imbue your life with significance and that significance.

322
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:52.480
You know,
one of the things I've discovered,
learned,

323
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.030
I would say over the last 25 years,

324
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:58.750
is that there's always been a mythological idea or an ID and literature and

325
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:01.090
philosophy that there was a shining path.
You know,

326
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:04.120
that you could walk down and modern,

327
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.890
cynical people believe that that sort of meaning the meaning that would be

328
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:12.730
obtained by walking on that path is somehow illusory or arbitrary.

329
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:15.790
And I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that that's true.

330
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.630
I think that sense of meaningful engagement,
that

331
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.450
what is revealed to you when you're in the right place at the right time,

332
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:28.090
doing the right thing.
That sense of deep engagement,

333
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:32.590
that loss of self consciousness,
that feeling that things are worthwhile,

334
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:34.930
that deep seated feeling,
that things are worthwhile.

335
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.140
That's the most real thing I think.

336
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.120
I think the neuro biological evidence suggests that.
I really do believe that.

337
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.610
And so we're in a fortunate time in some sense because we can look at those old

338
00:23:46.611 --> 00:23:51.190
metaphorical ideas of the,
of the Shining Path,
let's say the,
the,
the,

339
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.610
the golden path forward.
And we can say,
yeah,

340
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.180
that's actually real.
It's real.
And that something.
And then that's,

341
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.480
so what's this,
what's so cool about that in my estimation is that,

342
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:06.290
and this is why 12 rules for life is actually an optimistic book is like the

343
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:10.730
darkness is real,
but the light is stronger.
It's like,
wow,

344
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.690
could that be true?
Could that possibly be true?
I think it's true.

345
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.220
So that's a good thing to know,
man,
that that might be true.

346
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.580
<v 3>And,
and you know,</v>

347
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.910
the w when I was talking about my friend in the beginning of this podcast,

348
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:23.270
that's,

349
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:28.270
that's why I was talking about it because it was a guy who had every reason to

350
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:29.990
be,

351
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.850
to be negative and to be dark and to look at the world and just say,

352
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:36.350
this is hell and it's not worth it.

353
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.370
But instead what he really did was want to take care of his,
of his friends.

354
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:45.280
<v 2>I talk about a woman in my book is someone I met as a client when I was just</v>

355
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:49.060
beginning my psychotherapeutic practice and she just blew me away.

356
00:24:49.061 --> 00:24:53.290
I've never forgotten her.
So she was,
she had a horrible life.

357
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.220
She was unattractive,
uneducated,
um,

358
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.570
no career unemployed,
um,
so shy,

359
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.540
you can't even imagine it.
Like you've met someone shy and anxious.

360
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.730
It's like they weren't in the same universe is this woman.

361
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.740
She was so shy that she couldn't walk up to people without looking at the

362
00:25:11.741 --> 00:25:14.050
ground,
hunching over and shielding her eyes.

363
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.580
So that's how she approached people on the street.
And,
and she,
she,

364
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.420
she looked like a homeless person as well.
And so,
um,

365
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.800
and she came to the behavior therapy unit that I was working at and,
um,

366
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.950
hypothetically for treatment.
And so what,

367
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:34.210
what we started doing was seeing if we could get her to stand up a bit and look

368
00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:39.211
people in the eye more normally so that people wouldn't respond to her as if she

369
00:25:39.251 --> 00:25:42.040
was so peculiar,
you know.
So we were trying to just to change your behavior,

370
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:45.880
but I started talking to her and,
well she told me a little bit about her life.

371
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:50.140
It's like she lived at editor,
she lived where she lived.

372
00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:51.160
Her mother was,

373
00:25:51.161 --> 00:25:55.600
I think she lived with her aunt who was like a violent schizophrenia alcoholic

374
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:59.770
who had religious delusions and constantly accused her of being possessed by the

375
00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:00.490
devil.

376
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:05.260
And she had a really violent and abusive alcoholic boyfriend who used to

377
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:09.400
mistreat this woman.
So that was like home life.
It's like,
yeah.

378
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.270
And she had been an inpatient in this hospital,
the Douglas Hospital.

379
00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:16.330
And that was in the 1980s.

380
00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:18.730
And the Douglas Hospital was a huge hospital,

381
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.360
both size of a university campus and it had had a lot of inpatients.

382
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:26.950
But they were all let out on the streets when medication became widely available

383
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:29.710
and when deinstitutionalization was the norm.

384
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.190
But there was a subset of them who couldn't be d institutionalized.

385
00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:36.190
And these were people that you can hardly imagine.

386
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.660
So I used to go in the underground corridors in the Douglas Hospital because

387
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:41.800
it's very cold in Montreal.

388
00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:44.190
So there underground corridors collecting the buildings and down

389
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.650
<v 4>there there would be vending machines in places for people to sit.</v>

390
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.280
And it was like walking through Dante's inferno cause these were people who were

391
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:51.720
so damaged.
You know,

392
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:54.810
they'd been in a psychiatric institution for maybe two or three decades.

393
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.660
They could not be released no matter what,

394
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.270
even though that's what the hospital was trying to do.

395
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.470
And so it was like Diane Arbus used to go across the United States and

396
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:08.280
photograph strange people and she has a whole collection of her photographs.

397
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:10.470
They're quite arresting and shocking.

398
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:14.400
And it was like walking through Diane Arbus is universe,
you know?

399
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.420
And so those were the inpatients and she had been an inpatient from time to
time,

400
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:19.231
but was well enough.

401
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:22.920
So she could also go out and it turned out she didn't actually want treatment.

402
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.040
She had this dog,
she used to take it for walks.

403
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:29.340
And so that was her source of enjoyment.
Right.
And she thought,

404
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.590
I really liked this dog and I really like taking him for walks and maybe I could

405
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:39.591
go to the Douglas Hospital and find one of these inpatients and take them out

406
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.760
for a walk.
Maybe that would be a good thing for him.

407
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:45.180
And so the reason she had come to the behavior therapy clinic wasn't to treat

408
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.140
all of her problems.
And this woman had problems.
Man,

409
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.420
everything about her life was a problem in,

410
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:55.770
in ways that like a normal person just cannot begin to understand,
you know,

411
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.650
unless they're in one of those situations in their life where everything is

412
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:02.040
collapsing around them.
And what she did,
what she decided was,

413
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.820
well there's someone worse off than me than me that I could help.

414
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.230
It's like she just absolutely blew me away.
You know,
this poor woman,

415
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:12.120
she had nothing going for her while it gets,

416
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:15.660
she did day cause she had this nobility of spirit that was absolutely

417
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:20.280
indomitable.
It just,
I never forgot that.
It just blew me away.

418
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.120
Lead her into her situation in a way of she's so noble and she wants to help
her,

419
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:24.961
her aunt,

420
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:29.961
that's all crazy and no one wants to help prop up her boyfriend that's violent

421
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:32.490
and no,
I don't think so.
I don't think she wanted any of that.

422
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:35.250
She was just one of these people.
It's like,
you know,

423
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:39.000
you can put someone in a situation that's so dire that,

424
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.370
that there's virtually no escape from it.

425
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:45.450
Like I've seen people in my clinical practice for whom things around things

426
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:49.320
around them have collapsed so badly that there's just no fixing it.

427
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.950
There's you fixed one thing and two other things break and then you fix those

428
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:55.470
and three other things break.
There's just no bottom.

429
00:28:55.471 --> 00:29:00.471
And those are often families that have had multigenerational problems.

430
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.200
Deeply rooted.
The whole community is pathologized,

431
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.310
the entire family structure is demolished.
They're there.

432
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.000
People don't have any marketable skills and they haven't for generations.

433
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.240
The whole situation is complicated by drug and alcohol abuse and heavily

434
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.550
biologically influenced insanity of one form or another.

435
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:24.960
Usually conjoined with relatively low cognitive ability.
It's just,

436
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.840
it's just hell no matter which way you turn.

437
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:30.990
And I didn't see her as a contributor to that.
I mean,

438
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:33.990
I'm sure she made her mistakes like everyone else,
but she was,

439
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:38.820
she certainly wasn't playing martyr or victim.
She,
she didn't come in to the,

440
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.590
to the clinic to complain to with,

441
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.350
but just like she was just telling me these were the,

442
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:49.330
the situation that she lived in,
she wasn't,
that isn't what she was,
therefore,

443
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.370
it's just that we thought she had come for treatment.

444
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:53.590
So we were doing the background analysis,
you know,

445
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.960
an intake interview and found out all these things.

446
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.490
It's like any one of those problems is enough to bring most people's lives to a

447
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:03.160
shuddering halt.
And yet that was her vision.

448
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:05.800
So the reason she had come to the hospital and she didn't just come to the

449
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:06.790
behavior therapy clinic,

450
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.650
she had gone around pestering administrators in the hospital to let her take the

451
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.490
longterm inmates out for a walk.
Now they wouldn't do it for,
you know,

452
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:16.720
for all sorts of reasons.

453
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.430
But that didn't stop her from thinking it was a good idea and it actually was a

454
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:23.290
good idea.
This was a practical idea.

455
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.290
Like she could have taken people out on the grounds because the grounds were

456
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:30.700
huge and walk them with the dog and it would've been fine for such a thing as

457
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:35.680
pet therapy in 1985 yeah,
well right,
exactly.
Exactly.

458
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:40.681
But she had enough wherewithal to notice that well that she liked the dog and

459
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:43.240
the dog like turn out.
That was a good thing.
Right?

460
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:46.240
The little bit of love in the world there and that there was nothing wrong with

461
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.520
taking the dog for a walk and that was kind of harmless.

462
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:52.210
And why not have someone along,
it's made her feel good.
She thought,

463
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:56.170
well maybe it'll make the yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
So like beat,

464
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.760
you just got to shake your head.
Well,

465
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:01.660
that's when I really learned to begin with deeply that there's no correlation

466
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:04.930
between intelligence and wisdom and then that's actually the case.

467
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:08.740
Technically like if you're smart,
you can just be like,
you can be,

468
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.220
you can be smart and good,
but you could be smart,

469
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.150
<v 3>bad.
It's just as well.
We used to say,
okay,</v>

470
00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:15.830
so we'd get these guys coming in the seal teams.

471
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.040
That wouldn't be for a while we were recruiting just the,

472
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.430
for the officer candidates,
we were creating these guys that were,
you know,

473
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.240
they went to Ivy League schools and they were off the charts and 1600 on their

474
00:31:26.241 --> 00:31:28.010
sats and then they were the captain of this.

475
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.420
They were just these really high achievers and we found that not all of them,

476
00:31:34.881 --> 00:31:37.700
but certainly some of them couldn't really function in the,
as a,

477
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.120
as a leader in the job because they just didn't have the,
I guess the wisdom to,

478
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.960
to pull it off,
but they couldn't make the personal connections.

479
00:31:44.961 --> 00:31:45.794
They couldn't develop the relation.

480
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.900
<v 4>The leadership's a complicated thing and it doesn't boil down just to</v>

481
00:31:48.901 --> 00:31:49.570
intelligence.

482
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.630
<v 3>Yeah.
And I don't want to make it sound like none of them work aside from work.</v>

483
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.090
Obviously outstanding,
incredible leaders.

484
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.180
But there were some of them that would be the same kind of recruit,

485
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.700
but they just were missing whatever piece of that was.

486
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.490
<v 4>Well,
intelligence and character are definitely not the same thing.</v>

487
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.400
They're not the same thing.
I mean,
all things considered,

488
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:08.230
if you're going to pick one of two leaders,

489
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:11.110
if I would pick the smarter leader over the Duller leader,

490
00:32:11.111 --> 00:32:14.440
if all other things were equal,
you know,
because well,

491
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.610
because someone who's more intelligent can strategize more rapidly and can

492
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:19.930
handle more variables,
right.

493
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.520
And perhaps can even handle while can have handle a more rapid rate of

494
00:32:24.521 --> 00:32:27.310
transformation as well.
And sometimes that's actually crucial,

495
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.840
but character and intelligence are,
are,
they're clearly not the same thing.

496
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.100
And characters actually,
well,
I don't think anything,
Trump's character,
that's,

497
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:40.270
that character is everything.
So you know,
it's interesting that you,
with this,

498
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.600
this woman that you talked about in the beginning,
you talk about how she's,

499
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.060
you know,
she's crouched down and she's looking down at the ground and all that.

500
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.650
So it's interesting in your roles obviously the,

501
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:52.484
the first,

502
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.170
the first rule is to stand up straight with your shoulders back.
Right?

503
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.680
Well when you get,
for lack of a better word,
indoctrinated,

504
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.320
in fact there is no better word when you get indoctrinated into the military,

505
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:06.320
that's exactly what's happening.
And guess what?
You get taught.

506
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:09.320
One of the first things that you get taught is how to stand,

507
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.090
how to stand properly.
And you know what they tell you?
Chin up,
chest out,

508
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.700
shoulders back.
They make you stand like that.

509
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.890
There's no coincidence to that is there?

510
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.490
You could say it's a dominant stance but I that's not the right way of thinking

511
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:27.650
about it.
Although it is a dominant stance,

512
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.040
the reason to adopt it is not because it's a dominant stance,

513
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:36.310
it's a competent stance and competence tends to make you dominant at least in in

514
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.030
hierarchies that are functioning property cause you want,
there are hierarchies,

515
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:44.690
which is what I outline in chapter one.
I say the hierarchies are old.

516
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.970
They're not socio cultural constructions.

517
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.390
They're not a secondary consequence of capitalism in the free mark.

518
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.800
All of that is absolute nonsense.
It couldn't be more wrong.

519
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.540
And as an indication of that,

520
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:01.541
I point out that lobsters whom we diverged from on the evolutionary front a

521
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:05.510
third of a billion years ago,
have hierarchies,
right?

522
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:07.970
And that the neurochemical systems,

523
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.890
the neural neurological systems that lobsters have runoff that mediate their

524
00:34:12.891 --> 00:34:17.891
hierarchical status run on the same chemical that the neurological systems that

525
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:22.820
we use to mediate hierarchy run on.
So that's just absolutely mind boggling.

526
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.781
But lobster,

527
00:34:23.781 --> 00:34:28.100
like a victorious lobster stretches out and adopt some more dominant poets

528
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:33.050
because his serotonin levels go up as he becomes more and more victorious and

529
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:38.051
that governs posture while and so to stand up straight with your shoulders back

530
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.900
is to open yourself up to the world.
You're not in a diff,

531
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.500
you're not in a defensive crouch of a prey animal,
technically speak it.

532
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.870
And that is the circuitry that's governing posture.

533
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:51.480
It's prey versus Predator or something like that.
And,

534
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:56.850
and it just stand up like that is to expose your yourself to the world,

535
00:34:56.961 --> 00:35:01.820
but in a bring it on sort of manner.
Not,
not precisely combative,

536
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:06.020
but let's say courageous and your posture announces that and it doesn't just

537
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:07.520
announce that to other people.

538
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:11.120
It announces that to yourself and it can start.

539
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.160
It can be one of those things that can start a virtuous cycle occurring,

540
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.970
which is partly why it's taught in the military.
You get these guys that come in,

541
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.440
they're all slumped over,
they don't know how to stand up.

542
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:23.930
They're looking at their feet,
their necks are band.
Like,

543
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.610
even if they're good looking men,

544
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.130
they don't look good because they're all crunched over.

545
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:30.110
You see people like this on the street all the time.

546
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:33.770
They can be perfectly attractive except they're completely huddled in,
you know,

547
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.290
and they need to stand up and stretch themselves out and then they can breathe

548
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.660
too.
And that's a competent stance.

549
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.030
And one of the things that the critics of the modern West don't understand about

550
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.750
hierarchies is that first of all,
they're everywhere.
They're,
they're inevitable.

551
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:52.020
If you're going to have a distinction of value between things,

552
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.210
you have a hierarchy.
And if you,

553
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.120
you don't want to get rid of the distinction of values between things because

554
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:01.350
then you don't have anything to do.
That's foolish.
You can't live that way.

555
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.330
So I say,
well,
the hierarchies are based on power.
It's like,
no,
they're not.

556
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.520
They're based on competence.

557
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.110
And there isn't anything more powerful than competence.
But power isn't tyranny.

558
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.580
It's not brutality.
It's not threat.
It might be the hint of all those things,

559
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.211
you know,

560
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:21.510
because I don't think you can be fully competent without being able to hint at

561
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:22.344
those things.

562
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.850
But hierarchies in the West are fundamentally based on competence.

563
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.910
That doesn't mean they're not flawed because we missed the mark lots.

564
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:33.900
And there's lots of reasons why perfectly competent people don't attain the

565
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:37.520
position that they deserve and that they should have for their benefit and

566
00:36:37.521 --> 00:36:41.040
everyone else's,
that the hierarchy's are tainted by corruption.

567
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.130
But fundamentally they're fundamentally,
they're based on competence.
So

568
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:51.200
<v 3>and,
and that's so,
so with that,
this first rule that you put into that book,</v>

569
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.190
and you're saying that's a cycle that can go backwards so you don't have to have

570
00:36:55.191 --> 00:36:58.760
like the serotonin first and then you stand up.
If you stand up straight,

571
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:02.450
you will somehow increase your serotonin over.
Definitely.
Definitely.

572
00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.730
You can actually see,
you see,

573
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.790
you say you could inject lobsters with Serotonin and they start to stand

574
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:09.390
straighter.
Yeah,
you can basically

575
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.560
<v 4>antidepressants.
So like if a lobster gets defeated in a fight,</v>

576
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.610
then he's statistically more likely to lose the next fight than you would guess

577
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:22.260
from a telly of his previous victories.
So that's the first thing.
If you lose,

578
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.110
you increase your risk of further loss.
But if you,

579
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:27.510
when you increase your risk of future gains,
that's,

580
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.510
that's a very important principle.
It's a crucially important principle.

581
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.220
It governs life.
But yeah,

582
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:36.000
if you take a lobster and he gets all defeated and he's off pouting and won't

583
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:37.380
fight anymore because he's,
you know,

584
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:40.950
having a bad day and you inject him with Serotonin,

585
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.530
essentially give him antidepressants,
it's the same thing.

586
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.530
Then he'll straighten up and you'd go out and have another scrap.
And it's like,

587
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:48.040
and I read that,
oh,
I don't know.

588
00:37:48.041 --> 00:37:51.510
It's probably at least 10 years ago when I was reading about,
well,

589
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.740
the neurophysiology of these neurochemical systems.
That's why I got onto it.

590
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.620
It just was another thing that just blew me away.
I thought,
really,

591
00:37:58.621 --> 00:38:02.880
you're kidding.
That circuit is that old.
It's like,
it's that old Siri,
you know,

592
00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:06.420
that's way before there were trees.
That's how long ago that is.

593
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.410
And so hierarchy is a patriarchal construction.

594
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.510
How bout no,
that's wrong and seriously wrong.

595
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.510
<v 3>I had up,
I was talking to one of my friends either night.
Uh,
his name is Joe.</v>

596
00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:22.800
He's got a kid that's wrestling.
His kid is six years old,
I think dom.

597
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.270
And he says,
you know,

598
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:28.320
he's getting put into the higher category is kind of getting these bought whip

599
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:31.560
now.
And I'm really not sure.
What do you think?
And I said,
well,

600
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:36.520
you want him to win because when he wins,
it's fun and we have more fun.

601
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:40.570
So now I have actual more evidence that you should get your kids in a position

602
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.000
again.
I think your kid should get beat sometimes.
Yeah.

603
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.320
But they should certainly not get beat down all the time.

604
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.370
I did that to my kids when my kids first started Jujitsu,
I put them,
oh,

605
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:53.740
you're good,
you're gonna compete because I'm just telling you to.
Yeah.

606
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.310
And then I'm gonna put you in a higher weight class with older kids because

607
00:38:57.311 --> 00:39:00.400
that's going to make you tougher.
That was my,
you know,
stupid thinking.

608
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.650
And now with my youngest daughter,
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.

609
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.190
You go on and you have fun and you go out and you compete against people that

610
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:08.740
are somewhat equal to you.
Maybe a little bit below you,
maybe a little higher,

611
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:12.880
but depending on your mood times.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Well that's,

612
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.280
I think we could,
we could think about that also in terms of,

613
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.090
of the conversation about meaning that we started to have.

614
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:23.860
It's like if you win all the time,
that's meaningless.
Because when you think why?

615
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:26.800
Because you want to win.
It's like,
yeah,
fair enough.

616
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.350
So why would winning all the time become meaningless?

617
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.590
It's because your theory of winning isn't sophisticated

618
00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:37.350
<v 4>enough because here's how you win.
You play the game to win,</v>

619
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.220
but while you're playing,
you play in a way so that you get better at the game,

620
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.350
right?
Because you're going to play a bunch of games.
Well,

621
00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.690
it's even more than that.
You play the game to win,

622
00:39:45.691 --> 00:39:49.470
but you play it so that you get better at the game.
Okay,
fine.
That makes sense.

623
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.990
So you want to push yourself,
right?
Because that's how you get better.

624
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:53.790
And so you need competition to push yourself.

625
00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:56.820
So you need to have the risk of loss.
Cause otherwise you won't do it.

626
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.100
But here's an even better way of thinking about it.

627
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.880
You play the game so that you don't only get better at that game,

628
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.180
but you get better at the entire set of possible games.

629
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.400
And that's what you do when you're a good sport.
It's like,
well,

630
00:40:08.401 --> 00:40:13.230
so how do you do that?
Well,
partly you,
you find the proper level of competition,

631
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.780
right?
So you want to be pushed

632
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.640
so that you will make the effort necessary to remove what's useless about

633
00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:27.180
yourself and to help foster the growth of what's useful.

634
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.800
And if you do that,
then you get the,

635
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.160
the joy of participating in the game towards victory.

636
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.430
But the extra joy of building yourself more and more strongly at the same time.

637
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.210
And so when you tell your kid,
doesn't matter whether you win or lose,

638
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.280
it's how you play the game.
Your kid says,
what do you mean by that?
And you say,

639
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.103
I don't know.

640
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:56.140
<v 3>I don't know what I mean by that.
Cause the kid says I'm supposed to win our die.</v>

641
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:59.630
It's like,
well,
yeah,
so why does it matter how I play the game?
It's like,

642
00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:02.660
well then you're stumped.
Even though you're right,
you just don't know why.

643
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.150
But the reason is is you want to want to

644
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.690
<v 4>tell you,
here's the reason.
It's like we can make this very simple,</v>

645
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.560
life is not a game.
It's a series of games.

646
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.110
It's actually a series of diverse games.
Okay,

647
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:17.740
so who's the winner of this series of diverse games?

648
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.530
Because that's the real question,
right?
Not who wins a game.

649
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:22.330
It's like whatever you win a game,

650
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.410
it's like if I hold a gun to your head and we're playing chess,
I can say lose.

651
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.090
I win.
It's like,
well

652
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.680
that's not helpful obviously.
So you want to teach your kid,

653
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:37.940
you want to help your kid learn to be the winner of the set of diverse games.

654
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.420
Okay,
so what does that winner look like?
Well,
here's the first clue.

655
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.010
That's the person who keeps getting invited to play.
You know?

656
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.760
So because you win,
if people invite you to play all the time,

657
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.380
you have opportunities coming to you just nonstop.
And maybe like,

658
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.440
let's say you have 50 opportunities and each of them are potentially 50% for you

659
00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:02.570
and 50% for the other person.
You think,
well that's pretty good deal.

660
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.600
And then you think,
well,
wait a minute,
let's flip this around.

661
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:10.010
So it's like 60% for the other person and 40% for me,
I'm going to be like,

662
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.340
I'm going to go,
I'm going to overboard.
And the generosity,
you think,

663
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.930
well then what happens?

664
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.600
Well then instead of having 20 opportunities at every moment,

665
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:20.030
you have like 50 opportunities at every moment.

666
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.800
And that's so that's what you want for your kids as you want all the invisible

667
00:42:24.801 --> 00:42:26.420
doors around them to open.

668
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.800
And you do that by sand play notably,
right?

669
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.540
Pay attention to your teammates passed the damn puck so they get a chance,
right?

670
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.220
Even if you're the best player on the team,

671
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.090
help the people on your team developed.
Don't grandstand,
right.
Um,

672
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.153
don't,

673
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.960
if you have the opportunity to beat your opponent 20 to one you know,

674
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.300
and goals,
it doesn't happen very often,
but it can,

675
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.160
especially when kids are playing,
it's like,
well,

676
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:54.860
maybe after you're up seven to one it's like

677
00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.040
back off a bit.
You don't have to humiliate your opponents.
It's because it's,

678
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.020
it's,
what would you say?
It's a contemptible behavior on your part.

679
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.310
And so you know that because you go and watch a hockey game or something like

680
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.130
that and you watch a kid that really knows how to play.

681
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.760
It's like they're playing like mad to when they're pushing themselves to be

682
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:17.300
better,

683
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.170
but they're paying attention to their damn teammates and there they respect

684
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:24.470
their opponents and you think,
well that's,
that's a hell of a kid there.

685
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:28.400
It's like,
yeah,
that's exactly right that that kid's going somewhere to do.

686
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.510
Kids ever show they get so committed,
let's say hockey,
right?

687
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:35.420
You get a kid that's just so committed to winning and hockey that he's going to

688
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:38.710
lose it other games.
While that's,
that's not an easy life.
Right.

689
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.350
That that's another,
well that's another problem is like you could be overboard.

690
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.100
Yeah.
Well,
well the other thing too is that with sports,
like you could say,

691
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:49.280
well most kids aren't going to be NHL level hockey players.

692
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:51.890
Like that's impossible.
Like maybe you should aim for that.

693
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.610
I would say probably not because it's so damn unlikely,
but whatever.

694
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:59.180
Some kids are going to manage that and more power to them say,
well,

695
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:03.140
what are the sports for,
for the rest of the kids?
And the answer to that is,

696
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.070
well obviously there's the physical discipline and,

697
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.380
and the health that goes along with that and the ability to engage in and

698
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:13.490
tolerate competition and learn how to be a gracious winner and a gracious loser.

699
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.790
But a lot of it is care that all that's part of character building.

700
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.930
Well that's what you want is you say,
well,
why build your character?
It's like,

701
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.780
well how,
how bout that's your set of toolkits for,

702
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.620
that's your set of tools for dealing with catastrophe.

703
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.790
How about that for a reason?
Right.
So one of the things I've,

704
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.800
I've suggested to my viewers,
this is the men in particular,

705
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:36.850
but not just the men.
Um,

706
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.710
you should be the most reliable person at your father's funeral.

707
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.080
That's a good goal,
man.

708
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.490
That's a good goal because everyone's broken in a situation like that and you

709
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.830
adding to that brokenness and misery.
I mean,

710
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:53.640
you're going to be grieving like no doubt about it and no kidding.

711
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.900
But there is a time to step forward with some character,
you know?

712
00:44:57.901 --> 00:45:00.320
And it's the same thing.
You're going to be at someone's deathbed.

713
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.730
You going to be quibbling with your siblings while you're doing that,

714
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.180
while your parents dying.
It's like it's bad enough that they're dying.

715
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:10.290
That's tragedy,
right?
But you'd can turn that into hell,
no problem.

716
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.860
He just get a bunch of people with no character around a deathbed.
And it's like,

717
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:18.300
well,
it's bad enough,
but that turns it into something like hell.

718
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.370
And that happens in people's lives all the time.

719
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.830
It's like character is everything.
So,

720
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:27.831
and that's why the wise people of our past tradition insisted upon that.

721
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:32.460
He say,
well,
don't lie.
Well why not?
Well destroys your character.
Well,
so what?

722
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.020
Well then you turn suffering into hell.
Is that what you want?
Maybe,

723
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.450
you know,
cause people will want that.

724
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.100
But I would say walk away from people like that.
Right?

725
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.460
That's not,
unless that's what you want then.

726
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.950
<v 3>Yeah.
And you've got a lot of,
uh,
I mean it's,
it's interesting as I'm,</v>

727
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.280
since I just got done reading the book,
you don't,

728
00:45:54.281 --> 00:45:57.530
I can hear you just hitting the wave tops of all the different rules and they're

729
00:45:57.531 --> 00:46:01.700
all interconnected about,
don't,
you know,
don't lie or,
or,

730
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:05.570
or tell the truth or at least don't lie.
And then,
you know,
hang on.
What's the,

731
00:46:05.571 --> 00:46:08.660
what's the chapter about hanging around with people that want to see you do
well,

732
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:13.810
<v 4>yeah,
yeah.
Make friends with people who want the best for you.
Right?
Yeah.
Well,</v>

733
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:16.510
and it's a really,
it's a real technical idea.

734
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.920
So Carl Rogers,
who's a psychotherapist,
great psychotherapist,

735
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.110
I'd very much recommend his books to people,

736
00:46:23.111 --> 00:46:24.670
especially if they want to learn to listen,

737
00:46:24.671 --> 00:46:26.920
because he was really good at teaching people how to listen.

738
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:32.620
He had this idea that what he would manifest towards his clients in therapy was

739
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:36.790
unconditional positive regard.
And I've always had trouble with that because,

740
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.900
well,
because you don't treat your children,
for example,

741
00:46:40.901 --> 00:46:42.280
with unconditional positive.

742
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.930
<v 3>Yeah.
As you're saying.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
It's</v>

743
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.440
<v 4>tricky.
Well,
what do you,
what do you,
he didn't articulate it.</v>

744
00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:51.670
I think as well as he might have,

745
00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.720
what you want to do is for your child is that you want the best for the best in

746
00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:03.100
them.
That's what you want and that's what you want from people that you surround

747
00:47:03.101 --> 00:47:06.220
yourself with.
Now they'll hold you to a high standard if that's the case,
right?

748
00:47:06.221 --> 00:47:10.960
Because whenever you degenerate in any of the multiple ways that you're likely

749
00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:14.320
be degenerate,
they're going to like whack you on the back of the head and say,

750
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.920
you know,
clue the hail in.
You know,
you're,
you're demeaning yourself,

751
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:22.420
you're less than you could be.
And there's real judgment and it's harsh,
you know?

752
00:47:22.421 --> 00:47:26.920
But with friends it's the same thing.
You want friends,
they're not friends.

753
00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:29.140
If they're not these people,
you want friends.

754
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.700
<v 2>When something good happens to you there,
that's good for you,
right?</v>

755
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:35.200
They're happy about that.

756
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.470
They're not like all bitter and resentful underground and like saying horrible

757
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:41.860
things behind your back and telling you how they did something that was better

758
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:45.040
and trying to drag you down.
It's like,
that's not helpful.

759
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.000
And then when something bad happens to you and you go to them and you say,
look,

760
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:51.430
this terrible thing happened to me.
First of all,

761
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:54.640
they don't try to top it with some like horrible thing that happened to them

762
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.610
because they don't have the patience to listen.
And second,

763
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.110
they're not secretly gloating about the fact that catastrophe finally be fail

764
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:02.620
you.

765
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.730
It's like they're actually hurt by it and that chapter is an injunction is like

766
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:11.731
take a look at the people that are around you and if they're not on this side of

767
00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:13.210
what's good for you,

768
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.710
then walk away because well first of all,

769
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:19.810
that's best for them too.
If you put up with that,

770
00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:22.030
all you're doing is enabling it.
It's like,
well,

771
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:26.050
it's okay that you mistreat me in a way that's harmful to me and everyone else.

772
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:30.580
It's like,
actually no,
that is not okay.
It's not an,
it's not the least bit.

773
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.970
Okay.
It doesn't mean you shouldn't try to help someone when they're down.

774
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.090
That's a whole different issue.
What if it's your family,

775
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:40.030
so you know how you say like walk away,
right?
Yep.

776
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.500
Do you still walk away from your family or do you can do if it's necessary?

777
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.560
There's lots of different ways of walking away.

778
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:52.010
They'll create while there's that,
for sure there's that.
I mean you,

779
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.930
you sometimes someone's on an incredible path,

780
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.050
like there's just nothing you can do.
You know,

781
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:01.300
maybe they're aiming down their aim,

782
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.080
aiming down hard and they're bitter and everything they do is to produce misery

783
00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:09.040
virtually everything.
And you have to detach yourself from that.
It's like,

784
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:12.180
I always think about it from the perspective of a lifeguard.

785
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.780
So if you're training to be a lifeguard,

786
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.620
one of the things that you're trained to do is to approach someone who's

787
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.570
drowning and panicking.

788
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.160
And the way you approach them is you put your foot out between you and them and

789
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.070
you push forward with your hands,
with your foot out.

790
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.010
And you basically tell them if they're flailing about,
you say,
look,

791
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.650
I'm here to help,
but you have to calm down.

792
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:36.490
And then if they claim to you like in panic,
you push them away,
you think,

793
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:39.610
well that's pretty damn cruel.
Because what if they drown?
It's like,
yeah,

794
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.360
what if you both drowned?
That's like not helpful.
You're,

795
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.590
you're there to rescue them.
They take you down,
you're both dead.
It's like fail,

796
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.820
right?
So you say,
look,
quit panicking.
I'll help you out,

797
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.250
but I'm not drowning along with you.
It's like,
well,

798
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:56.320
it's the same with someone in your family.

799
00:49:56.321 --> 00:50:00.730
It's like if they're on a downward path and you've done your best,

800
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:02.530
you know you've,
you've made your efforts,
you've,

801
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.400
and they're not paying attention.
They're not changing.
They say,
yeah,
we'll,

802
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:08.080
I'll quit doing this.
Quit doing this.

803
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:11.710
They tell you the same story over and over and over.
It's a downhill path.

804
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:14.080
You don't trust it at some point.
First of all,

805
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:17.410
you stop offering your words.

806
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:22.990
That's do not cast pearls before swine.
A very,
very harsh statement,

807
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.470
right?
But what it means is if someone,

808
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.680
if you're offering words of wisdom to someone in the genuine attempt help and

809
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.580
they treat that with contempt,

810
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.730
then shut up because you're demeaning your words by throwing them away.

811
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.500
You think,
well,
how do you help someone who's aiming down?
Well,

812
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.050
sometimes you help them by walking away and saying,
look,

813
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:52.520
you're aiming down so hard that I am despite the fact you're my brother,
man.

814
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:56.360
It's like,
you know,
this is killing me.
You're aiming down so hard.

815
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.100
I'm not coming along with you.

816
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.820
And the reason I'm not is to tell you in no uncertain terms that what you're

817
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:06.470
doing is so terrible that I will even violate our kinship to oppose it.

818
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.670
And maybe it'll take them 10 years to wake up to that,
you know?

819
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.280
And so that can be the case because you know,

820
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.080
people often have to be hit so many times before they'll learn.

821
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:21.260
You see that,
especially if someone's addicted or,
or,

822
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.730
or otherwise pursuing a pathway that's like seriously downhill.

823
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.150
So Yep.
Harsh you port,

824
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:32.510
you cover that pretty well in that chapter where you're saying there's a certain

825
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:36.110
point where you just got to say,
we're done.
Yeah,
we're done.
We're done.
Well,

826
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:39.470
it's like,
why should I think that you're actually trying to change?

827
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.480
Maybe you're just telling me is you're,

828
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:46.510
you tell me the story that you use to justify your own idiocy to yourself and

829
00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:50.450
then you tell it to me and you demand that because I'm compassionate,
I accepted,

830
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.690
and therefore validate your excuse.
It's like,
well,
that Ha,

831
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.210
like it's really hard not to get tangled up in that.
Right?

832
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.180
Because if someone who's really in rough shape is telling you about why they're

833
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:02.780
suffering,
first of all,
they're probably about half right in their story.

834
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.940
But some of its justification and excuse and blaming and all of that failure to

835
00:52:07.941 --> 00:52:12.020
take responsibility,
it's really hard to stand up and say,
no,
I don't buy that.
No,

836
00:52:12.021 --> 00:52:14.090
I don't buy that.
No,
you're wrong about that.

837
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:18.260
You have to be a brutal bastard in order to do that.
But hey,

838
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.510
sometimes like surgery is brutal.
It's brutal,
but

839
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.560
<v 0>a to cut you open and we're going to rip out part of your,</v>

840
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:32.430
<v 2>yeah,
right,
right,
right.
Exactly right.
Precisely.
And so,</v>

841
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.460
so this chapter about,
you know,

842
00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.370
only making friends with people who want the best for you.

843
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.570
That's a brutal chapter.

844
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:44.460
<v 0>No,
but it's right.
Unfortunately,</v>

845
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:49.530
going to your book a little bit,
I'm going to,
I'm going to pick up,

846
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.290
going back to that first thought.

847
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:58.430
Standing up means voluntarily excepting the burden of being your nervous system

848
00:52:58.831 --> 00:53:00.570
responds in an entirely different manner.

849
00:53:00.571 --> 00:53:04.050
When you face the demands of life voluntarily,

850
00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.770
you respond to a challenge.
Instead of bracing for a catastrophe,

851
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.970
you see the gold,

852
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:13.620
the dragon hoards instead of shrinking and terror from the all too real fact of

853
00:53:13.621 --> 00:53:14.454
the dragon,

854
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:19.670
you step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy your

855
00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:24.990
territory.
Manifesting your willingness to defend,
expand,
and transform.

856
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.850
<v 3>To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible</v>

857
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:33.760
responsibility of life with eyes wide open.
Right?

858
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.890
The reason I pulled that one out in particular is the feeling that you have as a

859
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:42.030
soldier or as a,
as a military person,

860
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:46.290
a feeling that you have going on and off offensive operation where let's say

861
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.050
you're a bad guy and I'm gonna come and get you at night.
Well first of all,

862
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:53.760
you don't know and I'm sneaking up on you and I have all this power,
right?

863
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:54.930
I feel good about it.

864
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:59.400
I'm going to get you the opposite of that is when I'm doing a convoy or I'm

865
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:01.410
going on a patrol,
we're now the bad guys are out there.

866
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.850
They're waiting to attack me.

867
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:07.530
And that is a defensive posture and your attitude about that type of thing is

868
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:10.880
bad.
Now we were train our guys that we,

869
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:14.610
we made a specific point with my guys.
I would say,
look,

870
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.360
when you're on patrol,
we're on the offense.
We are scanning,

871
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:20.070
we are looking to get the,

872
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.100
to get us to be standing up straight and to get the mentality of we want to do

873
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:29.220
this and we're moving towards the target as opposed to we're being chased.

874
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.983
That's a big deal.

875
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:36.220
<v 4>Absolutely.
That's a big deal.
Yeah.
And that's,
that's what would you say?</v>

876
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:41.500
That's an extreme example of what's necessary under normal conditions in life.

877
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.160
So one of the things that happens if you're treating someone who has a phobia,

878
00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:48.910
say like agoraphobic.
So they become afraid of virtually everything.
Um,

879
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.080
maybe they're afraid of an elevator.
It's one of many fears.
And so you think,

880
00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:53.914
well,

881
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.280
and they're afraid of an elevator because they've actually gone in elevators and

882
00:54:57.281 --> 00:54:58.101
have panic attack.

883
00:54:58.101 --> 00:55:01.930
So it's weird because what you do to cure them is to get them to go in elevators

884
00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:04.450
and you think,
well wait a second.
That's actually what caused the problem.

885
00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.900
So how can getting them to do that again,
make it better.

886
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.110
And now answer is because they've gone in elevators their whole life,
right?

887
00:55:11.111 --> 00:55:12.790
And yet they still become terrified.

888
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.750
So how can getting them to go in an elevator cure them for a long time?

889
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:20.440
People thought,
well,
you get them to relax while they were in the elevator.

890
00:55:20.441 --> 00:55:24.370
And the pairing of the relaxation with being in the elevator taught them to not

891
00:55:24.371 --> 00:55:26.970
be afraid.
That was the first theory.
But then people learned,

892
00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:29.590
didn't know you could just get them to go in the elevator without having them

893
00:55:29.591 --> 00:55:30.880
relax.
And it also worked.

894
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.300
And eventually psychologist sorted this out and what they figured out was that

895
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:40.150
voluntarily encountering something you're afraid of is not the same thing as

896
00:55:40.151 --> 00:55:44.830
running from it.
Like it's seriously not the same thing.
So you say to the person,

897
00:55:44.831 --> 00:55:48.700
okay,
you're afraid of the elevator,
let's can you go look at an elevator?

898
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.390
And they usually say yes and maybe they're so terrified because they're so far

899
00:55:52.391 --> 00:55:54.010
gone in their illness that they can't say,

900
00:55:54.011 --> 00:55:56.350
well how about we'll look at a bunch of pictures of elevators since like

901
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.420
virtually everyone can do that.
So I'd say,

902
00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.760
let's look at pictures of elevators till your board.

903
00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:03.790
That actually doesn't take very long because it's actually quite boring.

904
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:05.890
So then the next thing would be,
well,
let's go.

905
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.950
You have to have the person trust you.
And so the rule is,
look,

906
00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:13.300
we're going to do some things that are going to push you like competition,

907
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.750
but you can stop whenever you want and we're not going to push you any farther

908
00:56:16.751 --> 00:56:19.780
than is good for you and I'll stop anytime you want.

909
00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:21.400
I often practice with my clients,

910
00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:24.010
like I taught one client a while back to be afraid of needles

911
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.550
<v 2>and he was afraid of needles.
And I'll tell you what that meant.</v>

912
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:31.730
He had dental surgery with no anesthesia.
Oh,

913
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.620
okay.
So that gives you some level of what it's like to be afraid.

914
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.560
It's like all do the dental surgery,
but you're not putting that needle in there.

915
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:42.110
It's really,
it's like I'm no needles so,

916
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.060
so I taught them how to not be afraid of of needles,
you know,
and it,

917
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:49.360
it didn't take very long.
But the first thing I did,

918
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.120
I told him I was going to bring a needle into the office.

919
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.950
That was all I told him.

920
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:57.190
The first week is next week I'm going to bring a needle in here and I'm going to

921
00:56:57.191 --> 00:57:00.640
keep it sheets and it's going to be sitting on a shelf and that's where I'm

922
00:57:00.641 --> 00:57:02.200
going to put it.
And when you come in here,

923
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:05.710
you can look at it and if you want me to put it away,
then I'll put it away.

924
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:09.600
It's under your control.
And then so he was okay with that.
So he came in,

925
00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.510
there's the needless to do you want to look at it and said,
no,
he's but Kenyon.

926
00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:14.590
It's like all look at it.
So he looked at it and then it said,

927
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:18.490
look like I'm going to pick up the needle and now what you're going to do is

928
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.430
you're going to tell me to put it down and I'm going to put it down.

929
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:26.110
So I picked it up and he got nervous,
like right away,
and he said,
well,

930
00:57:26.111 --> 00:57:27.880
you put that down.
I put it down right away.
I said,

931
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:32.881
we do that 10 times so that the bottom part of your nervous system actually

932
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:36.420
knows that that's what's going to happen.

933
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.210
Said now and then the next thing we'll do is we're going to practice you saying

934
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:44.800
you've had enough and leaving the office.
So I pick up the needle and he'd say,

935
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:48.520
okay,
so now you say you've had enough,
I'm leaving.
And so he said that,

936
00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:49.390
and then I'd let them leave.

937
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:53.200
We did that like 10 times so that he knew that he could just say he'd had enough

938
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:56.470
and leave.
So that mean he didn't have to be a prey animal.
Right?

939
00:57:56.471 --> 00:58:00.100
So we're getting them out of that mode and it didn't take very long until,

940
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:04.320
well then I could bring the needle close to them and they said,

941
00:58:04.321 --> 00:58:06.940
make sure you watch it.
You can't pretend it's not there.
Right.

942
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:10.210
I'll bring it close to them and touch and touch them with the sheath needle.

943
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.350
So we did that a bunch and then finally I unchaste it and I'd bring it close and

944
00:58:14.351 --> 00:58:17.740
he tolerate that or stop me.
And then I touched him with that.

945
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:21.080
And then the last part of it was that,
um,

946
00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.920
I put it under a piece of paper so he couldn't see it.

947
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.880
And then I'd bring it close to him.
Right.
Cause that was,
that was the unknown.

948
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:30.520
Right?
You don't know what the hell is going on underneath the piece of paper.

949
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.850
But he got to the point where he could go and have a needle.
I took on about,

950
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.990
it was very brave of him to do this because,
well,
what had happened,
he got,

951
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.050
what had happened to him is he had a very bad experience with the childhood

952
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:44.980
dentist.
Held him down.
Oh yeah.
Held him.

953
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:49.780
Six people held them down to give him a needle.
It's like it wasn't so good.

954
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.320
It had some longterm consequences.
But see what happens.
So when you,

955
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:57.160
when you do that with people,
you don't teach them to be less afraid.

956
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.940
You teach them to be braver.
That's different.

957
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:04.270
And so like I had a client once the doors open on the elevator and she looked

958
00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:07.390
and she said,
that's death.
Like that's a tube.
And I thought,
wow,

959
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:10.390
that's an amazing response.
And her idea what,
she'd go in there,

960
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.150
her heart rate would accelerate,
she'd have a heart attack and she die.

961
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.540
So as far as she was concerned,
walking in,
there was death.
Right.
Okay.

962
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:20.140
So for me it was an elevator,
but for her it was death.
It's like,
okay,

963
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:23.990
well what do you do about your fear of death?
Well,
we're not getting rid of that.

964
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:28.640
It's like,
you know,
and you could die in the elevator.
You actually could,

965
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.720
probably,
you won't.
But people do die in elevators.
And her idea was that,
well,

966
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:35.930
if anyone has ever died in an elevator in the history of mankind,

967
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:39.530
that's a good reason for me not to be in the elevator.
It's like,
fair enough.

968
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:42.800
You know?
And then why aren't you terrified out of your skull all the time?

969
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.100
Because while you're wandering around,
you might have a heart attack like that.

970
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:48.860
We'll probably in fact happened to you at some point.

971
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.460
So why aren't you terrified at that at every moment?
Well,
that's the mystery.

972
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.570
Well,
so you treat people and,
and you see with that client,

973
00:59:56.571 --> 00:59:59.210
what I eventually did with hers,
we went and watched an embalming.

974
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.990
She was terrified of death.
Like seriously?
Yeah,

975
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.780
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right.
No kidding.
But you know,
so you get,

976
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:14.390
you don't get less afraid.
You get braver.

977
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.660
That's better because there's plenty of things to be afraid of,

978
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.040
but you can get braver.
So that's something people manage this on their own ever.

979
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.350
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
People manage it on their own.

980
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:26.630
They'd manage it on their own all the time.
Like,
you know,

981
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:27.650
let's say you're in a rowdy,

982
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:31.040
horrible job and you're being oppressed by your boss and one day you think I've

983
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.710
had enough,
and you go write your resume.
It's like,
there you go.

984
01:00:33.711 --> 01:00:36.950
That's what you're doing.
And it's like,
you know,
you're,
you're,
because you think,

985
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:41.420
well,
I've got the devil I know.
And,
and then there's devil I don't know.

986
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.800
And that's relevant when you're,

987
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.560
when you're trying to switch careers cannot find another job.

988
01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:48.920
Will anyone hire me?
How long would this take?
Two.
I have to get educated again.

989
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:50.240
I have to put my resume together.

990
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.450
That's a real pain because there's holes in it and I don't know how to present

991
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:57.170
myself.
Then I have to go to interviews and it's like,
oh my God,
that's,
you know,

992
01:00:57.171 --> 01:01:01.820
that's a lot of trouble.
Well then you think,
no,
I'm going to start that.

993
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.220
I'm going to rewrite my resume.
It's like,

994
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:08.150
well then you get right and just you're moving forward in your life.

995
01:01:08.151 --> 01:01:13.151
You're not taken being tyrannized by your son of a bitch of a boss and you're

996
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.330
out to do something about it.
You know?
And people can get really good at that.

997
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:21.440
So one of the things you do is a psychotherapist.
You do assertiveness training.

998
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.290
It's like,
so people come and they say,
help help.

999
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:29.120
I'm being oppressed in the famous Monty python in the famous Monty python
manner.

1000
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.780
And you say,
okay,
look,
well first of all,
you're probably whining a lot.

1001
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.280
So let's figure that out.

1002
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:38.630
So you quit whining and then let's figure out how you actually are oppressed and

1003
01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:40.010
what might be done about it.

1004
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.340
And then let's figure out a strategy and then let's help you practice the

1005
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:45.220
strategy until you get good at it.
And,

1006
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:50.650
and let's also map out the consequences of not fixing it because people think,

1007
01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:54.050
well,
how can I stand up to my boss?
It's like,
that's terrible.

1008
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:58.250
I might risk my job.
It's like,
yeah,
fair enough.
No wonder you're afraid of that.

1009
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.480
Maybe you should just shut up.

1010
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.620
Let's see what your life would be like in 10 years if you just shut up.

1011
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.330
It's like,
you know how bad it is now?

1012
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.600
It's like it's going to be way worse than that because you're going to shrink

1013
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:12.140
and shrink and shrink and your boss is going to become more and more tyrannical

1014
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.890
and you're going to hate every minute of your life and it's like you want that

1015
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:19.980
or do you want to confront your boss or change jobs?
It's like,
oh,
I see.
It's

1016
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.620
<v 4>like hell here.
It's hell here.
I get it.</v>

1017
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.390
I get to pick which of those I'm going to walk down and that's a relief to

1018
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:28.380
people most of the time.

1019
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:32.790
It's so funny because people often think they have their,

1020
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.930
they're paralyzed because they think that there's a good option.
Right,
right,

1021
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.280
right.
But what are the things you do as a psychotherapist to say,
oh,
no,
no,
no,

1022
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.450
you're screwed.
No matter which way you turn.

1023
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:47.070
It's like a crocodile here and it's a wolf there.
And behind you there's a Hyena.

1024
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:50.730
It's like there's no lambs.

1025
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:54.270
You're not in Lam territory.
It's all predators.
Well,

1026
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.620
pick your battles,
pick your battle,

1027
01:02:56.621 --> 01:03:00.570
and then all of a sudden you're in the battle and then it doesn't matter that

1028
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:05.070
it's a Hyena because your warrior so fine,
bring it on.

1029
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:10.200
<v 3>This is a common to another point that I picked up from the book that I,</v>

1030
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.760
I have a leadership and management consulting company started work with

1031
01:03:12.761 --> 01:03:13.311
companies all the time.

1032
01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:16.550
And one of the topics has come up a bunch in the past couple of years is,

1033
01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.010
you know,
when you're,
when you're dealing with someone,

1034
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.150
you're dealing with an employee and you got firearm and how this big hard

1035
01:03:23.151 --> 01:03:25.550
conversation and et Cetera,
et cetera.
No one wants to have those.

1036
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:28.370
And I always say,
look,

1037
01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:31.100
if you have the hard conversation earlier,

1038
01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.010
it's not so hard because all I have to tell you is,
Hey Jordan,

1039
01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.230
you know you were late today and we're not supposed to be late.

1040
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.070
And you all sorry.
And the problems sorts itself out or it or it doesn't.

1041
01:03:40.071 --> 01:03:41.150
And then I got to escalate.

1042
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:46.820
But what you talk about in the book is if there's a problem,
go attack it.

1043
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.660
You can go get that problem solved.
Don't go after that dragon.

1044
01:03:49.661 --> 01:03:51.800
You know the dragons in there,
go get it.

1045
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.090
<v 4>Well,
your observation is dead on.
It's like,</v>

1046
01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:56.430
and this is the problem with being too nice.

1047
01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:59.610
Like I don't want regard nice as a virtue or if it's a virtue,

1048
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:02.550
it's a very low order virtue.
Because what nice usually means,

1049
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:07.170
but nice usually means is I don't want to cause conflict now,

1050
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.190
even though the consequences of the conflict might multiply into the future.

1051
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.760
So let's say you have an employee that's chronically late,
right?
And,
but you,

1052
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.010
I don't want to,
I don't really want to disturb them.

1053
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:18.210
I don't want to cause any trouble.

1054
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:20.490
It's like while you're angry about it because they're late and they're not

1055
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:22.770
supposed to be.
So you're getting all bitter and resentful,

1056
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.320
plus you're not doing them any favors,
you know,

1057
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.860
cause you're also telling them that you can be taken advantage of and that their

1058
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:31.800
lack of discipline is okay.
And then you know,

1059
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.980
so then you're going to dislike the employee and you're going to amplify their

1060
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:37.650
other errors in your,
because of your distaste.

1061
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.650
And then if they are someone who's taking advantage of you,

1062
01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:43.200
then they're going to take advantage of you a little more and then a little more

1063
01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:44.580
and then a little more and a little more.

1064
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.970
And then you're going to have to have a really difficult conversation or put up

1065
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.130
with it.
And that might sink your business,

1066
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:51.870
especially if you're a small business owner.

1067
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:57.170
So by not confronting the dragon when it's like two inches high and can only,

1068
01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.770
you know,
it's,
it's like it can belch out something like a bic lighter.

1069
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:05.070
You wait until the thing can inflame the whole room and then you say,
oh my God,

1070
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:06.870
like isn't this hellish?
It's like,
well,

1071
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:11.010
you knew that there was something to say.
You knew it,

1072
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.930
you knew it a thousand times,
and now you can't just say the one thing,

1073
01:05:15.931 --> 01:05:18.070
you have to say the thousand things,
or maybe you have

1074
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.540
<v 3>to say the 10,000 things and it's just destructive in every way.</v>

1075
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.460
So yeah,
that's not good.
No.
Here's where I need help with this.

1076
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:31.510
So what I think people might get the ideas,
okay,

1077
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:35.770
if I'm in a relationship with my wife and she gives,

1078
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.350
serves me dry chicken again.
Yeah.
Right.
Which is,

1079
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.340
which is a common theme in my household.
And actually,
thanks to the Internet,

1080
01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:45.760
it's actually changed now because she's gotten thousands of people that have now

1081
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:50.110
sent her how to keep the chicken moist.
So she does a great job.
But for,
for,
um,

1082
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.630
you know,
we're talking about two decades of my life.

1083
01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:56.590
We're talking about dry chicken.
This is a problem.
And you know what I did?

1084
01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:01.450
I didn't say anything because I would drink more water,
more water at dinner.

1085
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.660
Yeah.
I fear that sometimes people say,
well,

1086
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.400
you know what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna run around and I'm going to tell

1087
01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:10.000
the truth to everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter.
Now,

1088
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.200
my,
my,
my actual best example that I've ever heard of this,

1089
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.490
we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie Plumb.
He was a pilot in Vietnam.

1090
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:21.290
He was shot down in,
um,

1091
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:25.720
in on his last mission of his deployment.
He was shot down.
He was captured.

1092
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:28.570
He was in the Hanoi Hilton for six years.

1093
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.770
This is the deal that they had amongst their roommates.

1094
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:35.380
So they had roommates in a room smaller than we're in right now,

1095
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:37.570
and there'd be four of them in there,
three of them in there too.
From there,

1096
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:41.230
depending on what was going on,
if you did something that annoyed me,

1097
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:45.400
if Jordan does something that annoys me,
we got to live together.

1098
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:50.140
If you do something that annoys me,
it's my fault.
It's my fault for allowing.

1099
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.900
You Click,
click,
click your nails together.

1100
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:55.990
You pick your nose a lot or you itch your head,
whatever it is that you do,

1101
01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:56.824
that bothers me.

1102
01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:02.070
It's my problem and I have to absorb it because otherwise what we have is we

1103
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.230
have like rats in a cage that are going to know each other apart.

1104
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.120
And I thought about that while I was reading the part of the book that was

1105
01:07:10.121 --> 01:07:14.110
saying,
and you actually also later in the book talk about,
Hey,
you know,

1106
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.910
are you going to get fired over this little stupid thing?

1107
01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:20.320
Are you going to absorb?
And I talk about that a lot as a leader,

1108
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.640
as a,
as a person in a relationship.
Hey,
there's problems from your boss.

1109
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.240
You absorb them and you don't pass them down to your people.
You know,
you,

1110
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.141
you want us to do to stay,

1111
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:31.780
work and or stay late and do a bunch of crazy stuff that we don't think we

1112
01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.780
should be doing.
Cool.
My guys are gonna go home.
I'm going to absorb that.

1113
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.510
I'll get it done myself.
I'm not going to,
I'm going to absorb these problems.

1114
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.260
Now are there some tertiary effects?
Of course.

1115
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.480
Are Secondary effects that now my boss thinks he can get away with that and all

1116
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:46.270
those things.
But I just think there's,

1117
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:51.271
we have to be careful that we're not just throwing spears of truth in people's

1118
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:56.260
heads on a regular basis.
Those are black truths.
The opposite of white lies,

1119
01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:59.390
right?
So black truths are truths that you use to hurt other people with

1120
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.300
technically in the moment,
the statement is factual,

1121
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:08.230
but the context belies right.
Whereas a white lie,
it's like,
well,

1122
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:11.230
it's a little lie,
but you're trying to support a larger truth.

1123
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:15.010
Not that white white lies aren't optimal.
You know,
it's better not to lie,

1124
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:15.980
but sometimes the

1125
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.870
<v 4>best you can manage as a white lie and then maybe that's pretty good.
Well,
okay,</v>

1126
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:24.770
so then in those sorts of situations you think,
well,
first of all,

1127
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.310
I have some rules of thumb.
If someone does something at work that annoys you,

1128
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.620
it's like,
write it off,
man.
It's like,
that's once.
It's like,
what does that mean?

1129
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:36.470
You're having a bad day,
you're having a bad day,
or I'm having a bad dates.

1130
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.050
Like it doesn't mean anything.
Do it twice.
I think so.

1131
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:45.020
Okay,
let's write that off.
Write that off.
It's,
that's it's the same issue.

1132
01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:50.021
It could still just be circumstance and situation three times.

1133
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:54.350
Okay.
Now there might be grounds for a conversation.
You go and say,
well,
you know,

1134
01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:59.600
you put your feet up on my desk like a day ago,
and that was okay.

1135
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:04.601
But then he did it again and then like you did it again and I'm thinking it

1136
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:07.100
actually happened three times.
Right.

1137
01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:10.430
So there's no denying it and perhaps that's not optimal.

1138
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:14.270
And then you go for the smallest possible victory.
That's the next thing is like,

1139
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.540
I'm not telling you that your,

1140
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.770
what would you say that you lack respect or that there's something wrong with

1141
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:25.280
you?
What I'm asking is that if you come in my office,

1142
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.700
it would be better for both of us if your feet stayed on the floor.

1143
01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.750
Is that okay?
You know,
and,
and that's a small thing.

1144
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:37.850
You're not going after the person's character,
right?

1145
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:40.760
You go on after the tiny victory.
So you say to your wife,
look like,

1146
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.610
I'm thrilled to death that you're cooking me dinner.
I really,

1147
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.450
I'm serious because,
and it could be a hell of a lot worse than it is,
you know?

1148
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:51.170
And,
and maybe I could be more helpful around the kitchen.

1149
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.670
That's certainly a possibility.

1150
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:57.260
But I have got this thing with regards to chicken and maybe it's me,
you know,

1151
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.560
but could we try for like a month to cook it differently and then we'll revisit

1152
01:10:03.051 --> 01:10:06.770
it.
And if I happen to be wrong,
like I'll shut the hell up and she might think,

1153
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:07.611
okay,

1154
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:10.850
well he is kind of useless around the kitchen and he sort of bitchy about the

1155
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:12.350
chicken and all of that.

1156
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:17.351
But maybe I trust him enough to admit that I made a small mistake and rectify it

1157
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:21.110
and we could go long and not have the damn chicken thing hanging over our heads

1158
01:10:21.111 --> 01:10:21.900
until we're 80.

1159
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:25.640
<v 3>Yeah,
right.
You know,
you just,
in your second example there,
you,</v>

1160
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:27.250
I tell people this all the time,

1161
01:10:27.251 --> 01:10:30.270
so you're coming into my office and you're putting your feet on the desk.

1162
01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:35.170
What I'll generally do is make it my fault.
I have generally say,

1163
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.810
Hey Jordan,
I hate to be like a nitpicker.
Yeah.

1164
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.650
But I'm really freaked out about germs.
It's really stupid,
but I am.

1165
01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:44.410
And when you come in and put your feet on my desk,
it freaks me out.

1166
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.820
Can you just do me a favor and not put your foot on your d at the same thing

1167
01:10:48.821 --> 01:10:50.980
with,
you know,
with the chicken it's like,
Hey,
you know what?

1168
01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:54.100
I have a super sensitive palate.
Refined and I,
yeah,

1169
01:10:54.101 --> 01:10:59.080
to super refined sense of about five.
Sorry.
And I just,

1170
01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:03.250
yeah,
could we maybe figure out another way to cook that or,
oh,
can we try,

1171
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:06.100
you know,
but I'll take the blame for,

1172
01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:09.040
for the situation rather than you're,

1173
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:11.320
you're disrespectful and don't put your feet on my desk.

1174
01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:14.400
This is what you don't want to a

1175
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.990
<v 4>more of a position of moral superiority than is absolutely necessary.</v>

1176
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.460
One of the things I recommend,

1177
01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:24.390
I don't remember if I wrote it in 12 rules for life,
I think I did about how to,

1178
01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.410
let's say you're in an intractable argument with your wife about who's the most

1179
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.270
reprehensible person,
right?

1180
01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:34.480
Which is where arguments sort of and when they go to hale,
thanks.

1181
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:38.430
Now you're in one of those arguments and you risk bringing up the past,

1182
01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:40.620
which is a very,
very bad idea,
right?

1183
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.960
Maybe you're saying something like you've always been this way,

1184
01:11:43.961 --> 01:11:47.490
you're this way down,
you'll never change and none of it's good.
It's like,
Oh man,

1185
01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:50.100
that's a fight because we're,
where are we going to go from there?

1186
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.810
So one of the things I recommend,

1187
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.810
and this actually works is when you're in one of these battles and you can't

1188
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.860
bloody well get out of it,

1189
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:59.010
you separate each go to your room and you sit and think,
okay,

1190
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:02.790
that person is really wrong.
And I'd like to give them a good stomping and,

1191
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.770
but then you think,
no,
I got to live with them.

1192
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.720
So that's probably not a good idea,
right?

1193
01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:09.660
Cause I don't want to live with someone who's like stomped and angry about it

1194
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:12.900
because they're going to take their revenge.
Like if they have any spirit at all.

1195
01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:16.830
So you cannot win an argument with your wife.
That's just wrong.
You can't,

1196
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.590
you can make peace,
you can come up with a solution.
But if you,

1197
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.600
when she loses and then she's the loser and like unless you want to have a loser

1198
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:29.610
round,
that's not a very good strategy anyway.

1199
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.170
So you go to your room and you think,
okay,

1200
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:37.410
fundamentally flawed as my wife is,
particularly in this particular circumstance,

1201
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:42.510
there's probably something stupid idea in the relatively recent past that

1202
01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:47.400
increased the probability that we're in this little hellish place.
And you think,

1203
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.030
ah,
what was it?
And you think,
Oh God,
I really don't want to know.
It's like,

1204
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.220
really don't want to know this.
And so you think,
no,

1205
01:12:53.221 --> 01:12:57.390
I'm going to figure out where I'm 1% at fault.

1206
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:02.160
She's 99% wrong,
but I'm,
I'm 1% at fault.
So you sit there and you think,
okay,

1207
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:02.994
what was it?

1208
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:07.560
Then you let your imagination sort of wander over your past stupidities and you

1209
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:08.700
think,
oh,

1210
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:12.480
there was something I did that was like kind of underhanded and devious and

1211
01:13:12.481 --> 01:13:14.590
crooked and pathetic and weasely and,

1212
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:19.020
and then you go and you tell her and she does the same thing,
you know,

1213
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:22.170
and she's just as irritated about it as you are.
And then you think,
okay,

1214
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.221
and you say,
look,

1215
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:26.490
I'm sorry about that and I know this increased the probability that we're in

1216
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:30.390
this like bitchy pourable place and she does the same thing.
And then you think,

1217
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:30.691
oh yeah,

1218
01:13:30.691 --> 01:13:34.710
well we're both pathetic losers and we can quit plan like dominance hierarchy

1219
01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:37.830
and then maybe you can have a conversation about how to make it better and that

1220
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:41.670
conversation should be bounded to,
it's like the chicken thing is a really good,

1221
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.660
my,
my father in law who I really like,
he used to come,

1222
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:47.850
my wife told me this story.

1223
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:52.080
He used to come home for lunch and his wife would feed them lunch and she always

1224
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:57.081
used little plates and it was like they'd been married for 30 years and one day

1225
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:01.260
he had this explosion at the table about the fact that he did,

1226
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.790
he'd had to eat off these damn little plates for 30 years and you know,

1227
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:09.570
it was much more of a large explosion then it had to be.

1228
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:11.980
But it's these little things actually matter.

1229
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.890
<v 2>Hey,
they actually matter that you have to straighten them out.
Cause your life,</v>

1230
01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:16.420
especially with your wife,

1231
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:21.280
is composed of about 50 little things that you do every day.

1232
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:23.620
And because you do them every day,
they're not little.

1233
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.350
You can just do the arithmetic.
You know?

1234
01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:30.070
It's like maybe you don't like the way your wife greets you when you come home.

1235
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.560
It's like,
okay,
is that relevant?
Is that important?

1236
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:36.460
Well let's say it takes 10 minutes cause you're thinking about it and you're

1237
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:38.920
coming home and then there's the little aftermath.
It was 10 minutes.

1238
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.460
So it's like an hour a week.
It's four hours a month,
it's 50 hours a year.

1239
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.810
That's one work week.
It's 2% of your life.
It's like 2% of your life.
Right?

1240
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:51.160
So that's the math.
It's like if you got 50 of those things right,

1241
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:55.150
your whole life would be right.
Think is it worth fighting about?
It's like,
yeah,

1242
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.560
it's worth it because it's 2% of your life or what's 1% even whatever.

1243
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:00.850
And then you think,
okay,

1244
01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:04.990
well how should people greet themselves when they first come home?
It's like,

1245
01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:09.310
well maybe it's not quite like your dog greets you cause your dog is like

1246
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.640
reprehensive really happy to see that's just too much.
Right.

1247
01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:13.870
Little candle do that.

1248
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.260
But maybe you want the person to not be watching TV for the second you entered

1249
01:15:19.811 --> 01:15:22.810
the house.
Maybe they should just stop watching TV and come and say,
you know,

1250
01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:26.020
hello,
how was your day?
And give you a hug.
That would be a good thing.

1251
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:30.040
And then maybe you do the same thing to them and you practice that for like two

1252
01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:32.920
months cause you're both stupid and it's really hard for you to learn anything.

1253
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:36.940
And then you've got that down and that the dinner times are like that too.

1254
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:40.000
Like lots and lots of households mealtimes are really fractured,

1255
01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:43.510
which is a bad thing.
Or they're bitter.
It's like I'm,

1256
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.630
here's your God damn food.
It's like,
yeah,
I'll eat it,

1257
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:49.360
but I can't stand it and you can't cook.
It's like,
okay,

1258
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:53.470
that's four and a half hours a day,
right for your whole life.

1259
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.440
You think you're going to like someone like that?
Not a bit,
man.

1260
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.960
You're not going to like them.
So you fix that.

1261
01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:02.360
<v 3>You actually do,
did tell that whole thing in the book.
So that's good.</v>

1262
01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:02.751
It's in the right.

1263
01:16:02.751 --> 01:16:06.170
And actually the phrasing that you used when you say if you win an argument,

1264
01:16:06.171 --> 01:16:09.920
you said something along the lines of you win,
you win that argument,

1265
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:13.340
they're the loser.
Yup.
Now you win that argument a hundred times.

1266
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:17.960
Now in a marriage you win 10,000 times and you are now married to a loser.

1267
01:16:17.961 --> 01:16:18.950
And that loser,

1268
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:24.320
<v 2>that loser is not going to be someone who makes any effort whatsoever,</v>

1269
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:29.160
ever to be attractive to you or anyone else.
Then you'll think,
oh look,

1270
01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:33.330
look,
look,
look who I ended up with.
It's like,
no,

1271
01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.340
look at how you produced.

1272
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.440
<v 3>It's like good work there sky.
And that's the,
that's the so,</v>

1273
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.850
so what you're talking about with this argument thing and you look over,

1274
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.750
you separate,
you go in your room and you say,
okay,
what did I do wrong?

1275
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:50.370
Did I do wrong?
And that's annoying.
What did I do wrong?
And,
and interestingly,

1276
01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:51.630
myself and my,
my,

1277
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.200
my buddy Leif Babin and we wrote a book called extreme ownership.

1278
01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:58.850
And the whole premise is you take responsibility for when things go wrong and

1279
01:16:58.851 --> 01:17:00.210
you say,
yeah,
this was my fault.

1280
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:04.830
So I'll go to clients and I'll be meeting with them.
And I'll say,

1281
01:17:04.831 --> 01:17:05.341
you look when you,

1282
01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:07.530
if something goes wrong with your team here with you guys made a mistake,

1283
01:17:07.531 --> 01:17:10.610
you fail whenever you're trying to,
you know,
you've got to take ownership of it.

1284
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:11.750
You stand up and you say,
hey look,

1285
01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:15.410
this was my fault and this is what we're gonna do.

1286
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.040
And the people will say,
well,
you know what,
if I did that,

1287
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:23.390
my team is so bad that if I did that with my team,
you know what they'd say?

1288
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:28.130
They'd say,
you're right,
it is your fault.
And he looked at me like,

1289
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.780
so you're planning Jocko sucks.
Because if I say,
this is my fault,

1290
01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.580
my team is going to look at me and say,
you're right,
it is your fault.

1291
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.590
And then what do I do?
And like I kind of get a little bit,

1292
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.480
maybe a little bit frustrated because I look at them and I say,

1293
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:48.920
that's the whole point.
It actually is your fault.

1294
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:52.460
You're not just saying it to get out of the,
the the problem.

1295
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:55.760
You're not just saying it to make excuses for everything that's happening.
No.

1296
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:56.810
When you say,
Hey,

1297
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:59.530
this is my fault that we got in this argument and then you're ending,

1298
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.260
your wife says,
yeah it is.
You don't say no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You say,

1299
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.890
I know and you have to meet her.
It is.
You say,

1300
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.140
I know and this is what I'm going to do to fix it.

1301
01:18:09.141 --> 01:18:11.210
And if you're a leader and you say it's my fault,
and your team says,
yeah,

1302
01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:12.740
you're right,
it is your fault.
You say,
I know.

1303
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:14.990
That's what I just said and here's what we'll do to fix it.

1304
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.390
So when you take ownership of a problem,

1305
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:20.030
it doesn't necessarily make the problem go away.
In fact,

1306
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:20.900
it doesn't do that at all.

1307
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.930
Once you admit what the problem is and you take ownership for the problem,

1308
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.240
then you have to say,
here's what I'm going to do to fix it.

1309
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.373
Here's my [inaudible].

1310
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:31.590
<v 4>Let's say you're a high school kid and he got a tyrant as a teacher,
it's like,</v>

1311
01:18:31.591 --> 01:18:32.131
well,
you could,

1312
01:18:32.131 --> 01:18:35.580
it could be the case that you have a tire and Teza teacher and the tire it is

1313
01:18:35.581 --> 01:18:37.770
particularly on your case and you think,
well,
yeah,

1314
01:18:37.771 --> 01:18:41.070
that's an awful thing and this person really is a tire,
and it's like,
yeah,

1315
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.460
but you're not very good at dealing with tyrants.
And you might think,
well,

1316
01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:48.150
I shouldn't have to be.
It's like fair enough,
man,
because who wants tyrants?

1317
01:18:48.151 --> 01:18:53.151
But truth of the matter is is that there is always tyranny and if you don't know

1318
01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:55.650
how to deal with it,

1319
01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:59.190
if you don't know how to thrive in the face of tyranny,

1320
01:18:59.191 --> 01:19:01.590
even then there is something wrong with you.
Now,

1321
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.870
doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong with the tyrant.

1322
01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:08.160
It's like that's self evident.
But it does mean that you aren't who you could be.

1323
01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.870
Because if you were everything you could be,
you could manage that situation.

1324
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:15.510
And it might be,
you'd figure out an exit strategy.
I mean,

1325
01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:18.900
who the hell knows what the solution would be?
But if you,

1326
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.010
if you are conceiving yourself as helpless victim,
then that's what you are.

1327
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.060
And I'm not saying that there aren't situations that people find themselves in

1328
01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:31.860
where there's very,
well,
it's hard to say,
you know,

1329
01:19:31.861 --> 01:19:33.600
that there's very little you can do.
I mean,

1330
01:19:33.601 --> 01:19:35.400
that woman that we talked about earlier,

1331
01:19:35.401 --> 01:19:38.880
she was in a pretty damn hopeless situation and she found something she could
do.

1332
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.710
You know,
and I've read these books,

1333
01:19:40.711 --> 01:19:44.430
Viktor Frankl's man's search for meaning and social knits and school leg

1334
01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:45.061
archipelago.

1335
01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:49.370
I mean he saw people in s pretty damned dire straights and like really mean

1336
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.470
really beyond comprehension.

1337
01:19:52.471 --> 01:19:57.060
And he noticed even in those situations that people still had their choices to

1338
01:19:57.061 --> 01:19:58.980
make.
You know,
and I mean you,
you,

1339
01:19:58.981 --> 01:20:02.760
you tread on that ground with extreme hesitancy because you don't say,
well man,

1340
01:20:02.761 --> 01:20:06.210
if I was thrown in the Gulag I would've been noble.
It's like,
no,
probably not,

1341
01:20:06.211 --> 01:20:09.560
man.
You would have a trustee and about 15 minutes,
you know,

1342
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:10.960
that's the most likely outcome.

1343
01:20:10.961 --> 01:20:14.190
So you have to be careful about not getting too high on your horse about such

1344
01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:17.760
things.
But it isn't obvious when you're out of choices.

1345
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.830
Most of the time you have more choices.

1346
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:24.150
You haven't used all the choices you have.
Most of the time.

1347
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.290
Now I've seen people in situations I couldn't help them get out of.
So,

1348
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:32.820
and people die,
right?
I mean,
you have a fatal illness,
you have pancreatic cancer,

1349
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.520
like you're dead in six months.
Your choices are limited.

1350
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:39.750
But maybe under those circumstances you figure out how to put your house in

1351
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:44.040
order and be what you can to the people who will be left.

1352
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.560
It's something like that.
Okay.

1353
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:49.570
<v 3>For me and I get a lot of,
and I know you get infinitely more than me,</v>

1354
01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:53.410
but I'll get someone that reports to me a problem or a situation that they're in

1355
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:55.690
that seems really bad and,

1356
01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:00.670
and what I've found is the solution that they're looking for,

1357
01:21:00.671 --> 01:21:05.671
the only solution that they can conceive of is one that is going to provide that

1358
01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:10.570
solution within a two week timeframe.
Like that's what we're talking about.

1359
01:21:10.571 --> 01:21:14.770
If I'm not,
if this problem isn't solved in two weeks,
then you know this is hell.

1360
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.740
And,
and I always kind of report back and say,
Hey,

1361
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:21.640
you're hearing a job right now that I understand it's bad.

1362
01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:25.330
I understand it's your boss's terrible vote team is terrible the but whatever

1363
01:21:25.331 --> 01:21:26.110
the case is,
would it?

1364
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.360
Or you're in a situation where your family is this or whatever.

1365
01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.680
So conceive a plan right now and it's not going to take two weeks.

1366
01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:35.020
It might take six months,
it might take a year.

1367
01:21:35.021 --> 01:21:39.130
It might take a year and a half of you saving your money and sending your resume

1368
01:21:39.131 --> 01:21:41.260
and getting the other skills that you need if you can.

1369
01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:44.590
If you can extend your time and I'll tell you what,
when you,

1370
01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:47.560
when you come up with that plan,
when you conceive of that plan,

1371
01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:52.300
immediately you have hope.
And when you have hope,

1372
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:55.660
you can continue on through the miserable existence that you're in.

1373
01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:56.291
Cause you know they're going to,

1374
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.420
you've got a plan and you're gonna get your way out of it.
Absolutely.

1375
01:21:58.510 --> 01:22:02.050
<v 4>Well,
I,
I had a client recently because I've done a lot of consulting as well as</v>

1376
01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:05.920
clinical work.
And often my clients come to me,
they're high functioning people.

1377
01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.130
They have decent jobs,
but you know,
we make a plan.
It's like,
well,

1378
01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.200
I'm making $75,000 a year right now.
The person says,
I said,
well,
how much?

1379
01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.720
Well,
okay,
we're gonna,
we're gonna improve that.
Like,

1380
01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.690
why don't we see if we can triple that,
see if we can triple it.
It's like,

1381
01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:23.170
what the hell?
You know,
maybe we can't,
but maybe we can.

1382
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:27.490
Some people do make triple.
That could be you.
Okay.
So what's wrong with you?

1383
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:31.750
Well,
you know,
you're not educated enough.
All right,
so we need to fix that.

1384
01:22:31.751 --> 01:22:36.220
Your resume isn't in order,
you're not sending the damn thing out.
It's like,

1385
01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:38.680
well then you got to do baseline statistics.
It's like,
well,

1386
01:22:38.681 --> 01:22:42.280
how many times do you have to send out your resume to to move ahead when you're

1387
01:22:42.281 --> 01:22:45.370
already in a pretty decent job?
Well,
the answer isn't 10.

1388
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.720
The answer is like you have to send out five a day everyday for the next two

1389
01:22:49.721 --> 01:22:51.550
years and the,

1390
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.600
the rejection rate will be so close to 100% that that's what it will feel like.

1391
01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.940
Right?
But it's a lottery ticket.
You only have to win once.

1392
01:23:00.941 --> 01:23:05.920
So it doesn't matter if you,
if you lose 300 times,
it doesn't matter.

1393
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.000
You just need one hit.

1394
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.330
So now you got to prepare yourself because it's going to be brutal because

1395
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.450
you're sending out all these,
you know,
resumes to jobs.

1396
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:17.740
You're not quite qualified enough for cause you're looking to move up,

1397
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.540
brace yourself,
right?
It's going to be nothing but failure.
Nothing but failure.

1398
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:27.340
Well,
in this particular client,
I think it took her two years,
maybe more,

1399
01:23:27.341 --> 01:23:32.140
two and a half years of sending out resumes and accelerating her education.
And,

1400
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.460
and practicing,

1401
01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:37.780
cause she'd get an interview now and then and get very close to it to get that

1402
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:39.310
first move right.

1403
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:42.580
But then she got two more in the next year and she was at Tripler salary.

1404
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.080
But you know,

1405
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:49.081
it's like longterm strategic thinking followed by an implementable plan and then

1406
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.560
the willingness to tolerate an insane run of ridiculous failures before you

1407
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:59.140
move.
But I've seen that happen to people.

1408
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.930
There's no reason that you can't move.

1409
01:24:01.931 --> 01:24:04.150
You just have to figure out where you want to move.

1410
01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.840
You have to figure out what the criteria are for putting you in that position.

1411
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.700
And then you have to be some measure of insanely persistent because it's so

1412
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:16.990
unlikely,
right?
The default answer to the question,

1413
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.790
can I have this good job?
Is are you out of your mind?
Of course not.

1414
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.230
Right,
right.
Well,
it is.
It's like,
and even if you're qualified,
it's like,
yeah,

1415
01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:30.490
you and 10 other people.
So there's even an element of chance added,

1416
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.420
especially at the end.
You know,
like if you're in the top five,

1417
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.220
you've done everything you can can do to control that outcome.

1418
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.330
There's some element of chance that's going to be the determining variable

1419
01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:45.640
because,
you know,
maybe,
I dunno,

1420
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.840
maybe they didn't like the way your suit looked on you and that's the only thing

1421
01:24:49.841 --> 01:24:51.910
that's differentiating you from the other candidate.

1422
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:54.520
It's like you also don't want to take that too personally.
It's like,
well,

1423
01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:58.750
you hit the top five,
you were shortlisted,
you're in there,
man,
you're in there,

1424
01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:02.380
you're in the game.
Do that 10 times,
you'll win one of those contests,

1425
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:07.150
but you got to do it 10 times.
So,
and you know,
even in lower end jobs,

1426
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:11.350
like I,
I've,
I,
I've worked in lots of lower end jobs.
We talked about Dishwasher,

1427
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.540
dishwasher,
I share a strong kid.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well,
you know,

1428
01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:19.870
I was dishwasher for a while,
but then that was a short order cook and you know,

1429
01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:22.060
but more than that,
more importantly than that,

1430
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:27.280
even while I was a dishwasher Washer,
once I kind of got the hang of it,

1431
01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:32.140
which was a lot harder than you might think.
Um,
once I got the hang of it,

1432
01:25:32.141 --> 01:25:36.910
I was valued member of that team.
It's like,
well,
you're a dishwasher.

1433
01:25:36.911 --> 01:25:38.470
It's like,
yeah,
that's one way of looking at it.

1434
01:25:38.471 --> 01:25:41.140
Another way of looking at it is that I'm valued member of this team.

1435
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:45.100
And that was actually fun.
Like I was just a kid,
you know,
I was 14 and I was,

1436
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:50.020
I did my job properly and I got treated like an adult.
It was like,
I loved that.

1437
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.710
I loved that.
That was great.
And so the fact that I was,
what,

1438
01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:57.940
are you a dishwasher or are you a 14 year old adult?
Hey,
I'm a 14 year old adult.

1439
01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:02.950
Hey,
I win,
I win that dishwasher,
no dishwasher.
It's like that's a good game.

1440
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.040
And I really did like that.

1441
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.310
<v 3>I mean,
when I look back in my mid adolescence,</v>

1442
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.600
it's certainly the case that the,
the Times that we're the best for me,

1443
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:14.510
which when I was working in restaurants because I was,

1444
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:19.820
I was part of the team man.
So you,
one of the sections in the book,

1445
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:21.420
you talk about,
um,

1446
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.880
I believe the person's name was lunchbox Lunchbucket

1447
01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:28.403
Toro lunch.

1448
01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:33.440
But since we're talking about work environments and there's that certain level

1449
01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:36.950
of comradery and you actually talk about the seal teams in here where you just

1450
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:41.840
have this,
it's like a non,
I've talked about this before in the seal teams,

1451
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:43.250
it's nonstop,

1452
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:48.650
hyper verbal abuse,
aggression around the clock,

1453
01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:53.510
24 hours a day.
You're in a seal platoon.
Like that's the,
that's life.
Any,

1454
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.210
any mistake that you make,
any,

1455
01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.800
any display of weakness is going to be passive.

1456
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:05.990
Oh,
it's going to be ripped apart.
And then if you get all irritated about that,

1457
01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:10.520
it's even worse.
Just the dad,
the nicknames,
you talked about lunch bucket,

1458
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.300
your nickname was howdy,
howdy doody,
and then be shortened to howdy.
Which was,

1459
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.580
which was you felt pretty good about is better.
Yeah,

1460
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.880
because you went from how to ut,
which is kind of how he was just kind of cool,

1461
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:24.650
right?
As Western guy and whatever.
But,
but the nicknames that that,

1462
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:26.000
that are in the seal teams,

1463
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:29.630
like I can't with good conscience repeat them because they're just,

1464
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:31.520
they're just horrible,
horrible names.

1465
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:36.080
But there's a comradery around that.
And there's also the way,

1466
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:38.270
as I was reading what you had written about,

1467
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:42.320
these guys were working on a railroad railroad crew.
Yeah.
There's a test.

1468
01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.213
It's a test.

1469
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.060
It's a test to see where you're at so that you're made of can we take,

1470
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:50.420
can you read,
can you tolerate a little bit of irritation?

1471
01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:51.950
If the answer to that is no,
it's like,

1472
01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:54.770
well maybe we don't want you around them cause some of your rotating things are

1473
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:57.860
likely to come down the pipe.
Yeah,
and it's,
it's not just

1474
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.810
to me.
To me it proves if you've got someone that can take it.
Right.

1475
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:07.280
It's not just that they can take some random joking insults like they can,

1476
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:10.520
they can take it.
They can take it.
Yeah.
That's what you're testing for.
It's like,

1477
01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:11.354
can you take it?

1478
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.660
Lunchbucket couldn't write because people would laugh at his lunch bucket and

1479
01:28:14.661 --> 01:28:18.800
he'd get all upset.
It's like,
well you have a stupid lunch pocket.
It's like,

1480
01:28:18.801 --> 01:28:21.380
you know your mum packed it.
How about you laugh at yourself?
Yeah.

1481
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:23.630
My mom packed this.
I know.
It's kind of stupid.

1482
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.350
That would have been the end of it.
He would just have to say that it's like,

1483
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.050
but I didn't want to hurt her feelings.
It's like,
oh okay.
You know,
fine,

1484
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:34.040
you got your stupid lunch bucket.
But no,
he couldn't handle that,
you know.

1485
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.630
So yeah,
it was,
it was horrible.

1486
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:38.360
It comical to watch at the same time because of the level of,

1487
01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.490
and people have written me about that and they said,
oh you know,

1488
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:43.730
poor Lunchbucket.
It's like,
cause they're all compassionate I think.
No,
no,

1489
01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:48.200
not poor Lunchbucket.
It's like clue the hail in buddy you had your chance.

1490
01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.580
You know,
that was a desirable job,

1491
01:28:49.581 --> 01:28:52.940
that real crew job in the summer because it was high paying,
you know,

1492
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.010
and they weren't easy to come by those jobs.

1493
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:58.310
And so the fact that he got hired onto that crew is a real opportunity for him.

1494
01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:02.010
You could make a pile of money into summer out working on the rail crew and

1495
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.660
<v 4>all you had to do was take some ribbing with good grace,</v>

1496
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.990
not suck up to the management too badly and not have other people do your job.

1497
01:29:12.511 --> 01:29:15.840
That was all,
that was all you had to do,
but he couldn't do that.

1498
01:29:15.841 --> 01:29:19.080
And so he got run off and it was like,
grow the hell up buddy.

1499
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:24.710
You know these guys win a hundred people are teasing you then probably they're

1500
01:29:25.891 --> 01:29:26.724
not wrong.

1501
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:34.830
You are getting teased like that as well.
Well,
when you,
when you,

1502
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.710
when you stop reacting,
it's no longer fun.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1503
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:42.200
Well it also gives you an opportunity to tease back.
It's like this,

1504
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.260
you can show your wit.

1505
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:45.900
And one of the things that working class guys in particular,

1506
01:29:45.901 --> 01:29:48.960
which is one of the things I really loved about working class jobs is there,

1507
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:51.750
they're always looking for some humor.
So it's like if,

1508
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:54.570
if person a is teasing person B,
that's kind of comical.

1509
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.130
But if person B comes back with a good comeback,
it's like,
that's even better.

1510
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:03.300
You know?
So I think that's a lot of how those jobs are rented.
Tolerable,
right?

1511
01:30:03.301 --> 01:30:07.220
It's their hard dirty jobs.
Dishwasher's a good example of that.

1512
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:11.910
It's not dangerous,
although cooking,
she's,
you know,
got to watch your step.

1513
01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.770
I got burned a lot when I was cooking.

1514
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:19.170
But what makes those jobs not only tolerable but even desirable,

1515
01:30:19.171 --> 01:30:22.590
is that you can develop a tremendous amount of camaraderie around them.

1516
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.490
I've never really experienced that at a professional level job that just doesn't

1517
01:30:26.491 --> 01:30:28.470
happen the same way.
And it's really,

1518
01:30:28.810 --> 01:30:31.980
there's a real loss and not so it's,
it's,

1519
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:35.520
it's fun to be part of a team that's doing,
you know,

1520
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:38.340
grubby hands on things and,

1521
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:42.180
and having a ridiculously entertaining,
vicious,

1522
01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:46.300
cruel and evil time while you're doing it.
That's very entertaining.
The,

1523
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:50.970
this new kids book I wrote,
So,
uh,
the kid mark,
he's getting made fun of by this.

1524
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:54.340
He's a different kind of bullies,
like a mental bullying that,

1525
01:30:54.341 --> 01:30:59.341
that verbally abuses people and he gets called plate face by this character and

1526
01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:05.220
to eventually it gets in trouble for throwing us something at the kid because

1527
01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:06.280
he's calling him plate face plate.

1528
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:09.540
But eventually the way he befriends the kid is by heat.

1529
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:12.390
They have to do a self portrait class and he draws a picture of himself looking

1530
01:31:12.391 --> 01:31:14.730
like a plate and he shows it again,
the kid laughs.

1531
01:31:14.731 --> 01:31:16.860
And all of a sudden their buddies.
And it's like that's what you do.

1532
01:31:16.861 --> 01:31:20.880
You take away that you take away the joy of,

1533
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.040
of being so he did and irritated by people that are making fun of you and you

1534
01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:28.550
just kill it.
Right?
She jujitsu in some sense.
Well,

1535
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.160
I had an experience with that about three years ago.

1536
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:36.510
I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying that I sounded like Kermit.

1537
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.840
And I thought,
well one person said it and I thought,
well,
whatever.

1538
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.390
But then like five people said it and I thought,
oh my God,

1539
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.540
like this Kermit thing.
So then I went and listened to Kermit and I thought,

1540
01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:50.280
oh no.
It's like,
really?
I really sound like Kermit,

1541
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:54.300
you know?
And so then,
well then I started to play with it a little bit.
You know,

1542
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.450
I used the puppet when I went away,

1543
01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.620
when I went to speak to university students and I made frog jokes and then I

1544
01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:03.250
made a video.
I mean a couple of videos that sort of featured me as a frog.

1545
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.480
And I mean,
it's crazy,
right?
It's ridiculous.
But,
but that's,
but,

1546
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:10.510
but the teasing never got mean because of that,
you know?

1547
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:14.620
And the same thing's happened online to a larger degree is people keep making

1548
01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:17.510
memes of me like,
and there's,
I don't know,
there's lots of them.

1549
01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.750
There's way too many to even keep track of.

1550
01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.450
And I was watching that happen and I thought,
okay,

1551
01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:25.060
this is a good thing because there's humor and wherever there's humor,

1552
01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:28.540
that's a good thing and they're making fun of me.
But it's gentle,
you know?

1553
01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:32.140
Most of it was pokey,
you know,
like,
well you sounded like this damn puppet.

1554
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.550
What do you think about?
It's like,
well,

1555
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:36.160
if I had to pick someone to sound like probably wouldn't be a puppet,

1556
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:39.910
but that'd be a puppet.
Kermit is not a bad one.
Could be a lot worse.

1557
01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:43.090
Like it could be Miss Peggy,
I couldn't be in that.
It also,

1558
01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:47.860
thank God that didn't happen.
But the memes have never got vicious because,

1559
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:48.821
you know,

1560
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:52.810
I'll post them if they're funny and satirical and then they won't get vicious

1561
01:32:52.811 --> 01:32:55.990
because they don't have to.
It's like,
can we poke fun at you?
It's like,
yeah,

1562
01:32:55.991 --> 01:33:00.100
please do and the more the better really because that'll also help keep my feet

1563
01:33:00.101 --> 01:33:04.120
on the ground and keep me awake and plus it's funny and like one of the things

1564
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:06.880
about life is that a sense of humor,

1565
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:11.440
that's a good thing to to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't

1566
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:15.040
have anything other than that.
Like my daughter,
when she recounts her,

1567
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.710
the horrors of her adolescence,
she,

1568
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.920
she had to have her hip and her ankle replaced because they both deteriorated

1569
01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:25.921
and beyond repair beyond the possibility of repair and she was like an agony for

1570
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.060
literally for years.
It was just awful.

1571
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.110
She can tell that story in a way that will just make you die of laughter and

1572
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:33.910
it's like,

1573
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:37.000
well thank God for that because what else do you have in a situation like that?

1574
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:37.960
Man,
if you,
if,

1575
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:42.280
and sometimes it's so dark that your sense of humor is just about gone and then

1576
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:43.180
you're in real trouble,

1577
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:47.260
but lots of times that's what you've got against the slings and Arrows of

1578
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:50.050
outrageous fortune.
It's like you see this with people,

1579
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.590
especially people who have been through really hard times and they were witty

1580
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:57.910
things.
There'll be bleak,
bleak,
bleak,
and they'll crack a joke and you think,

1581
01:33:57.911 --> 01:34:01.660
well thank God man,
you could pop up above that and see above it a bit and,

1582
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:06.610
and like,
you know,
tap it with a bit of irony and thank God for that.

1583
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:09.790
So when the comedian start to get silenced,
there's real trouble.

1584
01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:12.610
And that's been happening to some degree in Canada.
And you know,

1585
01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:16.520
comedians are increasingly not willing to go speak on university campuses say,

1586
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.480
and that's when the comedians can't talk.

1587
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.040
That's a really bad site because that's the,
that comedies,

1588
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:27.130
that's the triumph of the human spirit over adversity,
right?

1589
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:31.390
That's why guys in these horrible jobs are often so unbelievably funny.

1590
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:34.210
It's like,
well what else do they have?
You know,

1591
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:37.150
and actually that's a lot to be funny like that too.
That can,

1592
01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.130
that can move you through a lot of dismal.
So you know,

1593
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:45.520
I'm paying attention to the time cause I know in case someone can't tell if that

1594
01:34:45.521 --> 01:34:49.920
were by an airport right now.
But to kind of bring this a little bit too close,

1595
01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.270
first of all,
we didn't cover anything that I wanted to cover today,

1596
01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:55.740
so we should all know that I have to do that with my talks.

1597
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:59.390
Like oh that's not the talk I plan.
Well yeah,
your first biblical talk,

1598
01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:01.700
you covered the first line of Genesis,
right?

1599
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:06.170
I made it one line deep in two and a half hours.
Well done.
Well thought.

1600
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:07.850
But one of the things in it,

1601
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:11.490
and I think it's a good note to end on at least a little bit to touch on it

1602
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:14.900
because you're kind of talking about it right now is you know the last rule is

1603
01:35:14.901 --> 01:35:17.840
to to pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.
Yeah.

1604
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:23.710
It's basically find a little bit of joy in these common things when it's a

1605
01:35:24.921 --> 01:35:28.910
chapter about about my daughter's experience and like it was brutal man.

1606
01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.110
It was brutal.

1607
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:35.180
She was literally walking around on two broken legs for two years and she had to

1608
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:38.840
take incredibly high doses of opiates and so had all the problems that went

1609
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:41.570
along with that.
She had to take Ritalin to stay awake.
It's like,

1610
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.540
and she was in all likelihood she was dying.

1611
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:48.170
There's a bunch of reasons for that and those were just some of her health

1612
01:35:48.171 --> 01:35:52.220
problems.
Those,
those weren't even the worst ones strangely enough.

1613
01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.780
So it was bloody brutal man.
And one of the things we told her,

1614
01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.100
and we manage this thank God,
is I told her once the disease started to develop,

1615
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:03.410
she had rheumatoid arthritis very,
very seriously.

1616
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:06.920
I said to her when she was a little kid,
he said,
look kid,

1617
01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:09.360
this is going to be rough man.
This is going to be rough and,

1618
01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.570
and here's what you could do to make it worse.

1619
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:16.340
It's like use your illness as an excuse.
You do that at your peril.

1620
01:36:16.341 --> 01:36:17.780
You do that a hundred times.

1621
01:36:17.781 --> 01:36:21.590
You will not be able to tell the difference between suffering that stops you

1622
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:26.120
from moving forward and an excuse for not living.
And you'll be done.
Said,

1623
01:36:26.121 --> 01:36:30.380
never.
Never,
never use your illness as an excuse.

1624
01:36:30.381 --> 01:36:34.220
Like if you can't do it,
you can't do it.
You know,

1625
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:35.780
we had a good experience with that.

1626
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:40.730
It's written in the book when we bought her a scooter because she couldn't use

1627
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:43.850
public transportation and we were all freaked out about that because like,
well,

1628
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.920
she has damaged bones and you know,
a broken hip and all of this,

1629
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:50.540
like you're going to buy that kit a scooter.
Really?
It's like,
well,

1630
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.970
what are you going to do to keep her in her bedroom?

1631
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.150
He won't think that's a good idea.
Tell her she can't go out in the world.

1632
01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.980
It's like have the damn scooter.
So after a while she had to get licensed for it.

1633
01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.260
There's a licensing procedure and to do that,

1634
01:37:03.261 --> 01:37:06.950
she actually had to ride a motorbike and so she trained to ride the motorbike

1635
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:11.390
like not very long after she had her hip replaced,
I think it was six weeks,

1636
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:12.830
something like that too.
Of course,

1637
01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:15.260
we're all freaked out about that too because it's like,
oh man,

1638
01:37:15.261 --> 01:37:18.020
she has to ride a motorbike and she has this hip.
And it's like,

1639
01:37:18.021 --> 01:37:21.980
what are we going to do?
And she went and she did the motorcycle left first one,

1640
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:26.480
but she dropped the bike a couple of times and some kid wiped out and rolled

1641
01:37:26.481 --> 01:37:29.420
like 30 feet and that kind of freaked her out,
unsurprisingly.
And,

1642
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:33.410
and so then the second day she went with her mom to do the motorcycle training.

1643
01:37:33.411 --> 01:37:36.620
She also got trained to ride a motorcycle.
And,
uh,

1644
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:40.820
the second day she woke up and she said,
I don't think I can do this.

1645
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.060
And we thought,
well,
you know,
that's understandable.
It's like,

1646
01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.900
I can understand that.
And we talked through it and we said,
look,

1647
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:50.960
here's what to do,
man is like,
yeah,
you can't do it.

1648
01:37:50.961 --> 01:37:55.070
We understand why you're afraid of it.
You can't hold the bike up that well.
Um,

1649
01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.850
but
why don't you just go,

1650
01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.230
like go in the car with your mom and see how you feel when you get there,

1651
01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:04.990
because you'll get close and you get right up to it.

1652
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:08.110
Maybe you can say no and you have to sit in the car and like,

1653
01:38:08.111 --> 01:38:11.590
that's life and we get it,
but maybe you don't have to.

1654
01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:13.930
And she went there so she thought that was okay.

1655
01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.860
And she went there and she picked up the damn motorbike and got her license and

1656
01:38:17.861 --> 01:38:19.090
everybody cheered at the end.

1657
01:38:19.091 --> 01:38:21.310
And then she could drive her God damn scooter around.

1658
01:38:21.311 --> 01:38:23.800
And thank God for that because you know,

1659
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:26.740
she used to go out there and she put on her helmet and she'd go on her scooter

1660
01:38:26.741 --> 01:38:31.000
and she was like ready to go up in the world.
And so that's like,

1661
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:34.660
that's the difference between making your kids safe and making them strong.

1662
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.700
And it was touching bloody go.
You know,

1663
01:38:36.701 --> 01:38:39.550
cause it could have easily been that she would have been in a little accident

1664
01:38:39.551 --> 01:38:42.100
with her motorcycle and broken her leg and then,
and we would have thought,
oh,

1665
01:38:42.101 --> 01:38:43.660
what kind of horrible parents are.
We,

1666
01:38:43.661 --> 01:38:47.560
she's already got problems and we put her on a damn scooter in the middle of the

1667
01:38:47.561 --> 01:38:52.090
city.
It's like,
well,
you're going to be competent,
are you going to be safe?

1668
01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:56.350
It's like there's nothing safer than competence.
And so,

1669
01:38:56.351 --> 01:38:59.740
and it was great for her because it was just one more act of courage,
you know,

1670
01:38:59.741 --> 01:39:01.960
and,
and it,
and she loved that Damn Scooter.

1671
01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:06.640
She had it for like six years and it was a really good idea.
Risky as hell,

1672
01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:07.780
but really a good idea.

1673
01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:13.070
<v 3>So,
yeah.
Well,
yeah,
again,
I'm looking at the clock.</v>

1674
01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.070
We've got to get you out of here.
Um,
first of all,

1675
01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.130
12 rules for life.
Um,

1676
01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.460
an antidote to chaos that's out right now.

1677
01:39:22.730 --> 01:39:26.990
It's number one on Amazon in America,
UK,

1678
01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.320
Canada,
everywhere.
That's pretty awesome.
I'm,
I'm,

1679
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:36.350
I'm uh,
yeah struck wordless by it.
Yeah.

1680
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:39.080
Yeah.
Everyone should just get it.
Um,

1681
01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:43.010
and because we didn't talk about anything I wanted to talk about today,

1682
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:45.380
will you come back?

1683
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:48.260
We'll do this book and everyone likes to read the books if I can,

1684
01:39:48.261 --> 01:39:50.150
if they can before I do the podcast on them.

1685
01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:53.080
So this will give everyone a chance to read it,
which will be awesome.
Uh,

1686
01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.380
any other things?

1687
01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:54.821
<v 4>Well,</v>

1688
01:39:54.821 --> 01:39:59.821
I should say I've got this online program called self authoring and uh,

1689
01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.930
I'm offering your viewers a end listeners,

1690
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:06.760
a 20% discount that helps you write out and autobiographies so you can figure

1691
01:40:06.761 --> 01:40:09.760
out like what you haven't sorted out about your life.

1692
01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:14.050
It helps you write an analysis of your virtues and faults so you can rectify the

1693
01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:17.440
faults and capitalize on the virtues and helps you make a plan for the future.

1694
01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:19.630
And I would say to your listeners,

1695
01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:24.280
don't be afraid to do it badly because a bad plan,

1696
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.350
a bad account for yourself and a bad plan is way better than no account for

1697
01:40:29.351 --> 01:40:34.090
yourself and no plan.
It's way better.
So do it.
Do it badly.
It'll,

1698
01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.520
it'll help orient you in your life.

1699
01:40:36.521 --> 01:40:40.000
And we have a preponderance of,

1700
01:40:40.690 --> 01:40:43.690
of scientific data showing,
for example,

1701
01:40:43.691 --> 01:40:46.120
that people who've done the future authoring portion of this,

1702
01:40:46.121 --> 01:40:50.290
that's the plan are like 30% more likely to stay in university,

1703
01:40:50.410 --> 01:40:54.580
has an overwhelming effect and it works best people who are doing worst,

1704
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.460
which is really quite cool.
So there's that.

1705
01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:02.461
I have a personality test@understandmyself.com and you can go there and get an

1706
01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:06.640
analysis of 10 aspects of your personality.
It's kind of a harsh test.

1707
01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:10.960
Like it'll tell you actually what you're like and it'll probably make you angry,

1708
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:15.700
you know,
because maybe not,
but it probably will,
but it'll tell you,

1709
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.550
it'll help you figure out what jobs you might be suited for,

1710
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:22.000
but it'll also tell you where you're weak and could be stronger.

1711
01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:26.560
And so that's bitter medicine.
But um,
but it's better to know.

1712
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:29.260
It's better to know because then you can do something about it.

1713
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:34.560
So I would say those are two useful things and I'd encourage people to their

1714
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:39.370
inexpensive,
give them a try,
they'll,
they're helpful.

1715
01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.100
<v 5>And on top of that,
you've got your podcast.
Yup.
You've got your youtube channel,</v>

1716
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:50.250
which has hundreds of hours worth of lectures and is fantastic.

1717
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:56.020
Jordan peterson.com as well and well,

1718
01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:59.830
I just wanted to thank you for coming on the podcast again,
but more important.

1719
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.890
I want to thank you for continuing to do what you do.

1720
01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.140
I know it's hard work and I know it's taxing on you and on your family life and

1721
01:42:08.141 --> 01:42:09.940
all that.
Yeah,
it beats suffering.

1722
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:14.941
Stupidly does and I know for a fact that you're having an incredibly positive

1723
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:17.710
impact all over the world.

1724
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:22.030
Getting people everywhere to try to at least grow the hell lie,

1725
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.850
grow the hell up,
grow up to speak the truth,

1726
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:30.730
make themselves and make their buy the world a better place.

1727
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:33.330
<v 4>Wouldn't that be good?
It couldn't be a better place.</v>

1728
01:42:33.331 --> 01:42:36.030
That would be good if we could manage that.
Yeah,
indeed.

1729
01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.270
<v 5>Thanks for coming on the bed.
Well,</v>

1730
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:44.140
we have excused Dr. Jordan Peterson from the,

1731
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.270
is this a recording studio?
No,
we're in a rented office space shift.
Make shift.

1732
01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.650
Jordan had to go catch a plane and

1733
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.060
continue to get out there and make the world a better place.
Good for him.

1734
01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:02.710
Good for us.
And Echo.
Speaking of making the world a better place,

1735
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:09.810
maybe you can let us know how we might be able to make our world a little bit

1736
01:43:10.091 --> 01:43:13.030
better.
Sure,
of course.
Yeah.

1737
01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:17.740
First thing we can do is stay on the path.

1738
01:43:18.130 --> 01:43:18.963
Oh.

1739
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:23.990
And part of staying on the path is maintaining our physical capability and

1740
01:43:24.251 --> 01:43:27.340
competent copy.
Competency.
Competency.

1741
01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.540
Is it competence or competence?
Tints.
See,
competency.

1742
01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:35.320
We're going to maintain that.
That's what we're going to do on the path.

1743
01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:39.280
So we had chocolate supplements.

1744
01:43:39.281 --> 01:43:44.090
Obviously we already know if you don't know Krill oil,
joint warfare.

1745
01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:45.760
So Jocko,
Super Krill oil.

1746
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:49.840
That's a Krill oil supplement joint where warfare is the glucosamine.

1747
01:43:49.841 --> 01:43:53.420
Can Drayton and curcumin.
Yes.

1748
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:57.110
Very good things for your joints.
Um,
we,
you know,

1749
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:01.760
at some point we'll go through everything that's in there.
Yeah.
Not Today.
Yeah.

1750
01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.330
We'll do something so that,
cause I don't wanna sit here and talk about,

1751
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:10.230
but it's good.
Yeah,
it's good.
Use it.
Yeah.
I use it the,

1752
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:15.730
and it's not the kind where it's good because it's generally healthy to take

1753
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:19.280
these things,
which it is,
but that's not the,
the main

1754
01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.480
push in my opinion.
Check.

1755
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.280
The main thing is that if your joints are kind of kind of off Jack,

1756
01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:32.240
like soar,
do Jujitsu a lot to anything.
Brought a few.

1757
01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:38.180
If you do
brick laying,

1758
01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:41.930
what does that Mason Mason if you're um,
yeah,
like just from you know,

1759
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.160
back elbows and then you'd start taking this,

1760
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:50.240
you'll see that you'll feel that difference specifically.
Yeah.

1761
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.900
And as a generally healthy anyway,
maintain the joints,

1762
01:44:53.901 --> 01:44:58.220
maintain the competency of your joints with Jocko,

1763
01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:03.200
super krill joint warfare.
Take them every day.
That's what I do in the routine.

1764
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.300
Also discipline preworkout it's a pre workout for me.
It's,

1765
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.320
it's a pre mission for me.
It's a pre mission.

1766
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:13.180
She straight up progression cognitive enhancer.
Yeah.

1767
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:17.810
And I'll tell you the only downfall of it right now,
while there's a couple,

1768
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.000
number one,
it tastes delicious.
So you want to drink a lot of it.

1769
01:45:21.090 --> 01:45:22.420
Dale the other day,

1770
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:26.680
I drank a lot of it and then I had to go and give a speech.
Yeah.

1771
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:31.350
I had to use the restroom right before I went on stage with John.
I'm like,
yes.

1772
01:45:31.410 --> 01:45:36.050
Be careful.
Well,
that's a general thing.
It doesn't have to be juggled.
Discipline.

1773
01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.470
You can do that with water.
Tearful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want to be careful with,

1774
01:45:39.471 --> 01:45:43.840
didn't you eat some of it?
Like,
oh,
can we use that?
Ate some of it today.
It's,
see,

1775
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:48.730
I'll be trying to avoid that.
And again,
it just took a mouth.
A little scoop.
Yeah.

1776
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:52.090
And it's not too bad.
In fact,
you know what,
uh,

1777
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.470
you know when you get like a shot of some really nasty alcohol and keep her do

1778
01:45:57.471 --> 01:46:01.970
it.
Sure.
But it gives you like a little hook.
Yeah,
sure.
That.

1779
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:05.870
Where do you take just the straight powder,
which I'm now doing.

1780
01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:09.680
Apparently it's gives you a little bit,
it gives you a little,

1781
01:46:09.710 --> 01:46:13.040
not only you get the,
the effects of what's in it,
but you get a little bit of a,

1782
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:16.820
the main line deal.
Yeah.
That's kind of like,
yeah.
When you're a kid,

1783
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:19.720
you buy the little Koolaid,
you know when you,
before you make the Koolaid.
Yeah,

1784
01:46:19.730 --> 01:46:20.630
you get like a little,

1785
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:24.860
you try that stuff straight and kind of what it's like only it's not quite as

1786
01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:29.720
horrible as that.
Better than that.
It's better than Kuleana.
Oh yeah,

1787
01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:31.820
definitely better than Cruz.
Good Jocko made it taste good.

1788
01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.020
He's into the tastes good stuff.
Anyway.
It's called De Jong Disa.

1789
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.230
It's called discipline called.
You'll see it anyway.

1790
01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:44.260
get@originmain.com and also@originmean.com you get,

1791
01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:47.210
that's where he can get your geek,

1792
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.170
so you don't that I want to give him still ask me what Geek get.
No,

1793
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.600
don't ask anymore.
No,
no,
no.
As good.
I'll tell you.

1794
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:57.750
He'll tell you and this is what I'll tell you.
Go to origin,
pick from there,

1795
01:46:57.751 --> 01:47:00.950
whichever one you want.
Plenty of color and a planning colors but did legit.

1796
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.710
You have white.
I have one blue Gucci that had never used.

1797
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.730
All I have is white.
I have a black gay.

1798
01:47:09.731 --> 01:47:12.750
Someone gave me a black gay and that's cool,
but I've never used it.

1799
01:47:12.751 --> 01:47:17.610
But because a lot of people ask me that too.
What color should I get?
Yeah,

1800
01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.780
what color should you get?
I am very traditional and I used the white gay,

1801
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:25.600
but I do have a deaf guy that's black.
I guess he's on,

1802
01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.980
but some schools they don't even allow other colors then white and blue.

1803
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:33.240
That's true.
But Pete says black is,

1804
01:47:33.241 --> 01:47:37.560
that is the number one seller don't care.
Like if just all colors blend.

1805
01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:42.540
Now can you compete Ibj GF with a black guy.
I don't know.
I forget.

1806
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:45.060
But here's what we were talking about.

1807
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.750
When you're a little kid and you think about martial arts,

1808
01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:51.840
what do you want to be the Ninja?
You want to be a Ninja?

1809
01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:57.820
You got a 36 year old guy or a 28 year old guy and he finally,

1810
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.650
he's feeling kind of Ninja man is doing the Jujitsu.

1811
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:06.670
You can take that one extra step and he's got a black geek boom Ninja in a,

1812
01:48:06.671 --> 01:48:08.420
in a matter of speaking.
Yeah.
And I,

1813
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:12.420
I actually felt that that's part of the reason why I don't get a black key cause

1814
01:48:12.421 --> 01:48:14.040
I,
I kind of wanted like,

1815
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:17.430
not like there's a Charles Bronson movie feathers.

1816
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.630
What do you mean an old Charles Bronson movie called the mechanic?
Yeah,

1817
01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:22.560
there's a,

1818
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:27.560
there's a scene where the traditional karate guy is going to fight a guy that's

1819
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:32.990
got some new tricks up his sleeve and the traditional karate guy has to get nuts

1820
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:38.550
on him,
but he's in the,
just a plain white t,
eh?
Yeah,
that's the tradition.

1821
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:43.170
And Charles Bronson to,
yeah.
So I'm just,
you know,
yeah.
And in the line,

1822
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.760
strangely,
I mainly stick to white because it's kind of,
that's the,
the main,

1823
01:48:47.761 --> 01:48:49.800
like I'm not doing too much with the,

1824
01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.160
with the cool black one because let's face it,
the,
the black one,

1825
01:48:53.161 --> 01:48:56.520
like you said about being a Ninja and it looks cool but does it looks really

1826
01:48:56.521 --> 01:49:01.200
cool and,
but I didn't want to roll in and be like,
and they think,

1827
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:03.930
well look where you feel real cool with your black geek kind of being,

1828
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.320
even though the thing is,
I think it's progressed beyond that.
It's totally,

1829
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:10.560
it's beyond that.
Now.
You are not,

1830
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.630
you are not standing out at all and you have a wacky now you might be,

1831
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:19.950
if you go to a traditional,
you know,
school that has only white geese.
Yeah,

1832
01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:22.050
you're going to stand out.
You come into victory,
MMA and fitness.

1833
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:23.610
You could be wearing a purple.
You,
no one's going to care.

1834
01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.700
No one's even looking at your second camouflage.
No one cares.
You might be like,

1835
01:49:26.701 --> 01:49:29.030
Dang,
that's a cool camouflage game that might say that.

1836
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.960
Just put a choke hold on your and get after it.

1837
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:37.320
So there it is.
I would say if they're saying,
Hey Jocko,

1838
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:42.060
echo what?
Gee,
should I get,
what color should I get?
We know origin.

1839
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.650
What color should I get a ask your school first.
Because some they don't allow,

1840
01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:50.750
you ain't gonna buy your cool black gay or there's like a army green ways.

1841
01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.740
Their army green one.
Yeah,

1842
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.300
you're going to buy it and they looked dope and you're solid.
You're ready to go.

1843
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:57.610
And you come in and they say you can't train with that.
You can't have that.

1844
01:49:57.611 --> 01:50:02.470
So ask your school first.
If they allow our colors then owns up to Uga.

1845
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:03.500
Yeah,
but,

1846
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.690
but the the point is with asking what color is that?

1847
01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:09.790
I think I think that they're like,
hey,

1848
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:14.350
is there like a violation if I get this cool black one and you answered it.
Yeah.

1849
01:50:14.351 --> 01:50:18.220
Now No,
no.
Unless your school does,
it's literally no factor.

1850
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.400
Literally no factor.
So they've got a lot anyway.

1851
01:50:21.401 --> 01:50:26.401
Origin mean.com that's where you get them also on it.com/jocko this is where I

1852
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:31.500
get
the kettle bells,

1853
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.960
the dope kettle bells.
You didn't talk about rash,
rash guards.
Oh at origin.
Yeah.

1854
01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.740
Yeah.
And because the reason that popped into my mind,

1855
01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.960
because they have spots now cause they have spats now.

1856
01:50:43.290 --> 01:50:48.290
The first run us bats are green and like some other color.

1857
01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.830
Yellow or green.
Yeah.
Right.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Don't worry.

1858
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:57.710
I sent Peter text now I'm not a gust.
Fats wearing dude.
I,
I'm not wearing tights.

1859
01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.860
Not Happening.
She's no sir.
Nothing against people that do.
There some,

1860
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:04.170
there's some crazy,
you did two guys out there that are wearing tights.

1861
01:51:04.171 --> 01:51:08.880
Like you read about the amen.
I said as it,
I said,
Hey Pete,

1862
01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.440
I'm not wearing tights.
Yeah,

1863
01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:14.880
I know a lot of people that do make some black ones or something else.
Yeah,

1864
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:19.950
he's got it.
Yeah.
So you can get,
obviously the rash guards are good to go.

1865
01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:21.930
Yeah.
But now you can also get

1866
01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.133
<v 1>okay</v>

1867
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:26.800
<v 5>spots that are not,
so we're sticking with spats,</v>

1868
01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:30.160
spats when we figured out the root of stats right here were dope.
Yeah.

1869
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:33.530
It's a good thing.
Yeah.
I thought it would route back to you know,

1870
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:38.110
some Ballerina,
some ballerina thing.
No,
it's war.
Yeah.

1871
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:42.130
It's where you were born,
your legs.
When you were off cavalry men.
Yup.
Yeah.

1872
01:51:42.131 --> 01:51:45.980
So we can say spats.
It's been approved yet.
The whole the same thing.
Yeah.

1873
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:50.050
It's you,
you tape your shoe and you're so we're good ankle.
Yeah.

1874
01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.630
Fully interesting color choice.
Yeah.
The first one.

1875
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:56.040
Here's the thing though about this fats.
Yeah.

1876
01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:01.690
Some colors you don't see like eat,
like if I was like,
Hey,

1877
01:52:01.691 --> 01:52:05.500
I'm,
I'm gonna wear this lime green and yellow thing,
whatever shirt,
spats,

1878
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:09.190
whatever.
And you'd be like,
lime green,
yellow.
That just doesn't even sound good.

1879
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:11.680
I'm looking at these two colors.
I don't think that's going to look good.

1880
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:14.590
But then you put it on a shirt or spots or something and then you put it on,

1881
01:52:14.591 --> 01:52:16.870
you're like,
oh Dang.
That kind of works for some reason.

1882
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:18.850
I'm not saying lame greening yellow does that.

1883
01:52:18.851 --> 01:52:22.360
I'm just saying certain color combinations.
Here's the interesting thing.

1884
01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:27.550
Pete's my bro,
right?
Sure.
Yeah.
My need to leave with the first time I had her,

1885
01:52:27.690 --> 01:52:31.810
um,
uh,
Skype conversation with Pete [inaudible].
My wife was like,

1886
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.590
it sounded like you were talking to yourself.
Yeah.

1887
01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:38.700
And when I was a four hour conversation,
by the way.
Now with that,

1888
01:52:38.701 --> 01:52:39.670
that being said,

1889
01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:43.810
I wouldn't have made spots that look like the first bath he had came out with in

1890
01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:48.650
a million years.
Now.
Now here's the funny thing.
I can't even say,

1891
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:52.610
I can't even say,
Hey Pete,
don't you know?
No one's gonna like those.
You know why?

1892
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:54.890
Because my sense of fashion,
yeah.

1893
01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:58.870
Is so off of fashion is nonexistent.

1894
01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:04.190
It's literally non existent if you even had one.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's right.
Well,

1895
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:06.260
no,
it's not existent.
Yeah.
If you had fun,

1896
01:53:06.261 --> 01:53:09.890
it would be get it and it's like double nones.
Yeah.
Well,

1897
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.320
so that's why I can't even say,
hey Pete,

1898
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:14.840
I can't say I can't make a blanket statement like Pete.

1899
01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:19.970
It's people won't like those.
Yeah.
I can't even say that because I have no idea.

1900
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:25.190
So I just said,
what I do know is people would definitely like some black ones,

1901
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:29.560
right?
Yeah.
That's pretty safe to say.
So yeah.
Yeah.
That's that.

1902
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.920
I don't mind the Greenland by the way,
but even we've had this stuff,

1903
01:53:33.921 --> 01:53:37.430
we've had issues like this where you make things that I just don't,
yeah,

1904
01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:40.770
unapproved.
Not,
yeah,
they're on approved or unapproved across the board.
Yeah.

1905
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:44.780
But I just know you just kind of just don't know and I say,
okay.
You know,

1906
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:47.540
I don't know.
That's,
I gotta stay humble over here.
Yeah.

1907
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.480
I can't claim to claim to have any,

1908
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:55.310
any flooding to stand on at all when it comes to fashion,

1909
01:53:55.390 --> 01:54:00.050
but any kind and haircuts.
I'm pretty good with those.
You know what?
Yeah,
sure.

1910
01:54:00.051 --> 01:54:01.980
If your head,
I agree.
Next question.

1911
01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:05.720
So yeah,
again,

1912
01:54:05.721 --> 01:54:08.690
or do you mean.com there's a lot of cool stuff on these hoodies and stuff too,

1913
01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:12.530
by the way,
which,
and this is a,

1914
01:54:12.531 --> 01:54:15.650
this is a buy it and not biased.
What do you call it?
Subjective.

1915
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:20.360
When I was wearing the full origin sweat suit,
I don't,

1916
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:25.340
I laid down on the couch,
just took a break or whatever.
No,

1917
01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.050
I don't normally do that till the break from what?
Cruising,
you know,

1918
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.590
doing whatever it is I was doing.
Took a break,
lay down on the couch,

1919
01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:35.450
full sweat suit on origin.

1920
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:40.930
It was the most comfortable moment I had in recent memory and just so everyone

1921
01:54:42.081 --> 01:54:42.381
knows,

1922
01:54:42.381 --> 01:54:46.560
if you're talking about echoes comfort levels that are already existing bi,

1923
01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.360
it saved our lives.
I know that,
you know comfort.

1924
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:54.200
I know about it and very familiar with it and yeah,
it was not saying a lot,

1925
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:58.250
so yeah,
there it is.
Okay.
Backed on it.
The kettle bells that I get,

1926
01:54:58.430 --> 01:55:03.300
the whole set all muscles that
primal bills,

1927
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:07.100
Zombie bills,
legend bills,

1928
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.860
they're the kettlebells.
That's where you get them on a.com/jocko also.

1929
01:55:12.861 --> 01:55:17.540
They got some cool Macy's on there.
Jeff was the Mace,
right?
I do,

1930
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:21.650
yeah.
Pounder.
You think 20 pounds is not heavy.

1931
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:23.560
It's heavy.
Yeah.

1932
01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:29.180
That's one of those things and we kind of talked about it before where you wait

1933
01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:33.250
like wait like this many pounds or kilos,
whatever prior to,

1934
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:35.690
it's not all created equal,

1935
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:40.810
like if it's shaped in a certain form or formulas or whatever.

1936
01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:44.880
Right.
It's way different.
Like my daughter,
I forget how I forget.

1937
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:45.930
How much do you do in ways now,

1938
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:48.230
like 53 pounds or something like that to be pounds.

1939
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:51.360
Nothing as far as lifting for she lifted.
Yeah.

1940
01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:54.370
Trey lift hurt when she don't want to be lifted.
Right.
She was like,

1941
01:55:55.130 --> 01:55:59.250
she is a good piece to like hundred 50 pounds.
Nonetheless.

1942
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.750
The point there is with these Mesas and there's all this cool stuff on there.

1943
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:05.400
If you want to vary up your workout,

1944
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:10.410
make an interesting unlike was workup,
make it make yours interesting.

1945
01:56:10.411 --> 01:56:11.490
If you want to do that,
you don't have to.

1946
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:14.850
There's some really good stuff on there.
Check them out and you know,

1947
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:16.500
if you want something,
get something.

1948
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:22.100
Also when you get Jordan Peterson's 12 rules

1949
01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:28.320
just called 12 rule,
12 rules,
travelers for life,
an antidote to chaos.

1950
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.370
Jordan B.
Peterson.

1951
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:34.200
It's 12 rules for life is like,

1952
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:39.600
it seems like a big claim,
you know?
Yeah.
But they're pretty,
they're pretty solid.

1953
01:56:39.601 --> 01:56:44.000
Pretty solid.
Yeah.
Follow the salt nonetheless that uh,
that is a good one.
Um,

1954
01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:48.450
when you get down and any of the,
any of the other books,
don't worry,

1955
01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:51.270
I organized them off or you go to Jocko podcast.

1956
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:54.960
Somebody said the other day on the Internet,
he said to me,
Oh,

1957
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.220
you should have a book club.

1958
01:56:56.730 --> 01:57:01.730
We got a book club going to Jocko podcast.com and click on books.

1959
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:03.960
All the books are there.
That's the club right there.

1960
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:08.940
Don't have to ask me about the book club.
The books are there.
Alright,
yeah,
idea.

1961
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:12.570
We've got to organize for you by episode.
By the way,
a little brief description.

1962
01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:15.810
Click on there.
Boom.
Get your book from there.

1963
01:57:15.811 --> 01:57:17.850
It's a good way to support ticks to Amazon.

1964
01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:22.920
You can get your book if you are doing other shopping.
Hey,
carry on.

1965
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:25.590
Just do your thing.
No one's going to stop you from that of course,

1966
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:29.790
and that supports the podcast.
Good way to support small action.
Big Reaction.

1967
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:34.680
Also,
subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
That one seems obvious.

1968
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.310
I know,

1969
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:40.310
but it's a good way to support just a little good way to support view of funny

1970
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.250
review.
I'm go like once a week.

1971
01:57:44.251 --> 01:57:48.060
Now I go and read all the new reviews for gems.

1972
01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:52.740
There's some gems in there.
She has freed up gyms.
Yeah,

1973
01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:55.860
if you feel like it.
Um,
yeah.
So,
so subscribe,
rate,

1974
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:58.770
review and subscribe to Youtube.
We have a youtube channel.

1975
01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:02.040
If you didn't know that already,
um,

1976
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:07.020
that's where the video version of this podcast resides.
You liked that.

1977
01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.710
These eyes,
good job.
Also excerpts on there.

1978
01:58:10.711 --> 01:58:12.300
If you don't listen or watch,

1979
01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:17.240
should I say the whole episode or episodes,
got some excerpts on that.

1980
01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:21.210
You can just watch a little,
you know,
little excerpts,

1981
01:58:21.211 --> 01:58:24.960
little tidbits of the podcast,
a little ideas,
little lessons,

1982
01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:29.970
tips of advice,
shorter form.
You know,
when you take a break at work or whatever,

1983
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:34.860
check.
Not that you should be watching youtube at work,
but if you are,

1984
01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:38.310
you watch this,
boom,
get back to work more effective.
Probably.

1985
01:58:39.330 --> 01:58:42.210
Probably also some other stuff on there.
I'm going to,

1986
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:46.060
we're going to try to slowly add more and more,
which is to say content,

1987
01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:48.340
not just for the sake of adding content by the way,

1988
01:58:49.670 --> 01:58:53.710
because I make videos from time to time,
very spaced out.

1989
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:58.720
You know,
I'm trying to get them done.
Then the lessons we're going to put more,

1990
01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:01.310
there's going to be more and more on their to new year.
Right.

1991
01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.500
Well it's February now cause cheap bro.

1992
01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:10.910
Anyway,
moving on.
Also Jack was a store,
it's called Jocko store.

1993
01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.680
Jocko store.com

1994
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:19.870
that this is the website online store where you can get discipline equals

1995
01:59:22.701 --> 01:59:26.200
freedom shirts,
rash guards,

1996
01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:30.820
the victory MMA and fitness shirt that Jocko always wears.

1997
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.480
Like Einstein by the way.
I think and Stan were the same thing everyday too.

1998
01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.510
Is that why you do it?
No,
I do it cause it's simple.

1999
01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:41.110
Not Because Einstein does it actually they say that this is you and Einstein

2000
01:59:41.111 --> 01:59:43.870
where the same thing every day for the same reason is what they say less

2001
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:48.430
decisionmaking.
Yeah,
cause your decision making,
you know,
resources.

2002
01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:50.440
I don't really believe all that.
I just believe,

2003
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.830
I don't feel like sitting around thinking about what I'm gonna wear in the

2004
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:55.870
morning just so I have a shirt drawer.
Guess what I said?
Sure.
It's pulling out.

2005
01:59:55.871 --> 01:59:59.010
Put It on,
right.
You have bigger things to make decisions about and think about.

2006
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:03.580
That's exactly what I'm saying.
And that's what I read too.
So you guys,

2007
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:08.170
you and Einstein are like,
I don't want to say obsessed.
You're like,

2008
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:12.590
you're just real into
more important things.

2009
02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:14.810
So what you wear,
that's that.
That's,

2010
02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:18.740
that shouldn't take up too many of your decision making resources.

2011
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:22.580
The thing about Jocko store,
yeah.
I don't know if you've ever made this clear.

2012
02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:26.780
Well,
maybe you have,
but if you want to support the podcast,

2013
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:29.000
that's a good way to support the podcast for a while.

2014
02:00:29.001 --> 02:00:33.350
People want us to do a thing where you donate money.
Yeah.
And I said,

2015
02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.290
well no,
people want to support that.

2016
02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:40.640
We're not going to ask for money and give them nothing.
Yeah.

2017
02:00:41.150 --> 02:00:45.560
We'll give them something,
a tee shirt.
A hat.
A sticker.
Yeah.
Good stuff.

2018
02:00:45.561 --> 02:00:48.380
By the way,
it's about the shirt that makes the man,

2019
02:00:48.381 --> 02:00:53.000
it's the man that makes this shirt.
So okay.
There you go.

2020
02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:57.560
Nonetheless there are and that cause you're the one that makes these shirts make

2021
02:00:57.570 --> 02:01:01.280
it so it's a different thing.
I think I saw it on the movie.

2022
02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.320
Uh Oh was it the one with Sean Connery and Catherine said Catherine Zeta Jones

2023
02:01:06.561 --> 02:01:11.300
and you know I remember they had to steal something.
Continue by email.

2024
02:01:11.301 --> 02:01:14.960
What movie I'm talking about.
Anyway,
there's some hoodies on there.

2025
02:01:14.961 --> 02:01:17.690
Some hats on there were restocking.

2026
02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:21.200
Actually I'm doing a thing because the people email cause you know there stuff

2027
02:01:21.201 --> 02:01:24.650
out of stock and guess what?
Not never again.

2028
02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.640
I'm hesitant to say,
never say never,
but yeah,
never again.
Okay.

2029
02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:33.260
So everything is in stock right now.

2030
02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.420
Not necessarily come back when you're ready.
Okay.
Any time.

2031
02:01:38.421 --> 02:01:43.421
Just keeping your lane that I'm working on is all very close to being complete.

2032
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:47.480
Okay.
So there'd be available and some new stuff's going to be on there.

2033
02:01:47.690 --> 02:01:52.690
Also rash guards on there for Jujitsu or for anything physical,

2034
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:55.340
you know you're doing physically.
Do you want to keep your range of motion,

2035
02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.400
you know,
whatever.
Anyway.
You know what?
Rash guards,
they're,

2036
02:01:57.401 --> 02:01:58.400
I think they're pretty dope.

2037
02:01:59.290 --> 02:02:04.290
I'm also women's stuff on there and I am not saying,

2038
02:02:04.521 --> 02:02:07.850
I say this a lot.
Let me say it again.
I'm not saying buy something.

2039
02:02:07.851 --> 02:02:11.510
I'm thing going there.
Just look.
If you don't want anything,
didn't,

2040
02:02:11.511 --> 02:02:14.120
don't get something,
but if you do on something,
get something.

2041
02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:18.370
It's a good way to support also.
That's really a deep,
you know,

2042
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:23.030
I'm trying to keep,
you know,
if you want something,
get something.

2043
02:02:23.031 --> 02:02:26.240
If you don't want something don't.
Yeah.
All right,
cool.
We'll abide by that.

2044
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:29.660
Is it kind of like,
you know how like when people say it is what it is

2045
02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:35.500
there,
you know what to say.
Hey,
it is what it is.
Yes.

2046
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:39.890
[inaudible] not going to be anyone but Jocko.
Jocko was Jockos through,
right.

2047
02:02:39.930 --> 02:02:42.650
Same thing.
Then why do you say that?
You know kind of,

2048
02:02:42.810 --> 02:02:44.090
I say that for the same reason.

2049
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:49.610
Also psychological warfare.
If you didn't know what that is,

2050
02:02:49.611 --> 02:02:53.840
it's an album with tracks.
Jocko tracks,
not Jocko,

2051
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:57.860
plenty Ukulele or the violin or what else do you play?
Violin.

2052
02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:01.190
I can't really play the drums too well either.
Yeah,

2053
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:05.750
but you play stuff nonetheless.
It's none of that.
It's Jocko to giving you,

2054
02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.530
so each track is jock a Jockos.
How should I say?

2055
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:12.260
Tips that really tips.

2056
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.700
They're kind of tips on how to eliminate the weakness that you're feeling at any

2057
02:03:16.701 --> 02:03:21.530
given moment on your path,
on your campaign,
on the campaign against weakness.

2058
02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:25.790
That's what it is.
So if you're about to skip your workout because a,

2059
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:28.460
you don't feel like it be,

2060
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:31.370
you don't think you have time or something like this,

2061
02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:35.630
or usually it's because you don't feel like it because you worked out yesterday,

2062
02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:40.340
your kind of sore,
like you were going to do squats today,

2063
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:44.510
but you did a bunch of burpees yesterday,
suit lower back,

2064
02:03:44.511 --> 02:03:49.040
and your quads,
they're kind of sore.
So you're like,

2065
02:03:49.041 --> 02:03:51.140
maybe I'll just do it tomorrow.
No.
So all you gotta do,

2066
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:56.000
but in psychological warfare,
listen to isn't.

2067
02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.130
There's a track for that and he'll,

2068
02:03:58.131 --> 02:04:00.650
he'll just explain just in his own little Jocko way,

2069
02:04:01.130 --> 02:04:02.510
explain why you shouldn't do that,

2070
02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:06.020
why you should just do the workout and after you listen to it,
you'll be like,

2071
02:04:06.021 --> 02:04:07.820
Dang,
that makes sense.
And guess what?
Boom.

2072
02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:11.510
All of a sudden you're doing the workout.
You didn't skip it.
It's what you do.

2073
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.681
If you like that,

2074
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:17.681
you can also get discipline equals freedom field manual on iTunes,

2075
02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:22.100
Amazon music,
Google play,
other MP3 platforms.
It's not on audible.

2076
02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.930
It's not on honorable.
It's available as an album.

2077
02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.230
Actually two albums.
Also,
you can get Jocko white tea,

2078
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:35.770
which as everybody now knows will increase your dead lift to a minimum of 8,000

2079
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:38.010
pounds.

<v 3>over and over again.
Everyone knows it now.</v>

2081
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:42.750
It's really not impressive anymore since so many people are hitting that 80,000

2082
02:04:42.751 --> 02:04:46.590
pound Max books.
Jordan B.

2083
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:50.040
Peterson maps of meeting is his first book.
It's old.
It's big,

2084
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:52.980
it's expensive.
I have it.

2085
02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.470
It's a great read.

2086
02:04:55.830 --> 02:05:00.450
Also 12 rules for life and I had to do to chaos way the warrior kid,

2087
02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:06.050
so where the warrior kid kid's book teaching kids to how get how to get on the

2088
02:05:07.231 --> 02:05:10.830
path.
Now there's a new book coming out,

2089
02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:15.210
a new warrior kid book.
It is available now on Amazon.

2090
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:20.100
It's called a way of the warrior kid Mark's mission.
It's a followup.

2091
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:24.810
The first book was fifth grade,
the second book,
sixth grade.

2092
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.850
Mark's getting a little older.
Guess what?

2093
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:31.020
He's still got some problems to solve and he's going to solve them so you can

2094
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:35.940
order that.
Also,
as I already mentioned,

2095
02:05:35.941 --> 02:05:39.750
discipline equals freedom field manual that is available.

2096
02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.260
If you want to get bigger,
stronger,
faster,
smarter,
more disciplined,

2097
02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:50.850
better get that book and then implement it because you can get the book and sit,

2098
02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:54.480
sit around and play video games.
It's not going to make you any of those things.

2099
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.540
You have to actually get it.
You have to read it,
you have to implement it,

2100
02:05:58.530 --> 02:06:03.420
so that works.
Oh,
also with the warrior kids,
don't forget,

2101
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:07.950
you can get some more of your kids soap.
Basically.
I got some.

2102
02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.080
Did you get something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's good to go.

Extreme ownership book by myself and my brother Leif Babin.

2108
02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:31.710
It's about combat leadership.
It's about how to lead.

2109
02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:35.040
That's what it's about and people think that's a simple thing.

2110
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.490
It's not even her German beat.
Jordan B.
Peterson say today,

2111
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:40.740
leadership is very complicated.
He's right,

2112
02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:47.240
so extreme ownership will help you in your leadership skills,

2113
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:50.850
tactics,
and strategies.
Also,

at Your Business or at your team,

2116

beyond what we give you here on this podcast and beyond the books,

2117
02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:04.830
I have a leadership and management consulting company.
It's called echelon front,

2118
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.640
where we will get the leadership you have and thereby your whole organization

2119
02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:15.240
aligned and moving forward together.
It's me.
It's Leif Babin.

2120
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.730
It's JP Denelle.

Also,
there is the monster.

2123
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:33.290
This is a leadership seminar that hits you like an atom bomb.

2124
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:42.040
So the monster,
everyone that's been to it,
there's nothing else like it.

2125
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:44.040
The people that work at the hotels,
we've done it out and him,

2126
02:07:44.050 --> 02:07:45.310
he said there's nothing else like it,

2127
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.120
so it's awesome if you want to come to it.

2128
02:07:49.121 --> 02:07:52.420
We're only doing two masters this year.
We don't have time to do more.

2129
02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.640
We're doing one in Washington DC,

2130
02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:59.760
May 17th and 18th that's for the east coast people May 17th and 18th of

2131
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:01.420
Washington DC,

2132
02:08:01.630 --> 02:08:06.460
and we're going to do San Francisco October 17th and 18th that's for your west

2133
02:08:06.461 --> 02:08:09.280
coast people.
Those are the only two monsters that we're doing this year.

2134
02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:13.330
We're not doing Vancouver.
We're not doing Atlanta.
We're not doing Memphis.

2135
02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.580
We're not doing Tampa.
Those are all great cities,

2136
02:08:15.581 --> 02:08:19.750
but we're not going to do a monster there.
We've had four monsters already.

2137
02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.300
San Diego,
New York City,
San Diego again,
and Austin,

2138
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:28.270
Texas.
All the mustards that we've done have sold out.

2139
02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.910
These two that we're doing this year are going to sell out as well.

2140
02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:35.200
So if you want to come registered@extremeownership.com we will see you there.

2141
02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:36.550
And until then,

2142
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:42.640
if you want to get on the path with us,
you can find us.

2143
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:46.960
We'll be cruising on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

2144
02:08:47.590 --> 02:08:51.850
on Instagram and on Dad's face.

thanks to all of you,

2150
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:17.290
I know a lot of men and women in uniform.
Listen to this podcast.

2151
02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:19.690
I hear from you all the time.
Well,

2152
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:25.830
we would not have this podcast if it wasn't for you overseas holding the line

2153
02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:32.820
and keeping evil at bay and to the people in uniform here at home,

2154
02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.240
police,
law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,
and the rest of you.

2155
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.620
First responders.

2156
02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:42.460
Thank you for keeping us safe inside our borders

2157
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:49.770
and to everyone else out there moving through life and that's good,

2158
02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.760
that's fine.
But I recommend you don't just move through life.

2159
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:57.460
I recommend you move down the path,

2160
02:09:58.930 --> 02:10:03.930
get stronger and faster and smarter and better every day.

2161
02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:08.380
Aim to be the best.
And as Jordan Peterson,

2162
02:10:08.590 --> 02:10:11.830
right so eloquently in his book,

2163
02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:18.780
always place your becoming above your current being.

2164
02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:27.030
In other words,
get up and get after it

2165
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:33.640
till next time.
This is echo and Jocko out.
