1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.600
Were you very disciplined as a kid

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.210
and was there a set day or moment when you saw how important discipline was and

3
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:14.400
decided to do it?
Well,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.490
as a kid,
I think I was,
for the most part,
a kid.

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.280
I was not extremely disciplined kid.
I was,

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.250
I was pretty stubborn when it came to certain things,

7
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:34.251
which may be some kind of in early immature form of discipline you have just

8
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.330
being hard headed.

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.870
But I think as I got older I saw the first thing I remember along these lines is

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.040
seeing a lack of discipline around me.

11
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.500
I didn't identify it as people having discipline.

12
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:53.520
I saw like a lack of discipline.
It's all weakness.
I saw drugs,
I saw alcohol,

13
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.850
I saw laziness
and I,

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
I started to get after it a little bit,
right.
A little bit,

15
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.940
a little tiny bit,
but there was no role models.
There was no internet,

16
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.290
there was no guidance.

17
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.390
I didn't have the sense to to go to the library and find Bob Hoffman's book,

18
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.600
how to be,
how happy,
healthy and strong like I didn't know to do.

19
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:22.980
I know what makes sense to do that.
And so we did some basic things,

20
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.500
you know what I mean?
Some pushups,
you know,
and,

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.230
and if the pushup workouts that I did when I was 13 years old are laughable.

22
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.750
Laughable.
I mean I think if I did,
you know,

23
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:40.410
a set of 50 pushups,
I was corn or you know,
boom,
I'm the man,
right?

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.230
You are the man 13 yeah.
And,

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.810
and we did some silly little like kind of Barbell dumbbell circuit training kind

26
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.540
of thing.
Now I always liked the military.

27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.910
I recognize that as a some kind of a trade of discipline in there.

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.480
And I looked up to military veterans,

29
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.350
I knew one Marine Corps drill instructor

30
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.250
and if you know anything about Marine Corps drill instructors,

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.580
so now we're talking [inaudible] 85 86 87 there wasn't any wars going on,

32
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.080
but you know,
when you're a kid you're just like,

33
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.600
oh he's a Marine Corps drill instructor.
He fit the part.

34
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.330
He was the perfect Marine Corps boat.
Drone struck her,

35
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.140
which most Marine Corps drill instructors are pretty damn perfect Kitsap,

36
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.830
incredibly,
incredibly honed job.

37
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.070
That's very well choreographed and very and very structured in it's,

38
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.500
it's a very fine,
um,
real tight,
real tight.

39
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.770
It's a real tight situation if you're getting Marine Corps drill instructor.

40
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.060
And I knew one right when I was a kid and I just looked at,
he was like a God,

41
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.670
right?
This guy is a marine corps are,
and of course he had,

42
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.320
I think he had like a 68 Camaro.
So he had a muscle car.
So he was Josie Ope,

43
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.680
like does the man and so now,
so I got that going on and then,

44
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.020
then there was the hardcore bands that I started listening to and they seem to

45
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.160
have some kind of,
it was something there,
right?

46
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.090
I recognized something there.
I recognize something with black flag.

47
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.020
I recognize something with bank called slapshot.

48
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.570
I recognize something with the Cro mags.

49
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:24.320
And I saw there was something in there and I,
and I,
I,

50
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.760
it Wa I couldn't,
I can't,
I didn't know what it was,

51
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:32.740
but it was some kind of strength,
right?
Some kind of discipline was in there.

52
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.810
I didn't put it all together though and there was no sort of unified way to go

53
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.080
down this path.
It didn't,
I didn't find that.

54
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.900
I don't know if I found it,
if it,
what it,
what it looked like to me.
You know,

55
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.080
maybe you could say that that path was the boy scouts.

56
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.730
The boy scouts are a disciplined group of individuals that learn how to hike and

57
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:03.620
haunt.
And I mean,
so was that it?
I don't know.
I,

58
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.190
maybe I didn't identify that or I didn't have the right personality cause I was

59
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:12.390
kind of nonconformist right.
It's a little bit,
you know,
a little bit of a rebel.

60
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.250
So I didn't put it all together.
Um,

61
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.570
in add some little flashes of like being hardcore where some of the things I did

62
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:27.810
that would be like,
you know,
kind of getting after some really minor way,
some,

63
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.650
some,
some minimalistic level of discipline.

64
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.680
But it wasn't until I started training in earnest to join the navy that I

65
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:41.390
started to what we could recognize now as getting after it a little bit.

66
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.370
You know,
it's,
and again,
it's nothing compared to what people do now,

67
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.690
what definitely not.
But you know,

68
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.730
now we're talking 1989 I was running through marshes and being covered in mud

69
00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:00.090
and I was swimming in the ocean and I was doing pull ups and pushups and dips

70
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.410
and sit ups.
And again,

71
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:06.030
it's nothing compared to what I do now or even what everybody does now.

72
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.110
But I was doing what I could with what I knew at the time.

73
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.220
And I didn't really have any idea of what I,

74
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.150
or really what people in general were capable of.
Like,

75
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.700
I just didn't know.
I didn't know.

76
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.060
I never would have thought a good pullup workout is 500 to a thousand pullups.

77
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.830
I,
I wouldn't have thought that,
you know,
for me,

78
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.610
I did three sets and pull ups and I was going to the murder,
you know,

79
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.250
so I just,
I just didn't,
didn't know.
And

80
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.230
I guess,
I guess you could say I didn't even have,

81
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.410
I didn't know to even explore those,

82
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.190
those outer limits of what I was capable of,
you know,
which is a bummer.

83
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.160
Um,
no,
I'm sorry.
You got to remember,

84
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.560
I didn't even know one other person that did pull ups.
Like there's,

85
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.930
there wasn't like pull up bars around.
There wasn't,
you know,

86
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.900
I'm out in the woods somewhere in the woods in New England.

87
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.960
There's no pullups people.
People aren't like,
hey,
how many posts can do,

88
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.950
I'd never heard that question.

89
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.870
And I didn't know anybody that swam in the open ocean.

90
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.960
I didn't know anybody that did push up workouts.
Right?
I Dunno,

91
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.580
I was just in the sticks.
And so when I joined the military,

92
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.620
I was a blank slate,
really for all practical purposes.
And it was really easy.

93
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.250
They say,
you do this,
this is what you do and you get advanced.

94
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.230
This is what you do to be ready.
This is what you do.

95
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.100
And I realized very quickly that the harder you worked that the more disciplined

96
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.530
you were,
the easier your life was,
the easier your job was.
Easier Day was,

97
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.920
these are your physical activities would get.
And when I got to the teams

98
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.500
and really going through buds when you're going through buds and when I'd

99
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:59.390
finally met guys that we're going to buds and we started doing a hundred pull

100
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:02.580
ups and we started doing 150 pilots.
We started doing 200 poles to workout.

101
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.890
And then it was like,
Oh wow,

102
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.380
you can do a lot of stuff that was getting ready to go to buds.

103
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:10.550
And then you go to buds and I,
you know,
you realize that people,

104
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.410
it's not just this individual like,
um,
spiritual awakening.
I'm like,

105
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:18.050
no.
You just realize,
hey,
you can do a lot of pullups people can,

106
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.180
it's not that big of a deal.
And everybody knows you can find that on the,

107
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:22.550
you don't need to go to buds to figure that out.
You can figure that out.

108
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.160
Just I'm telling you right now,
you know what I mean?

109
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.440
And all you need is to have that knowledge.

110
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.460
But I continued to realize that being disciplined,
all these things,

111
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.940
waking up earlier and working hard and training hard and keeping your gear

112
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:37.250
squared away and studying the material that we were supposed to know,

113
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.930
I realized that that work,

114
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.050
that discipline made life easier and it made us freer,

115
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.770
made me freer,

116
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.480
and the more time I spent in the teams,

117
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.760
the more this came in bedded in my head,

118
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:59.870
and not only as an individual that I realize this,

119
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:02.420
but I realized this very quickly.
We're not very quickly,

120
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:04.250
but as soon as I started moving into leadership positions,

121
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.180
I realized that the more disciplined a squad was over,

122
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:13.160
the more disciplined to platoon one was the better that squatter of that platoon

123
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:14.360
was going to be.
And

124
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.370
that's kind of where the evolution,

125
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.410
the evolution of it.

126
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.920
<v 1>Yeah,
man,
it's that whole</v>

127
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.460
process that I'm finally,
I don't know if they finally buy it right now.

128
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:36.490
It's starting to become clear where the whole,

129
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.930
you know you're going to pay the price in at some point,

130
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.790
you're going to pay the price for your actions.

131
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.770
So if you're going to prepare,
like let's say I'm going to get in shape,

132
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.900
right?
You committing to working out every day,

133
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.260
that's you paying a price like dis did.
Having the discipline to do it,

134
00:08:58.261 --> 00:08:59.250
you're going to pay the price.

135
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.060
Waking early is not comfortable working on hard every day.
It's not comfortable.

136
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.940
You're going to pay a little price rate there the next day or the,
you know,

137
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.560
in regards to the results of that workout,
you're not paying the price,

138
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:12.510
you're reaping kind of rewards.
Right.

139
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.350
Or you can not pay the price early with the workout and stuff,
but you still got,

140
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.540
that tab is still outstanding.
So when you,
yeah,

141
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.320
so when it comes results time there,
that's,

142
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.520
that's when you're going to pay your little price there,
your body,
your health,

143
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:33.810
whatever.
At some point you're going to have to pay a price.
Pay Now or pay later.

144
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.180
Yeah.
Mansell and pay now.

145
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.500
Pay Now you get way more benefit cause like no one remembers.

146
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.520
Well we do.
Some of us do.
We buy,
I don't remember,

147
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.000
and take pleasure in remembering the time I skipped that workout because I

148
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:49.740
wasn't feeling like doing it.
You know?

149
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.850
Like that doesn't provide a sense of pleasure in my life to think back on those

150
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.040
days,
you know,
it's not good.

151
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.880
And at the same time when I think of like the detriment of doing the workout

152
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.590
when I didn't feel like it,
that doesn't,
that's not a bad memory to me.

153
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.483
You know,

154
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.660
when I do think back of like an or think even now if like the result of being in

155
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:12.570
better shape than the,
you know,
the average person or we're going,

156
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.670
did you do so and not gassing or whatever,

157
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.990
bringing in all the groceries at one time,
let's face it.
That's something

158
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.540
that is a sense of pleasure that I have the freedom to be able to do that one I

159
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.000
want,
I want,

160
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.090
<v 0>you know?
Yeah.
And you know,
what else is interesting about this,</v>

161
00:10:31.091 --> 00:10:35.500
and sometimes I hear this and you did this a couple of times tonight,
right?

162
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.310
People go,
well,
yeah,
but you're Jocko late.
Like,
as if I'm,

163
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.810
as if I'm not a normal person,
but I'm not.

164
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.390
But I'm saying like,
you know her,

165
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:51.130
I just kind of went through like the story [inaudible] it's paints a pretty

166
00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:54.000
clear picture that I'm a pretty normal person.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

167
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.000
It's pretty normal.

168
00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.330
But I made decisions along the way that maybe weren't normal and that may be

169
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:06.340
open the doors to being a little bit,

170
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.420
not normal.
Yeah.
But there are choices that you can make.
So,

171
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.500
so I'll have this with my kids too,
or you know who else is?

172
00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:18.730
Sometimes I'll have them,
I would have friends,

173
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.280
we'll say that would say,
you know,
well,
yeah,
you're,
that's you.

174
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.580
You know,
like I'd say,
no one of you,
if you want to win this fight,
for instance,

175
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.890
you want to win this fight,
man,
you gotta,
you gotta do this,

176
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:33.730
you got to get after this,
you've got 80 be well.
You know,
it's not that easy.
And,

177
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.900
and that's,
that's what you would do.
But you're,
you're,

178
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:42.040
you in.
That's,
you know,
it's almost like,
yeah,
it's,

179
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.180
unachievable doesn't apply to me.
And my kids will say that to me.

180
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.860
You know,
my kids.

181
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.920
And I think it's actually a pretty big detriment that they think that I,

182
00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:56.980
not that that,
oh,
I do it,
but,

183
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:01.840
but that's because I'm me and I'm the note.
It's not true.

184
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.630
It's not true.
And so,
you know,
occasionally I have,

185
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.180
I hear people say that and I go,
man,
this isn't like,

186
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.750
I guess it's kind of like what we were talking about the other day with someone

187
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:19.570
saying,
Oh,
oh,
that's a good picture you took.
What kind of camera did you use?

188
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.400
Well,
it's kind of like that.
I'm like,
you know,
oh,
I wake up early.
It doesn't,

189
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.460
it's not just because I just give it that way or I work out a lot.

190
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.800
Oh,
did cause you're super motivated,
right?

191
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.790
Was gifted you and born motivated?
No,

192
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.320
actually I'm a person and I grew up,
you know,
person.
Yeah.

193
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.850
And so it,

194
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.560
but it makes it very clear that these are just choices you can make and you can

195
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:50.890
get after it.
Totally true.
And I would say that it does,

196
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:56.410
when I say one,
anytime I would say consciously in meaningfully say,

197
00:12:56.411 --> 00:13:00.580
well that's you is if I would be talking about a way of achieving like the same

198
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:03.490
thing.
Like you would do it this way.
I would try to do it this way kind of thing.

199
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.150
If I was confidence that I could get the results,
you know,
like whatever that is.

200
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.200
But um,
when did I say it to do about your sleeping,
your you,

201
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:12.360
you can do the four hour sleep.

202
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.630
So more so than you can do the four hours sleep and still function.

203
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:21.610
I meant you're into the four hours,
five hours sleep thing.
Yeah.
Which is cool.

204
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.960
But,
and I realize there are some genetic points in there,

205
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.220
I believe,
right?
Yeah.
I believe that there are some genetic points in there.

206
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:33.460
I believe there are some genetic points in,
in everything.
Right.

207
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:34.870
And I've told you this,

208
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.490
I have one of my daughters who is most similar to me,

209
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.520
both physically and mentally sleeps about the same as I do,

210
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.440
if not less.

211
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640
One of my other daughters who is most physically and mentally,

212
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.910
well,
physically more like my wife.

213
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.420
She sleeps a lot.
Yeah.

214
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.020
And so there is a gin and my wife sleeps more than I do.

215
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.940
And so there is a genetic component to it,
I believe in.

216
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.610
I've read articles and people send me you Twitter articles all the time.
Oh,

217
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:16.150
you're one of these,
you know,
fast sleepers,
the 2% of the population,

218
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:20.050
all this stuff.
And I'm just saying,
okay,
yeah,
that's great.

219
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.250
But then people say,

220
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:25.720
oh well you just work out every day because you're super motivated or you just

221
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:29.470
trained Jujitsu all the time because you're just super motivated.
And it's like,

222
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.470
oh,
okay.
Well,
you know what?
Great.
Great,
great.
Yeah,
yeah.

223
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.800
I think you're absolutely correct.
And even with the sleeping thing that is like,

224
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.540
because ultimately yet,
if you don't have to sleep as much as the next person,

225
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:46.000
sure.
That's an advantage just because you have more time and that's it.

226
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.950
It's not like,
you know,
someone would would be like,
hey,
other than that,

227
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.621
to be like,
hey,

228
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.850
it's cooler or it's somehow more beneficial for me to sleep five hours rather

229
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:59.750
than my normal eight.
Like,
so I mean that,
put it this way,

230
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:04.550
if someone wants to choose to sleep four hours just because you do it,

231
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:08.540
that's kind of weird.
Yeah.
Now that being said,

232
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.730
what's awesome is there are a bunch of people on,

233
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.900
on the interwebs,

234
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.570
a bunch of bad ass troopers that have our,

235
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.870
are,
I retweet almost all of these,
cause people go,
hey,
you know,
I'm,

236
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.480
I lost 32 pounds.
Hey,
I lost 42 pounds.
Hey,

237
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.540
I did my first squat today with 300 pounds.

238
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.403
So,
and,
and,

239
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.930
and there's no difference in what they were doing before and what they're doing

240
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:42.380
now fundamentally in their,
in their genes or their,

241
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.940
or their physiology.
What they did is they decided to make these decisions.

242
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.740
They decided that they were going to go out,

243
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:50.240
they decided they're going to step up their game.

244
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.560
They're gonna decide you're gonna wake up early.

245
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.970
They decided they're going to clean up their diet.

246
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.910
They decided they were going to get after it.
And when they do that,

247
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.430
all of a sudden boom resolved.
And you know what?

248
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.880
You fast forward six months and people were,
will you just do that?

249
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:05.900
Cause you're super motivated and they'll be thinking,
you don't know.
I'm not.

250
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.840
I'm a person,
you know,

251
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.330
and I choose to get after it meal.

252
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.670
I recommend you all choose to get after it.
And I encourage that.
Any,

253
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:20.510
you know what?
It's not easy.
It's not easy.

254
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.570
There's the nagging weakness that is pulling you down.

255
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.280
You know?
And you've got to shut that.
