00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.950
This is Jocko podcast number one 29 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.590
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.710
cry.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.710
I had risen for the reserve and it must come as soon as possible.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.240
We ran what we could run.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.310
Our lieutenant colonel fell killed almost at the first.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.560
Beyond this,

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.870
we lost our major and indeed all of the officers,

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
but three,
three only.

10
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.470
We had crossed two successive ditches which lay in an orchard to the left of the

11
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:49.471
first houses in and we were beginning to form in front of the village,

12
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.450
but there was no standing of it besides the general cannon fire such as hardly

13
00:00:58.421 --> 00:00:59.500
can be imagined.

14
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.860
There was also a reign of case shot upon this battalion of which I,

15
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.470
as there was no colonel left,
had to take command,

16
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.570
a third battalion of the Royal Prussian foot guards,

17
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.970
which had already made several of our regiments pass.

18
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:23.910
That same kind of muster gave at a distance of 80 paces.

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250
The liveliest fire upon us.

20
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
It stood as if on the parade ground that third battalion

21
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.510
and waited for us without stirring

22
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.740
the Austrian regimen at our right hand.

23
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.740
Could not get itself formed properly because of the houses.

24
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.150
It was standing 30 deep and sometimes it's shots hit us in the back

25
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.551
on my left.

26
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:55.900
The Austrian regiment ran its way and I was glad of that in comparison.

27
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.580
By no method or effort could I get the drag dunes who stood 50 yards to the rear

28
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:05.560
of me to cut Ian a little and help me out.

29
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.680
My soldiers who were still tired from running had no cannon support.

30
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.200
We're scattered fewer in number and we're mainly fighting out of solidness.

31
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.090
It was more out of honor then the notion of doing good in the affair that

32
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:28.950
prevented us from running off.

33
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.743
Finally,

34
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.990
two officers of the granted deers brought me what they still had some Hungarians

35
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.300
to.
We're luckily got together,

36
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.690
but it lasts with all help and the remnants of my own brave battalion

37
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.690
I drew back.

38
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823
<v 1>Okay,</v>

39
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>and that right is a report</v>

40
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.680
from Charles Joseph Lamar.
Raul,

41
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.680
<v 1>okay.</v>

42
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.600
<v 0>The prints,
prints d'alene,
I believe is how you say it.</v>

43
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.840
Who was the captain in the Austrian army fighting against the Prussians during

44
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:19.830
the seven years war.

45
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.290
And that particular battle was the battle of Luth,

46
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.710
which took place on December 5th,
1757

47
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.160
where the Austrians suffered about 22,000 casualties,

48
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.680
about one third of their forces

49
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.990
that was at the hands of the Prussian army,

50
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.950
who interestingly had about half the number of troops as the Austrians.

51
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.440
<v 0>And the Prussian army was led by a guy by the name of King Frederick,</v>

53
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.370
the second who became known as Frederick.
The great,

54
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.370
and you know,
this type of fighting was,

55
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.680
it was brutal and it's,

56
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.750
it's sort of is the classic of vision of the old European infantry tactics.

57
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:22.130
Like what you picture troops lined up by rank,

58
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.660
marching forward to close with the enemy in what often became just a test of

59
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.200
will and courage

60
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.040
and who's will and whose courage was stronger,

61
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.480
who would drive forward and who was going to back down,

62
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:47.340
who going to run away.
But on top of that will encourage you also,

63
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.950
there was still maneuvers happening out there and the movements were
centralized,

64
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.100
but the,
but the maneuvers were still happening,
happening,

65
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.260
and the battlefields still required there to be leadership,

66
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.810
to maneuver these elements around,

67
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:08.490
to assess what was happening and then to drive the troops to get the job done.

68
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.290
Leadership was absolutely required in one of the most respected leaders of this

69
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.030
era was the leader at that battle of the Prussians.

70
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.560
Frederick the great.
Now Frederick the great,

71
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.530
interesting character,
born in 1712 his father,

72
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.840
Frederick William,
and he,

73
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.830
he seemed like one of those kind of tyrannical fathers that really pushed his

74
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.830
son with extreme discipline and all that.
And guess what?

75
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.600
Young Frederick didn't like?
It
didn't like it wasn't,

76
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:47.280
wasn't into that.
You know what?
He was into music literature.

77
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.360
That's what he was into.

78
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.930
And he actually plotted an escape to England and he had a couple of his buddies

79
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:58.880
helped him out,
had a little plan,
put the plan together.
I'm gonna get out,

80
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.050
get away from my tyrannical dad who's trying to turn me into this warmongering

81
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.363
guy.

82
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.360
And the plot got foiled and the king actually captured you,

83
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.020
captured one of the two friends that was helping young Frederick and incentives

84
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.863
them to death.

85
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.850
And Young Frederick had to watch his friend who had tried to help him get

86
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:24.670
beheaded.
Yeah.

87
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And despite that he eventually got on board with becoming a military leader and

88
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.720
become an king.

89
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.990
And he gained a reputation for being extremely aggressive on the battlefield.

90
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.420
And there's a good quote,
I think Napoleon had a good quote about him,

91
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.720
which was something along the lines of if Frederick the great was still here,

92
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.400
we wouldn't be here.
So he,

93
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.400
he got a lot of respect than he led very successful campaigns all over Europe.

94
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:56.234
He was,

95
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.190
he was known for having an extremely hard work ethic,

96
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.850
strong work ethic.
Interestingly,
he woke up

97
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.660
at either four or five o'clock in the morning every morning.
So he,

98
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.410
he was one of those guys.
And another interesting thing at a time when,

99
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.030
when the royals all over Europe and the world,

100
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:19.880
when they kind of flaunted their riches,
he wasn't like that.

101
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.360
He was kind of like a low profile guy.
He allowed free speech,

102
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:26.180
he allowed people to even insult him,
which was,
you know,

103
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.280
I mean obviously he's old man,

104
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.720
didn't have any problem just tossing out the death sentence.

105
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.070
But there was a story about him where there was like a poster hung up that

106
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:37.070
someone had done a drawing and it made him kind of look like a buffoon.

107
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.030
And he was going through this village where this thing was hung up and he kind

108
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:43.160
of went to see what all this commotion,
all these people around.

109
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.380
Do you want to see what all the commotion was,
uh,
was about.

110
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.850
And he saw this sign hand hanging up on a post and his comment was,
hey,

111
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.130
lower that sign down a little bit.

112
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:54.080
So people don't hurt their next while they're looking at it.

113
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.980
He's just one of those guys.
And you know,
so we kind of had his ego in check,

114
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.000
which is,
which is definitely good.
And is his tactics.
Like I said,

115
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:06.140
I mean there's still,
even when you had these rigid sort of ranks in battles,

116
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.860
you still had to maneuver the out the elements around the battlefield and his

117
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.760
tactics were based in the mobility and being able to move quickly,

118
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.730
being able to move more quickly than the enemy.

119
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.320
And he focused on drill and more drilling.
And this is another interesting thing

120
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.880
in his opinion,
he cause drill.
I don't know if you know this,

121
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.070
but when we say drill in the military,

122
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:32.480
we're talking about you ever seen like a drill team with the rifles and they

123
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:34.210
march and everything's perfect.
A few good men,

124
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.450
the Edne remember that movie at the beginning as a criminal?

125
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.730
That's what it is.
I haven't,
I can't remember that.

126
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.250
I've definitely seen the movie,
but I can't remember that particular part.

127
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.050
But yeah,
that's what drill is.
So when people talk about drill,

128
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:48.980
that's what they're talking about.
And he was saying he,
you know,

129
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:53.981
he was of the opinion that people often miss mistook drill for the art of war.

130
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.080
He's no,
they're two different things and they're important.

131
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:02.680
And there's a reason why you do drill and it teaches you certain things.

132
00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:03.880
It teaches you a lot about discipline.

133
00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:05.830
It teaches you about responding to orders quickly,

134
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.420
teaches you how to work together as teams.
So there's,

135
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.380
there's definitely a reason for drill,
but that is not the art of war at all.

136
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.630
So at age 35 he was,

137
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.450
he had been sick and he was recovering from an illness,
but he was,

138
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.920
I guess I'm still a little bit down.

139
00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:24.010
So he was doing what he could in in this case,
in this case,

140
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:25.420
it meant that he wrote down,

141
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.310
so some of his principles and the first version of it,

142
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.600
what's called the instruction of Frederick,
the great to his generals.

143
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.140
And that piece was it kind of revised and the title was eventually changed to

144
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.370
general principles of war.

145
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:43.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.990
<v 0>And we're going to look at that book today and see what we can learn from</v>

147
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.660
Frederick the great.
And I was actually,

148
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.980
I'm always surprised at how much I have to learn and how much I can learn from

149
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.330
people that fought several hundred years ago and led several hundred years ago.

150
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.430
It's amazing.
It's amazing what you can learn from these folks.

151
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.970
All right,
so here we go.
Going to the book.

152
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.920
This section is called the capabilities of Prussian troops and their particular

153
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.973
merit.

154
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.080
The greatest force of the Prussian army resides in their wonderful regularity,

155
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.230
which long costume has made a habit,

156
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.870
inexact obedience,
and in the bravery of the troops.

157
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.560
The discipline of these troops now we evolved into habit,

158
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.770
has such effect that in the greatest confusion of an action and the most evident

159
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:48.471
perils there disorder is still more orderly than the good order of their

160
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:51.750
enemies.
So,
so there you go.
This is,

161
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.530
this is discipline equals freedom in whatever 17 something.

162
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.910
<v 0>If you think about what he's saying,</v>

164
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.680
his troops were so disciplined that even when there's total chaos going on in

165
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:04.514
there,

166
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.290
<v 1>okay.</v>

167
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.400
<v 0>In their worst state,</v>

168
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.190
they still are more squared away than the enemies because they're discipline is

169
00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:09.870
so strong.

170
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.703
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

171
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:12.921
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

172
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:17.921
Consequently small confusions are redressed in a moment and all evolutions are

173
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.070
made promptly.
It doesn't matter what you do to confusion,
no problem.

174
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.993
We got discipline.

175
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.400
A general of other troops could be surprised and circumstances in which he would

176
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:33.401
not be if commanding Prussians since he will find resources in the speed with

177
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:38.540
which they form and maneuver in the presence of the enemy.

178
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.320
And this is something that I say all the time was that like in a seal platoon,

179
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.580
in my seal platoons,
in my seal task unit,
in an Army or marine corps,

180
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.280
Infantry Platoon,
the discipline that they,
it gives them more freedom,

181
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.530
freedom on the battlefield because they can react to things quicker.

182
00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.910
That's exactly what we're talking about.
Exactly.
Exact same thing.

183
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.980
Frederick the great realized back to the book,

184
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.120
Prussians discipline renders these troops capable of executing the most

185
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.780
difficult maneuvers such as traversing award in battle without losing their

186
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:12.460
files or distances.

187
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.090
Advancing and close order at double time forming with promptness,

188
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.360
reversing their direction suddenly to fall on the flank of the enemy,

189
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.760
gaining an advantage by a forced march and finally in surpassing the enemy in

190
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:25.300
constancy.
And fortitude.

191
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.220
Discipline equals freedom.
I'm glad he didn't use that title.
He could have,

192
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.370
he could have.
Now he's got something in here.
And,
and when I,

193
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.900
when I initially read this part,
um,
I was like,
oh,

194
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:43.780
well that's a little bit off of my thoughts,

195
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.860
but he comes back to it later and we'll get to that part.

196
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.840
Remind me actually when he,
what do you get to this part?

197
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:54.670
Talking about decentralized command because he talks about something that's a

198
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.370
little bit opposite of what I usually say.
So here we go back to the book,

199
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.690
obedience to the officers.

200
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:03.010
And subordination is so exact that no one ever questions in order.

201
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.020
Hours are observed.
Exactly.

202
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.830
And however little a general knows how to make himself obeyed,

203
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.360
he is always sure to be no one ever reasons about the possibility of an

204
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.380
enterprise.
And finally it's accomplishment is never disparative.

205
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.840
So what he's saying there is,
you know,
like everyone just listens to me.

206
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.410
That's what the g everyone just listens and no one questions the orders and

207
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:29.050
we're going to get to later where he actually,
there's two things.
Number one,

208
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:30.550
he really takes care of his people.

209
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.560
So they listened to him because he takes care of them.

210
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.040
It's not because he barks orders of them,
it's not.

211
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.440
It's that he really cares about them and he takes care of them.

212
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.760
And the other thing he talks,
and we'll talk later about this,

213
00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:44.260
is how getting input from people is important.

214
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.940
So even though he lays that out there,
I think that's almost like a little macho.

215
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.800
He thought he's throwing some macho,
hey,
look at me.
Everyone just listens to me.

216
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.773
That's the way it is.

217
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.990
I don't know if you noticed this when we had a colonel Phife on the podcast,

218
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.280
and I was talking about this with Dave Burke the other day
when we first were,

219
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.330
we're talking with Colonel Fife,
you know,
he was saying,
yeah,
well,
you know,

220
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.420
everyone just did what I told them to do and I was kind of like,
wow,

221
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:13.980
you know that,
that I always say that that doesn't really work.
You know what's,

222
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.510
I'm thinking this to myself,
you know,
he says,
yeah,

223
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:20.560
people just tell him what to do and they do it.
That's what made my group,

224
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.020
my unit so good.
And I was like,
wow.

225
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.880
And then he went into it and when he went into it,
all of the answers were there.

226
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.780
He was like,
no,
no,
no,
I cared about my guys.
And then you went into,

227
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.880
I don't know if you remember this,
you went into this part about when he said,

228
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.690
look,

229
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.840
if you're in a tank and you tell someone to get out of the tank when the tanks

230
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:40.750
are hitting,
bullets are hitting the same.
Yeah.
And go fix the track.

231
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.820
Do you think they're going to do that just because you told them to?
No,

232
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:45.580
they're not.
Not if you don't take care of them.
Not if they don't say so.

233
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.580
Even though he initially said kind of like what Frederick the greatest saying,

234
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.040
hey,
people are just going to listen to me both saying the same kind of thing.

235
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.930
But both of them have a lot more depth behind that reaction from their troops.

236
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.550
So when,
when ever somebody hears something like that,
it's like,
no,

237
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.140
it's not true.
It doesn't work.
As a matter of fact,

238
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.590
there's a chapter in the new book coming out that life and I wrote and waves

239
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.220
talking about this one CEO that we're working with that's kind of like quoting

240
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:14.780
patent,
like discipline is the ultimate and same thing.

241
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.990
Laughs talking to the guy like,
hey,
that's not the way the military works.

242
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:20.990
And he believed that when he would hear this kind of thing,

243
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.870
this is like a macho thing to say,
right?
Is that the right word?

244
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:27.260
I don't know if that's the right word.
It's a,
it's a bold statement.
Hey,

245
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.550
my troops just listen to me.
Right.
It's not true.

246
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.800
There's so much more depth and that makes that actually happened.
Yeah.

247
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.240
All right.
Going back to the book,

248
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:46.241
the Prussians are superior to their enemies in constancy since the officers who

249
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:52.121
have no other profession nor other fortune to hope from except their arms and

250
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.890
made themselves with ambition and a gallantry beyond all test because the

251
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:03.491
soldier has a confidence in himself and because he makes it a point of honor to

252
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:08.620
never give way.
So I just,
we were working with a company,
uh,

253
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.530
doing a,
doing an FTX training,
you know,

254
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.450
so we're out in the field and I was talking to them about come from move and I

255
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:17.661
said,

256
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:22.580
if you're walking while you're covering your field of fire from a level of one

257
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:26.060
to 10 how well can you do it?
And you know,
people like,
I don't know,
five,
six.

258
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:28.220
Cause when you're walking you can't really,
you know,

259
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.290
you've got to look where you're walking there.
Look what everyone else is doing.

260
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.390
You,
you can't just look at your field of fire.

261
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.800
You can't just look at your field of fire,

262
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:36.050
which is where you're looking for threats.
I said,

263
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:39.710
when you do cover move and you stop and you get behind some cover and then you

264
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:39.951
just,

265
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:44.660
your whole job is just to look how good you do one to 10 and everyone's like 10

266
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.170
and I said,
yeah.
And,

267
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.780
and that's kind of the same thing here where you get this guy when you have

268
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:53.360
people that their whole life is just dedicated to one thing,

269
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.340
well then they're going to do it good.

270
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.610
He's a Prussian officers who had nothing else going for them other than being in

271
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.980
the military,
they're going to do a good job of it.

272
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.830
That's why sometimes people ask me,

273
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.420
should I start another job while I'm on active duty?
And quite frankly,

274
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:14.780
my answer is no.
It's if you do,

275
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:19.810
it's gotta be so on the side that it doesn't interfere at all with your job as

276
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.070
being a,
being in the military,
it's just too hard to balance two things.

277
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.830
Can you give a little advice?
Can you maybe set something up on the side?
Yeah,

278
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:30.920
but dedicate focus on focus on what you're doing.

279
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.800
100% there's nothing else that I don't know.
I just don't,

280
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.200
I don't see that as working out very well.

281
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:43.250
I say just focus on what you're doing.
That's my opinion.
Some people pull it off.

282
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.540
I've never known anyone that pulled it off.
Well,
maybe I could think of some.

283
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.710
Most people that had some kind of side gig going on the the,

284
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.320
the military was their side Gig too.
You know what I mean?

285
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.060
They weren't just in the game.
Yeah.
Like,
no,
dude,

286
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.410
do your job,
do it.
Well,
yeah,

287
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.880
that doesn't go with,
if you're working for some corporation,

288
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.270
then you can pull it off.
Right.
You can have,
you can do something on the side.

289
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.520
Depends on the job,
but I don't know,

290
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:15.270
it just seems like if you're the boss of of let's say you had a team,
right.

291
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.240
And they were like,
you know,
they're,
you know,
productivity and all,
you know,

292
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:18.870
all this stuff,

293
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.790
and then you find out one team member is basically splitting his time.
You know,

294
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.600
I don't know,
doing something else.
It's kind of like,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

295
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.810
We're all over here Tryna,
if it's interfering,

296
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.610
but most jobs aren't 24 hours to answer not or leaving.
True.
Yeah.
You know what?

297
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.960
I think you can pull it off and you can pull off way easier in any other job

298
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:40.290
than in the military.
Yeah.
You can have something going on the side.
Yeah.

299
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.730
Because the military is the job where it's like 24 hours a day.
Yeah.

300
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.560
Are you,
are you saying in a combat scenario we're talking about just in general,

301
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.230
just in general.
And I shouldn't say that.
You know,

302
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.480
there's a lot of jobs where I work with companies.
There's people that are,

303
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.250
they're doing it 24 hours a day.
They're in the game.
Yeah.

304
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.800
So if you're in one of those kind of jobs,

305
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:02.820
don't get a side job and aren't there like or sub self up properly that you can

306
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:05.160
do it.
It's hard to pull off,
man.
It's hard to pull off.

307
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.220
But aren't there jobs in the military that are,
that are pretty mellow?

308
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.080
There are where you can come in.
There are,
I guess if you're doing that,

309
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.280
maybe you can do it.
Yeah.
You're thinking of you like your,
yeah,

310
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:19.260
but I'm also thinking about like guys and guys in the seal teams.

311
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.170
That's what the guys in the seal teams that had some kind of side hustle going

312
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:26.160
on.
We're genuinely,
they weren't fully in the game,
you know?

313
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:26.994
That's just the way it is.

314
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.450
And maybe there's some guys that I didn't even know about that did it,

315
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.170
but most people like,
hey,
if you're out buying houses and flipping houses,

316
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.640
you know you can kind of do that when you're in the military because you just

317
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:40.110
doing some hard work on the weekends and that's cool.

318
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.400
Good to get a little rental property going.
Hey,
right on.
Yeah,
I did that.

319
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.840
It wasn't,
it wasn't.

320
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.760
It literally interfered zero with my primary job,
which was getting out

321
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.230
all right.
Back to the book.
Many have been seen to fight even when wounded,

322
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.590
since the organization in general,

323
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:03.591
proud of its past brave engagements considers that any soldier who has shown the

324
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:09.300
least cowardice,
inaction upfront,
front tip.
I like that.

325
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.270
So you have that attitude.
You have that that culture inside your organization.

326
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.440
It's a real thing.
We don't back down.
We keep fighting hard.

327
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.990
That's where we do.
All right.

328
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:25.320
Now he talks a little bit about projects of campaign.

329
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.300
One should no one's enemies,
their alliances,

330
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.710
their resources and the nature of their country.
In order to plan a campaign,

331
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.070
one should know what to expect of one's friends.

332
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.370
What resources one has oneself and see the future effects to determine what one

333
00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:48.220
has to fear or hope from political maneuvers.

334
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.930
We've heard this over and over again.
Understand your enemy.

335
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.750
Back to the book.
Extravagant camp projects of campaign are worthless.

336
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.070
I call extravagant.

337
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.780
Those which require you to make penetrations or those which reduce you to a two

338
00:21:06.781 --> 00:21:11.781
rigid defense penetrations are worthless because in pushing too far into the

339
00:21:12.211 --> 00:21:14.250
enemy's country,
you weaken yourself.

340
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.050
Your communications become very difficult to maintain on account of their
length.

341
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.960
And in order to make assured conquests,
it is necessary always to pref.

342
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.470
Proceed within the rules.
And here's the rules to advance.

343
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.280
Establish yourself cyl solidly to advance again to establish yourself the same

344
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.350
and always to prepare to have within your reach of your army,

345
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.800
your resources and your requirements.
So there he's saying,

346
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.740
make sure you're ready and if you got to extend yourself,

347
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.030
don't extend yourself too far.
That's,
that's what he's saying.
That's,

348
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.980
that's very good advice.
Now he also says this note,

349
00:21:58.981 --> 00:22:00.540
so that's going on the offense.

350
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.710
Now there's a dichotomy here which we talk about Dichotomy Hill hot.

351
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.050
There's a dichotomy here cause he's saying,
hey look,

352
00:22:07.051 --> 00:22:08.580
you gotta be careful going on super,

353
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.960
super far distant offense and extending yourself too far.

354
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.490
But then he says this back to the book,

355
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.940
projects of absolute defensive are not practicable because while wishing to

356
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:25.020
close yourself in strong camps,
the enemy will envelop you,

357
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.670
deprive you of your sustenance from the rear and oblige you to lose ground while

358
00:22:29.671 --> 00:22:32.970
disheartening your troops.
So while you're digging in,
guess what?

359
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:35.310
The enemy's going to maneuver on you and cut and cut you off.

360
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.270
Now back to the book,

361
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.480
I prefer to this conduct of the offensive with the hazard of losing the battle,

362
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.080
since this will not be more fatal than your retreat and you're timid,

363
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.310
defensive.
So he's saying there,
he'd rather be aggressive,

364
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.450
be lean towards being me at more aggressive than leading towards being more

365
00:22:57.451 --> 00:22:58.920
defensive.
And He,
and he says,

366
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.921
why in the one you lose ground by withdrawing and soldiers by desertion and you

367
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:09.810
have no hope.
So if you go on the defense,
that's what happens.
You lose ground,

368
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.760
you lose soldiers and you have no hope.
Jadah now on the offense,

369
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:17.520
he says in the other,
you do not risk more,

370
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.260
and if you are fortunate,
you can hope for the most brilliant success.

371
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.880
What does he say in their attack?
That's what he's saying.
I agree with that.

372
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.310
Again,
there's a dichotomy there because he's saying attack,
but the,

373
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.010
the previous paragraph,
he's saying,
don't overextend yourself.

374
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.010
This is why we're writing a book called the dichotomy of leadership,

375
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.130
because you have to find that balance.
All right,

376
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.610
back to the book.
I am now coming to what I,
the defensive,

377
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.500
which turns into the offensive,

378
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.920
the greatest secret of war and the masterpiece of a skillful general is to

379
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.850
starve his enemy.

380
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.980
Hunger exhausts men more surely than courage,

381
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.060
and you will succeed with less risk than by fighting.

382
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.880
But since it is very rare that a war is ended by the capture of a depot and

383
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.460
matters are only decided by great battles,

384
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.760
it is necessary to employ all these means to attain this object.

385
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:21.763
<v 1>Okay?</v>

386
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.490
<v 0>Starving your enemy.
You don't notice the interestingly,</v>

387
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.410
you know what I was thinking about would that popped into my mind is when

388
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:32.840
you're,
when you're dealing with relationships,

389
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.380
one of the best ways to like win in a relationship scenario is you starve the

390
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:44.560
other person of attention.
What do you mean?
We,
it's so,
uh,

391
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.330
to,
to,
yeah,
to win.
So like when you,

392
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.260
what's the worst thing you can do to your kid when your kid is doing something

393
00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:55.740
bad?
Give it attention.
Yeah.
The worst thing you can do is,
yeah,

394
00:24:55.741 --> 00:24:58.670
let's give it attention.
The best thing you can do is starve it of attention.

395
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.910
Yeah.
I just thought that was kind of interesting.

396
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.550
And another thing is like in Jujitsu,

397
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.660
you start with a person of energy,
right?

398
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.720
You make them use their energy and once they're out of energy,
they're done.

399
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.680
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Yeah.

400
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.750
So I guess it depends on what you mean by when the relationship,

401
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.000
I guess I didn't really phrase that correctly,

402
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.260
but I was thinking of what we generally do.

403
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.930
Let me clarify that.
I think I just figured it out a little bit.

404
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.480
What we generally do is if we've got a problem in a relationship,

405
00:25:30.481 --> 00:25:34.550
but what do we do?
We go to fight it and go to war.
The better thing.

406
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.850
Maybe just to starve,
starve it a little bit.
How do you start it?

407
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.840
Start it from attention,
right?
Like we talked about it,
I think it was last week.

408
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.890
There's someone asked like,
how do you get vengeance?
And I was like,
Hey,

409
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:49.380
the best thing,
the best interventions to give,
starve them of attention.
Yup.

410
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.610
Don't even give it to them.
Yeah,
you're going to,
that's the win.
Yeah.

411
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.880
So I guess it's not good to put that in perspective with your kids.
Really.

412
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.160
Not a good dig any battle scenario,
interrelationship.
Sure.
They get,
yeah.

413
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:06.110
I think as shrinking.
And you could definitely go too far with that.
Oh yeah.

414
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.460
Yeah.
No,
I'm not saying starve.
I guess if you're,
if you're talking about,

415
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.330
I guess more than anything else,
I'm not even saying it's good or bad.

416
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.360
I'm saying it's something to be aware of that you can use attention as a tool to

417
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:24.410
help you in,
in your engagements,
in relationships,
in business,

418
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.270
in life,
in family,
whatever.
You can use that attention as a tool.
Yeah,
yeah,

419
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:33.300
yeah,
yeah.
I think that's more appropriate.
Yeah.
Yeah.

420
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.800
Cause then pay attention to your kids.
Yeah.

421
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.370
Cause when you say relationship you automatically assume wife,
kids,

422
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.160
girlfriend,
boyfriend kind of thing.
I don't automatically that.
Yeah,
it was like,

423
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.710
yeah.
Okay.
He any,
any battle situation where like,
yeah.

424
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.240
Any combatives combatives near.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just saying it's another tool.

425
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.750
I'm glad you,
it's a good one.
Yeah.
By the way,
it's a good one.
It is a good one.

426
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.500
Right here.
He talks about it and by the way,

427
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.690
obviously I'm cutting out big chunks.

428
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:08.691
And what's interesting is he talks about heat for each one of these little

429
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:10.890
principles that he talks about.

430
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:15.891
He actually goes through specific historical battles that happened and how they

431
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:20.790
unfolded.
But if you want to read those,

432
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:22.820
you should get the book.
But yeah.

433
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

434
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.580
<v 0>I wanted to get through all the principles.
So here we go.</v>

435
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.450
This is kind of skipping the,
the,
uh,
the battles and his,
his battles.
They're not,

436
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.290
they're not like these first person kind of accounts that are really moving.

437
00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:40.040
They're more just,
um,
historical perspective.
Hey,
here's,

438
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.530
and he wasn't even at owl owl,
all of them,
you know,

439
00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:45.020
some of you saying this is what happened in this place and this is what happened

440
00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:48.470
in this other place.
Hmm.
Alright.
He's talking here about rest camps.

441
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.570
The duty of the general in these sort of camps is to restore his army and

442
00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.510
personally to oversee order and discipline.

443
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.520
The cavalry and infantry should be visited often and examined to determine if

444
00:28:01.521 --> 00:28:05.090
the first is well nourished and if these two cores are complete.

445
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.320
So take care of your people.
Likewise,

446
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:14.940
the troop should be exercised frequently.
Cavalry as well as infantry.

447
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.260
And the general should be,
uh,

448
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.600
should often be present to praise the ones to criticize the others and to see

449
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:26.100
with his own eyes that the orders which are found in my institution,

450
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:28.680
military are observed.
Exactly.

451
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

452
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.480
<v 0>The camp guards should be visited to see if they are vigilant,</v>

453
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.750
if the officer's attentive or if he is negligent to be extremely strict so that

454
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:40.650
the amount did centuries.

455
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:44.610
We'll model out anyone to enter the camp without examining and announcing him

456
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:49.770
and to prevent desertion by all means that I have indicated previously.

457
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.550
He talks about one of the problems they had is people deserting and he goes into

458
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:55.530
how do you stop people from deserting?

459
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.980
It's that's what he's referring to there.

460
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.860
Things that keeping everyone busy,
making sure that they're well fed.

461
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:03.860
He talks about those kinds of things,
so that's what he's referring.

462
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.863
<v 1>Two</v>

463
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.840
<v 0>got exercise and frequently got to keep him busy
and you have to inspect.</v>

464
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.750
You have to get eyes on,
he says with your own eyes,

465
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.360
so when you're the leader you just can't throw that order out there and expect

466
00:29:17.361 --> 00:29:19.930
it's all going to happen the way you expected it to.
Not going to happen.

467
00:29:19.931 --> 00:29:24.290
You got to go spend it with your own eyes.
Back to the book,

468
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.760
Nala.
Oh,
before I go back to the book,
he's going to talk about

469
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.270
how important it is to understand the battlefield and the terrain.
Here we go.

470
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.390
Knowledge of the country is to a general what a rifle is to an infantry man and

471
00:29:40.551 --> 00:29:44.250
what the rules of arithmetic are to a geo Mac.
Trition.

472
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:46.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

473
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.530
<v 0>If he does not know the country,</v>

474
00:29:49.531 --> 00:29:53.370
he will do nothing but make gross mistakes without this,

475
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.540
without this knowledge,

476
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.600
his projects be them otherwise admirable become ridiculous and often

477
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.863
impracticable.

478
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.450
Therefore study the country where your going to act

479
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.610
when his desire to apply oneself to this essential part of war.

480
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.350
The most detailed and exact maps of the country that can be found are taken an

481
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.250
examined and reexamined frequently if it is not in time of war.

482
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.730
The places are visited,
camps are chosen,
roads are examined.

483
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.240
The mayors of the villages,
the butchers and the farmers are talked to.

484
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.980
One becomes familiar with the foot pass and the depth of the wood there.

485
00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:34.110
Nature and the depth of the rivers there.

486
00:30:34.111 --> 00:30:39.111
Practicable marshes and those which are not and one observes in this study to

487
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:45.300
distinguish carefully between the conditions of the marshes and the streams in

488
00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:47.130
the different seasons of the year.

489
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.780
It cannot be said that a stream is impracticable in the month of August because

490
00:30:53.781 --> 00:30:55.310
it had been in the month of April.

491
00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.080
The road is chosen to be taken on such and such a march.

492
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:05.000
The number of columns in which the march can be made and all the strong camping

493
00:31:05.001 --> 00:31:08.960
places found on the route are examined to see if they can be used.

494
00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.330
Gathered your Intel,
gathering,
your Intel.

495
00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:20.650
This is critical on the battlefield and my first deployment to Iraq,

496
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.800
I didn't do this as much as if I as I should have because we'd be going to a

497
00:31:27.801 --> 00:31:29.630
place for the first time and we'd go there,

498
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.190
we'd get a quick kind of information,
intelligence would come in and we'd go,

499
00:31:34.191 --> 00:31:36.800
okay,
we're going to,
we find out what this guy is and we do a quick map study.

500
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.320
You know,
we do a map study,

501
00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:42.680
but it wasn't as thorough as as when we were in Ramadi for six straight months.

502
00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:45.690
And you actually just knew where you were.
Uh,

503
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.800
and somebody just hit me up on Twitter talking about this,

504
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.710
but there was a guy from the first of five Oh six,

505
00:31:51.711 --> 00:31:53.780
a company commander and he was awesome.
And he videoed,

506
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.980
he had video cameras in his humvees.
And so when he's out driving around Ramadi,

507
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:01.640
he would record it and then when he got back he'd just watch it over and over

508
00:32:01.641 --> 00:32:04.360
again.
So he knew every little detail.
Yeah.

509
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.120
And that's what you want to do that it's so important to know where you are.

510
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.070
Yeah.
And understand the terrain.

511
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.290
Okay.
Now we're going to talk about something.
It's,
it's a,

512
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:22.600
it's a French word and I don't speak French by the way.

513
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.700
I dig it.
I looked it up,
but I'm still gonna murder it.
All right.
I apologize.

514
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:31.270
Here it cute.
It looks like coop doughy oil,

515
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.340
but the way you actually say it is [inaudible].
Okay.
So Cody on,

516
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:39.320
it's actually used quite a bit.
So I had to like run a couple rehearsals it,

517
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.270
how do you spell it?
C O,
U.
P which,
which I knew that one,
right?
[inaudible] right.

518
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:48.440
There's a coup and then d apostrophe,
O,

519
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.130
e I.
L.
E coup.
Yeah,
and sometimes they say that a coup de,

520
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.660
but I liked her that some people put a little on the end of it.

521
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.700
I liked that because it made a little bit more distinct.

522
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.690
So that's what I'm doing.
Okay.
And what that means it it,

523
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.670
it translates directly I believe,
to stroke of the eye.

524
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.900
And what it means is like a quick glance.
Oh,
Cody,
you,

525
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.890
so you just take a quick glance at something and you understand it.

526
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.080
Think about the power of this recruiting.

527
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.100
You have a general is the talent which great men have of conceiving in a moment

528
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.380
all the advantages of the terrain and the use that they can make of it with

529
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.770
their army.
When you are accustomed to the size of your army,

530
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.990
you will soon,
you soon form your cutea with reference to it.

531
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.440
And Habit teaches you the ground that you can occupy with a certain number of

532
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:45.080
troops.
So what are you saying there is you've gotta practice,
you gotta practice,

533
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:47.270
you gotta practice,
practice,
practice and that's what,

534
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:51.410
that's what makes you good at it.
You start to be able to size things up,
right?

535
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.700
You start to look at situations and the more you get put in those situations,

536
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.600
the better you can size them up.

537
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.990
Thinking about when you first started as a bouncer,
right?

538
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.810
When you first started as a bouncer and you'd look at something and you might

539
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:05.450
think,
oh,
what's this Guy gonna do?
And then a year,

540
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.240
how long were you were bouncer for sort of been here.
Okay.

541
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.210
So by like the sixth year you're looking at a situation like,
okay,

542
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:13.460
I can see that guy's good,
I got to get that guy out of here.
You,

543
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.290
you just get better at your job.
Yeah.
Your,
your quota,
you,

544
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.280
your way of just looking at things and assessing him get sharper.
Yup.

545
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.670
That's very important.
That's very important.

546
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:31.490
Oh,
speaking of which,
back to the book,
the Cutea is of great importance.

547
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:32.390
On two occasions.

548
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.810
The first is when you encounter the enemy on your march and are obliged to

549
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.940
choose ground on which to fight instantly.

550
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.750
As I've remarked with a single square mile,

551
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.180
a hundred different orders of battle can be formed.

552
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.540
This is why you are her,

553
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:51.800
so this is also why you think you think about when you're patrolling,

554
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.920
you're looking around at the terrain and you're going,
okay,

555
00:34:54.921 --> 00:34:57.440
if we get contacted from over there,
we can go into this direction.

556
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:00.740
If we get contact from over there,
we can get covered behind this,
this berm,

557
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:05.000
or go behind this building.
If you're thinking about that,
even when you go into,

558
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.820
yeah,
you go into a restaurant and you're like,
okay,
where are the exits?

559
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.700
That's exactly what you're doing.
Where are the exits?

560
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.320
If someone comes in the front,
here's what I'm gonna do.

561
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:13.970
If someone comes in the back,
here's what I'm going to do.

562
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.200
You just do a quick assessment.
That's all I'm saying.
Little [inaudible],

563
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:23.030
the clever general perceives the advantages of terrain instantly.

564
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.380
He gains advantage from the slightest.
Hey look from a tiny marsh,

565
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:32.180
he advances or advances or withdrawals a wing to gain superiority.

566
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.260
He strengthens easily either his left or his right moves ahead to the or to the

567
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:40.110
rear and profits from the Marist.

568
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.360
Bagatelles had to look that word up,
by the way.
What is it?

569
00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.600
Bagatelle Bagatelos it's something of little value.

570
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.380
So what he's saying is if you're good,

571
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.840
you look at even like a little bag of towel,

572
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:57.350
just something that's kind of meaningless and you can take advantage of it.
Yeah.

573
00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.990
Hmm.
If you think about in Jujitsu,
when a guy,

574
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.500
if you're good at Jujitsu and a guy moves his arm just a little bit like her
cry,

575
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.880
I always say like across the center of their chest.
Yes.
If they do that,
they,

576
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:12.620
that's only an inch.
Right.
To be like,
here,
I'm okay here.
I'm not okay.
Yeah.

577
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.820
When you're good,
you can take advantage of that.

578
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.360
That's a good example by the way.
He liked it.
Yeah.

579
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.470
So a little Jujitsu at echo make you happy.
It makes me happy to

580
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.450
back to the book to kick the cooter Ya is required of the general when the enemy

581
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.760
is found in position and must be attacked,

582
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.800
whoever has the best cutea will perceive at first glance that weak spot of the

583
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:35.940
enemy and attack them there.

584
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.530
The ladder is a result of experience

585
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.560
and you can only get experienced through through two things.

586
00:36:47.561 --> 00:36:51.310
Training or actual experience.
Talk about that at the monster.
Yes.

587
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:54.790
Like if you want to be good you can get good through experience.

588
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:55.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

589
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.150
<v 0>Or you can get good through training.</v>

590
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.630
Now there's some things that only experience will give you.
Yeah.

591
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.950
You can really make up a lot of ground just from training.
Yeah.
Good.

592
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.800
Like realistic training.
Really cute.
Yeah.
Yeah.

593
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.010
That's what separates the old martial arts.
Yes.

594
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.520
From the new martial arts through it.
This is the experience.

595
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.150
What's the experience?
Didn't used to be close to a real fight.
Oh,
the training.

596
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:21.600
Yeah.
Yeah.
The old training experiences didn't,
wasn't close to real fight.
Yes.

597
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.870
It was like Kata and remember those old things where it's like,

598
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.930
well when I hit you here it's going to cause this reduced 100% yeah.

599
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.970
That's like part of the practice.

600
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.550
Let me teach you the reactions that you will have.
Yeah,

601
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.950
that's total garbage and actually that's a good way to kind of evolve.
Good.

602
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.440
A good way to evaluate when someone's like,
okay,

603
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:50.010
this is how you deal with this attacker or whatever situation and then they

604
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:55.011
demonstrate it and then it takes a big involvement in like big involvement from

605
00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:59.400
the the tacker person.
Yeah.
You know,
in the demonstration it's like Whoa,

606
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.340
that might not happen.

607
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:08.220
I remember there was people teaching me that if you hit someone in the neck with

608
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.280
like a karate chop,
a straight up,
they were teaching me this.

609
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.950
If you hit someone in the neck,
it's gonna Knock 'em out.

610
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.040
That's what they were saying and that was part of it was part of the whole
thing.

611
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.720
If you get them here Booman wait a minute,

612
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.490
and I was young and I didn't even know Jujitsu at the time,

613
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.240
but I've been a lot of fights.
When I was a kid.
Yeah.
You know,

614
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.950
we were in the streets and I was like,

615
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.490
I don't think that's actually going to work.
Do it to me

616
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.120
and the dude's karate chop

617
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.300
<v 3>and me in the neck.
It didn't,
it didn't have any,
I didn't do anything.</v>

618
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.980
I mean does it give you a little flash?

619
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:43.690
I mean it gives you a look like a little tiny.

620
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.330
He's trying to knock me out now cause I'm calling them out.
Right.

621
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.890
So he's given it all.
Yup.
Yup.

622
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.010
So there are debunked.
Yeah.
Debunked real quick.

623
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.590
You know those ones where the,
wait,
what was it in the front?

624
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.750
Right side of the neck.
Man Side of the neck.
That's going to knock you out.

625
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.770
He told me.
Yeah.

626
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:06.700
You know those ones where it could be the same thing where they hit,
they do it.

627
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.690
It's like a karate chop or so and the hitch put this little bit in the front of

628
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:14.590
your neck and I always see it.
I've never seen it in real life.

629
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.170
Well they do it and they hit you right there and the guy knocks out.

630
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.540
That's not true bro.
It's so that doesn't work.

631
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.630
I've never seen it with Joe Rogan.

632
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.460
Joe Rogan is post something that's like fake [inaudible] and,

633
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.480
and those are slapstick.
I know.
But he's like,

634
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.180
I could literally post these all day long because there's so many of them out

635
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:36.010
there and they're kind of funny.

636
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.510
It's weird though when you start talking about how when Jujitsu first came

637
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.270
around and people had been training in,
you know,

638
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:48.450
calling whatever traditional martial art for 20 years and all of a sudden like a

639
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.420
white belt or a blue belt in Jujitsu would come and wrap them up.

640
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.590
Now I will say this,
if I trained whatever,

641
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.120
some traditional martial art and it's 1986 and you and I get in a fight.

642
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.970
Yeah.
I don't know anything.
Yeah,
you're going to be in trouble.

643
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.990
Cause I at least know how to throw a punch.
Yeah,
possibly.
Yeah,
possibly.

644
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.030
Well,
I mean there's advantages to hitting mitts.
You don't like him for sure.

645
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.860
Punch.
You know how it feels to land a punch that spacial kind of.
Yeah.

646
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.910
Do you have you developed learn how to develop power?
Well,

647
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.810
if we're talking about boxing,

648
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.350
that's a whole different story cause that's a real martial art.

649
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:25.690
And if you've watched people trained,
they're going to get knocked out sometimes.

650
00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.700
But even like a karate situation,
like a guy who can kick a bag,

651
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:35.410
like that guy does know how to by the way.
And there's some forms of karate.

652
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:38.680
What does it?
Um,
yeah,

653
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:42.970
there's some forms of Krave that are legit and they,
they go get after it.

654
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.090
That's what GSPS background was originally in Oak Hill.

655
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.050
She can,
yeah,
it's rough.
It's rough.

656
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.150
No head strikes though.
No head strikes but kind of a bummer.
Yeah,

657
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:57.760
I mean I think it's like,
Hey,
I'm going to grab the Geek,

658
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:02.450
grab your g and kick the crap out of your legs and I didn't punch you in the

659
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:07.540
chest.
It's tough though,
man.
It's,
well,
let's say this,

660
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.110
it's a little bit closer to real,
right?
So it's a little bit closer to real.

661
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:14.800
That's why it has some effectiveness.
The more closer you are to real,

662
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:18.920
the more effective something is.
And that's the way it goes.
Yes sir.
Alright.

663
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.710
Right.
Speaking of training back to the book.

664
00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:28.180
It is on this exact knowledge of the terrain that is regulated,

665
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:32.500
the dispositions of the troops and the order of battle of the army,

666
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.160
so he's,
again,
he's still talking

667
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 0>about being able to look quickly and assess how you're going to set up your</v>

668
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:38.900
troops on the terrain.

669
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:44.890
Our modern formations for combat for the most part are defective because they

670
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:49.460
cast all in the same mold as I really liked this part.

671
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.630
He's saying,
look,
it's not always the same.
The what we do,

672
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.550
what we say right now is,
hey,
everyone lines up here.

673
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.640
Reality is that doesn't work.
We can't do that.

674
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.900
If an army is really to be camped according to the rules of war,

675
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:08.080
it is essential that each arms should be placed in a locality where it can act.

676
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.610
That means you got to have flexibility in what you're doing.

677
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.200
That's what it means.
Now he talks about

678
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.290
detachments,
how and why they should be made.

679
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.540
There is an ancient rule of war that cannot be repeated often enough.

680
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.170
Hold your forces together,
make no detachments,

681
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.390
and when you want to fight the enemy,

682
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.160
reassemble all your forces and sees every advantage to make sure of your

683
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:37.994
success.

684
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:43.430
This rule is so certain that most of the generals who have neglected it have

685
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:47.900
been punished promptly.
So he's saying don't separate your forces.
And we,

686
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:50.540
I've talked about this before because that's what I believed.

687
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.450
Are there times where you separate your forces?
Yes,
there are.

688
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.770
You have to be prudent.
You have to be smart.
And He,
well,
here's the dichotomy.

689
00:42:57.771 --> 00:43:02.270
He says the same thing.
The subject of detachments is extremely delicate.

690
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.490
None should be made except for good reasons,
right?

691
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.570
None should be made except for good reasons.
If you're acting offensively,

692
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.780
an open enemy country and our only master of some strong point.

693
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.080
So
again,
this is something I talk about all the time.

694
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.420
Once you've got your s forces separated on the battlefield,

695
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.430
it can get problematic very,
very quickly.

696
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.430
So keep your forces consolidated as much as you can.

697
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.280
How does that translate into the business world?

698
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.090
Well be careful when you start breaking off little chunks,

699
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.120
chunks of your company to go and explore new territory because when you break

700
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:44.630
off chunks and you get a little bit weaker,
so don't do that.

701
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.500
Well when you do it.
I'm not saying don't do it.
He's not saying don't do it.

702
00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.170
When you do it,
understand the risks that are being taken.

703
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.330
<v 4>That's what you have to do.
Yeah.
And that's good.
It is funny like you,</v>

704
00:43:55.331 --> 00:43:58.680
you kinda how you said that where it's like no,
you know,

705
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.720
basically the idea that it's like this is the hard and fast rule,
but yeah.

706
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:03.590
You know kind of thing.
Yeah.

707
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.560
That is a good way to put it because if you don't say it like that or you don't

708
00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:11.280
present it like that,
it kind of in a way makes you think,

709
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.550
why can bend that rule then,
you know?
And it kind of,

710
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.420
it's like to the people might be too cavalier cavalier about the whole thing

711
00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.140
about making the exception,
you know?
You're right.

712
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.740
<v 0>I've got a question for you.
How does this apply to,
did</v>

713
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:30.210
<v 4>you Jitsu
like what a specific move.
Okay.</v>

714
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:32.040
So actually use your example,

715
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.680
which has stuck with me from the first time you said it,
by the way,

716
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.910
that don't don't

717
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.430
<v 0>your elbow across your midline of your body,
your mail list,</v>

718
00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.260
like we were going from the game.
You're like,
okay,

719
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.350
<v 4>see you gave an example of this,
but okay,
so the you,
uh,</v>

720
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.570
you should never put your arm across your chest.
You should never do it

721
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.540
every once in a while.

722
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.620
And I'll almost say not even every once in a while I'll just say there is an

723
00:44:57.621 --> 00:44:59.090
exception where you know,

724
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:03.830
and I think you had a situation with deans where you were like,
he messed you up,

725
00:45:03.831 --> 00:45:04.670
but you thought about it.
Yeah,

726
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.180
<v 0>no,
no.
He told me later,
Oh,</v>

727
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.460
here you have to do something that I've told you never to do.
Here.

728
00:45:10.461 --> 00:45:15.110
You have to do it.
It's from the mouth.
It's from you.
Turn so far that you,

729
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.670
that there's an escape.
Where I was going when I was going to talk about this.

730
00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.970
Well,
the way the did to just do this specifically,

731
00:45:22.971 --> 00:45:24.890
you're talking about something else that does apply to Jiu Jitsu.

732
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.660
This applies to Jujitsu.
Picture this,
you're,
you're a one body,
right?

733
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.430
When you're doing Jujitsu,

734
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.940
it is highly advantageous to keep your arms and your legs close to your body,

735
00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:40.130
especially your arms,
right?
You don't stick your arm out,
right?

736
00:45:40.131 --> 00:45:41.210
What happens when you stick your arm out?

737
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.880
It's out there by itself and it's taken over.

738
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.660
It's our mock tests get taken over yet.
So,
so you don't do that.
You can,

739
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:51.860
you keep your arms in close to your body.
And that's where you,
Fabio,

740
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:56.060
Fabio Santos,
he used to say,
make like your arms come out of your belly.
Oh yeah.

741
00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.450
You don't even have shoulders.
Your elbows just come out of your belly.

742
00:45:59.451 --> 00:46:02.840
That's how you should keep your arms.
And I,
I've always obeyed that rule.

743
00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.110
Accept there are times when yes,

744
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:07.970
you got to reach out and you got to make another move happen.

745
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:12.350
So as much as you can,
you keep your forces consolidated as a body,
as a human.

746
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.810
Occasionally you got to step on that.
So,

747
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.950
<v 4>but yeah,
if you,
when you put it like that,
it's a,</v>

748
00:46:20.951 --> 00:46:24.460
it's pretty clear that it's like,
hey,
this isn't like some ambiguous rule.

749
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.240
That's the rule.
Keep,
keep your arms in.
That's the rule.

750
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:33.440
And then remember the golden child you ever watched the golden child anywhere

751
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.800
for,
this is called the golden child,
this old school eighties movie.

752
00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:39.190
But he was like,
hey,
stay on the path.
He was like,
hey,

753
00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:42.640
you got to walk on these like stumps in the dark and get this glass of water,

754
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:46.570
this Buddha thing I think.
And he's like,
Hey,
stay on the path.

755
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:50.050
You got to stay on the path.
That's it.
That's the only advice I can give you.

756
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:53.590
I think there's something else.
But that was it.
So he stays in the bath,
right?

757
00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.960
Then there's this weird rope bridge and he,

758
00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:00.460
right as he gets off the rope bridge burst into flames and he's like,
Hey,

759
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.370
I thought you told me to stay on the path.
And he said,
yes,

760
00:47:03.371 --> 00:47:06.580
but you got to know when to break the rules there.
That's it.
Right?

761
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:10.030
Epic lessons learned from Eddie Murphy,
Murphy Golden Child.

762
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.490
<v 0>True.
Very true.
All right,
so no problem.</v>

763
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.310
We can come up people from different angles that I'm sure there's someone,

764
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.780
this isn't a podcast,
it was like,
oh,
now I get it.
It's true.

765
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:26.600
Whoever you are out there,
Echo Charles has got your back.
Okay.

766
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:33.340
All right.
Uh,
this is a great section.
This is a great section.

767
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.940
The talents that a general must have.

768
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.310
And then it talks about

769
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:46.270
spies and reduces and stratagems of war.
But here we go.

770
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:50.680
Talents that a general must have a perfect general,

771
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.640
like Plato's republic is a figment of the imagination,

772
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.610
either would be admirable,

773
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:02.850
but is not characteristic of human nature to produce beings exempt from human

774
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:05.650
weakness and defects.

775
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.440
The finest medallions have a reverse side.

776
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.040
Dang,
I liked that.
So yeah,

777
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:19.180
there's no such thing as a perfect leader and everyone has weaknesses and,

778
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.840
but then he says the finest medallions have a reverse side.

779
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.390
And I don't know if you remember me saying this,
I've said it before.

780
00:48:25.391 --> 00:48:26.224
I'll say it again.

781
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.330
Oftentimes people's biggest strength is also their biggest weakness,

782
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:31.991
right?

783
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:35.320
So if you've got a guy that's super aggressive and that's what makes him such a

784
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:39.610
good for a certain job,
they also can be too aggressive.

785
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.980
And so there's a bunch of examples like that,

786
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.320
but the finest medallions have a reverse side.

787
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.220
Even if you think about what your personal best quality is like you gotta watch

788
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:52.600
out because it can be out of balance if you,
if you let it go too far.

789
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.470
Now he says this,
but in spite of this awareness of our PIR imperfection,

790
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.390
it is not less necessary to consider all the different talents that are needed

791
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.160
by an accomplished general.

792
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:11.800
These are the models that one attempts to imitate and which one would not try to

793
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:14.710
approach if they were not presented to us.
So he's like,
hey look,

794
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:15.790
even though we can't be perfect,

795
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.690
we should still look and see what perfect is so that we can at least try and get

796
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:24.250
there.
Nothing wrong with that.
Here we go.

797
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

798
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:31.010
<v 0>It is essential that a general should dissemble while appearing to be occupied.</v>

799
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:37.640
So what he's saying is you got to detach a little bit working with the mind.

800
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:41.600
And working with the body and he goes into a good list right here.

801
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:47.090
Ceaseless least suspicious while affecting tranquility.

802
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.170
So you act like you're calm,

803
00:49:49.171 --> 00:49:52.170
but you should constantly be suspicious of what is happening.

804
00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.630
Here's a solid one,

805
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.720
saving of the blood of his soldiers and not squandering it except for the most

806
00:50:00.091 --> 00:50:01.590
important interests.

807
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:10.550
Take care of your people,
informed of everything that makes sense.

808
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:14.450
Always on the lookout to deceive the enemy.

809
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.600
And careful not to be deceived himself.

810
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.920
Makes sense in a word.

811
00:50:21.921 --> 00:50:25.520
He should be more than industrious active,

812
00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:31.060
an indefatigable
not forgetting one thing to execute,

813
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.740
execute another and above all,

814
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.890
not despising those sorts of little details which pertain to great projects.

815
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.340
So you gotta be more than just like hardworking.

816
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.480
You gotta be more than active.

817
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.580
And he goes into a little clarity around some of these.

818
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.000
Here we go back to the dissimulation of the general consists of the important

819
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.450
art of hiding his thoughts.
Now this is,

820
00:51:05.451 --> 00:51:09.200
this is one of those things where people start to freak out a little bit
because,

821
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.900
because these days,
everyone throws around the transparency word hi,

822
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.170
everyone should be transparent.
It's like actually no,
you,

823
00:51:17.171 --> 00:51:21.530
you shouldn't be transparent all the time.
Yeah.
And in fact,
you know,

824
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:23.840
that's why I talk about controlling your emotions all the time.

825
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.570
And that's why it's so powerful.
If,
if,

826
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.630
if you're getting mad at someone and you show them that you're getting mad,

827
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.780
well then you're giving away your hand and now they're going to get mad at you

828
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:37.220
and it's just a problem.
So you need to,
you need to not do that.

829
00:51:37.221 --> 00:51:41.260
You need to not be transparent.
Yeah.
And this,

830
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.990
he goes into brilliant explanations as to why you can't just be transparent,

831
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.310
hiding UDB hiding his thoughts.
Okay.

832
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.560
He should be constantly on the stage and should appear most tranquil,

833
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.150
most tranquil when he is most occupied for the whole army.

834
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:03.500
Speculates on his looks,
on his gestures and on his mood.

835
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.280
So when you're walking around and you're panicking,
guess what?

836
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.340
Everyone on the team is looking at you going,
what's going on?

837
00:52:10.341 --> 00:52:12.540
Why is the boss panicking?
Yeah.

838
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.790
If you seem to be more thoughtful than customary,

839
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.890
the officer's will believe he is incubating some project of consequence.

840
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.620
If his manners uneasy,

841
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.670
they believe that affairs are going badly and they often imagine worse than the

842
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:32.840
truth.
You gotta stay calm.
You've got to put on,

843
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.920
you've got to put on the little mask over your little emotions.

844
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:39.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

845
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:39.900
<v 0>And he says the,</v>

846
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.900
these suppositions become the rumors of the army and this army gossip is certain

847
00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:48.790
to pass over to the enemy's camp.
It is necessary,
therefore,

848
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.020
that the personal conduct of the general should be so well reasoned that his

849
00:52:53.021 --> 00:52:57.400
dissimulation will be so profound that no one can ever penetrate it.

850
00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:00.110
<v 1>Okay?</v>

851
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.660
<v 0>If he fears that he cannot master his expression.</v>

852
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.640
So no one should ever know what you're thinking

853
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.810
unless you want them to know that.
Right.
Unless you want to give it to him.

854
00:53:09.811 --> 00:53:13.650
Cause I say this all the time,
you can't just be without emotions.
Yeah,
you can.

855
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:17.340
If you,
if,
if you come to me and you're all mad,
I just can't be like calm down.

856
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:21.210
No,
I can't do that yet.
I need to,
I need,
yeah,
I need to give you some of that.

857
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.210
Yeah.
So I'm not saying never be emotional,
but you better control them.

858
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:28.830
They better be the you want to show.
Yeah.
And then he says this,

859
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:32.850
this is funny
talking about the,
uh,
the general,

860
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.970
if he fears that he cannot master his expression,

861
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.200
either he can pretend to be ill or he should make an excuse to some personal

862
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:45.040
trouble to explain his appearance to the public,
you know?
Yeah.

863
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.030
That's pretty funny.
Yeah.
That's actually a,
when you think about it,

864
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:51.760
like a lot of us kind of do that,
like,
uh,
like,
uh,
you know,

865
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.390
I'm just tired or something like that.
You know?

866
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:58.710
Like if like if a girl's crying or something or something like this.

867
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.550
Oh No,
I just had something in my eye.
It's kind of the same thing.
They're like,

868
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:03.750
oh,
I'm getting dusty in here.

869
00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.510
There's something else wrong with me that's understandable.
You know,

870
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.510
it's not me crying or nothing.
Yeah.

871
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:14.400
I was going to bring up an excuse,
but that's different.

872
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.550
You don't want to use for your,
you know,

873
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.450
when you're doing Jujitsu with someone and they're like,
yeah,
you know,

874
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:22.910
I just got,
that's all you hear.

875
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.750
Big excuse,
excuse,
excuse.
Don't tell me that.

876
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.703
But that's,

877
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.330
that's interesting advice that shows you how important it is if you're,

878
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:39.060
if you're willing to like skip work because you don't want people to see your

879
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:42.840
freaking out.
I don't recommend that.
But Hey,
I can't come into the damn sick.

880
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.220
Yeah.
I think opposite actually happens.
Hung over.
Yeah,

881
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:51.780
we'll definitely look at it.
You know what,
uh,
people in the teams,

882
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:56.370
I would say people do the opposite and they have like problems at home.

883
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.040
Instead of my calling and saying like,
Hey,

884
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.880
I can't make it say what they're really doing is like crying because they were a

885
00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:06.360
big scrap what their old lady.
All right.
Uh,

886
00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.630
this is,
this is brilliant right here.
Above all,

887
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.600
when he has received some bad news,

888
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.630
he should treat it as a trifle and show the number of resources which he has to

889
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:22.120
retrieve it.
It's basically good.
That's,

890
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.800
that's saying good when somebody,

891
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:27.700
what do you have when you received some bad news?
Oh,
good.
Bring it.

892
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:29.950
He's saying the exact same thing

893
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.750
while never despising his enemy in the bottom of his heart.

894
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:40.880
He should never speak of him except with scorn and compete.

895
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.580
And compare carefully the advantages of our troops over the others.

896
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.653
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

897
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.930
<v 0>So he's actually saying,
look,
he's doing the opposite.</v>

898
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.910
He's like,
I don't even hate my enemy,

899
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.050
but I'll never let anyone know that I don't completely despise him.
Right,
right.

900
00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.950
That's pretty funny.
This is good.

901
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.950
If some detachment is unfortunate in the war,

902
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.480
he should examine the cause and after having determined the reason for the
fault,

903
00:56:08.481 --> 00:56:11.840
he should instruct his officers concerning it in this fashion,

904
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:13.250
a few minor misfortunes,

905
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.180
we'll never discourage the troops and they will always preserve the feeling of

906
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:20.360
confidence in their ability.
So when something goes wrong,
you don't freak out.

907
00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.501
You just look,
okay,

908
00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:24.160
well let's take a look at what went wrong there and then we'll fix it and then

909
00:56:24.161 --> 00:56:25.030
it won't be a problem anymore.

910
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.330
That's how you handle a problem when someone doesn't do well.

911
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.451
Back to the book.

912
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:36.010
Secrecy is so necessary for a general that the ancients have even said that

913
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:39.190
there was not a human being able to hold his tongue.

914
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.260
But here's the reason for that.

915
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.050
If you form the finest plans in the world but divulge them,

916
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:48.580
your enemy will learn about them and then it will be very easy for him to Perry

917
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:49.414
them.

918
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.910
The general plan of the campaign should be communicated at most to the officer

919
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:58.660
responsible for supplies and the rest of the details should not be told to

920
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:01.450
officers except when the time has come to execute them.

921
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.640
When there are generals detached and you must write to them,

922
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:11.260
the letters should be completely in code.
If your enemy intercepts one,

923
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.880
you will not have betrayed yourself.

924
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.240
This is clearly something that applies to that type of warfare back in the day,

925
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:22.030
but it applies to life as well.

926
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.420
I mean when you opened your mouth you might as well just,

927
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:30.010
you might as well just put it on Twitter cause everyone's going to know about
it.

928
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.150
Yeah.
Yeah.

929
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:35.830
The kind of wear and they always say before they say something of consequence,

930
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.590
they'll say,
hey,
don't tell anyone this but hey,

931
00:57:38.591 --> 00:57:42.760
I'm going to do this or I feel this or whatever and then sure enough they go and

932
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:45.130
it's the same thing.
Hey,
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

933
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:49.270
but you know Blah Blah Blah and then yeah,
sure enough that's bad.
Bad,
bad,
bad.

934
00:57:49.271 --> 00:57:52.870
Completely just got told.
I'm not supposed to tell you this.
Yeah,
that's why.

935
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:58.610
Because you don't say those old hardcore band park and then I think lizard,

936
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.840
I think it was wrecking crew from Boston and they used to have tee shirts.

937
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.500
Just big letters on the tee shirts on the back.
Trust no one

938
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:14.410
I hadn't won.
Yeah,
that actually sounds familiar.

939
00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:16.270
Like I might have seen a shirt like that before.

940
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:17.620
I don't know if you saw that shirt.

941
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:19.270
Maybe other people made it cause they probably,

942
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.070
there's probably like 12 of those turns back.

943
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:28.170
Echo Charles would have seen on the island of Hawaii can 88 probably not loose

944
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:30.640
lips sink ships.

945
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.290
So we do say that you are correct

946
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.571
back to the book.

947
00:58:37.571 --> 00:58:41.470
It is absolutely necessary to change your methods often end to imagine new

948
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:44.410
decoys.
If you always act in the same manner,

949
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.090
you will soon be interpreted for you are surrounded with 50,000 curious who

950
00:58:49.091 --> 00:58:52.360
wants to know everything that you think and how you are going to lead them.

951
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.040
That's pretty cool.
It's interesting.
What,

952
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.840
what's kind of interesting about that is he's not even talking about the enemy.

953
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.250
He's talking about your own people.
You know,
you got to think of new things.

954
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.920
Um,
and this is clearly,

955
00:59:05.921 --> 00:59:09.430
this is something I always try to explain people in Jujitsu is the thing that

956
00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:13.630
you're going for is not going to work.
You,
you have to use the,
you have to use,

957
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:14.620
create new decoys.

958
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.140
You have to try new things or else you're not going to catch people.

959
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.900
It's a way it works.
Now here we get nick,

960
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.870
I'm glad that I'm the Lafe and I just got done writing a book called the

961
00:59:23.871 --> 00:59:26.480
dichotomy of leadership because here we go.

962
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:31.820
The commander should practice kindness and severity

963
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.580
should appear friendly to shoulders,
speak to them on the march,

964
00:59:37.581 --> 00:59:38.990
visit them while they are cooking.

965
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:41.900
Ask them if they wellcare Ford and alleviate their needs.

966
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:45.830
If they have any officer's without experiencing war should be treated kindly.

967
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:47.900
They're good.
Action should be praised.

968
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.880
Small request should be granted them and they should not be treated in a manner,

969
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:57.860
in an overbearing manner,
manner.
So there you go.
It's like that's all good,

970
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:02.720
right?
That's the kindness part.
Yeah.
Which we're,
we're down with that.

971
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.430
And that's again,

972
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:07.460
that's why when I talked about why people would listen to this guy,

973
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.680
one of the reasons,
cause he took care of his people.
Yeah.

974
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.320
He was out there seeing what problems they had.

975
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.850
How can we get those problems fixed

976
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.570
and then he says,

977
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.290
but severity is maintained about everything regarding the surface.

978
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.660
The negligent officer's punished.

979
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:27.530
The man who answers back is made to feel your severity by being reprimanded with

980
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:30.320
authoritative error.
That superiority,
Gibbs,

981
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.620
pillaging or argumentative soldiers or those who,

982
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.580
whose obedience is not immediate,
immediate should be punished.

983
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.360
So there you go.
Dichotomy.
You got to hold the line,
but at the same time,

984
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.580
don't hold that line so tight that it snaps,
which you can do.

985
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.570
The general can even discuss the war with some of his core commanders who are

986
01:00:55.571 --> 01:00:58.960
the most intelligent and permit them to express their sentiments freely and

987
01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:01.330
conversation.
So when I was talking about how he was just,

988
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.410
everyone listened to me,
blind obedience is water.
Recard here he's saying,
no,

989
01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:06.520
actually listened to your people.

990
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.040
If you find some good things among what they say,

991
01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.540
you should not remark about it then,
but make use of it when this has been done,

992
01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:19.030
you should speak about it in the presence of many others.

993
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.000
It was so and so who had this idea?
Praise him for it.

994
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:26.020
This modesty will gain the general,

995
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.390
the friendship of good thinking men.

996
01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:33.400
And he will more easily find persons who will speak their sentiments sincerely

997
01:01:33.401 --> 01:01:37.060
to him.
Boom.
So that thing,

998
01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:40.900
that macho thing at the beginning was not true.
This is what's true.
Yeah.

999
01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.300
You wanna you wanna have,
he's,
he's,

1000
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.600
the reason that he's doing this is because he wants people to speak their mind

1001
01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:48.370
to him.
That's the reason why he's doing this.

1002
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:50.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1003
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:55.940
<v 0>Think about that.
It's also,
it's also interesting that,</v>

1004
01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:57.500
cause I've,
I say this,

1005
01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:00.560
you're heard me talk about how like it's whenever someone's right and I'm wrong,

1006
01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:03.950
I'm happy because if you're right and I'm wrong,
I can be like,
yeah man,

1007
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:07.550
I call it,
that's a really good job.
And that's really pointed that out.
And it,

1008
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.440
it shows you that I'm humble.
Yeah.
Cause otherwise you're just like,
God dude,

1009
01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:15.320
Jack thinks he's right off of,
no,
no,
heck no man.
You're right.
I'm wrong.

1010
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:19.710
That's good job.
Hey,
appreciate you,
uh,
straighten me out on that,
right?
Yes,

1011
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.070
you are

1012
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.050
<v 3>right,
actually.
Yeah.</v>

1013
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.130
And so that's what he's saying is it actually gives you the opportunity to be

1014
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.440
modest and to be humble.
Yeah.
Because sometimes it can be hard when you're sure.

1015
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.270
Right.
All the time.
Yeah.
And you're used to that feeling and yet,

1016
01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.400
and the reason I think it's kind of funny cause I can imagine or I can kind of

1017
01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:43.390
remember a few times where you're like,
yeah,
yeah,
you are correct.
You are crying.

1018
01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.540
You'll say that you are correct.
It won't be like,

1019
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:49.070
I'm kind of happy when you're right.
That's what I feel.
I feel like,
yeah,

1020
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.340
I to talk just a little something.
Just not small,
small,
but it's there.

1021
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.250
It's something.
I don't know.
It's like,
all right,
well that's,

1022
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.430
that's one of the one on the tactics I guess,
but it's still work.

1023
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:03.270
So I guess my overheads that,
am I over here just manipulating you,

1024
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.250
put it this way.
I'm glad to be here.
You know?
So,

1025
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:11.400
and that helps that question for you,
and we've talked about this before,
if,

1026
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:15.040
if the reason I was doing it was so that I could get something out of you,
right,

1027
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:17.720
that would benefit me and not benefit in hurting you,
then yeah.

1028
01:03:17.721 --> 01:03:20.940
To be manipulation.
But if it's like,
hey,
we're just trying to build,

1029
01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:23.580
we're trying to make something happen.
Yeah,
yeah.

1030
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.600
Then it's all good in my opinion.
Kind of gives me room to talk to,

1031
01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:30.960
which is empowering,
you know?
Sure.
Hey,
I abuse it from time to time.

1032
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.910
I understand birds.
There was,

1033
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:37.350
would you say the last podcast was an example of that?
It was bordering on abuse.

1034
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:40.460
I got dressed.
I brushed against the line

1035
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:46.430
over the line.
No real it was it the body,
my body moving through space,

1036
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.273
what it was.

1037
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.530
I drink some of that discipline and I was on that white tea is listen to this.

1038
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:55.800
I'm just saying,
you know what you need to do right now.
Own it.

1039
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.210
The white in business one that I got your brain firing correctly.

1040
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.910
I think you are correct.
We're going to cut you off.

1041
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:04.080
There can be like don't give them anymore.

1042
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.040
I told you I've been pounding that stuff.
That can,
Woah.
All right,

1043
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.070
well let's tasty.
No.
Did a simulated under simulated.
Back to the book.

1044
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:15.150
The principal tasks I ask of

1045
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.160
<v 0>the general is mental large projects and major arrangements,</v>

1046
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:25.150
but since the best dispositions become useless,
if they are not executed,

1047
01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.010
it is essential that the general should be industrious to see whether his orders

1048
01:04:30.011 --> 01:04:34.570
are executed or not.
Again,
just cause you say go make this happen,

1049
01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:35.800
it doesn't mean it's going to happen.

1050
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:38.710
You've got to get out there and make sure it happens.

1051
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:45.100
Moving on,
here's a,
here's a line.
You can just,
you can just,

1052
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.050
you can just print this up.

1053
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:51.850
Skepticism is the mother of security.

1054
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.880
That's legit.
Even though only fools trust their enemies.

1055
01:04:57.881 --> 01:05:02.860
Prudent person's never do the generals,
the principal's sentinel of his army.

1056
01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:07.090
Think about that.
The general is the principle sentinel of the army.

1057
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.080
The guy that's the guy that's keeping everyone safe is the general.

1058
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.510
He's the primary watch stander for everyone.

1059
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.980
He should always be careful of its preservation and that is

1060
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.660
<v 3>never exposed to misfortune.</v>

1061
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:25.420
One falls into a feeling of security after battles when one is drunk with

1062
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:29.500
success and when one believes the enemy completely disheartened.

1063
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.910
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1064
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.990
<v 3>so we all know that.
You know when that happens.
You know what Jeff Higgs told me?</v>

1065
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.440
If you tap a guy out,
like if it's,
if you have someone that like legit,
you have,

1066
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.810
you have battles with on the map and you tap them out,
you,

1067
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.960
you need to step it up.
What?
They're going to step it up.
Bringing in a year,

1068
01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:50.920
I'll relax.
You're all celebrating your victory.
Don't do it.
Step it up.

1069
01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:54.820
They're coming hard.
Yeah,
you do that to me all the time.
Yes sir.
Can I

1070
01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.450
please get crazy?
Hey,
back to that.

1071
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:04.000
The one you were saying before this about,
you know,

1072
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.090
how like you let them talk or whatever the opposite of that is if,

1073
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:10.751
if you know,

1074
01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:13.630
let's say when he subordinates or whoever like says something to you and then

1075
01:06:13.631 --> 01:06:18.631
you respond with the opposite of what you do with this either tone or words that

1076
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:21.610
basically say,
Oh,
I already knew that you already knew that.

1077
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:25.510
You don't have to tell me kind of thing.
I already knew that people will do that.

1078
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:27.160
You can just on a real small,

1079
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:31.270
even on a social level sometimes and it does make you not want to talk to them

1080
01:06:31.271 --> 01:06:33.450
that much.
Yeah,
for sure.
The um,

1081
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.170
the idea of saying I already knew that is not good.

1082
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.630
Yeah,
that's an extreme case
Tom can say.

1083
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.660
But also I already knew that you didn't know it.

1084
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:49.930
If you would've known it,
you would've said it most likely,

1085
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:53.320
like that's an 80% sure.
20% of the time you might be like,

1086
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:58.090
Hey Jocko arm locks work from the garden too.
I'd be like,
I would even then,

1087
01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:00.520
I wouldn't say I already knew that.
I'd be like,
yeah,

1088
01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.380
that's definitely good to consider.
Yeah,
no,

1089
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.640
that's sort of a general principle that I totally agree with.
You know,

1090
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:10.390
something like that.
Just not,
I already knew that,
or we'll of course,
or,

1091
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.910
or you know,
de that's extreme,
but well,

1092
01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:14.470
of course that's the one where they're like,

1093
01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:17.860
you know what forces those words out of your mouth,
your ego.

1094
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.680
It's your ego because you don't want that person to have that piece of

1095
01:07:20.681 --> 01:07:25.060
information that you didn't have.
So I already knew.
Yeah.
It's hard.

1096
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.770
Yeah.
I mean,
I can't say that it's not natural.
I mean,
it feels,
you know,

1097
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.530
especially if you did already know it,
it's like,
oh,

1098
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:34.390
I don't want him to think that.
I didn't know that one.

1099
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:37.870
I really did kind of thing.
Like I don't want him to think I'm like not know.

1100
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.000
What you need to do is you need to trust,

1101
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.010
you need to trust the nature of the world tens.

1102
01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:48.880
The nature of the world is that you will eventually be seen as someone that

1103
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:50.530
actually does know that.
Yeah.
Clearly,

1104
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:54.520
you know that trust the nature of the world,
that's the nature of the world.

1105
01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:57.790
All right.
Here's another situation.

1106
01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.610
One falls into a feeling of security.

1107
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.170
When a skillful enemy amuses you with pretend piece proposals,

1108
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.050
one falls into a feeling of security by mental laziness and through lack of

1109
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:13.660
calculation concerning the intentions of the enemy.

1110
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.080
<v 0>Mental laziness just say no to the mental laziness to proceed and it,</v>

1111
01:08:21.961 --> 01:08:26.250
and now he gives instructions on how to overcome these situations to proceed

1112
01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:30.030
properly.
It is necessary to put oneself in his place and say,

1113
01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:34.830
what would I do if I were the enemy?
What project could I form?

1114
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:38.670
Make as many as possible of these projects?

1115
01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:43.830
Examine them all and above all,
reflect on the means to avert them.

1116
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:44.790
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1117
01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:46.710
<v 0>if you find yourself unable,</v>

1118
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:48.230
<v 1>okay,</v>

1119
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:52.490
<v 0>put it right at once.
So look it even when you win and go,
okay,
well,</v>

1120
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.960
if I were the enemy,
what would I do right now?

1121
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.960
And if you can't figure out how to solve what you think the enemy is going to
do,

1122
01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.100
then correct it right now.

1123
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:01.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1124
01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.020
<v 0>Often through an hour's neglect and unfortunate delay loses a reputation that</v>

1125
01:09:08.321 --> 01:09:11.200
has been acquired with a great deal of labor.

1126
01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.680
Always presume that the enemy has dangerous designs and always be four handed

1127
01:09:17.261 --> 01:09:18.130
with the remedy.

1128
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:24.200
So you got to be careful of what the enemy is going to do.

1129
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:26.960
You've always got to imagine that the enemy is ready for you.

1130
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:29.090
Gotta be ready for that.
That's gotta be your mindset.

1131
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.770
And that's an extreme mindset.

1132
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:34.910
Like the enemies always waiting and ready and you can go too far with that

1133
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:38.810
mindset.
There's a dichotomy and here's the dichotomy of it back to the book,

1134
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:44.000
but do not let these calculations make you timid.

1135
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.253
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1136
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.550
<v 0>So just cause you're thinking about the enemy might do this,</v>

1137
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:49.710
the enemy might do this and but yet could overwhelm you mean like,
you know what?

1138
01:09:49.711 --> 01:09:52.110
Screw it.
I'm not going to do anything.
Yeah,
no,

1139
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.570
don't let these calculations make you timid.

1140
01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.530
Circumspection is only good to a certain point.

1141
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1142
01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:03.780
<v 0>A rule that I practice myself and which I have always found good,</v>

1143
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.120
is that in order to have rest,

1144
01:10:06.121 --> 01:10:10.500
oneself is necessary to keep the enemy occupied.

1145
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:15.750
If you want to rest yourself,
you've got to keep the enemy occupied.
Got God.

1146
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:18.750
Put your competitive,
you've got to put your competitor on their heels.

1147
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:21.540
If you want to get any restaurant,
you got to put your competitor on their heels.

1148
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:25.380
Then he says this throws them back on the defensive and once they are placed

1149
01:10:25.381 --> 01:10:30.360
that way,
they cannot raise up again during the entire campaign.
You just go,

1150
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.330
you,
when you get that lead on someone,
you put them down.

1151
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.250
That's one of the thing I noticed in MMA.
Like someone will say,
Oh,

1152
01:10:38.251 --> 01:10:41.610
you won that last round.
You got this.
No,
no,

1153
01:10:41.611 --> 01:10:45.470
actually don't say that to your corner.
Yeah.
You like,
Hey,

1154
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.470
that guy's going to step it up.
He's going to come out harder.

1155
01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:51.930
This is the round that he's wanting.
He's coming after you.

1156
01:10:51.931 --> 01:10:54.690
You need to step it up.
You didn't win that round.
Especially in MMA.

1157
01:10:54.691 --> 01:10:57.660
You never know who won the round because the judges are so horrible.
Kidney.

1158
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1159
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:07.130
<v 0>Continuing on back to the book.
If you wish to be loved by your soldiers,
husband,</v>

1160
01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.500
their blood and do not lead them to slaughter.
So that's a,

1161
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:16.080
that's an obvious statement,
right?
But he talks about that in detail.

1162
01:11:16.081 --> 01:11:16.914
That's important.

1163
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:22.590
They can be spared by shortening the battle by means that I shall indicate by

1164
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:27.210
the skill with which you choose your points of attack in the weakest localities,

1165
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.710
in not breaking your head against impracticable things,

1166
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.980
which are ridiculous to attempt in not fatiguing the soldiers uselessly and

1167
01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:40.560
inspiring him in sieges and battles.

1168
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:41.940
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1169
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:46.330
<v 0>so he's saying you got to take care of your,
your men.
You've got a husband,</v>

1170
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.060
their blood and not lead them to slaughter.

1171
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.600
But the way you do that is by attacking the week locations is I,

1172
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.240
you know,
how many times do you hear me say like,
don't blink.

1173
01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:00.330
Bang your head against the wall.
47 times.
Yeah,
47 okay,
that's the limit.

1174
01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.850
Or 48 you've got to find a different way.
That's what he's saying.

1175
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.690
Don't just keep banging your head,
banging your head against impracticable.

1176
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:08.280
Things don't do that.

1177
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:16.300
And here he says this,
when you seem to be most project goal of soldiers,

1178
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:21.220
blood,
you spirit,
however,
by supporting your attacks.
Well,

1179
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:26.500
by pushing them with the greatest vigor to deprive time of the means of

1180
01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:30.130
augmenting your losses.
So what is he saying there?
He's saying that the times,

1181
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.140
sometimes it might seem like you're being most wasteful,
hmm.

1182
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.350
Of of the blood of your soldiers.

1183
01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:39.630
But it's in those times where it seems that way,
the weight,

1184
01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:43.310
the reason it seems that way is because you're being super aggressive just

1185
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.860
because you're,
you're setting up your tax,

1186
01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.440
you're supporting them well and you're,

1187
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.410
you're being default aggressive husband,

1188
01:12:50.411 --> 01:12:53.590
their blood that's like take care of care of you.
We'll take care of it.

1189
01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:56.410
Like it's like it's yours.
Yup.
Take care of it.

1190
01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.870
And then be saying,

1191
01:12:58.871 --> 01:13:03.040
when you seem to be most prodigal of your soldiers blood,

1192
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:05.710
that means when you're wasteful of your soldiers blood.
Hmm.

1193
01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:09.670
You spare it by supporting your tax.
Well that makes sense.

1194
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:13.480
By pushing them with the greatest vigor.
That makes sense.

1195
01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.880
Cause if you guys are going at it half ass,

1196
01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:17.580
guess what's not going to work out well for him?

1197
01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.593
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1198
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.480
<v 0>Your rules of war are of great usefulness or sorry,</v>

1199
01:13:27.701 --> 01:13:32.000
Russa's of war are of great usefulness.
Roosters of war,

1200
01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:35.800
so this is like tricks,
right?
They are detours.
Listen to this,

1201
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.980
they are detours which often lead more surely to the objective than the wide

1202
01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:43.330
road which goes straight ahead.

1203
01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:45.390
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1204
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:46.810
<v 0>so what does he say in there?</v>

1205
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.820
Don't do the frontal assault on the enemy's strong point.

1206
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:53.730
Use tricks,

1207
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:58.590
claims flanks and here he just breaks it down.

1208
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:02.220
Animals have only one method of acting,

1209
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.970
but intelligent men have inexhaustible resources.

1210
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:08.730
These resources are infinite in number.

1211
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.320
Their object is to hide your veritable design and to catch the enemy and the

1212
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:15.700
trap you have prepared for him.

1213
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.210
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1214
01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:22.140
<v 0>Thus the contrary of what one wishes to do is feigned.</v>

1215
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:24.440
If you open the campaign,

1216
01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.730
you have your troops march and counter march so that the enemy cannot learn the

1217
01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:33.350
locality where you assemble.
If it is a question of capturing cities,

1218
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:38.530
you and camp in a place which makes him fearful for two or three cities of his

1219
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:43.910
at the same time being attacked.
If he hastens to one flank,

1220
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.830
throw yourself on the other.

1221
01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:51.320
This is obvious stuff.
Seems obvious,

1222
01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:57.320
but what are you doing when you're,
when you're setting up a triangle,
right?

1223
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:58.790
You're,
you got the arm bar,
you,

1224
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:02.000
you put the person in the threat of the arm bar and the triangle and the sweep

1225
01:15:02.001 --> 01:15:03.570
all at the same time.
You,
you,

1226
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:06.770
you set up camp in between three cities and they don't know which one you're

1227
01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:08.720
going to attack and they got to defend all of them.

1228
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.520
Are they going to try to defend all of them?

1229
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:14.120
So when they hasting to defend the arm bar,

1230
01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:19.460
that's when you throw yourself through this triangle,
that triangle,
that triangle

1231
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.030
you out with the enemy to force him to fight or to prevent him from it.

1232
01:15:26.031 --> 01:15:29.870
So he's saying that the two ways to outsmart the enemy as you either make the

1233
01:15:29.871 --> 01:15:32.720
enemy fight when you don't want him,
when he doesn't want to,

1234
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.490
or you prevent him from finding when you don't want to fight.
And here he talks,

1235
01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:42.350
this is basically a reverse psychology is what he's about to go into right now.

1236
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:46.370
There are two means of forcing the enemy to fight.
One is pretending to fear it.

1237
01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:52.420
His self confidence becomes your accomplice security laws him into security

1238
01:15:53.541 --> 01:15:58.370
laws,
him and you're cutting triumphs.
So if you act like you're afraid,

1239
01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:03.710
maybe the person is going to fight you when it is desired to avoid battle.

1240
01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:09.190
Different roses are used and apparent war has made which has all the actions of

1241
01:16:10.281 --> 01:16:14.270
the authentic live and which nevertheless is of an opposite nature.

1242
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:19.130
So He's in there.
If you don't want to fight,
you act like you want to fight.

1243
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.650
That's that's all he's saying in a bunch of words.

1244
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:27.830
It is your attitude that imposes on your enemy and the suspicion that you give

1245
01:16:27.831 --> 01:16:31.040
him that you are forming the boldest prayer projects against him.

1246
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:37.350
The attitude is maintained by not withdrawing easily before the enemy and often

1247
01:16:37.351 --> 01:16:39.150
the appearance that you are waiting for him,

1248
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.960
we'll make him lose all desire to attack you but if he does kill them,

1249
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:44.820
you steal away by at night march,

1250
01:16:44.821 --> 01:16:49.530
which you are already planned long before he thinks he has you and the next day

1251
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:54.690
there's no one.
If you only withdraw,
you will be fought,
followed,

1252
01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:57.930
but,
but then it is necessary to take position to the flank,

1253
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:01.560
which will prevent him from passing you without running into great danger.

1254
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1255
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.520
<v 0>This sort of war is a masterpiece of the Austrians and it is from them that it</v>

1256
01:17:09.081 --> 01:17:09.914
should be learned.

1257
01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.190
<v 3>So Act aggressively and plan your escape.</v>

1258
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.470
That's kind of the key thing because if you just act aggressively,

1259
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:21.320
you might get called on it,
right?
Yep.
And he say to act aggressively,

1260
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:23.300
but plan your escape while you're acting aggressively.

1261
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.010
This is going to sound like,

1262
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:28.160
this isn't an example because we all are too familiar with it.

1263
01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:31.280
But here's the thing.
When it first came out,
when this tactic first came out,

1264
01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:35.000
it was a good example of that very thing.
So at the bark die wants to fight you.

1265
01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:38.030
Right?
That's why you want to fight me.
You want to fuck me?
Okay.
Tell your friend,

1266
01:17:38.031 --> 01:17:40.490
Hey,
hold me back.
Holding me back.
Right.
You got to fight and yeah,
let's fight.

1267
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:42.920
Let's fight the fight holding me back home.
You're back home in friends,

1268
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:44.960
holding them back.
He wants to fight.
The guy's like,
oh shoot,

1269
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:47.330
this guy wants to fight whatever and be like,
hey,
meet me outside.

1270
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.450
We're going to fight outside.
Meet me outside one minute.

1271
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:53.180
I don't want to fight it in here,
you know,
but I'm ready kind of thing.

1272
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:56.360
Cause I thought he goes outside and meets the guy.
It's like guys gone.

1273
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:00.000
You don't get to fight.
Acted all aggressive.
Yeah.

1274
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:01.880
And then when he went outside to fight you,

1275
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.030
I'm not even wants to go outside to fight.
You might be like,
man,

1276
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:07.280
this gets kind of crazy.
It was down to fight to all quick.

1277
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.490
So I might not go out there,
but when he does finally go out there,
he's gone.

1278
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:15.170
Is it an unwritten rule that if you go to get a fight,

1279
01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:16.700
I'm going to try and hold you back?

1280
01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:19.010
Could you get like whispered us over like hold me back.

1281
01:18:19.011 --> 01:18:22.250
I know back in the day before everyone knew that tactic.

1282
01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:25.340
It's kind of like that was a good tactic.
No,
I'm just saying,

1283
01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:30.110
is it the general rule to just hold people back?
Like,

1284
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:32.940
hold your friend back from getting in a fight and defend.
Depends on,
I guess,

1285
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.870
cause if you ever been with someone who's like I'm not gonna hold you back.
Go.

1286
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.910
You want to Oh yeah,
100%.

1287
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.120
One of my buddies who's always a Badass team got somebody was talking smack,

1288
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:47.850
another seal was talking smack.
He's like,
I'll go kick that guy's ass.
Yeah.

1289
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:52.290
Thinking that my buddy would be like,
no,
you know,
don't hold your,
hold you back.

1290
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.330
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?
He's right over there.

1291
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.250
Why don't you go get them?
You're running your mouth

1292
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:06.830
so they'll run your mouth is the key point there.
Yeah.

1293
01:19:06.831 --> 01:19:07.664
See so I feel,

1294
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:11.830
I feel like that's kind of like a response to that old school tactic.
Yeah,
no,

1295
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.610
that's a good response to the old school tactic.

1296
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.920
If you come out with me and you want to go after someone,

1297
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.730
I'm going to let you go.
Let me like go,
go,
go,
go get some,
see what you got.

1298
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:22.940
Cause I don't like people when they're running their mouth.
You know what I mean?

1299
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.690
I don't think anyone does.
You know we had a gun or in football too.

1300
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:29.660
It's weird that everyone knows.
No one likes people that run their mouths,

1301
01:19:29.661 --> 01:19:31.900
but there's a bunch of people in the world that run their mouths.
Yeah.

1302
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:36.890
Explain that one.
We all know it.
It's Kinda like the name dropping thing,
right?

1303
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:40.220
It's harder to see it in yourself than it is to see another people.

1304
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:43.010
It's like easy to see it in other people.
I hate when they got runs his mouth.

1305
01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:45.980
Meanwhile,
like that's all you do kind of thing.
It's hard to see it in yourself.

1306
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.740
Easy to see it.
I think that's one of those things.
That's what I think,

1307
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:55.190
but who knows?
Yeah,
good point.
Because that is that you just,

1308
01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:59.870
you once again for that guy that's listening,
you just nailed it.
He's like,

1309
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.270
oh,
got it.

1310
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.590
That I'll tell you what this book was.

1311
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.960
<v 0>I don't know if the translation or whatever,</v>

1312
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:14.790
but there's definitely some long complicated sentences that were a little bit

1313
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:17.910
tricky for me.
I'm sure I had to read a few times

1314
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.303
back to the book.

1315
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:24.150
And let me by saying that what I mean is like sometimes you know a movie from

1316
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:27.790
1987 as a better example for him and that was one dazzler.

1317
01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.460
Good real over here

1318
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.680
there is another reus which is that if you find the enemy too strong to attack

1319
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:40.800
him,
you help him with the means of dividing his forces.

1320
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.110
So basically if you can get people to split up,

1321
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:46.650
if you can get your enemy to split up,
that's a good tactic as well.

1322
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.900
There's another type of reus,
which is admirable.
It is that of double spies.

1323
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:56.610
It is necessary to know them and then tell them with an air of good faith,

1324
01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:58.800
everything that you want the enemy to know.

1325
01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.840
So there you go.

1326
01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.610
It is essential to know what is happening amongst amongst the enemy.

1327
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.470
I'm of the opinion that the best thing against the Austrians would be to bribe

1328
01:21:11.471 --> 01:21:13.750
some captain or major for their who?

1329
01:21:13.751 --> 01:21:17.770
SARS by means of whom intelligence can be carried on with them.

1330
01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:19.640
And there's a reason why I'm talking about this.

1331
01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:22.690
So he's talking about spies and this is kind of old school,
but I,

1332
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.990
I brought that part up so I could do this part right here.

1333
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.210
If greed for silver does not work,
it is necessary to employ fear.

1334
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.440
Sees some mayor of a village where you camp and force him to take a disguised

1335
01:21:39.171 --> 01:21:43.610
man who speaks the language of the country and under some pretext to conduct him

1336
01:21:43.611 --> 01:21:46.400
as his servant in the enemy army

1337
01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.110
threatened him that if he does not bring your man back,

1338
01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:55.550
you will cut the throat of his wife and children whom you hold under guard wall

1339
01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:58.310
waiting and that you will have his house burned.

1340
01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.960
I was obliged to employ this sad expedient in Bohemia and it succeeded for me in

1341
01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:07.011
general,

1342
01:22:07.011 --> 01:22:11.810
does necessary to pay spies well and not to be miserly in that respect.

1343
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.160
A man who risks being hung in your service merits being well paid.

1344
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:21.360
So Frederick the great,
we know he,

1345
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:24.480
we know he liked music and literature,
but guess what?

1346
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.830
He was no stranger to just having your family's throat cut and burned the house

1347
01:22:28.831 --> 01:22:31.140
down.
Ruthless.

1348
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.070
So he seemed be we'll pay like,
it's kind of like,
hey,

1349
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:39.510
if you listen like a carrot and the stick situation where it's like,
okay,

1350
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:42.510
if you listen,
if you're all good,
you get paid well.
If not,

1351
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:46.960
you get your house burned down in a kid's life.
Slit throats.
Yup.

1352
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.570
He's saying if no,
he's saying if you can use the carrot,
if the carrot works,

1353
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:53.460
that's great.
If you could make someone greedy,
that's like,
all right,

1354
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:55.890
you know what,
I'll get this information for you because I'm greedy.
That's cool.

1355
01:22:55.950 --> 01:23:00.780
If you can't get that
kind of give them no choice kind of situation.

1356
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.080
Yeah.
And you know,

1357
01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:06.190
that's what's scary about that is that's

1358
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.210
<v 3>goes on today.
That's what a lot of the jihadists would do.
They would,</v>

1359
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.120
they would kidnap where they would,
they would take someone and say,
look,

1360
01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:16.300
you either run the suicide bomb and this building or we're going to kill your

1361
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:19.480
family,
all of them and burn your house down.
And,
and you know,

1362
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:23.710
the people make that horrible choice and that I will even that,

1363
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:27.610
that's more the stick.
It's like,
remember that's complete stick.
Remember the Ma,

1364
01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:32.020
like apparently the on the mafia movies and stuff,
they're like,
hey,

1365
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:33.910
they are paying off this guy.
But if he's like,

1366
01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:36.370
if he doesn't want to play the game anymore and then they kill him,
you know,

1367
01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:40.600
it's Kinda like that,
right?
Basically.
No,
it's two different things.

1368
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:45.160
So if you can get someone that does,
we'll do what you want him to do for money.

1369
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:49.480
That's great.
Yeah.
If you can't get anyone to do that,
then you got to go.
Yeah.

1370
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.220
But I guess you're right that someone could say,
Hey,
I'm done.
And then you go,

1371
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:57.610
oh no,
you're not done.
You're done.
So you are right.
Yeah.
No Mafia.

1372
01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.690
The mafia thing,
like,
yeah,
you're gonna,
you're going to,

1373
01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:01.030
you're going to keep doing this.
No,

1374
01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:04.450
not people get involved in situations like that that they shouldn't have gotten

1375
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:08.140
involved in and it all seems okay.
Yeah.
It all seems okay in the beginning,

1376
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.990
you know,
one side or the other because either side,

1377
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.160
whether you're a criminal or you're,
you're,

1378
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:15.430
whether you go to help a criminal law or you go to help the cops out,

1379
01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:18.080
like you think it's going to be,
hey,
it's just going to go good.
It's not,

1380
01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.080
you're going to up in a bad situation.

1381
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:22.840
You're in a bad way so that the expression,

1382
01:24:22.841 --> 01:24:26.880
getting into bed with a whatever,
it's not going to work out.

1383
01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:30.010
I never wanted to be a spy of any kind.

1384
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:32.560
You never did never want to be a spy of any kind.

1385
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:37.540
Never watched a James Bond.
And it was like,

1386
01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:38.950
I'd really like to do that.

1387
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.410
Never watched a spy movie and thought like,
I don't know.
I don't like the,

1388
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.450
I don't like that whole

1389
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.520
paranoia like undercover cops too.

1390
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:55.360
I'm sure we'll get somebody that can deep undercover never had like,
I don't,

1391
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.200
I want to,
I don't like that.
I don't can dig it and I don't like to,

1392
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.060
I don't want to fabricate everything like that all the time.
It's just hard.

1393
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:07.900
I mean,
props to them.
Like undercover cops.
That's crazy job.
Can imagine it.

1394
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.110
Imagine going in,
right?
You're undercover cover.

1395
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.760
You go in and you don't know if like I know

1396
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.230
for sure if she needs organized crime bosses,
how it is on the movies anyway,

1397
01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.670
where when they find out it's like a lot of times they don't just,
Oh,

1398
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:29.380
what really set them up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1399
01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:32.170
That's a,
I never had the desire to do that.
Some people really like that stuff.

1400
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.180
I never had the desire to do that and for swordfish,
watch a movie,
swordfish.

1401
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:41.060
That happens.
Anyway,
this is like a cross and a double cross anyway.
Yeah.

1402
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:43.900
We'll talk about that some other tough hour.
You know what?

1403
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:47.510
Let's tee it up from that podcast.
Go back to the book cover

1404
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:53.860
check.
In neutral countries,

1405
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:58.861
it is necessary to make friends if you can win over the whole country so much.

1406
01:25:58.901 --> 01:26:02.590
The better the friendship of the neutral countries gained by requiring the

1407
01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:04.220
soldiers observe good discipline

1408
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.780
<v 0>and by picturing your enemies as barbarous and bad intentioned,</v>

1409
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.830
solid,
solid advice.
Right?
Hmm.

1410
01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:17.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1411
01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:19.090
<v 0>Oh,
this is good.</v>

1412
01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.680
Let no one imagine that it is,

1413
01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:28.890
that it is sufficient just to move an army about to make the enemy regulate

1414
01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:33.200
himself on your movements
so you,

1415
01:26:33.201 --> 01:26:35.630
you can't just think to yourself,
hey,

1416
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:41.480
my moves are enough and I'm doing an and it's going to have the impact that I

1417
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:42.314
wanted to have.

1418
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:44.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1419
01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:48.940
<v 0>A general who is,
who has too presumptuous,
confidence in his skills,</v>

1420
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.150
runs the risk of being grossly duped.

1421
01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.320
That's what this is.
Don't let your ego get out of control.

1422
01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:59.470
War is not an affair of chance.

1423
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:04.480
A great deal of knowledge study and meditation is necessary to conduct it well,

1424
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:06.340
and when blows our planned,

1425
01:27:06.341 --> 01:27:10.450
whoever can tribes them with the greatest appreciation of their consequences,

1426
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:12.370
we'll have a great advantage.

1427
01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:15.483
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:19.370
<v 0>However,
to give a few rules on such a delicate matter,</v>

1429
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:21.680
I would say that in general,

1430
01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:26.710
the first of two army commanders who adopts an offensive attitude almost always

1431
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:32.081
reduces his rival to the defensive and makes him regulate himself on his

1432
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:37.100
movements.
What does that mean?
It means default aggressive.
It means go.

1433
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:38.240
That's what it means.

1434
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:45.750
Unskillful general's race to the first trap set before them.

1435
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.270
I just had a guy on Twitter say,
uh,

1436
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.930
I'm a white belt but tonight I swept the blue belt.

1437
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:58.620
It wasn't really that good though cause he arm locked me quickly thereafter and

1438
01:27:58.621 --> 01:28:02.840
I was like,
sweep him.
You got set up Jujitsu.

1439
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:05.850
So same thing.
Don't race for the first trap that's set before you.

1440
01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:09.900
This is why a great advantage is drawn from knowledge of your adversary.

1441
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:12.840
And when you know his intelligence and character,

1442
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:15.270
you can use it to play on his weaknesses.

1443
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1444
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.660
<v 0>Everything,
which the enemy least six specs will succeed the best.</v>

1445
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:30.060
That's true.
100%.
That's why when you get,

1446
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:32.370
like,
when you think about when you get caught in Jujitsu,

1447
01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.690
I would say most of the time it's getting caught with something that you didn't

1448
01:28:37.691 --> 01:28:39.940
expect.
Right.
Some people,

1449
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.480
Dean can do things and like he's going to get it and you know what's coming.

1450
01:28:43.481 --> 01:28:45.460
Like you hear Hixon stories Hicks and be like,

1451
01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:49.030
I'm going to arm lock everyone's left arm and they'd line up 20 black belts need

1452
01:28:49.031 --> 01:28:50.590
our mock everyone's left arm.
Yeah.

1453
01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:56.740
But most of the time it's something that you least expect.
Yeah.

1454
01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.970
In the in,
there's kind of two things.
I think the weird,
strange,

1455
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:01.890
I was just thinking about this

1456
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.810
<v 3>yesterday with,
there's like there's two kind of ways where you'll get caught.</v>

1457
01:29:06.811 --> 01:29:10.620
So if you want,
he's dean as the example and then the,
the unexpected example.

1458
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:14.460
If you get caught by someone,
like when Dean does that or does like go,

1459
01:29:14.461 --> 01:29:17.790
I'm going to get you with this.
What he does is the equivalent of let's say like,

1460
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:21.000
I don't know,
he might not literally say that,
but you know it's coming.

1461
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.890
I mean I do this to you,
right,
where you're like,
oh,

1462
01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:25.780
he's good about to come hear me.
Yeah.
Like you know what's coming.
Yeah.

1463
01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.940
So that's the situation that we're talking about.
Yes.
Example one.
Yes.

1464
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:32.040
So it's like,
okay,
if you're on the battlefield,

1465
01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:34.840
do whatever you have a defense here,
you know,
a defensive position there,

1466
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:35.730
defensive position there.

1467
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.850
I defends his position in there and they're all protecting ultimately.

1468
01:29:38.851 --> 01:29:40.230
Like one guy's protecting this guy,

1469
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:43.080
this guy's protecting this guy and this guy kind of thing.

1470
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.930
So it's like you can't get to this guy with that without going through this

1471
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:46.920
situation.
Right.

1472
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:51.780
And what Dean essentially does is he shuts down all your defenses for this thing

1473
01:29:51.781 --> 01:29:55.770
to moves ahead of you.
So it's like,
okay,
I'm going to try to pass the guard,

1474
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:57.800
but to pass the guard,
how's he going to defense?

1475
01:29:57.801 --> 01:30:00.450
So he shuts that down before you even realize like,
oh yeah,

1476
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:02.790
that he's going to try to [inaudible] steps ahead.
Yes.

1477
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:06.420
So when he goes for these wound,
I'm getting the commuter on you.

1478
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.490
It's not the community itself that got you.
It was
your arm out.

1479
01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:14.880
And I isolated it because I was going for a choke and I ended up doing that.
Yes.

1480
01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:19.890
And then your other arms tied up under your heaviest knee because that's part of

1481
01:30:19.891 --> 01:30:22.680
the defense.
But you already knew that,
but you already knew that.
So they,

1482
01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:25.920
you shut those down.
And that's what Dean's good at.
A lot of time,
especially at,

1483
01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.520
he has that weird good like pressure.
Oh,
you know,

1484
01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:31.020
so if your arm is like isolated,

1485
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:34.680
since you don't really detect like immediate threat,

1486
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:36.960
you're like Dang my arm stuck,
but hey that's not,

1487
01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.530
it's kind of okay for right now.
I'll deal with it later.
But here's the thing,

1488
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:43.010
not you're not going to do it.
He just took care of that,

1489
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.210
that big defense that you're going to need by the way,

1490
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.130
and it's gone and then by the time you get there,

1491
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:51.120
you don't even know that you need it yet in 20 seconds in the future.

1492
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:54.870
But he already eliminated that.
Exactly right.
And that's the way it works there.

1493
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:58.200
And the other ones are just like how you're saying where it's kind of like you

1494
01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:58.350
don't,

1495
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:03.090
you attack this sweep and the arm bar and when they go to defend one or even

1496
01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.980
both of them a lot of times because they're ready for it,
you know,

1497
01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:08.370
you went for the thing that you had planned or dean does that what I like,

1498
01:31:08.371 --> 01:31:13.371
let someone try and our mock and more let them try and triangle and they're 100%

1499
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:17.610
not going to harm walk them.
Yeah.
But even me,
I'll be like,

1500
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:22.110
maybe I can get it this time.
He continues on here.
Back to the book.

1501
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.850
If you realize for security on a chain of mountains that he believes

1502
01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.570
impracticable and you pass these mountains by roads unknown to him,

1503
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:34.290
he is confused to start with and if you press him he will not have time to

1504
01:31:34.291 --> 01:31:36.240
recover from the his consternation.

1505
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.150
That's actually a really good description of Jiu Jitsu right there.

1506
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:44.450
Like you're just confused by the time you're trying to overcome your confusion

1507
01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.210
and you're concerned,
you're getting crushed in the same way.

1508
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:51.840
If he places himself behind a river to defend the crossing and you find some

1509
01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:56.100
Ford above or below,
which he which on which to cross unknown to him,

1510
01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:59.940
this will surprise and derange him and confuse him.
I liked that

1511
01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.440
<v 0>the art of war is divided between force and stratagem.</v>

1512
01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:15.220
What cannot be done by force must be done by stratagem and I actually was kind

1513
01:32:16.671 --> 01:32:21.671
of unclear about the usage of the word stratagem and there's meanings of it.

1514
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:25.310
To clarify the meaning a little bit more specifically,

1515
01:32:25.311 --> 01:32:29.620
it's means like deception but trickery.
It's not,

1516
01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.780
it just doesn't mean strategy means like we're,
we're,
we're,
we're,

1517
01:32:32.781 --> 01:32:34.580
this is a trick scenario.
Yeah.

1518
01:32:34.581 --> 01:32:38.750
It kind of seemed like the root word of what strategy can and maybe came from,

1519
01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.840
well,
yeah,
I would definitely say that it's the same day.

1520
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.770
So I'd say you failed that one.
Uh,
hold on,

1521
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.480
let me Redo that.
That's a good point.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1522
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:57.730
And I didn't see that.
You,
uh,

1523
01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.860
see sometimes I don't follow my own guidelines.
That was one of them.
Huh?

1524
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:05.210
Talking a dagger at you.
Isn't that an exception though?

1525
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:08.240
Because you know how like everything,
you know,
you can do something too much.

1526
01:33:08.241 --> 01:33:12.140
So like,
you know,
like if you're always encouraging me,
I'm busting out dumb,

1527
01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:16.550
obvious stuff at all.
Looking at like strategy.
Yes,

1528
01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.770
exactly.
That's why I didn't try and fake it.
You know,
I kept a real

1529
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:27.590
dichotomy,
dichotomy,
check,
uh,
have your disposition supported well,

1530
01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:30.110
do not forget your reserves.

1531
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:34.580
Take advantage of the terrain and then attack him.

1532
01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:38.780
Brusquely and you should be able to hope for the most brilliant success.

1533
01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.800
If the heights are on your side,
this will be of great advantage to you.

1534
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:46.610
If they are not,
you have almost no hope of succeeding.

1535
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:48.500
Take the high ground or the high ground.

1536
01:33:48.501 --> 01:33:52.510
We'll take you something that we talked about a little bit.
Yes sir.

1537
01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.580
Now he's talking about Ti attacking the enemy's entrenchments.

1538
01:33:58.581 --> 01:34:03.320
So the enemies in a defendant position,
if you have resolved to an attack,

1539
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.520
an entrenched enemy,

1540
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.050
do it at once and do not allow him to time to perfect his works.

1541
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:12.980
So if you know you're going to have to defense attack a defended position to do

1542
01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:17.710
it as quick as you can,
don't let them get their defense is all set up.

1543
01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:21.830
That's something that a lot of Jujitsu players,

1544
01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.273
<v 5>they</v>

1545
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.170
<v 0>especially,
I would say it's kind of the same thing.
But if you pass my guard,</v>

1546
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.080
I don't wait until you settle me across the side before I start escaping.

1547
01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.220
As soon as I know I'm going to lose that position,
I'm already escaping.
Yeah.

1548
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:42.540
And same thing if I pass your guard and then I let you get in your defensive

1549
01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.500
position.
Well it's gonna be hard to Yank your arm over there,

1550
01:34:44.501 --> 01:34:47.320
but there's a moment where your arms hanging out and if I go for it right then

1551
01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:50.140
my probability for success is a lot higher.

1552
01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:52.870
I you got all mad one time,

1553
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.840
like a couple of months ago because I did that to you.
I like pastor go wham on.

1554
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:58.070
And you and you

1555
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.210
<v 3>were,
it was a straight,
just something that bothered you about it.
Yeah.</v>

1556
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.200
Emotionally.
I don't know what it was.
Oh,

1557
01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:07.520
I could recount the account.
Yeah.

1558
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:11.480
So I said to you,
I said,
you know what,

1559
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:15.460
because you kept getting me with the guilty and I was,
and I said to you kind of,

1560
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:20.300
I don't even know why I said this,
but I did say that.
I said,

1561
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.640
I think I got my defense against your Kimora in arm locked,

1562
01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:28.220
like your other arm moves.
I think I got that.
Dot.
I think I'm solid with those,

1563
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:31.130
defending those,
but to guilty and I'm still,
you know,
trying to figure out,

1564
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.060
I said something,
I said that basically in so many words and you were like,
oh,

1565
01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.220
okay.
And then yeah

1566
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.860
and yeah,
and then you went a little bit,
you know,

1567
01:35:42.861 --> 01:35:47.000
more sense of urgency or whatever and it was an arm bar that you did that was

1568
01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:50.930
almost a,
would've been a flying arm barks up.
It was done within a scramble.

1569
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:54.710
So like you kind of did a little guard pass and you went to and yeah,

1570
01:35:54.711 --> 01:35:55.760
it came out of nowhere.

1571
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:59.450
You shouldn't have been capable of doing that in my opinion at the time.

1572
01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:03.160
I open the game up sometimes I go to open the game up a little bit.
Yes,
he did.

1573
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.760
That's exactly,
I love that part of Jujitsu la.

1574
01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.140
I love that part too,
where you're going like getting after.

1575
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:15.050
I've been training with Andy hard and we've been both been opening up the game.

1576
01:36:15.051 --> 01:36:18.560
I used to train with Dean like this all the time.
We just didn't care.
Suicidal.

1577
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:22.610
Every move was a suicide move.
Like,
Hey,
I might just die after I do this move,

1578
01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:26.900
but I'm gonna do it anyway.
And you just watch.
It would just be like a,
like a,

1579
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:30.290
like a Tasmanian Devil.
You see stuff going on.

1580
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.810
I'm trying to train like that again right now.
Yeah.

1581
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:36.200
And that's good because it's so fun in a way.
You start to,

1582
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.910
it's almost like you guys are both doing offense and counters is what you're

1583
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:44.240
doing.
You're not really defending technically much.
Exactly.
You know,

1584
01:36:44.241 --> 01:36:46.430
you're just going to Congress and yeah,
he's going for something.
You'll be like,

1585
01:36:46.431 --> 01:36:49.970
okay cause most news have a counter to it,
you know,
kind of thing.

1586
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:54.180
And you're just thinking like it's a real forward thinking like dynamic.
Yeah.

1587
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:58.880
Yeah it is.
It's fun.
It's good.
Yeah.
And so point being,

1588
01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.310
once you get a little advantage on the enemy,
take advantage,

1589
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:07.040
take further advantage of it.
Don't let them reset and resettle.

1590
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.210
Go get a little advantage on your competitor.
Go tear him apart.

1591
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.760
<v 0>Attack harder.
Yeah.</v>

1592
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:20.930
It is the generals coup de d'etat that must decide this.

1593
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:25.040
If you attack a bull by the horns,
your task will be difficult.

1594
01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:28.910
And perhaps will not succeed at all.
Attack a week.

1595
01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:33.260
Positions make sense.
And now he starts talking about,

1596
01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:36.230
so when they talked about attacking it,
an entrenchment or a defensive position,

1597
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:39.050
now he's talking about setting up the defensive position and he says,

1598
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:41.900
as I have already said,
and I repeat it,

1599
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:47.150
that I would never put myself in an entrenchment at least unless a terrible

1600
01:37:47.151 --> 01:37:52.151
misfortune such as the loss of a battle or a triple superiority on the part of

1601
01:37:52.221 --> 01:37:56.940
the enemy forced me to do it.
So he's not going to dig in and try and defend.

1602
01:37:56.941 --> 01:37:59.340
He's going to be on offense all the time.
You know,
this is really the,

1603
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:02.620
essentially what the guard is.
People think,
you know,

1604
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.790
you shouldn't be on the bottom in the guard.
That's a disadvantage.

1605
01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:10.050
It's disadvantage.
You would rather be on top and if you end up in the guard,

1606
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.440
well that's because you ended up there by some gross misfortune of your own

1607
01:38:15.781 --> 01:38:18.750
doing,
most likely or you're on the person now have there.

1608
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.040
Are there some people out there that absolutely have a guard that's so crazy and

1609
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:27.300
offensive that it's be,
it's kind of morphed that a little bit.
Yeah.
Yes,

1610
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:29.510
that is true.
Yeah.
And then that goes along with it.

1611
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.520
And there's some people in combat that are so good at defending positions that

1612
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:37.860
they make it.
We'll look at the Russians that there,

1613
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:42.080
their whole strategy is basically pulling guard like,
yeah,
okay.

1614
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.150
You come this way a little bit because what's,

1615
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:47.940
where do you spend more gas defending Gardner passing guard,

1616
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.770
passing guard.
Me Too.
For sure.
Trying to pass.

1617
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:57.350
God is way more energy.
Draw draws way more energy.

1618
01:38:57.351 --> 01:38:59.970
Trying to pass them on to target.
And when you're just,

1619
01:38:59.971 --> 01:39:02.670
when you're just holding and you adjust your hips and you adjust your hips,

1620
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.850
well that's what the Russians do.
So their guard is just really,
really good.

1621
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:08.820
They tax you a little bit and moved back.
They tax you a little bit,

1622
01:39:08.821 --> 01:39:12.150
move back to tax you a little bit,
move back.
And by the time you get there,

1623
01:39:12.151 --> 01:39:15.090
you're exhausted.
Hmm.
Interesting.
You get caught.

1624
01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:21.980
<v 2>Um,
if</v>

1625
01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.600
<v 0>you are inferior in numbers,
do not despair of winning,</v>

1626
01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:32.230
but do not expect any other success than gained by your skill so you can win

1627
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:36.140
when you're outnumbered,
but you better have some serious skill.

1628
01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:43.050
There are some generals who maintain that an army and position should be

1629
01:39:43.051 --> 01:39:44.820
attacked in the center.
As for me,

1630
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:48.030
I am of the opinion that it should be attacked at the weakest point.

1631
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:50.880
They say that in breaking the center,

1632
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:54.630
you separate the entire army and place yourself in a situation to gain the most

1633
01:39:54.631 --> 01:39:57.600
brilliant advantages.
As for me,
I repeat it,

1634
01:39:57.990 --> 01:40:02.990
I approve of all methods of attacking provided they are d directed at the point

1635
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:08.120
where the enemy's army is the weakest and where the terrain favors them.

1636
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:09.143
The least

1637
01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.600
<v 2>attack,
weak points.
Boom.</v>

1638
01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:18.990
<v 0>This is important.</v>

1639
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.990
The defensive positions is gay and he's talking about the defense a little bit

1640
01:40:21.991 --> 01:40:22.824
more.

1641
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:28.040
I would choose only on a saleable positions or else I would not occupy them at

1642
01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:34.460
all for we have too many advantages in attacking to deprive ourselves of them

1643
01:40:34.861 --> 01:40:37.830
gratuitously.
Let me tell you what I took away away from that.

1644
01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:41.790
This is something that I do all the time and it's like no big deal.

1645
01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:46.800
It's no big deal,
but when you think about it,
it's,
it's important.
I choose.

1646
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.760
I would only choose on a salable positions or else I would not occupy them at

1647
01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:54.190
all.
What does that mean to me?
What that means is if

1648
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:59.190
<v 3>I don't know something 100% I don't try and defend it with a hundred percent</v>

1649
01:40:59.801 --> 01:41:04.270
strength.
I see this all the time with businesses,
with human beings,

1650
01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.330
with people.
They are not,

1651
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:09.910
they don't know something 100% but they're going to,

1652
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.690
they're going to fall on their sword because of it and it's a total mistake.

1653
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.750
There's,

1654
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:19.750
there's very few things that I feel so knowledgeable about and I have such a

1655
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:25.160
good position on that.
My position is unassailable,

1656
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.890
so why it doesn't take a,
it doesn't,
it doesn't.

1657
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:33.410
You're not a bad person if you go,
you know what?
I'm not 100% sure on that.
Yeah.

1658
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.080
Here's my opinion,
but it's just an opinion.
Yeah.

1659
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:39.130
Look at people that are,

1660
01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:46.020
the minute you throw down and you're in a position that is a saleable meaning

1661
01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:50.800
you can get your,
your butt kicked.
Well then guess what,
you will,

1662
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:54.640
someone's going to come and do it.
Yeah.
So just keep an open mind.
Don't,

1663
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:58.480
don't hunker down on positions that you're not even sure about.
Yeah,

1664
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:00.880
there you go.
That's all seems logical.

1665
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
But here's what's hard I think is because usually that's in like some kind of me

1666
01:42:06.861 --> 01:42:10.180
against you situate and I'm talking about obviously with just normal people,

1667
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:14.110
usually it's like some sort of a deep aid that you get into with somebody about

1668
01:42:14.111 --> 01:42:18.970
something and it turns into this,
okay,
it's me against you.

1669
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:22.210
I'm right.
You're wrong.
Versus you're right and I'm wrong kind of thing.

1670
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.280
And it just turns into that.
So now it's like,
no,

1671
01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:27.250
it could have some part in their brain kind of thinks,
okay,
if I say,
Hey,

1672
01:42:27.251 --> 01:42:29.080
I'm not really sure.
I just gave up the battle.

1673
01:42:29.081 --> 01:42:32.920
I just gave up this whole battle that kind of started and we don't start there.

1674
01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.760
The key part of this is don't start with,
I'm right in your role.
Start with,

1675
01:42:36.761 --> 01:42:39.460
you know what,
I'm not too informed about this subject.
Can you fill me up?

1676
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:43.210
And by the way,
the more you talk as we learned,
the more you talk,

1677
01:42:43.211 --> 01:42:46.230
the more I know about your position and my position.
Yeah,

1678
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:49.870
I'm going to let you talk.
You go ahead.
But that is given the,

1679
01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.230
given the fact or given the circumstances that your brain,

1680
01:42:53.231 --> 01:42:58.210
your mind isn't in a me against you because you don't walk around in that mode.

1681
01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.850
That there is,
that there's a,
there's a,
there's a little dichotomy there too.

1682
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:06.310
You don't want to know why because I'm always me against you.

1683
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.390
How many against everyone.

1684
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.860
But the way I actually win against you is to not defended an unassailable

1685
01:43:11.861 --> 01:43:15.810
position.
Yeah.
That's how I actually win.
And you have this thing where you're,

1686
01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.470
that's,
that's,
that's important.
Important as you say.
Yeah.

1687
01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.200
And that's not to mention how you always have,
well,

1688
01:43:23.201 --> 01:43:27.440
you seem to always have this mindset of like the bigger picture,
like a big,

1689
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.350
you know how you say like you don't necessarily,

1690
01:43:29.351 --> 01:43:31.000
you're not focused on little battles all the time.

1691
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:33.860
You're more focused on the work.
So a little something,
we call it detached.

1692
01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:37.510
I don't really care about the thing that you're actually fired up about.

1693
01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.730
I don't actually care.
You care about a little tiny bit.

1694
01:43:39.731 --> 01:43:42.280
I only care about how it's gonna Affect the longterm outcome of this broad

1695
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:47.110
strategy that I'm over here executing.
Yes.
So see how your,

1696
01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:52.160
you seem to be always aware of that.
There's the misstep.
I think

1697
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.640
<v 0>that people,
they get,</v>

1698
01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.450
what do you call it when you get sucked into our district stations?
Yeah,
yeah,

1699
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:59.750
exactly right.
For sure.
That's not an easy thing to just not do.

1700
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:04.260
I'm just not going to do it.
You know?
It's not that easy,
man.
Not for you though.

1701
01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:06.890
I get
back to the book,

1702
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.320
I have not spoken yet of the reserve.

1703
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.740
It should be commanded by a skillful general and it should be placed in a

1704
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:14.750
locality where he can see everything.

1705
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:17.600
So the reason I brought this up is to again,

1706
01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:19.610
counteract something that he said in the beginning of the book,

1707
01:44:19.611 --> 01:44:23.960
which is right here.
He should act on his own initiative.

1708
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.990
And if he sees that one of the wings are in need of help,

1709
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:29.780
he should conduct a reserve there without being called.
So again,

1710
01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.500
as much as he says,
Hey,
listen to me obey,
that's his macho statement.

1711
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:37.850
The reality is he wants is he wants his reserve leader to step up and make

1712
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:41.330
things happen without being told.
That's decentralized command.
Hmm.

1713
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.540
That's how it has to be.
I like this.

1714
01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:51.541
What is practiced in armies is done on a small scale with detachments.

1715
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.150
So you got your,
you got your big army,

1716
01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:58.120
they do the same thing that the little elements out there in the field do.

1717
01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.890
What's my primary example?
This cupboard move.
So when he says detachments,

1718
01:45:02.891 --> 01:45:06.940
he means just means small little al can break off a company,

1719
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.830
apple two and a battalion.
Gotcha.

1720
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:11.590
They're out there doing the same thing that the army is doing,

1721
01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.310
that the big regiment division's doing.
Hmm,

1722
01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:19.780
here's a good one.
A battle is lost less,

1723
01:45:20.290 --> 01:45:24.820
less through the loss of men than by discouragement.

1724
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:29.860
Remember that one?
The other one,

1725
01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.920
the man who does things without motive or in spite of himself is either insane

1726
01:45:35.441 --> 01:45:36.274
or a fool.

1727
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:42.320
Wars decided only by battles and it is not finished except by them.

1728
01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.430
Thus,
they have to be fought,
but it should be done,

1729
01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:53.160
but it should be opportunity.
And with all the advantages on your side,

1730
01:45:55.710 --> 01:45:56.543
<v 1>concur,</v>

1731
01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:00.090
<v 0>here's,
here's a good little section,</v>

1732
01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:03.930
reflections on the hazards and misfortunes of war.

1733
01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:07.440
When a general conducts himself with all prudence,

1734
01:46:07.530 --> 01:46:12.530
he can still suffer ill fortune for how many things do not cooperate at all with

1735
01:46:15.241 --> 01:46:17.130
his labors.
So yeah,
things are going to go bad.

1736
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:23.110
Whether harvest the officers,
the health or sickness of his troops,

1737
01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:27.970
blunders the death of an officer on whom he counts,
discouragement of the troops,

1738
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.590
exposure of your spies,

1739
01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:34.120
negligence of the officers who should rec rec and order the enemy.
And finally,

1740
01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:34.983
betrayal.

1741
01:46:36.150 --> 01:46:39.630
These are the things that should be kept continually before your eyes,

1742
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:44.750
so as to be prepared for them and so that good fortune will not blind us.

1743
01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.753
<v 1>Hm.</v>

1744
01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:53.450
<v 0>You cannot be blinded by good fortune.
You're going to get lucky sometimes.
Hmm.</v>

1745
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.900
He goes on and on about this more.

1746
01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:02.810
If an important detachment isn't trusted to a man of judgment and if this man

1747
01:47:02.811 --> 01:47:04.740
should become sick or should be killed,

1748
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:08.420
there is all your business hung up for.

1749
01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:12.320
No one should imagine that sound heads are common in armies.

1750
01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:16.410
Yeah.
Guess what?
It's really hard to find good leaders.

1751
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:22.950
Offensive Generals are rare among us.
I only know a few and nevertheless,

1752
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.380
it is only to these that this sort of detachment can be entrusted.

1753
01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.890
He's talking about aggressive.
When he says offensive general,

1754
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:34.530
he means aggressive generals.
People are going to make things happen

1755
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:37.980
so good.
You know,

1756
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:41.700
if you're like a young person or an old person or you're a person listening to

1757
01:47:41.701 --> 01:47:45.120
this,
sure.
If you can make things happen.
Yeah.

1758
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.830
It's like incredible.
Yeah,
and you will go far in life.
Well,

1759
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:51.420
if you sit back and you wait for things to happen,

1760
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:53.610
it's not good and you won't go far in life.

1761
01:47:54.150 --> 01:47:58.810
Nothing is going to just happen because you held your f,

1762
01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.620
you crossed your fingers.
It doesn't make anything happen.

1763
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:02.910
You have to make it happen.

1764
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.680
You have to be an aggressive general.
And they're rare.
There's not,

1765
01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:13.140
he said,
you know what,
there's actually not even any competition.

1766
01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.840
Like there's no competition for it.
Like if you're,

1767
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.870
you're there that you are such hide.

1768
01:48:17.871 --> 01:48:20.400
If you're a person that can make things happen,
you are in such high demand,

1769
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:22.330
you're going to,
you're going to be set.
Yeah.

1770
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:26.400
There's just not that many people that will make things happen.
Yeah.

1771
01:48:26.401 --> 01:48:29.850
And if you're one of them,
you're going to do great.
Yeah,
that's true.
Huh?
Hey,

1772
01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:34.110
am I saying they get to step on toes and you've gotta be all aggro and Matt

1773
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:34.801
Macho and run around?
No,

1774
01:48:34.801 --> 01:48:37.500
I'm not saying that you make things happen and you do it tactfully and you're

1775
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:41.880
smart.
You the sky's the limit.
Yeah.
Cause it's not like this,

1776
01:48:41.881 --> 01:48:44.700
just this overabundance of people making,
Hey,

1777
01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:48.960
I work with businesses all the time.
The,
the,
every,

1778
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:52.890
every single business I work with is looking for good people that are going to

1779
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:57.180
make things happen.
Yeah.
That's just all of them.
100% I never went to a business.

1780
01:48:57.181 --> 01:48:59.070
They're like,
oh yeah.
Luckily everyone here,

1781
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:04.040
we're maxed out with people that good,
good people that make things happen.
Yeah.

1782
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.970
So be a person that makes things happen.
Yeah.
There's a difference

1783
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:12.750
as far as what I can tell,

1784
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.030
this is the difference between someone who's grinding and working real hard at

1785
01:49:16.031 --> 01:49:18.360
it and then someone who makes it happen.
Cause like,
okay,

1786
01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:21.300
when you kind of make it up and sure that usually takes work.
I dig it.

1787
01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:25.800
But at the end of the day it's like they're straight up results for sure.

1788
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:29.280
To just work.
Sorry,
the guy that works,
art's cool too,
but there's a difference.

1789
01:49:29.281 --> 01:49:30.010
You're right.
It,

1790
01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:32.430
there's a difference between somebody that just makes things happen.
Yeah.

1791
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:35.490
And they'll work,
they'll do whatever.
Don't make things happen.
They'll work hard,

1792
01:49:35.491 --> 01:49:39.360
they'll grind hard,
don't maneuver.
They'll go back.
They'll read,
they'll read.

1793
01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:42.970
They'll revisit the whole plan.
Yeah,
to get the result.

1794
01:49:43.690 --> 01:49:44.700
They're going to make it happen.

1795
01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.370
Remember I told the story about finding wine for my brother?

1796
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:53.590
<v 3>Go.
You're going to start that.
That was the kind of the I know.
Terrible example.</v>

1797
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:57.670
I know,
but at its core,
it's the same thing.
You ever seen the wine aisle,

1798
01:49:57.671 --> 01:50:02.380
it's huge and you're like,
you easily could say,
hey,
I didn't have that much time,

1799
01:50:02.381 --> 01:50:06.570
or whatever.
You know,
grind.
I don't care.
I'll be there.

1800
01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:11.680
You're one of those people,
I'm sure I'm starting.

1801
01:50:11.681 --> 01:50:15.560
I'm beginning to see a series does.

1802
01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:21.200
<v 0>Okay.
Speaking of things happening by luck,</v>

1803
01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.880
kind of mentioned that in considering for Tutus events and the chapter of

1804
01:50:25.881 --> 01:50:26.714
accidents,

1805
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:31.750
one can see that a general should be skillful and lucky and that no one should

1806
01:50:31.971 --> 01:50:34.250
believe so fully in his star,

1807
01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.040
that he abandoned himself to it blindly.

1808
01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:41.100
If you are lucky and trust in luck alone,

1809
01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:45.540
even if your success reduces you to the defensive,
if you are unlucky,

1810
01:50:46.290 --> 01:50:50.030
you're already there.
So if you're counting on luck,

1811
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:54.740
you're already on the defensive and if you're unlucky,
you're already on

1812
01:50:56.670 --> 01:51:00.610
and you know what I say to that is make your luck.
That's what I say.
Yeah.

1813
01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.490
Get out there.
Make your luck.
Yeah,

1814
01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.200
you will have seen by what I have occasion to delineate concerning war,

1815
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:12.710
that promptness and my prompt us,
he's talking about speed.

1816
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:18.370
Promptness contributes a great deal to success in marches and even more in

1817
01:51:18.711 --> 01:51:19.460
battles.

1818
01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:24.170
That is why our army is drilled in such fashion that it acts faster than others.

1819
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.690
Violence of action is what they used to teach us in the seal teams.

1820
01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:33.160
How cool is it when you're 19 years old and you're getting taught about violence

1821
01:51:33.161 --> 01:51:35.680
of action?
Seems pretty cool.

1822
01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:39.130
If I heard this podcast and I was 18 years old and I heard someone saying,

1823
01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:41.890
when you got to the seal teams,
you get taught about violence of action.

1824
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.120
I would go sign up with the Vla.
Yeah,

1825
01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:50.470
violence of action,
like go hard now.
That's what he's talking about.

1826
01:51:50.471 --> 01:51:53.480
He calls it promptness,
but we don't call it God.
Miss Recall,

1827
01:51:53.481 --> 01:51:56.950
call violence of action
from drill.

1828
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:01.980
These maneuvers which enable us to form in the twinkling of an eye and from this

1829
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:07.360
that speed in all cavalry moments.
So again,

1830
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:09.490
when I got to the seal teams,
they didn't say,
hey,

1831
01:52:09.491 --> 01:52:12.190
you need to learn to be able to move in the twinkling of an eye.

1832
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:16.580
I wouldn't have been would have been dealt with that violence of action.
Yes sir.

1833
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:21.730
That's what's important.
As that was talking about cavalry,

1834
01:52:21.731 --> 01:52:26.731
now he talks about on foot as for the rapid step of the infantry and the attack,

1835
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:29.343
it is not,

1836
01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:34.120
it is not the greater or lesser number of dead that decides and action,

1837
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:35.440
but the ground you gained,

1838
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:39.970
it is not the fire but the bearing which defeats the enemy.

1839
01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:43.330
So we say it's not like the the,
the shooting that does it,

1840
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.720
it's how aggressive you are.
And so now there's a caveat to that,

1841
01:52:47.721 --> 01:52:50.870
which is like fire superiority is a real thing.

1842
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:54.740
And if you've been on the wrong side of supplier superiority,

1843
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:59.330
you're not winning anything.
But if you get aggressive,

1844
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:03.260
then that is the one of the most powerful things on the battlefield.

1845
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:07.010
And that's exactly how you overcome.
When,
when you're,

1846
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:11.060
when someone else has superior firepower on you or fire superiority on you,

1847
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:13.790
the way you overcome it is by aggressive action,

1848
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:18.200
by sending out someone to a flank and and do something aggressive move.

1849
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:19.123
That's what you have to do.

1850
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.230
That's what you do to get out of there and they taught us.

1851
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:23.240
That's another thing they tell us like you get ambushed.
Do you get,

1852
01:53:23.241 --> 01:53:27.410
someone's got fired spirit eerie,
what do you do?
You attack,
that's do you attack?

1853
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:32.150
<v 2>Still recommend that.</v>

1854
01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.660
<v 0>A couple more thoughts here from Frederick the great,</v>

1855
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:47.480
the general should make sure that new uniforms for the army arrive in time

1856
01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:51.680
towards spring,
that the captains provide shoes,
that the wagons,

1857
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:56.540
Canon carriage is et Cetera of the army are repaired as well as the saddles and

1858
01:53:56.541 --> 01:53:58.520
boots of the cavalry in a word.

1859
01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:03.650
He should enter into all these details and himself visit the quarters to see

1860
01:54:03.651 --> 01:54:07.160
what is going on there.
If the officers are drilling the recruits,

1861
01:54:07.161 --> 01:54:08.180
if they are working,

1862
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.480
and to animate them with kind words and reprimands to make them do their duty.

1863
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:18.060
So he's a guy that gets in there.
Yeah.

1864
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:21.550
That makes things happen as we've been talking about.

1865
01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:24.400
And he's also a person that really takes care of his people,

1866
01:54:24.401 --> 01:54:28.780
make sure that they are taken care of.
If you take care of your people,

1867
01:54:28.781 --> 01:54:30.340
your people are going to take care of you.

1868
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:34.580
He closes out and close out the Frederick.

1869
01:54:34.581 --> 01:54:39.530
The great thoughts right here.
I had to pick something to close on.

1870
01:54:39.531 --> 01:54:43.400
There's a lot of stuff,
but I figured this one would,
would do a decent job.

1871
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:49.870
It should be said to the shame of young men that debauchery and laziness often

1872
01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:54.830
make them prefer ease

1873
01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.430
<v 2>to glory.
Boom.</v>

1874
01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:03.693
So

1875
01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:07.940
<v 0>there you go.
And obviously once again,
um,</v>

1876
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:13.280
I think we see that leadership is leadership is leadership and in different

1877
01:55:13.281 --> 01:55:17.450
times and different places and different battles in different circumstances,

1878
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:21.440
the fundamental principles do not change.

1879
01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:24.310
They do not change it.

1880
01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:29.340
And we do see them with different angles and you see different nuances and that

1881
01:55:29.621 --> 01:55:34.621
provides us the ability to understand them with greater depth

1882
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:40.780
so that,
so that we can become better leaders.

1883
01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:44.070
Is War is what I'm talking about here.
Not,
maybe not,

1884
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.260
maybe not as great as Frederick the great,

1885
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:51.840
but if we become better leaders,
we can take better care of our teams.

1886
01:55:51.841 --> 01:55:55.590
And if we take care of our teams,
our teams will take care of us.
And that

1887
01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:00.480
is what leadership is.
Frederick the great.

1888
01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:08.420
Now we make this podcast so that we can learn and I learned a lot from this

1889
01:56:10.831 --> 01:56:15.831
podcast myself and we also do it on a podcast so that other people can learn

1890
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:20.460
with us,
which is seems fair.

1891
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:23.390
And if anyone wants to help support the podcast,

1892
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:28.770
it was actually a bunch of different ways that you can do at which we'll talk

1893
01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:33.600
about.
And it's not just like,
hey,
just support to podcasts.
That's not,

1894
01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.260
that's not the deal.
No,
it's more like just get in the game,
get anything.

1895
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:43.080
Yes.
That's the other one.
It's about just support.

1896
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:47.370
The podcast would be,
uh,
send,

1897
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:51.990
you know,
send money or hey,
we're going to put the podcasts

1898
01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:55.540
<v 3>behind a firewall and if you want to get them,
you'll give me money.</v>

1899
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:59.140
<v 0>That's not what we're saying.
No,
because we're getting a lot of,
oh,</v>

1900
01:56:59.150 --> 01:57:02.400
we're already getting a lot out of the podcast.
Yes sir.
So we're good.

1901
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:06.590
But if you want to get deeper into the game,
think that's cool.

1902
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.650
You can do that too.

1903
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:13.310
You can do that one way is our company origin USA.

1904
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.300
You can do it.
Farmington,
Maine.
What is it?

1905
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:23.010
American made products 100% American made without compromise.

1906
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.820
Get some,
we got gies and rash guards,

1907
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:32.160
which are the best in the world.
Straight up straight.
No,
no doubt.

1908
01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.130
No doubt.
Yeah.
Factually.
Oh,
it's factually the,

1909
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:41.070
the geese are made of a blend.

1910
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.930
They're not Ughi from 1956 which is what all other geese are.

1911
01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:50.050
Just geeks from 1956 I mean,

1912
01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.080
<v 3>yeah,
right.
No,
you're not.
You're a modern,</v>

1913
01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:57.910
modern made for Jujitsu.
Yes,
indeed.
Indeed.

1914
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:03.190
Yup.
Yeah.
And also
the joggers.

1915
01:58:03.191 --> 01:58:08.050
I know,
I know,
but yes,
the joggers most comfortable Joe.
So,

1916
01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:10.660
okay.
And you know,
I,

1917
01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:15.640
I consider myself a fancy myself as a connoisseur of comfort.
Right?

1918
01:58:15.850 --> 01:58:20.250
So I consider myself a connoisseur of suffering.
Yes.
So this,
the,

1919
01:58:20.290 --> 01:58:24.110
it's the daikon.
There's a dichotomy even within the podcast personalities.

1920
01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:29.910
So if you are interested in that,
I would recommend the joggers.
Yeah,
yeah.

1921
01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:34.270
I'm not interested in it.
So if you are interested,
you can get them with not,
oh,

1922
01:58:34.271 --> 01:58:36.880
by the way,
you can jog in them too,
by the way.
Okay.

1923
01:58:36.881 --> 01:58:39.160
Well then I guess that ups the suffering level a little bit.

1924
01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:42.280
He can do suffering in

1925
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:46.720
<v 4>the comfortable joggers.
That's,
that's kind of the key anywhere.
What else?</v>

1926
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:51.400
Also there's supplements there.
Yeah,
a bunch of different kinds.
Sure.

1927
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:55.930
Yeah.
Joint Weatherford joint supplement one.
Yeah.

1928
01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:58.960
So joint warfare is,

1929
01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:03.880
and this is totally just me doing this,
me categorizing it.
So the Krill oil,

1930
01:59:03.881 --> 01:59:07.480
Iowa,
I always looked at like,
okay,
Omega threes,
that's for general health,

1931
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:11.680
you know,
so joints and other stuff.
By the way,
your eyeballs,

1932
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:17.140
there's stuff too.
Um,
it's going to keep it more in the game,
healthy,
whatever.

1933
01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:20.050
So your joints as a degenerate over time.
Boom.

1934
01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:21.460
The Omega threes from the Krill oil,

1935
01:59:21.461 --> 01:59:24.580
which is the best absorption compared to fish oil and all these other

1936
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:28.420
supplements,
which are fine,
but crow is way better.
Jocko.
Super Krill oil,

1937
01:59:28.421 --> 01:59:30.550
even better,
more antioxidants,
by the way.

1938
01:59:30.551 --> 01:59:34.870
Factually I always considered those as just general health.
I did.

1939
01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:37.960
And so the joint warfare,

1940
01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:42.310
that's like if you're getting nuts doing Jujitsu,
that's kind of the thing,
right?

1941
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:45.730
Even when I first started you to Brant,
I think it was,
he was like,

1942
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:47.630
hey glucosomine and can Drayton,

1943
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:50.200
this is going to help you from just from all the twisting that you do,

1944
01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:53.140
especially when you train every day,
this is back,
you know,
training five,

1945
01:59:53.141 --> 01:59:56.810
six days a week,
hardcore competing or whatever.
And he was like,

1946
01:59:56.811 --> 01:59:57.890
yeah glucosomine constraints.

1947
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:01.720
So I always like viewed those two like so the joint warfare has glucosamine,

1948
02:00:01.730 --> 02:00:06.160
Chondroitin and Curcumin,
you know that I always got to add the extra good stuff.

1949
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:08.170
Yay.
Yeah,
I dig it.
Good.

1950
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:12.400
So it's like if your joints are being like hammered on,

1951
02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:18.070
cause you carrying a pick ax all day or something like this.
Anyway,

1952
02:00:18.071 --> 02:00:21.430
that's how I kind of view the thing.
So I had surgery on my bicep.

1953
02:00:21.431 --> 02:00:24.100
I know I'm going to go into it again.
I'm gonna give you an update on it.

1954
02:00:24.101 --> 02:00:28.630
So literally I'm no cast.
Have no cash bandage,
no stitches,
no nothing right now.

1955
02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:32.350
That's amazing.
In fact,
if you see me,

1956
02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.540
you wouldn't even think,
maybe

1957
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:39.700
<v 0>I didn't remember that you had surgery until you told me today</v>

1958
02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:44.700
<v 4>I want to do a tench.
But the uh,
the fro,</v>

1959
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:47.740
and that's funny you say that because sometimes I even forget I had surgery.

1960
02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:50.010
Like you don't want to like you do just everyday stuff.

1961
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.200
<v 0>Was there anything done?
I'm not going to try and drag this out,</v>

1962
02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:55.750
but you had the exact same surgery on the other arm.

1963
02:00:55.810 --> 02:00:59.110
The healing process was much,
much slower.
The only,

1964
02:00:59.770 --> 02:01:03.340
I guess difference between the two scenarios.
There's actually two differences.

1965
02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:06.310
I said the only,
but there's two differences.
One,

1966
02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:10.060
you were much younger in your first surgery,

1967
02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:14.420
which would indicate that probably you would heal quicker.
Yeah.

1968
02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:17.560
But that did not happen and that has not happened.
In fact,

1969
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:22.030
the opposite has happened.
You have healed much,
much faster.

1970
02:01:22.090 --> 02:01:23.740
It's not even close much faster.

1971
02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:29.260
And the only other thing is that joint warfare,
Krill oil.

1972
02:01:29.490 --> 02:01:34.320
<v 4>That's the only thing I did different.
Yes.
In fact,
yeah.</v>

1973
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:37.560
I mean,
yeah,
it's the only thing I did different.
Um,

1974
02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:39.650
to the point I hear it's

1975
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.950
<v 3>in the spirit of accuracy.
I don't know technically,</v>

1976
02:01:42.951 --> 02:01:47.951
biologically how much this is healing as far as Mike tendon healing to the bone.

1977
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.320
I don't know.
There's no way of knowing,
but I do know this,

1978
02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.110
I forget that I had surgery three weeks ago by the way,

1979
02:01:54.111 --> 02:01:56.900
to reattach my whole muscle,
to my boom.

1980
02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:00.560
They drill a hole in your bone.
They put it in that hole.

1981
02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:03.000
They put an anchor on the other side of your bone attached to them.

1982
02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.910
And it's broad.
It's not nothing.

1983
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.120
And I forget that I had that surgery three weeks ago,
by the way.
Well,

1984
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:13.490
that's good.
Joint Warfare,
awesome Krill oil.

1985
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:17.480
I've been on that forever and I highly recommend it because it helps you with

1986
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:20.810
everything.
And now you're saying it helps me with my vision too.
Well,

1987
02:02:20.811 --> 02:02:25.070
Omega threes helped you with a bunch of stuff in your body,
including vision.

1988
02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:28.040
All that stuff's going to know.
I just thought I just had sharp vision

1989
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:35.330
Omega threes men look into.
It's all good.
Also discipline,

1990
02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.030
you need discipline.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
just want to be self discipline in your life.

1991
02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.440
But you're not talking about that.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1992
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:47.480
And it's not even impose the discipline and actually it's kind of somewhat

1993
02:02:47.481 --> 02:02:48.111
imposed.

1994
02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:51.140
You're imposing on yourself but not really cause you made it tastes go then

1995
02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.410
supplements called discipline,
but you made it taste good so it's not imposed.

1996
02:02:54.411 --> 02:02:56.900
It's welcomed.
It's like well discipline.

1997
02:02:57.380 --> 02:02:59.550
Dave and I were up working with a client actually gets to me,

1998
02:02:59.551 --> 02:03:04.250
Dave and Lafe and we're up working with a company and you know,
whenever we work,

1999
02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:07.400
whenever we get together it's always like we're going hard.
And you know,

2000
02:03:07.401 --> 02:03:10.640
there's not a lot of sleep going on or whatever and workouts and all that.

2001
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:12.910
And you ever,
um,

2002
02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:18.440
you ever seen those like videos or memes where they got one word that means a

2003
02:03:19.071 --> 02:03:20.180
lot of different things.

2004
02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.650
Like I remember there was an old one about dude and it said like,
oh,

2005
02:03:24.651 --> 02:03:28.700
it could mean,
you know,
how's it going?
Like dude.
Or it could mean,

2006
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:30.080
why did you do that?
Like,
Dude.

2007
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:35.840
And the other day I was with Dave and we were at this gig and you know,

2008
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:39.920
like I said,
we're working and he sees me with a cause,
you know,

2009
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:42.840
Dave's kind of addicted to discipline.
Yes.
And he sees me with a,

2010
02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.930
I took a water bottle,
whatever,
you know,

2011
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.380
normal plastic water bottle and I poured discipline in it cause I always travel

2012
02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:52.150
with it.
And as I'm,
as I,

2013
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:57.170
I'm now standing with a clear plastic water bottle and Dave sees that I bet it's

2014
02:03:57.171 --> 02:04:01.020
discipline.
Right.
And he just looks at me,
he goes Brah

2015
02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.090
totally knew exactly what he meant.
He wanted some discipline bad.
And I was like,

2016
02:04:08.091 --> 02:04:10.580
yeah man,
I got enough for you Dave.

2017
02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:15.360
And then he caught on fire on fire.
Cognitively.
Really?

2018
02:04:15.361 --> 02:04:16.160
What's cause we were,

2019
02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.820
well we did some physical stuff in the morning but we didn't take this

2020
02:04:18.821 --> 02:04:22.610
supplement for that.
Uh,
it wasn't that hardcore.
It wasn't like we were rolling.

2021
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:24.140
But yeah,

2022
02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:29.170
he wanted the cognitive enhancement for putting together all the different

2023
02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:34.280
applications of extreme ownership up in the company.
So yeah.
Yup.

2024
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.440
No big deal.
And that's what it is.
Ultimately is a cognitive

2025
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.460
<v 0>enhancing supplement,
but Jocko style,
and you know what,</v>

2026
02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:43.920
this is the thing that I got to figure out because I've got,
you know,

2027
02:04:43.921 --> 02:04:47.970
I've got my own little methodologies of how I operate just across the board.

2028
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.480
There's just operations to happening,
right?
That's just how I roll.
For instance,

2029
02:04:51.570 --> 02:04:55.410
the discipline on in,
when I go in the field or when I go on a trip,

2030
02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:58.740
I have little,
little Tupperware thing that's small and I put it up above.

2031
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:02.040
I got a little elastic band on,
I carry in my travel bag,
whatever.
It's all good.

2032
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.220
I haven't figured out how to do this with milk yet,

2033
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:08.340
which is a problem because here's the thing with milk.

2034
02:05:09.150 --> 02:05:12.940
Milk tastes freaking good.
And if you don't know what mold because it's,
yeah,

2035
02:05:12.941 --> 02:05:15.510
it's got protein in it.
That's awesome.
It's got,

2036
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.120
what do they buy?
What are they called pro by?
It's got the whole biotics,

2037
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.440
which is awesome.

2038
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:24.750
And I never took those before cause I always thought that that was kind of like

2039
02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:29.010
just like a yoga thing.
Right?
But they're not so,
but they,

2040
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:31.850
but they're like,
no,
like you're talking to Brian and Pete there can no owner.

2041
02:05:31.851 --> 02:05:32.640
You definitely want to.

2042
02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.460
So we put them in there and now that definitely your gut will feel better,

2043
02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:39.540
but whatever,
I don't care about any of that.
It tastes freaking good.
Right?

2044
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:42.060
And so it gives you the old,

2045
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:47.670
the ultimate like satisfaction.
We know,
let's see,
you have a giant steak,

2046
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.350
which I eat a lot of giant stakes.

2047
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.860
Have you ever eaten a giant steak and you got done and you were still like,

2048
02:05:52.861 --> 02:05:57.310
you know what,
I just want it like something a little bit.
I was,
well,
no,

2049
02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.480
maybe so I get that way.
What I want.

2050
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:03.870
Maybe it's all those years where I should just get after the mint chocolate chip

2051
02:06:03.871 --> 02:06:06.660
ice cream at the end of the night.
And so sometimes that little,

2052
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:11.340
that little five little flashback and I get done with a big steak and I'm a

2053
02:06:11.341 --> 02:06:14.210
should be all happy.
And instead I'm like,
aw man,
I want to be the one.

2054
02:06:14.211 --> 02:06:17.280
So if you have mark with you,
you're good.
You want your dessert,

2055
02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:21.720
that's what you want.
I don't want to say that,
but it looks so anyways.

2056
02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:25.740
If you get milk,
you can have dessert every night.
You can have dessert every day.

2057
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:27.210
You can have breakfast,
Moelleken dinner

2058
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:33.470
cause it's a,
it's a meal and actually life was asking me,
it's like,

2059
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:36.480
what does [inaudible] mean?
Anyways,
I was like,
I made it up.
He's like,

2060
02:06:36.481 --> 02:06:38.930
what do you mean you paid off?
Because I had made it up.
How did you meet?

2061
02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.740
What was the making up process?

2062
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:44.970
Have you ever tasted it and what did you think when you first tasted it?

2063
02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.270
Taste like a dessert to me.
I was like,
Oh man,

2064
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:50.210
this is good mold and it just came out.

2065
02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:58.260
There's no other way to describe it.
It wasn't milking,
it wasn't ice cream,

2066
02:06:58.261 --> 02:07:00.210
it was something else.
There's something new,
so there you go.

2067
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:02.860
Mauk it's a mint chocolate milk.

2068
02:07:03.690 --> 02:07:06.610
Probiotics in it is a big deal.
You were like,
Oh yeah,

2069
02:07:06.611 --> 02:07:08.910
I guess what I was probably biotics we've striked guests.
You is cool.

2070
02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:11.170
That's your whole that man.
That's a huge deal.
I know.

2071
02:07:11.171 --> 02:07:14.640
I know that now that now that I realize how it settles your stomach,

2072
02:07:15.090 --> 02:07:18.240
but you know what else?
Speaking of Dave Berg,
Dave,

2073
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.420
you know how like I'm willing to mentor her milk.
Sorry.
Yes sir.
I do.

2074
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:26.370
His flavor happens to be peanut butter chocolate,

2075
02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:30.330
like that's his deal.
So He's,
he's like a crack addict.

2076
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:33.900
Like windows would say chocolate bean coming off.
So when he was just coming out,

2077
02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:36.160
um,
and then,
and then he said

2078
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:38.230
<v 3>it's not coming out for a long time.
And I was like,
yeah,</v>

2079
02:07:38.231 --> 02:07:40.990
it's going to be like another three or four weeks or five weeks.
And he's like,

2080
02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:45.840
I know that's a mall,
so take it easy Dave.
We got you.
Gotcha.
Um,

2081
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:48.970
be honest.
I agree with Dave.
I feel it's the exact same way.

2082
02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:52.810
And peanut butter chocolate happens to me.
My second favorite as well.

2083
02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:57.760
What's your first favorite mint chocolate chip.
You're fully in the game.

2084
02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:02.750
Hundred percent.
Actually.
They're even energy never made that connection.
Yeah,

2085
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:05.940
I might've mentioned it.
Maybe they did it.
I remembered that.

2086
02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:10.120
So you're pumped.
You're all about that mall.

2087
02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:12.130
I know you're 100% on board.

2088
02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:17.280
I try not to admit too much of my liking for desserts around you.

2089
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:22.590
A tame that back,
but the,
hey,
the facts are the facts.
Yeah,

2090
02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:25.840
the mock,
and actually I didn't mention this where it's like,
you know,

2091
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:29.260
you do the one scoop or whatever.
I don't do the one scoop or I put it in the,

2092
02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.130
in the big 30 ounce due to three scoops.

2093
02:08:33.131 --> 02:08:36.740
Even little bit of Phil,
I don't know.
I fill it up.
Well,

2094
02:08:36.741 --> 02:08:39.450
you just said 30 ounce or you're talking to 30 ounces?
Yeah,

2095
02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:42.880
probably not to the top.
Top 20 2023 ounces.
Sure.

2096
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:45.790
24 25 and you're putting two,
three scoops.

2097
02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:48.380
Three scoops in and scoops it thick.

2098
02:08:48.381 --> 02:08:51.800
Is that because I'm doing like 20 ounces of milk and two scoops?

2099
02:08:51.810 --> 02:08:56.020
It's not extra thick,
I think,
but that's just what my standard,
I don't know.

2100
02:08:56.021 --> 02:08:59.250
Like what's the style?
I don't really take protein powders or nothing like this,

2101
02:08:59.251 --> 02:09:03.280
so,
hey,
thick,
good.

2102
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.280
Actually put an egg in there,
put it in the blender.
Dang right.

2103
02:09:06.281 --> 02:09:10.810
You really want to get nuts.
I'd do that for like the squat or the experience.

2104
02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:14.560
No.
All right,
so that's milk you want to go to on some,

2105
02:09:14.561 --> 02:09:17.050
get some origin main.com.
Yes.

2106
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:22.450
Origin main.com is where you ordered and you can also get it on Amazon.
FYI,

2107
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:23.830
if you didn't know that.
Hey,

2108
02:09:23.831 --> 02:09:28.831
speaking of origin main.com if you want to come to the Jujitsu immersion camp is

2109
02:09:28.931 --> 02:09:32.140
August 26 through September 2nd there's two.

2110
02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.580
What phases,
sessions,
sessions,
or we can go to the whole thing.

2111
02:09:37.210 --> 02:09:39.880
Somebody asked if we're going to go to the origin factory.

2112
02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:41.900
If you want to come see the factory.
Yes,
we're going to be,

2113
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:45.490
the factory visit isn't in the middle of the week and we'll be doing Jujitsu all

2114
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:47.180
the time,
so get some,

2115
02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.610
we'll see their ongoing echo's going.

2116
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:56.310
Echo is going to be incapacitated because I,
oh,

2117
02:09:57.130 --> 02:10:01.840
oh,
so you'd just be in a knowledge acquiring mode.
Yeah,

2118
02:10:02.410 --> 02:10:06.670
and and knowledge sharing mode isn't technically I,
I could,
I could rule,

2119
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:11.770
but okay.
Then we roll with Brian.
Viglione comes in,

2120
02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:16.720
starts getting nuts.
I can't rule with him.
Well maybe it could.
No,

2121
02:10:16.730 --> 02:10:19.840
I shouldn't.
It'd be irresponsible for me to roll heart.
Put it that way.

2122
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:23.680
He didn't care.
He came here and rolled it isn't,
he was jacked up.
Right.

2123
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:25.360
He's neat.
Yeah.
But it's different.

2124
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:29.560
Like a muscle tendon attachment is directly correlated.

2125
02:10:29.561 --> 02:10:30.460
Injury wise,

2126
02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.760
directly correlated with how hard you go on that muscle directly.

2127
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.630
So you'll be a limited basis,
but you'll be there to share knowledge,

2128
02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:42.770
receive knowledge,
hang out,
kick it,
eat lobster.
Yes.

2129
02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:47.870
Oh Dang.
Echo is gonna be there.
I'm going to be there.
Dave Burke is going to be,

2130
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:49.910
their life is going to be there.

2131
02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.040
Jp I believe is marginal right now.
We're not 100%,
but whatever.

2132
02:10:55.370 --> 02:11:00.320
We'll be there.
We'll be hanging out and uh,
like black belts Galore.

2133
02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:02.870
I forgot that part.
Yeah.
Black Belts Galore.

2134
02:11:03.110 --> 02:11:07.580
There'll be a bunch of black belts and then every other belt.
Yeah,
a huge deal.

2135
02:11:07.581 --> 02:11:09.580
Knowledge wise.
Even training wise.
Yeah.

2136
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:11.570
Cause most everyone's going to be training.
Yeah.

2137
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:16.040
So you get to experience like cause cause um,
yeah sometimes it's like if you,

2138
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:18.740
some people have never rolled with it,
but some people never know.

2139
02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:21.140
Some people have never trained before and they're gonna come to the camp that

2140
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:23.480
happened last year.
People have never trained before it came to the camp.

2141
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:26.000
But I'm sorry I cut you off and you're going to say that some people never

2142
02:11:26.001 --> 02:11:26.960
rolled to the black belt before.

2143
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:30.080
Like even if they had been training for even like a year or something like that.

2144
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:34.250
Some,
you know,
sometimes that's how it goes,
you know?
Or if it's like,
hey,

2145
02:11:34.251 --> 02:11:38.860
I want to roll with Jocko specifically.
Are you kidding?
You're good.

2146
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:43.940
I'm good.
Last year I had a rib issue this year.
No issues whatsoever.
No good.

2147
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:48.920
So that's that.
Boom.
And also switching gears,

2148
02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:53.240
just another good way to support the podcast and oneself.

2149
02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:54.213
Jack the store,

2150
02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:58.610
it was called Jocko store website chocolate store.com I know.

2151
02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:02.720
Super simple but that's the way we keep it.

2152
02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:07.760
I keep it simple now too.
Yeah,
that's a law of combat actually.
Exactly right.

2153
02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:10.760
Boom.
And you practice what you preach.
As we all know,
anyone,

2154
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:15.350
[inaudible] dot com this is where you can get chocolate here.

2155
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:19.550
Like you can get rash guards and you used to always go on a big tangent about

2156
02:12:19.551 --> 02:12:23.090
how it's for all activities.
Sure it is.
Yeah,

2157
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:25.840
I do when the water's warm,
but right,

2158
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:28.460
right now by the way out here in California,
the water's warm.

2159
02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:32.930
You do not need a wet suit at this time to surf.
And so yeah,

2160
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:37.550
the origin rash guards very effective for surfing the Jocko white rash guards.

2161
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.590
Also very effective for surfing and cycling and cycling and whatever else.

2162
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:47.210
Yeah.
And everything that's um,

2163
02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:51.530
yes,
again,
Jocko store.com is where you can get all this stuff.
T shirts,

2164
02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.240
the ones that say discipline equals freedom.
Get after it.
Tank tops by the way.

2165
02:12:56.450 --> 02:13:01.430
Oh yeah.
And I'll also on Amazon there's fake Jocko tee shirts.
Yeah.

2166
02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:03.170
I'm,
I'm cool.
I'm,

2167
02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:06.530
I'm happy that you're in like trying to get in the game and that's cool.

2168
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:12.100
It's a cool way to like feel cool about stuff and you can do that but you are

2169
02:13:13.611 --> 02:13:18.230
not supporting that is therefore it does not go to that support goes to someone

2170
02:13:18.231 --> 02:13:22.480
that a pirate.
A pirate.
Yeah,
but not like not a cool part or not a cool pie.

2171
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.560
Just a thief.
So watch out for those.
If you get your tee shirts,

2172
02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:31.050
get them from Jocko store.com also,
you can get trucker hats.
Yes.

2173
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:36.180
Which you seem to be really surprised at.
Trucker hats would look cool on me.

2174
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:39.690
You told me you were like,
I need a picture of the situation.

2175
02:13:40.050 --> 02:13:43.930
I don't know that I can get right here.
Get the flak where they flex.
Flex fit.

2176
02:13:43.931 --> 02:13:47.840
See that?
That's what everyone's all pumped for.
I'm old school.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2177
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:52.860
And then beanies to yes sir.
Which,
which beanies for me.
This is a,

2178
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.980
so I sleep when I'm on planes.
Sure.
You went on a plane.
I sleep.

2179
02:13:56.310 --> 02:14:00.700
I put a beanie on my head.
Oh,
well sleep.
You sleep for like four minutes.
Yeah.

2180
02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:03.470
The legs.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
You've been on the plane with me.
Yes sir.
Have A,

2181
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:07.590
so I'll put my head up against the bulkhead as they call it in a plane.

2182
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.100
And the beanie keeps your head from a little tiny valuations going the whole

2183
02:14:11.101 --> 02:14:13.540
time.
You just need that little beanie.
It's like a pillow.
Yup.

2184
02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:18.240
So I put on a beanie and sleep.
If you see me,
don't bother me.
Um,

2185
02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.200
and then I'll wake up and four minutes later be ready to rock and roll and
right.

2186
02:14:21.201 --> 02:14:25.080
And another book.
Yes sir.
So when you say,
Oh,
I sleep on the plane,

2187
02:14:25.081 --> 02:14:28.960
who's think I sleep on the plane,
go use on the plane.
That's what I'm saying.

2188
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.670
It's amazing.
Yes sir.
I was impressed by your sleeping capabilities that you,

2189
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.990
you had sunglasses on.
Yes.
You were asleep for four straight hours.
You know,

2190
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:43.050
you look like those.
What are those Chinese statues?

2191
02:14:43.230 --> 02:14:44.063
Um,

2192
02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:49.130
in the big vault where they have like thousands of Chinese soldiers all lined

2193
02:14:49.621 --> 02:14:53.850
up.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Anyways,
that's what I looked like.
You just look like a pro.

2194
02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:57.000
You did not move out and you did not move.

2195
02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.910
Your head stayed straight up and he just sat there asleep.

2196
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.920
Just so disruptive to sleep.
I sleep on the plane.
I'm like,

2197
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:08.790
you know,
it depends on what you mean by sleep,
but I get it.

2198
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.180
And the beanies eliminate.
That makes sense.
Yeah.

2199
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.610
They allow it and they keep the head warm.
Yeah,

2200
02:15:14.611 --> 02:15:17.910
it was going to say they do have other uses and even let's face it,

2201
02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:20.120
they look kind of cool.
Yeah,
for sure.
Well,
yeah,

2202
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:21.510
I know you don't know about that either.

2203
02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:24.900
I don't know about sleeping or looking cool.
None the less they are available.

2204
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:26.790
Bed is true.
Also women's stuff.

2205
02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:28.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2206
02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.220
<v 3>Lot of times people will ask me,
hey,
make more a women's stuff.</v>

2207
02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:32.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2208
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:35.960
<v 3>And I will,
but there's web stuff on their tanks and shirts and whatnot.</v>

2209
02:15:35.961 --> 02:15:39.330
The rash guards are kind of for everybody as well.
But yeah.
Good stuff on that.

2210
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:44.030
Good women's stuff.
Good stuff to get afterward in.
And hoodies.

2211
02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:47.090
Yes.
Don't forget about hoodies.
Yeah.
I want to make a new hoodie.

2212
02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.280
You might not approve of this,
I think.

2213
02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.050
Why are we making things that I don't approve of?
Do you know?
Sometimes they,

2214
02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:56.600
hey look,
I don't break the rules every,
why won't I approve of it?

2215
02:15:56.690 --> 02:16:00.830
Except sometimes because it's lightweight.
It's a lighter weight Hoodie.

2216
02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:05.600
Can we did it might be a zip up as the Hawaiian version.
Wait,

2217
02:16:05.601 --> 02:16:08.900
why would someone want to Hoodie?
That's not going to keep more.

2218
02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.230
It'll keep you a little bit warm cause sometimes it cause you're going to,

2219
02:16:12.231 --> 02:16:12.621
you can't,

2220
02:16:12.621 --> 02:16:15.320
you know when you're sleeping or when you're trying to go sleep at night,
right.

2221
02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:17.120
And then you put the covers on,
you're like,
Dang,
I'm too hot.

2222
02:16:17.121 --> 02:16:19.220
You take the covers off.
Oh it's like too cold.

2223
02:16:19.221 --> 02:16:22.220
So you got to get in that little zone that you can't get into sometimes.

2224
02:16:22.221 --> 02:16:26.690
Every once in a while it's like that.
So sometimes in life it's like that.
Okay,

2225
02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.370
while we're doing this,
can we make ultra,

2226
02:16:28.371 --> 02:16:32.200
I want the possible weight that they make it in America.

2227
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:35.410
This is what we're going to do.
I'm going to get with Pete.
All right.

2228
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:40.570
And we're going to figure it out.
Fabricate whatever even.
Yeah.

2229
02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.830
Even when you talked to Pete,
like let me get the samples.

2230
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:46.000
I want them in my hands.

2231
02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:50.440
I want to feel the weight not playing around with this Hawaiian Love Hawaii.

2232
02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:53.950
As you know,
it's my homeland,
but I'm not down with the Hawaiians sweatshirts.

2233
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.823
Hey,
so

2234
02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:01.570
where are you going to wear a heavy,
heavy hoody?
Not here.

2235
02:17:01.571 --> 02:17:05.140
You're talking to when you go to Montana or something like this?
Montana.

2236
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.390
Michigan.
Yeah.
Boston.
Yeah.

2237
02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.880
It's cold in the morning here.
Okay.

2238
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.500
How [inaudible] 33 degrees.
36 degrees.

2239
02:17:17.501 --> 02:17:19.870
38 degrees.
Go Surfing in the morning sometime.
We May,

2240
02:17:20.210 --> 02:17:23.020
I see what's up and I'm going to try wearing hoodies.
Surfery first.
No,

2241
02:17:23.170 --> 02:17:27.430
you wear it to go surfing.
Surfing.
Okay.
All right.
Hey,

2242
02:17:27.431 --> 02:17:31.930
I'm going to take your word for that and actually I have a heavy Hoodie I think.

2243
02:17:31.970 --> 02:17:36.970
Do you have a like a super ultra and I only wear it when it's unreasonably cold

2244
02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:43.730
in my opinion.
Quite much from years 62.
Yeah.

2245
02:17:43.810 --> 02:17:47.980
Know 50 either way.
Boom.

2246
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:49.720
I told him to do the summer one.
You know what?

2247
02:17:49.721 --> 02:17:53.440
I think this is more what I predict.
I predict people will like tell him.
Yeah,

2248
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:58.150
I think so very much actually.
Okay.
We'll see.
We'll check your fashion sense.

2249
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:03.400
Um,
which I have none so we could go with it.
Also subscribe to the podcast,

2250
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.880
iTunes,
Google play,
stitcher,
Spotify.

2251
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.030
Someone just told me Spotify on your podcasts.
On Spotify.

2252
02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:13.090
We can fast forward without having a subscription or something like that.

2253
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.040
So we're just on Spotify just full on whatever.
It's all good.

2254
02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:23.260
And also leave.
If you want to leave a review,
give us some feedback.
That's cool.

2255
02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:28.480
And you can do like one dude did who put an Oom lout over every oh,

2256
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:30.340
in his reveal.

2257
02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:35.260
So obviously in the game he know photo cool.

2258
02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:38.410
Youtube too.
Yup.
Yeah.
The Youtube,

2259
02:18:38.530 --> 02:18:42.490
the thing about youtube is echo makes,

2260
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:47.820
he's not going to say this because he's super humble,
right?
Nobody makes the,
the,

2261
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:50.950
the enhanced videos,

2262
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:56.080
which are legit and if you want to watch him,
you got to go there.

2263
02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:00.940
And He seems to be putting up more and more excerpts of little videos,

2264
02:19:00.941 --> 02:19:05.941
little clips of the podcast so you can share them sharable.

2265
02:19:06.730 --> 02:19:09.070
It wasn't there some like lunch thing called a shareable.

2266
02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.800
I think that was a lunchable.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yes,
man.

2267
02:19:16.090 --> 02:19:20.880
You kind of knew,
but the drinking too much job.
Oh yes.
Very sharp.

2268
02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:22.690
I tried to you,
uh,

2269
02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:27.720
choose or put up the ones that I think apply to all us in one way or another.

2270
02:19:28.011 --> 02:19:31.700
So many times like people will say,
Hey,
this is just on time right here,

2271
02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.870
this little message cause they were thinking this or something like that because

2272
02:19:34.871 --> 02:19:38.720
it applies to all of a sudden throw one of our bros.
That's kind of a,
you know,

2273
02:19:38.721 --> 02:19:43.330
we're not super tight,
but we're,
we're,
we're,
we're,
he came out to me,

2274
02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:48.410
he was like,
hey man,
he went through a little rough patch with a,

2275
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.770
with a female.
Yes.

2276
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:53.030
And he went through the whole breakup scenario and he was like,

2277
02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:57.160
I watched that video a hundred times.
The breakup one.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.

2278
02:19:57.350 --> 02:20:01.130
Like you said,
you happen to put that out there and he happened to somebody,

2279
02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.610
somebody,
one of our other friends sent it to him like,
hey,
check this out.

2280
02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:06.890
And he was like,
oh,
okay,
got it.

2281
02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:12.220
Now he's moving on as it should be and it's way simpler and more effective.

2282
02:20:12.350 --> 02:20:14.930
I mean in a scenario like that where rather than Sydney,
hey,

2283
02:20:14.931 --> 02:20:18.560
remember that episode with that in and it's like two,
two and a half hours long.

2284
02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:22.460
Hey,
read a watch.
I timestamp,

2285
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.540
this is a good message to pie.
I'm not going to do all that,
you know,

2286
02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:30.260
but if it's just x or you just made it sound like it's all laziness,

2287
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:31.820
not necessarily laziness.

2288
02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:36.680
Like there's sometimes there's some nuggets that just need to be put out there

2289
02:20:36.681 --> 02:20:40.310
to the world.
Yeah.
And it's not just because you didn't want it.

2290
02:20:40.310 --> 02:20:45.140
Some people don't have time to listen to it.
Just,
you know.
Yeah man.
Jocko.

2291
02:20:45.141 --> 02:20:46.440
Mcnuggets remember though,

2292
02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:52.420
I'm also good way to support is on it.com/jocko good fitness stuff on there.

2293
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:56.420
I just got some,
um,
you know what?
You know what?

2294
02:20:56.421 --> 02:21:01.190
I got Elk Bacon,
elk,
you know,
like where are your bars?
They're warrior bars.

2295
02:21:01.770 --> 02:21:05.780
I think they're brand new.
Did you get those here?
So good.
So good.

2296
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:09.710
You know what I have for you too is I have a mace for you.

2297
02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:13.910
I have a 20 pound mace that I've been hoarding at my house and I apologize,

2298
02:21:13.911 --> 02:21:16.640
but I owe it to you.
I'll bring it next time.
So cute cause they're there.

2299
02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:18.950
You know what I use those four people said,
what do you do with those?

2300
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:24.310
Basically I swung them around like a maniac,
psycho barbarian with a battleax.

2301
02:21:24.390 --> 02:21:29.300
Yeah,
but they're a little shorter,
but they're heavy and I put it into my,

2302
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:33.080
I'll put it into my
routine.

2303
02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:37.670
I want to say routine because that's every day I put it into a workout almost as

2304
02:21:37.671 --> 02:21:42.671
like a little mobility slash cardio slash something break.

2305
02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:47.030
It's,
it's a good tool to have.
It's a good tool to have.

2306
02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:50.780
I got to do you think the 20 pounder,
the 20 pounder looks light.

2307
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:53.960
When I give it to,
you're gonna be like,
Oh,
I'm going to know it's,
it's heavy.

2308
02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:58.670
We'll consider a side from a 20 pound weight,
like what weighs 20 pounds?

2309
02:21:58.730 --> 02:22:03.650
Nothing.
Huge things.
TV or something like this.
And then you see amazing.

2310
02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:06.830
How,
how long is it not going?
As long as you're sure it's probably,

2311
02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:11.600
it might might not even be two feet long.
It's 20 pounds.
20 pounds.
Yeah.

2312
02:22:11.601 --> 02:22:12.320
So your,

2313
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:16.740
your eyes and your brain and your body kind like Kinda miscalculating you know

2314
02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:19.650
by observation you pick it up and you're like,
Dang,
this thing is heavy.
Yeah.

2315
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:22.700
Yeah.
So do it.
Yeah.
Actually that's perfect.

2316
02:22:22.701 --> 02:22:24.880
I go walk down this canyon right outside my house is,

2317
02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:28.910
and I always feel like I want to carry something you dose thing.

2318
02:22:29.970 --> 02:22:34.120
If you had it as a weapon it would not be effective.
It's too heavy.
Yeah.

2319
02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:36.030
It's like that.
That's how heavy it is.

2320
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:39.280
It'd be cool to carry and I'm sure if you had a blood into someone to death with

2321
02:22:39.281 --> 02:22:44.010
it,
you could,
it would be not an ideal weapon against a mountain mine,

2322
02:22:44.011 --> 02:22:45.390
which is like the big threat here.

2323
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:47.460
When you're walking to the canyon behind your house,
you know,

2324
02:22:47.461 --> 02:22:48.420
you get the mountain lion,

2325
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:52.950
you're gonna re rear that Mesa got you by the neck.

2326
02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:57.460
Actually it's more just ticket.
Usually I'll grab like a thin stick,
just,

2327
02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:02.040
it's just,
it's just fun.
You know,
it'd be solid.

2328
02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:07.550
I'm looking forward to that one,
but hey,
that elk,
uh,

2329
02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:10.770
I don't even know if they call it a worry part,
but it's l bacon.

2330
02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:15.750
There's a 21 grams of protein in that 21 that's good.

2331
02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:19.020
And it's one of those things that can kind of keep you on the path.

2332
02:23:19.050 --> 02:23:20.780
If you're in the mood for a little song,

2333
02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:23.880
a hundred percent kind of like psychological warfare.
The album,

2334
02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:29.400
you get that on,
well you can get it on iTunes,

2335
02:23:29.401 --> 02:23:33.630
Google play and B three it's a little album talking about how to stay on the

2336
02:23:33.631 --> 02:23:36.210
path.
That's all.
Get some,
yeah.

2337
02:23:36.330 --> 02:23:40.530
Well actually in the spirit of meticulous accuracy,

2338
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:42.450
it'll help you.

2339
02:23:42.451 --> 02:23:46.430
It's an album about telling you why and how you should stay on the path.
Yeah.

2340
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:50.370
In those moments of weakness,
when you kind of feel,
actually it's not,

2341
02:23:50.371 --> 02:23:52.110
when you feel like getting off the path path,

2342
02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:55.410
it's when you don't feel like staying on that path for that moment.

2343
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.410
This will get you right back.
Cool.

2344
02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:01.870
100% effectiveness Jocko Willink cause the artist.
Yes sir.
Yeah.

2345
02:24:02.010 --> 02:24:05.220
You can get it on Amazon,
iTunes,
wherever we get MPPS.
That's where you get it.

2346
02:24:05.610 --> 02:24:08.430
Also Jocko white tea,

2347
02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:14.400
try t and in a can by the way.
So the dry tea,

2348
02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:17.160
he was thinking,
I didn't know this,
so I'm gonna say it by,

2349
02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:18.750
and I know a lot of people would be like Kung Fu.

2350
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:21.900
Oh all the dog already knew that.
I remember like we were saying earlier,

2351
02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:26.430
but dry tea,
dry tea is like the actual one.

2352
02:24:26.431 --> 02:24:31.230
You got to brew this tea bags then?
Yes.
Yeah.
Like in a bag or whatever.

2353
02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:35.170
He comes in a tea bag.
Wait,
can't you have it?
Like what do you call it?

2354
02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:39.230
Loose loose leaf.
And we do not have loose links.
That's not dry.
You know,

2355
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:44.520
for the seven people out there that want loose leaf passionately,
I feel you.

2356
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:48.600
I feel you.
And I just had a woman the other day that was like,
Hey,

2357
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:51.180
I really want loose leaf tea.
And I was like,
oh,
that's awesome.

2358
02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.460
And there's six other of you that want that.
And as we grow,

2359
02:24:56.550 --> 02:25:00.380
eventually we'll do loose leaf for the purists.
Right.

2360
02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:03.420
For the PRS that want to deal with that.
Yeah.

2361
02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:06.540
That have the time to deal with that.
So right now,
no loose leaf.

2362
02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:10.480
You got to go with a tea bag or in a can get,

2363
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:13.410
which strangely I'm the opposite.

2364
02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:16.260
I don't know if I'd be considered opposite of the loose leaf artisans,

2365
02:25:16.350 --> 02:25:20.070
but they can,
I pound way more of the camp then the pin,

2366
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:23.170
cause I don't like brew it,
but they can't.
Oh,

2367
02:25:23.171 --> 02:25:25.240
I'm popping them everyday surprisingly too,

2368
02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:30.070
because I don't see how there's tea drinkers technically,
whatever.

2369
02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:33.760
I'm not a tea drinker.
This is what I think is going to be interesting.

2370
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:39.070
It tastes really good.
Yes.
It makes you feel really good.

2371
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:41.790
It's refreshing.
Right?

2372
02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:47.200
He's just there that got that thing that dislike is good.
Right.

2373
02:25:47.201 --> 02:25:48.310
Okay.
I,

2374
02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:52.420
I think one of the standard energy drinks,

2375
02:25:52.690 --> 02:25:56.170
they're filled with sugar and they,
and they,
they,

2376
02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:58.690
they got everything in there to make them taste good.

2377
02:25:58.691 --> 02:26:02.410
That's what they're set up for and they got the caffeine that's going to make

2378
02:26:02.411 --> 02:26:04.270
you feel good and all this stuff.

2379
02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:08.650
As good as those things are the,

2380
02:26:09.350 --> 02:26:11.470
the dark away t it's better.
It's,
it's,

2381
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:15.310
it's like if you had the choice of one of the two,
like let's,
okay,
let's be real.

2382
02:26:15.311 --> 02:26:17.110
I'm going to be real here with you right now for a second.

2383
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:22.770
If I had the choice between like a salad and a mint chocolate chip ice cream

2384
02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:24.573
milkshake,

2385
02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:29.410
if I had to spill my heart spill y'all to you right now,

2386
02:26:29.980 --> 02:26:31.930
I'd be like if you put those two in front of me,

2387
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:36.580
nine times out of 10 I'm going to get the mint chocolate chip milkshake.

2388
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:37.780
Occasionally I'll be like,
okay,

2389
02:26:37.781 --> 02:26:39.580
I'll have a salad cause I'm really in the mood for that,

2390
02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:43.060
but nine times out of 10 like I'm just going to go with what you know,

2391
02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:47.710
which is that majority geography of milkshake is good with this.

2392
02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:50.860
Nine Times out of the 10 you're actually going to get Jocko white tea.

2393
02:26:50.890 --> 02:26:52.120
You're not going to take the thing.

2394
02:26:52.121 --> 02:26:56.260
You're not going to get the thing that's been engineered to be like attack your

2395
02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:00.360
taste buds and make them massage and feel good and you don't know.

2396
02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:03.640
You don't want to feed.
This is obviously an assumption,
but when you get like,

2397
02:27:03.641 --> 02:27:07.630
okay,
you have a duck white tea in a k,
then you have a standard energy drink,

2398
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:12.790
the standard energy drink.
I think the taste is more of a secondary thing.

2399
02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:14.410
When they make it,
it's more like,
you know,

2400
02:27:14.411 --> 02:27:17.290
get you and like the caffeine and the the whatever.

2401
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:20.680
But they make that stuff tastes good.
Yes,
but that's secondary.

2402
02:27:20.681 --> 02:27:23.680
That's why like birth tastes to energy drink.
It's like okay,

2403
02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:25.900
you know all the tastes okay,
it tastes good,

2404
02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.310
but it's like it can be an acquired taste.

2405
02:27:28.311 --> 02:27:31.990
It tastes kind of weird to be honest with you and that's a good point with this,

2406
02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:35.410
it's like how you say,
I don't want to overuse the word refreshing.

2407
02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:36.500
Don't want to do that.
Well,

2408
02:27:36.501 --> 02:27:40.930
what was just going to say is in order to not overuse that word,
have you ever,

2409
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:44.470
okay,
remember when you were a kid and you doing something,

2410
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:47.800
you're all hot and sweaty,
tired,
like it's hot outside and you're thirsty.

2411
02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.330
And so you're,

2412
02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:53.590
you get a Gatorade and you drink the Gatorade and when you get down the Gatorade

2413
02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:57.970
you're still thirsty because it's got whatever it hasn't it that doesn't taste

2414
02:27:57.971 --> 02:28:02.170
like water.
It's like too far away from water.
When you,

2415
02:28:02.171 --> 02:28:04.990
when you drink the tea,
it's like an actual,

2416
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.260
it actually satisfies the actual thirst.
Yes it does.
Yeah.
Cause it's,

2417
02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:14.740
it's super mild.
It is mine.
It is mild.
But it does have a weird kind of,

2418
02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:20.320
I mean,
I don't want to overstate this,
but it's like this crispy kind of feeling.

2419
02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:22.070
It could be the kid,
it could be

2420
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:26.180
<v 4>the cat.
I don't,
you know how you drink some man,
I get this same thing.</v>

2421
02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:30.230
So how's this?
So two occasions is legitimate and recent.
That's why.

2422
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:34.340
So to eight and one time I was feeling kind of sick.
I was sick.
Oh.
Straight up,

2423
02:28:34.341 --> 02:28:39.110
sick.
And I was feeling like,
aw,
you know,
I took,

2424
02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.910
I was sick to the point where I got to take like one of these,
you know,

2425
02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:45.440
a lot of no Nyquil,
the Nyquil,
it was like Tylenol,
you know,
the liquid one,

2426
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:47.490
the little,
the red syrupy liquid one.

2427
02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:51.140
And it's been so long since I took anything like that.
So I was like,

2428
02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:52.370
I don't know how much you take,
let me,

2429
02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:55.130
so I put it in little shot glass that I had and I just pounded it.

2430
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:59.060
Apparently it was too much.
So I'm like,
oh,
I'm like jammed up.
Super jammed up,

2431
02:28:59.061 --> 02:29:01.880
like super nauseous,
had all messed up.
Like,
oh,

2432
02:29:01.881 --> 02:29:05.360
I couldn't really think tech that was messed up and we had to record that day.

2433
02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:08.330
So this was earlier,
like in the morning and this how I'm like,
shoot,

2434
02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:10.700
I'm hoping I'm off this thing.
I just kind of laid out and whatever.

2435
02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:13.850
And I brought,
it wasn't off it.
When I came in and recorded,
I was like,
man,

2436
02:29:13.851 --> 02:29:17.660
I'm like super nauseous.
I'm not feeling good.
So I tried to drink like some,
uh,

2437
02:29:17.661 --> 02:29:20.690
caffeine thing to kind of probably didn't help.
It was messing me up.

2438
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:25.820
So I grabbed one of these and instantly now not that came like I drink something

2439
02:29:25.821 --> 02:29:29.300
and then I ended up feeling better.
It was like I drink and I was like,
Dang,

2440
02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.900
instantly felt better.
So I was like,
you know,
could have been a timing thing.

2441
02:29:32.901 --> 02:29:35.590
Whatever,
100% full credit cards,

2442
02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:38.240
it's 100% but the thing is that's a

2443
02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:45.680
total anecdotal,
I realize,
but,
and then another time I drank,
I,
okay.

2444
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:50.600
So I'm unlike you,
like I do like coffee,
you know,
for the,
for the,
the caffeine,

2445
02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:53.930
right in the morning,
whenever.
So I come across this coffee,
the brand,

2446
02:29:53.931 --> 02:29:57.320
we will remain nameless,
but it's 1.75 times,

2447
02:29:57.321 --> 02:30:02.320
almost two times the caffeine,
200% it's 175% Catholic of the caffeine.

2448
02:30:02.321 --> 02:30:05.690
That's a lot of caffeine.
So I'm like,
Hey,
I'm gonna get this.
And you know,

2449
02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:09.140
if it's like too crazy,
I'll just make less of it or drink glass of water down,

2450
02:30:09.141 --> 02:30:12.710
whatever.
So I make something first time,
it totally messes you up.
It puts you,

2451
02:30:12.890 --> 02:30:16.160
caffeine is like a curve where you want to hit it at the top of the wave.

2452
02:30:16.161 --> 02:30:18.440
You know where it catches you.
If you drink too much.

2453
02:30:18.441 --> 02:30:20.870
It makes me feel jittery and then if you just really drink too much,

2454
02:30:20.871 --> 02:30:24.890
it makes me feel kind of sick.
In my experience.
This just regular,

2455
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.720
the same amount I drink of regular coffee,

2456
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:29.930
it put me over into nausea immediately.
No,

2457
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:33.950
like belly dude.
No,
it wasn't like pain,

2458
02:30:33.951 --> 02:30:36.890
like how something it'll,
it's like it's in your head,

2459
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:41.000
it makes your head all Weigley at whatever.
And so I'm like,
man,

2460
02:30:41.001 --> 02:30:42.980
I'm messed up for this thing.
So the next day I'm like,

2461
02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:45.230
I'm not going to drink tasks.
Like no,
you know what,
I'll water it down.

2462
02:30:45.231 --> 02:30:47.090
So I watered down,
boom,
same exact thing.

2463
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:51.890
Messed me up and happened to be yet another day that we record.

2464
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:53.121
So I come in,

2465
02:30:53.121 --> 02:30:56.630
I'm like all came to and it grab another one of these seeds again instantly.

2466
02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:00.870
Immediately.
It didn't like,
oh help it wear off later or whatever.

2467
02:31:00.871 --> 02:31:02.990
Like immediately made me feel better.
No nausea.

2468
02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:07.730
I'm not saying this is an antinausea medication,
but I will tell you this,

2469
02:31:07.731 --> 02:31:10.350
you're just providing multiple examples.

2470
02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:18.040
I will say that about the Jocko white tea in a cat organic certified.

2471
02:31:18.381 --> 02:31:20.100
Yes sir.
Alright,
cool.

2472
02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:22.170
<v 3>Uh,
got some books</v>

2473
02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:27.930
that I've written and you can get those on.
Boy.

2474
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:29.630
You can get them where books are sold.
Yeah.

2475
02:31:30.450 --> 02:31:34.920
This what is not the best one.
The current one that I'm on right now,

2476
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:39.120
me and my daughter,
we have the word kid to mark the mission.
Actually.

2477
02:31:39.121 --> 02:31:43.950
She was very,
very excited about that,
I think.
Cause you signed it too,

2478
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:48.510
but yeah.
But yeah,
that's a good one.
Um,
and she happened to be,
you know,

2479
02:31:48.511 --> 02:31:51.600
in the beginning the paper Miss Shea.
Oh yeah.
Pumpkin.
Pumpkin.
Yeah.

2480
02:31:51.601 --> 02:31:52.890
She was really into that by the way.

2481
02:31:52.891 --> 02:31:57.390
But she has a situation where one of the girls in her class classes,

2482
02:31:57.391 --> 02:32:00.540
like she's not a teaser necessarily,

2483
02:32:00.541 --> 02:32:04.110
but she's just bossy and now you've got to deep just got to deal with people.

2484
02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:09.350
I get a lot of warrior kid podcast questions about bossy kids.
Yeah.
And it's,

2485
02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:13.410
yeah,
yeah,
me and it makes sense.
But she has,
she's,
she's all on that.

2486
02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:19.470
And so that's another thing worth mentioning is there's the warrior kid books,

2487
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.820
two of them where the warrior kid and Mark's mission and there's also a warrior

2488
02:32:23.821 --> 02:32:27.910
kid podcast called warrior kid podcast.
Yeah.

2489
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:31.620
And ask Uncle Jake,
so you can check that one out.

2490
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:34.260
There's also the discipline equals freedom field manual,

2491
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:38.940
which tells you how to get after it
very clearly.

2492
02:32:39.210 --> 02:32:42.180
And if you want to get it on audio,

2493
02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:46.170
the only way you can get it on your audio is as an it MP3 album.

2494
02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:50.970
Or you can buy individual tracks if you want them,
iTunes,

2495
02:32:50.971 --> 02:32:55.500
Amazon music,
Google play,
et cetera.
Yeah.
Also extreme ownership.

2496
02:32:55.650 --> 02:33:00.530
Yes.
The do you don't feel there are regional right ownership?

2497
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:02.730
No,
this is the second version now.

2498
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:07.990
It's like an enhanced version goes clips.
There's sections from the Po,

2499
02:33:08.010 --> 02:33:11.130
from this podcast in the new extreme ownership.
Yeah.
That's the,

2500
02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.740
when they come out,
when they release a book,

2501
02:33:14.310 --> 02:33:18.000
they want to add a little spice to it.
Make sense?
So the spices,

2502
02:33:18.001 --> 02:33:19.860
the podcast actually,
which is pretty cool.

2503
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:23.820
So extreme ownership book sprinkled with podcasts.
Yeah.

2504
02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:27.910
Spice Spicy podcasts.
Yes.
Yeah.
Um,
good ones.

2505
02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:29.660
Simple but not easy balance.

2506
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:33.980
But if you can assimilate it legitimately life changing.
What's,

2507
02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:38.130
what's cool to me.
Yeah.
You know,
you just threw out life changing.

2508
02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.040
You just threw it out there.
No big deal.
I'm not the only one.
No,

2509
02:33:41.041 --> 02:33:42.090
that's what I'm saying.
What's cool,

2510
02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.170
what's cool is when people are pretty stoked about the impact that it's had on

2511
02:33:46.171 --> 02:33:49.950
their personal life and on their business and on their family.

2512
02:33:50.010 --> 02:33:51.980
And I hear people talking about that and they,

2513
02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.300
they come and talk to me about it and send me emails and everything else.

2514
02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:56.730
It's awesome.
So that's the book.
Extreme ownership.

2515
02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:02.120
Wrote it with my brother Leif Babin and Lafe and I just wrote another book.

2516
02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:04.590
I kind of referenced it a couple times day.

2517
02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:09.270
It's called the dichotomy of leadership and the wife and I literally,

2518
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:11.430
I keep saying,
we just get done writing it.

2519
02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:14.700
Have you heard me say that on this podcast before,
while I have,
you know why?

2520
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.940
Because every time you edit,
you edit again.
So every time you think you're done,

2521
02:34:18.941 --> 02:34:19.541
you're not done.

2522
02:34:19.541 --> 02:34:23.380
And so we just turned in another series of edits and the edits are,

2523
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:27.160
it's not like we're going through these massive changes,
but you just,
you just,

2524
02:34:27.370 --> 02:34:30.580
somebody changes something in a sentence and then it throws off this other
thing.

2525
02:34:30.581 --> 02:34:34.980
And so just to,
um,
the way though,

2526
02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:38.400
that's what we're doing.
Do you have the philosophy like I'm on a,

2527
02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:39.280
I forget who said it,

2528
02:34:39.281 --> 02:34:43.090
but it's like editing gets done when you can take away no more.

2529
02:34:44.470 --> 02:34:48.430
No,
it's the opposite.
Yes.
Editing is done when you can't,
you can't.

2530
02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:51.480
Every word matters and that's what you want.
And you know,

2531
02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:54.790
Lafe and I Lafe Lafe basically like,

2532
02:34:54.791 --> 02:34:58.210
I do like a thousand words a day and I edit the same way.
Well,
I edit,

2533
02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.540
you can edit faster.
So I'll edit like one chapter at a time,

2534
02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:07.120
but then I'll do that one per day.
Laughs the opposite.
He just goes boom.

2535
02:35:07.121 --> 02:35:10.300
He just goes and he'll call me at like midnight broad

2536
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:16.120
open ended for each dollars and they go to chapter nine.
I'm like,

2537
02:35:16.121 --> 02:35:20.080
that's awesome man.
But yes.
And then we edit each other.

2538
02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:23.710
And so we're,
it takes a while.

2539
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:27.790
So we just finished another series of edits and both of us are stuck.

2540
02:35:27.791 --> 02:35:30.580
Lafe sent me a text the other day,
he's like,
Bro,
this book,
this book is awesome.

2541
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.300
It is actually.
Oh that's right.
Cause you don't have,
we'll taste it.
It now

2542
02:35:35.970 --> 02:35:38.890
it is,
I think it's really gonna help people out.
And again,

2543
02:35:38.891 --> 02:35:41.560
you can preorder that thing right now so that the publisher Prince enough so

2544
02:35:41.561 --> 02:35:45.010
that people can actually have them.
Cause the publishers don't ever get it.

2545
02:35:45.250 --> 02:35:47.500
And it doesn't mean it does help in,
I'm ready.
I don't want to,

2546
02:35:47.650 --> 02:35:50.620
I want to give it away any kind of swell or nothing like that.
But it does,

2547
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:52.330
it makes complete sense,

2548
02:35:52.331 --> 02:35:57.270
especially after extreme ownership where extreme ownership like eh,

2549
02:35:57.271 --> 02:36:01.840
and it kind of has this tone of extremeness,
which is,
it's all true and accurate,

2550
02:36:01.841 --> 02:36:03.540
but I can see how like someone,

2551
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:07.840
someone might not get that little element of like,
hey,
it's extreme,

2552
02:36:07.841 --> 02:36:11.620
but it's more of like this approach to like this horse and that whole thing is

2553
02:36:11.621 --> 02:36:12.950
this balance.
Yes.

2554
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:18.690
I actually wrote in the book dichotomy.
Leadership.
Yeah.
One of the PR,

2555
02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:22.390
one of the problems with extreme ownership as the title extreme ownership

2556
02:36:22.391 --> 02:36:25.030
because people think it got to be extremely,
no,
actually you need to,

2557
02:36:25.090 --> 02:36:28.180
you need to not be extreme.
Most of the time as a leader,
you need to be balanced.

2558
02:36:28.181 --> 02:36:31.540
Now do you need to be extreme and your attitude towards ownership?
Yes,

2559
02:36:31.541 --> 02:36:32.590
you absolutely do.

2560
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:36.940
But do you need to be extreme and your attitude of being aggressive?
No,

2561
02:36:36.941 --> 02:36:41.850
because if you get too aggressive,
you're going to cause other problems.
Yeah.

2562
02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:46.240
Like extreme meaning like don't deviate from thinking like this kind of thing.

2563
02:36:46.241 --> 02:36:50.800
Not like when I go in,
I'm just owning everything.
No exceptions.

2564
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:54.340
What you say doesn't matter.
This is mine.
Kind of kind of extreme.
It's not that.

2565
02:36:54.370 --> 02:36:57.130
And then really the extremeness of the balance.

2566
02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:58.630
It's almost like a contradictory thing,

2567
02:36:58.631 --> 02:37:03.190
but it's all the parts that like I'm using it for a little something that have

2568
02:37:03.191 --> 02:37:07.930
to,
that I'm,
I have to do it,
but you know,
anyway,
I'm reading some of it.

2569
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:12.880
Yeah.
And it's like,
man,
it makes it really clear.
It's really good.
Yeah,
no,
that's,

2570
02:37:12.881 --> 02:37:14.560
that's what life texted me the other day.
I'm like,
yeah,

2571
02:37:14.561 --> 02:37:17.810
cause obviously we've been reading a bunch and I think it's going to really help

2572
02:37:17.811 --> 02:37:22.430
people out really help people out the green.
So that'll be good.

2573
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:26.360
And you know,
actually on top of the dichotomy of leadership,

2574
02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:27.830
because speaking of leadership,

2575
02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:32.240
if you need leadership training on site for you or your team,

2576
02:37:33.350 --> 02:37:34.910
you can check out echelon front.

2577
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:40.610
That's my leadership consulting company with life,
with JP,

2578
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:44.390
with Dave.
We've got some other people coming on board right now,

2579
02:37:44.391 --> 02:37:46.520
which is awesome.
Awesome guys.

2580
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:49.910
And what we do is we solve problems through leadership.

2581
02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.760
That's what we do at echelon front.
Ashkelon front.com come and get some.
Yup.

2582
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:58.990
Effectively I feel like I'm kind of like this ongoing client of echelon front

2583
02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:02.870
of,
you know,
of your consulting,
you know,
just cause I'm always kind of around.

2584
02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:07.010
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's interesting how just by,
what do you call it?

2585
02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:11.990
Osmosis known is osmosis.
Just by being there,
it kind of said to your brain,

2586
02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:17.090
it's good.
Also the muster,

2587
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:18.310
that's a big part.
Look,

2588
02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:23.090
I'm essentially an attendee at the muster with a camera with a camera,

2589
02:38:23.091 --> 02:38:27.070
which is even more so because I get to rewatch it.
Certain parts.
Oh yeah.

2590
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:29.970
You get to get up,
move around,
get close.

2591
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:35.030
Outstanding time,
by the way.
And so yeah,
there's a net,
there's another one,

2592
02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:40.280
the the one,
the last one we went to sold out before that one sold out.

2593
02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:44.300
DC was pretty awesome.
Yeah.
I mean,
and it was a base,
well,
let me,
DC was awesome.

2594
02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:50.560
It was just awesome being in DC and the master was a good time and people

2595
02:38:51.021 --> 02:38:55.900
learned a ton.
So yeah.
Sold out again.
All of them.
Yeah.

2596
02:38:56.870 --> 02:39:01.340
And
so it's reasonable,

2597
02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:06.320
as you always say,
to belief that this next one is going to sell out.
Oh,

2598
02:39:06.321 --> 02:39:08.990
the next one is going to sell out.
Yeah.
They're definitely gonna sell out.

2599
02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:11.240
It's a San Francisco Monster,

2600
02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:15.710
zero zero six October 17th and 18th it's absolutely going to sell out.

2601
02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.260
So if you want to come register,

2602
02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:21.110
the other thing that happens is if you book hotel rooms,
you know,

2603
02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:25.460
because those things get bought,
bought up too.
So,
yeah,

2604
02:39:25.810 --> 02:39:27.710
it's,
it's a leadership seminar.

2605
02:39:27.890 --> 02:39:30.560
We talk about leadership and it's not just talking about leadership,

2606
02:39:30.561 --> 02:39:34.100
we actually give you the pragmatic tools that you need to take home and become a

2607
02:39:34.101 --> 02:39:38.480
better leader in your business,
in your life.
I was watching this,

2608
02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:43.580
I was watching TV the other day because my kids were watching TV.

2609
02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:45.200
It wasn't my choice by the way.

2610
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:49.220
That's nonetheless I'm watching TV and I see a little,
you know,
the commercial,

2611
02:39:49.221 --> 02:39:50.820
it's almost,
it's the local like commerce,

2612
02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:54.050
you know how the commercial one commercial kind of starts and then it goes to

2613
02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:57.590
the local commercial,
you know,
that situation.
And that happens.
So anyway,

2614
02:39:57.591 --> 02:40:01.970
it's for this seminar,
you know,
for,
I don't,
I forget where,

2615
02:40:01.971 --> 02:40:05.000
maybe real estate or whatever,
you know,
cool,
cool info or whatever.

2616
02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:07.280
And you know how in the video they show a,

2617
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:10.610
you know like clips from the actual seminar that they held last time or

2618
02:40:10.611 --> 02:40:14.010
something like that,
Bro,
I'm going to,
and then you can't help but compare it to

2619
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.790
<v 0>like the muster situation and it's like men night and day,
you know you,</v>

2620
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:20.760
I'm the as cool looks like people are getting good information put pro.

2621
02:40:20.761 --> 02:40:24.750
It's just way different than this.
That's why,

2622
02:40:24.890 --> 02:40:28.740
that's why they're all selling out.
That's why people are people coming back.

2623
02:40:28.741 --> 02:40:31.590
So there's that added element where they kind of get to hang with you guys.

2624
02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:34.980
Oh yeah.
Yeah that's true.
There's no green room.
There's no behind the scenes.

2625
02:40:34.981 --> 02:40:37.320
You're actually the last one,
there was literally no backstage,

2626
02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.160
there was no place.
We were just out front.
We were out front of the whole time.

2627
02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.190
The whole team.
Not that you would even need it because you kind of,

2628
02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:47.280
you don't go back there.
No,
you can't Kinda can't.
No Green Room.

2629
02:40:47.310 --> 02:40:50.790
Even when you say there's a break,
there's already a line kind of formula.
Okay.

2630
02:40:50.791 --> 02:40:51.950
Cause you know,
you get questions,

2631
02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:55.110
but I want to ask questions in between and sign books and hang out and take

2632
02:40:55.111 --> 02:40:58.380
pictures and all that stuff.
That's what we do the whole time.
Yeah.
No,

2633
02:40:58.410 --> 02:40:59.970
forgot to mention we're all the same hotel.

2634
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.680
Lafe Lafe lost nine pounds during the muster two,
seven.

2635
02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:08.090
Really.
Cause that's what we're doing.
We're just and going no time to eat.
Like,

2636
02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.630
like we literally don't eat.
You don't eat cause you,
I mean we don't,

2637
02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:16.320
you can eat as um,
as a attendee.
You can eat but like leave me,

2638
02:41:16.321 --> 02:41:19.290
the boys wouldn't have time to eat.
We're working.
And so yeah,

2639
02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:24.180
coming to muster also,
uh,
for current military law enforcement,
border patrol,

2640
02:41:24.210 --> 02:41:26.070
firefighters,
paramedics,
first responders,

2641
02:41:26.071 --> 02:41:29.240
we got the roll call September 21st in Dallas,
Texas.
It's a

2642
02:41:30.810 --> 02:41:35.130
like a really focused one day leadership training seminar aimed at people that

2643
02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:38.670
put on a uniform and deal with dynamic situations.

2644
02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:43.820
And that's also available to register@extremeownership.com and until we see you

2645
02:41:44.671 --> 02:41:47.490
live and in person,

2646
02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:52.730
either at the muster in San Francisco or the roll call in Texas or the immersion

2647
02:41:53.251 --> 02:41:56.670
camp up in Maine,
if you want to,

2648
02:41:57.630 --> 02:41:59.400
if you want to hang out with us virtually,

2649
02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:03.750
we are hanging out actually on the inner webs.

2650
02:42:03.810 --> 02:42:08.810
Echo is at echocharles and I am at Jocko Willink and to all the service men and

2651
02:42:09.031 --> 02:42:10.560
women out there in the world.

2652
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:15.420
Thank you for protecting our nation and to the police,
law enforcement,

2653
02:42:15.421 --> 02:42:18.090
firefighters,
paramedics,
border patrol.

2654
02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:23.640
Thanks for keeping us safe here at home and to the families of all those that

2655
02:42:23.641 --> 02:42:24.474
serve.

2656
02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:30.510
Thank you for supporting those heroes that support us

2657
02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.820
and to everyone else that is listening.

2658
02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:39.440
Remember as we learned today,

2659
02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:44.360
laziness is the shame of us all.

2660
02:42:44.390 --> 02:42:49.100
Laziness makes us prefer the easy path,

2661
02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:54.490
the week path
instead of glory.

2662
02:42:57.270 --> 02:43:00.930
Do not allow that.
Instead,
take the hard path,

2663
02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:06.180
take the discipline path,
take the war path,

2664
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:09.360
the path of getting after it,

2665
02:43:10.770 --> 02:43:15.210
and until next time,
this is echo and Jocko.
