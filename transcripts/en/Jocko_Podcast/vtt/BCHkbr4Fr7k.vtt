This is Jocko podcast number 11 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.510
Jocko Willink.
And additionally,

3
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:15.560
today we have our first guest Leif Babin.

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.760
Lafe welcome to the show.
Thank you.
Glad to be here with you.

5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.170
Now to begin this podcast today,

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.450
I'm going to start at the end.

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.090
I'm going to start at the end of my navy career when I retired from the seal

8
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:34.340
teams after 20 years.

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.090
And this is the speech that I gave on my last day of military service,

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.710
my last day in the seal teams,

11
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:46.790
and about an hour before I walked back to the trade at building

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.280
clean.
The last thing is out of my locker.
Loaded them into my car.

13
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.700
<v 0>And drove away from the seal teams for the last time.</v>

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.850
<v 0>With 20 years of memories and experiences and the best times of my life and the</v>

17
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.410
worst times in my life,
all rushing through my mind.

18
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.230
And this is the speech I gave that day.

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 0>During my last deployment to Iraq in 2006 one of the first things we did was a</v>

21
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:29.560
series of operations on the eastern side of Ramadi.

22
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.710
In order to execute these operations,

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.180
we took a majority of the seals to Camp Corregidor home with the first of the

24
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:42.181
five oh six band of brothers on the edge of the melodic district of Murmur of

25
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.623
Ramadi.

26
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.020
<v 0>Camp Corregidor was like Ford Apocalypse.</v>

28
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.930
They received mortar fire RPGs and small arms fire daily.

29
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.000
The barracks were an old partially blown out building with sandbags in the

30
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.000
windows,
dirt floors and no air conditioning.

31
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.710
There were no showers.
It was hard living

32
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.390
as far as the fighting.

33
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.650
<v 0>Charlie company from the first of the five Oh six who,</v>

35
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.420
who we were set to work with had suffered almost 40 casualties in the time

36
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:23.421
they'd been in Ramadi and had gone from a fighting force of 142 just over a

37
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.983
hundred

38
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.000
Charlie company loved having seals with them after the first operation they

39
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.200
conducted with seals.

40
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.670
The company commander told his battalion CEO he wanted seals with him on every

41
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:38.500
mission to help keep his men alive.

42
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.220
<v 0>As we continue these initial operations into the melodic district,</v>

44
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.080
there were heavy firefights,

45
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
many dead enemy and multiple coalition casualties.

46
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.030
It was intense,
sustained combat.

47
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.330
Many would have considered camp Corregidor and eastern Ramadi to be hell on

48
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:06.070
earth,
but I knew it was exactly where seals belonged.

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.130
We soon completed that first run of missions and had it back to our main camp.

50
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.090
When we got there,
I told one of the platoon commanders,

51
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
I wanted him to select guys to form a seven man squad to take back to Camp

52
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.893
Corregidor,

53
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.400
but he told me he didn't want to just pick guys.

54
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.810
He thought that some guys might not want to go back to Corregidor due to the

55
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:36.190
hard living conditions,
the tough fighting and the high rate of casualties.

56
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.620
That sounded reasonable to me.

57
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.860
So I mustered the whole troop in the planning space.

58
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.050
I explained to them that we were sending a squad to Corregidor permanently

59
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.310
because the army isn't a tough fight and suffering heavy casualties and that as

60
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:56.030
Americans,
as servicemen and his frogmen,

61
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.620
we cannot sit on the sidelines is that happens.
If there's a fight,

62
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.720
we need to be in it.

63
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
I wrote on the Dry Erase Board Camp Corregidor volunteers and I said to this

64
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.800
pack of seals,
if you want to go over to Corregidor,

65
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.730
if you want to volunteer to be in the worst area with the worst living

66
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.420
conditions,

67
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.260
with the hardest fighting and with the highest chances of getting hurt or killed

68
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.461
the,

69
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:29.200
go ahead and write your name up on that board and then I walked out of the room.

70
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.803
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.640
<v 0>a short while later I came back in and I looked at the list on the board.</v>

72
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.890
It was filled,
in fact,

73
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:47.090
every single seal to a man had written his name on that board.

74
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.500
Yes.
Every man had volunteered to go forward

75
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.420
into that raging storm

76
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.850
and that is who we are.

77
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.450
That is what we joined the seal teams for to do what no one else can do.

78
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.080
In the worst areas,
in the worst conditions,

79
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.690
we crave the dirt and sweat and fire and blood.

80
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.320
Let there be no doubt it is in our soul.

81
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.000
It is in our nature.

82
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.440
Sure seals can do any job well,

83
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.350
but it is in the belly of the beast where we thrive.

84
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.260
I have seen with my own eyes,

85
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:45.261
the wholesale slaughter that occurs when seals are unleashed on the enemy as we

86
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.200
were meant to be.
And it is incredible thing.

87
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.070
It is also a thing of strategic impact areas like Ramadi and solder city,

88
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.040
which after years of complete enemy control become pacified soon after the sword

89
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:07.061
of overwhelming carnage is wielded by the frog men on the high ground.

90
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.460
This is who we are.
Death dealers,
killers,

91
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.050
executioners,

92
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

93
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.120
<v 0>And in being so saviors,
defenders,</v>

94
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.980
warriors,

95
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.570
now there are those that say we need to change,
evolve,

96
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.590
and mature.

97
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.000
They claim that the nature of war has changed,

98
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.450
that it is more complex and demands a more sensitive approach.
