00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.650
The Path,
the war path,

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.210
path of war,

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.140
moving toward a battle,

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.340
fight towards

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.280
actual war against our nation's enemies,

6
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.050
against my own.
This is preparing

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
and sharpening my sword and honing my skills and maintaining the unmitigated

8
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.840
daily discipline
in all things.

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.130
Where does it lead?

10
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.790
It can be

11
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.710
I am waiting.

12
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.830
The warpath
against

13
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.680
war against ignorance

14
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.833
delivers

15
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.200
the war path

16
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.850
leads to owner shift
your life,

17
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.260
and that is the war path

18
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.270
five verse.
The path of blood,

19
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.260
of sweat and of suffering

20
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.360
is the preeminent path of dis,

21
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.450
which is why it leads to freedom.

22
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.460
And beyond that in the end it leads

23
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.980
to peace.
