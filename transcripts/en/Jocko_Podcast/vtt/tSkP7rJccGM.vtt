00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.380
This is Jocko podcast number 42 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.560
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.880
Now in podcast number 11 we brought on Leif Babin,

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.220
who was the Charlie platoon commander.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.680
Charlie between was a part of task unit bruiser.

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Obviously Lafe is one of my brothers guy wrote the book extreme ownership with,

7
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:34.640
so
that's leaf Charlie platoon.
And when,

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.090
when he was on that first podcast,
we talked about a bunch of things,

9
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:43.091
but one of the main focuses of our conversation was some of the brothers that we

10
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.680
lost.
Mark Lee,
who was the first seal killed in Iraq.

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.870
We talked about big goals.
Ryan job,

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.010
who was gravely wounded in Ramadi and who later died after complications from a

13
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.900
surgery to repair those wounds.

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.400
And finally we talked about Chris Kyle,

15
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.730
who was also in Charlie platoon,

16
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.270
was the lead sniper and point man and who ended up writing the book,

17
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:16.870
American sniper,
which was,
you know,

18
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.110
turned into a very successful movie.
And Chris,
as you know,

19
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
was senselessly murdered as he tried to help out a fellow veteran.

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.930
And on that podcast,

21
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.820
we didn't talk in any depth at all about Mikey monster,

22
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.750
who is another one of our brothers seals from task unit bruiser who was also

23
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.490
killed in Ramadi.
And if you don't know,

24
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.550
Mikey was posthumously awarded the medal of honor after he smothered a grenade

25
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:56.300
with his body in order to save three of our other teammates

26
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.550
in.

27
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.020
One of the reasons I didn't want to focus on Mikey during that podcast is

28
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.400
because Mikey was in Delta platoon as opposed to Charlie between chocolatiers

29
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.020
two platoons in the task unit,

30
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Charlie and Delta and Charlie was Lafe was the platoon commander and Tony,

31
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.320
uh,
fratty who was on the podcast as well,
he was the the platoon chief.

32
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.290
And before I went and talked about Mikey,

33
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.760
I wanted to bring somebody from Delta platoon on the podcast.

34
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.030
It's a little bit trickier than it sounds because most of the guys from Delta

35
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:41.031
platoon are still active duty and the ones that aren't active duty are,

36
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.760
they're not around.
I couldn't get get ahold of them or if I get ahold of them,

37
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.750
they,
they were busy are I?

38
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.810
They were out of the area.
So it's just been hard.
It's been a challenge.

39
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.650
But I didn't want to wait.
And finally,

40
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.190
and we're lucky because

41
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.050
<v 1>I got one of my,
one of my good Bros here,
guy by the name of Andrew Paul,</v>

42
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.290
who was the assistant platoon commander in Delta platoon tasking at bruiser seal

43
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.950
team three.

44
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
But I wanted to start off today by reading a speech that I gave at one of the

45
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.470
ceremonies that took place when Mikey was awarded the medal of honor.

46
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080
And this was not the ceremony that took place at the White House with President

47
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:32.531
Bush,

48
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:37.531
which actually the entirety of tasking at bruiser did attend that and it was

49
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.584
awesome.

50
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.440
But I gave this speech at a navy ceremony that took place.

51
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.640
I think it took place later in the day or perhaps the next day at the navy

52
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:50.500
memorial in Washington DC.

53
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.510
And that day there was a ton of senior naval officers in attendance and

54
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.780
basically the whole of the seniority of,
of the,
of the navy was there,

55
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.410
you know,
this,
the chief of naval operations and the secretary of the navy.

56
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.740
And there was a bunch of other metal of honor winners there,

57
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.190
including a couple other seal metal of honor winners.

58
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.720
They knew it was a

59
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.700
very fitting day and it was a great honor for me to be able to give this speech

60
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.530
and here it is.
Okay.
Yeah.

61
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.990
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

62
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.590
it is obviously very humbling to be here today as it was humbling to be on the

63
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.470
battlefield of Ramadi with my fellow seals

64
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.930
and the two to eight brigade combat team,
the iron soldiers,

65
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.630
and then the one one d,
The ready first combat team,

66
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.010
which was a formed up by our brothers from the army,
navy,

67
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.020
air force and Marines.

68
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.390
And it included such hallowed units as the first two,

69
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.790
the five oh six band of brothers,

70
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.740
the one three seven bandits and the three eight marines.

71
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.640
I met Mike Monster when he checked into seal team three as a new,

72
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:23.040
highly motivated young frogman

73
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.210
as we trained and prepared to deploy to Iraq,

74
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.580
everyone learned that Mike was an incredible person.

75
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.070
He was gifted in everything he did.
Hardworking,
funny,
and selfless.

76
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.610
<v 0>He was the ultimate teammate.
The ultimate friend.</v>

78
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.440
When Mike died,
a picture of him circulated in the news.

79
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.030
It showed Mike and his platoon mates and the war torn streets of Ramadi shrouded

80
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:58.550
in a midst of greenish yellow smoke,

81
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.130
which was used to mask their movement from the enemy.

82
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.890
That picture says so much.

83
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.570
Mike's gun is at the ready.
His face,
his calm,

84
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:16.160
almost smiling despite the obvious chaos and danger around him.

85
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.530
Ramadi at the time was the epicenter of the insurgency in Iraq.

86
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.060
A city filled with peril.

87
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.230
The hardened to enemy was bent on destruction.

88
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.310
They fought with ruthlessness constantly on the attack with machine guns,

89
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.270
mortars,
grenades,
and I eds.

90
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.200
<v 0>Brave men died or wounded every day and every day brave man continued to push</v>

92
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.160
forward into the fray

93
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.200
for those of us who were there.

94
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.210
That picture of Mike captures all of this in the picture.

95
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.810
His brother seals are nearby,
but Mikey is out front.

96
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.670
I have looked at this picture over and over again and it speaks to me

97
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.780
as someone that had the pleasure of knowing Mike.

98
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:12.570
He is a friend and had the honor of serving with him on the battlefield.

99
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.290
This photograph tells me a story.

100
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.160
As I look at that picture,

101
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.450
I hear a voice in a humble but confident tone.

102
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.480
This voice says to me,

103
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.970
I am Michael Monsoor.

104
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.930
I am patrolling through the streets of Ramadi.

105
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.710
It is a city devastated by war.
Bullet holes cover the rubber rebel.

106
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:47.560
The buildings burned out.
Cars littered the streets.

107
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.290
I am walking just behind my point,
man.
I am ready.

108
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.020
My eyes sting from the sweat my gun and gear our heavy,

109
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.180
but these things do not bother me.
There is no comfort here,

110
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.230
but this is the life I have chosen and there is no other place.

111
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:13.160
I would rather be.
I am Michael [inaudible] sore.

112
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.290
I pray and I believe my faith is my shelter.

113
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.600
My faith is my strength.

114
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.180
Fear thrives in this place,
but fear is no match for my faith.

115
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.950
Faith conquers all.

116
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.930
The word of the Lord proves true.

117
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.530
He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.

118
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.930
Lord,

119
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.930
protect my brothers above all else you have made me ready to protect them.

120
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.490
I am Michael [inaudible] sore.
I am far away from home.
I miss my family.

121
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.830
I miss my mother,
my father,
my sister and brothers.

122
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.910
Everything I am is rooted in them.

123
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.820
I want to hold my nephews and nieces again.
I want to make them smile and laugh,

124
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.090
but I am far away from home.
Instead,

125
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.120
I smile at the Iraqi children where we passed them by.

126
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.650
When we encounter Iraqi families,
I treat them with respect and dignity.

127
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.380
I know the importance of family because there was nothing more important to me

128
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.670
than my family.

129
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.240
<v 0>I am Michael [inaudible].
I love my country.
My fellow seals and the men,</v>

131
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.160
men fighting alongside us.

132
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.440
The men fighting alongside us and the streets are infantry,
men,
grunts.

133
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.720
I know these grants are not just soldiers and marines,

134
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.630
but fathers and brothers and sons.

135
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.130
I know because my father and brother were also grunts,

136
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.110
proud marine rifleman.

137
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.890
We are fighting are determined enemy,
but we are strong.

138
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.540
Our strength is our brotherhood.
Soldiers,
sailors,

139
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.740
airmen and Marines fighting together a brotherhood,

140
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.070
bound by sweat and blood and tears.

141
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.260
Together we live in dust and dirt and filth

142
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.640
and death.
Death is everywhere.

143
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.700
Many of my brothers have fallen.
Mark.

144
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.660
He is gone.

145
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.510
But we fight on for,

146
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.010
for the men to our left and right.
We fight on,

147
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.380
I am so proud to be part of this band of brothers.

148
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.040
I am Michael Months Sore.

149
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.670
I am ready forged by faith and family molded by belief and brotherhood.

150
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.450
I have live life to its fullest.
I have not looked back.

151
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.270
I leave nothing but love
and I have no regrets.

152
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.860
<v 0>I am Michael [inaudible].</v>

154
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.680
I am the frog man on the high ground

155
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.340
and I have given everything for you.

156
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.060
And that was the speech

157
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.510
and I did my best to

158
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.830
share my thoughts about marquis,

159
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.910
<v 2>then a monitor year to</v>

160
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.540
Andrew Paul with me today.
Like I said,

161
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.540
the former assistant platoon commander from Delta platoon

162
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.320
to share some stories about Ramadi and about Mikey and about tasking at bruiser

163
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:13.321
and about himself and the lessons that he learned over there.

164
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.150
<v 2>And how he carried those lessons to civilian life and the kind of challenges he</v>

166
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:21.174
faced there.

167
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.843
<v 1>So</v>

168
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.480
<v 2>Andrew,
Paul,
my brother,
welcome to the show.</v>

169
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.180
Thanks for coming on.
Thanks for having me Bro.

170
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.090
<v 3>It's an honor to be here.
And you know,
the main thing,
listening to that speech,</v>

171
00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:43.320
I remember when you gave it my hope and prayer today is that whatever I do here

172
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:45.750
today,
it honors is a legacy of our brothers.

173
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.430
<v 2>Absolutely.
Absolutely.</v>

174
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.610
And we'll get,
we'll get into plenty of that.

175
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.350
But in order,
and I hate to do this because everybody does this.

176
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:02.470
When they start like this type of situation,

177
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.530
it's almost like a bar or a pickup line,
you know?
Hey,

178
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:10.060
we're so where are you from?
Right?
So,
uh,
that being said,
Andrew,

179
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.840
so where are you from?
Where am I from?
I'm from New England,
New Hampshire.

180
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.400
We at Tony's.
Tony was just on,
you know,
the New England death.
That's right.

181
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.990
If I don't get some boys from Texas on here,
I'm going to get,

182
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.540
I'm going to help me to start hearing about it.

183
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.260
You gotta be real hard to grow up in New England.
Let me tell you,
it's cold.
True.

184
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.170
True.
So,
so you grew up in New England and,

185
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.640
and by the way,
for those of you that just listening on the podcast,

186
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.150
what do you weigh?
155.
One 55.
So the,
the,

187
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.780
the image that everyone has,
if the big navy seal is not,
first of all,

188
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:44.550
it's not true.

189
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.730
They're seals come in every shape and every size and Andrew comes in the smaller

190
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:53.730
size.
And,
uh,
so,
but how did you,
uh,
so,
so wait,

191
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.510
did you,
how did you ever,
how'd you hear about the seals?

192
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.940
Like what made you decide that that was what you wanted to do?

193
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.650
<v 3>Yeah.
You know,
I'm,
first of all,
I've always been the kind of person that like,</v>

194
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.380
tell me I can't do something and I'm going to just show you.

195
00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:06.150
So I mean things like,
oh,

196
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:09.420
we're in high school and someone says we're talking about like the Boston

197
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.050
Marathon.
And I'm like,
Oh,
I'm going to run.
Oh,
you can't do that marathon.
Oh,
okay.

198
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.250
Watch this.
Ran the Boston marathon.
Um,
but you know,

199
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

200
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.540
<v 3>Probably saw a movie.
Cause you know,
when I was growing up,</v>

201
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.000
there wasn't a lot of information out there about the seal teams.

202
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:28.000
And so tell me about it,
right?
I mean,
even less for an old guy like you.
Um,

203
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.940
so there wasn't a lot of information,
but somehow you probably saw a movie,

204
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.360
ended up reading a book and then,
you know,
started to do some research and found,

205
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:40.400
well,
first of all,
outside my immediate family,
um,
uncles,

206
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.790
grandfather,
all served in the military.
So I grew up with that song,

207
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.000
strong sense of wanting to serve my country and uh,

208
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.010
always had a sense of one to protect people who couldn't themselves.
So it

209
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.270
<v 4>was drawn to that kind of line of work.
Then began to read about the seal teams,</v>

210
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.810
and at least from what information I had available,
it seemed like,
hey,

211
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:01.040
they were the best.
So I'm like,
all right,

212
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:03.340
well if that's the best and that's what I want to go do,
hey,
that was it.

213
00:15:03.341 --> 00:15:06.740
You know,
that was in its infancy as it,
as a young kid.
But then,
man,

214
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.360
I just got on to that like a bulldog,
bulldog on a pork chop and just,
I mean,
oh,

215
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.560
tunnel vision went after it and you get you,
did you go to college?

216
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.170
Did you already have that decision in your mind when you went to college?

217
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.660
Oh yeah.
So you knew you're going to go to ocs,
you knew all that.

218
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.440
Did you know ROTC?
I did ROTC.
So the thing is is that I didn't know,

219
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.050
I didn't know anything.
I mean,
I didn't know about,

220
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:30.140
I didn't even know what ROTC was.
I didn't even know what enlisting was.

221
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:35.000
I had no clue.
No would,
no,
no exposure.
I just knew I wanted to be a seal.
So,

222
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.181
you know,

223
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:38.180
but we start looking at going to college and I went down and I looked at

224
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.890
Vanderbilt University among others,

225
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:43.760
John Hopkins or Rpi goes an engineering major and I knew nothing.

226
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.390
And all of a sudden I walk into this almost like job fair kind of style thing.

227
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.630
Like welcome,
check out the school.
And there's this guy in uniform.

228
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.700
And he's of course got a picture of like some navy seal frogmen coming out of

229
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.500
the water over the beach.
And I was like,
Hey,

230
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:56.500
what's this realistic picture of all time,
right?

231
00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.850
Because that's what we do every day.
And like,
Hey,
what's this?
He goes,
oh,

232
00:15:59.851 --> 00:16:03.050
well this is our two sigma would say,
oh well you go to college,

233
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.110
we pay for college.
And then you go in the navy and I'm like,
wait,

234
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.520
you can be a seal through this program.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
Big Lie.

235
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.520
Like they take like 16 guys a year.
Oh yeah,
you can be a seal.
Oh,
okay.
Wait,

236
00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:19.940
let me get this straight.
So I go to college,
you pay for it,
watch this.

237
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.230
I get to go in the navy and I can be a seal.
Yup.
I'm like,
sign me up.

238
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:26.480
So that's how I found out about ROTC recruiter.

239
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:29.870
Just straight truth from the recruiter.
You got to love it.
That's right.
Yes,

240
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:31.820
you can be a seal.
It's a little did I know.

241
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.290
So you get done with college,
get your commission,

242
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:40.550
you do ROTC and then you go to,
you go to buds show up to buds.

243
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.870
That was funny.
I showed up.
So I asked the ROTC instructor,
Hey,
um,
you know,

244
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:49.600
like what's the process for checking in?
Do I just like,
what should I wear?

245
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.510
I would just wear,
you know,
appropriate civilian attire.

246
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.080
So I show up to the buds quarter deck and like a collared shirt walking out of

247
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:03.950
the quarter deck and one of the most sadistic instructors possible happen to be

248
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:08.450
standing there.
I walk on,
I'm like,
Hey,
uh,
I'm here to check in.
Like,

249
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.970
like the all seeing eye,
just like glance is like you said what?

250
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.530
I was up checking into buds wearing that.

251
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.340
I'm like,
uh,
maybe I should go put it in four months.
Yeah,
good idea.

252
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.520
Run out to my car.
Three minutes.
And your uniform son,
right?
Went on,

253
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.370
put on my sdbs,
came back promptly,
got wet and Sandy,

254
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.520
that's how it works as dbs because you don't know,
it's like the Ah,

255
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.660
the high level uniform with all the ribbons and all that crap on it.

256
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.420
And then you got to,
you know,
you've got to take good care of it.

257
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:44.750
So when you take that and you wear it down to the ocean and then you jump in the

258
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:47.770
ocean and roll around in the sand,
it's not a good deal.
So that'll inform.

259
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.920
The good news is there weren't a lot of ribbons on there yet.

260
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.530
So we had one ribbon,
so,
so,

261
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.300
and you end up going through buds with leaf,
right.

262
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.520
Which people know who Lafe is obviously.
Um,
which is cool.

263
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.210
And then you get done with buds.
Any,
I mean,
buds,
buds.

264
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:06.330
I don't really care about buds.
Yeah.
Some funny life stories.

265
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:11.070
So I talked about my bro.
I got pneumonia in hell week,

266
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.600
first time through.
So I got rolled back and start over.
So,
um,
and then,

267
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.590
and then later transferred in.
So Lafe was our,
was our class leader.

268
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:25.220
And so me,
the Delta platoon commander,
who one day you'll hear from,
uh,

269
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.290
and he and I,
we all went through buds together,

270
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.730
but they were both lateral transfers in.

271
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:31.470
So they were senior to me in rank right there already,

272
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:36.120
like JG and the in a full lieutenant and a,
so there's games in Bud's,
right?

273
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:38.150
Like you're,
you're trying to win.
So,
you know,
we were,

274
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.240
we were wise to the game's already to try and win in life if,
you know,

275
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.460
my brother is like,
life is black and white with my brother late.
Okay.

276
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:51.090
So I'm going to hear about this one,
but he,
so you know,

277
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.020
it's right and it's wrong.
And there's like,
and so we know,
we're like,
you know,

278
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.890
bud,
sort of like,
if you ain't cheating,
you ain't trying.
And if you get caught,

279
00:18:56.891 --> 00:18:59.820
she ain't trying hard enough.
I mean,
so,
and there's an element of that and buds,

280
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.490
uh,
obviously not completely,
but so,
you know,
we're,

281
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:05.880
we're pulling all kinds of games and in his book,
who is losing,

282
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:08.310
because we are just,
we're cheating to win.

283
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.140
And he's getting so pissed like after the race,
like after class he's like,

284
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:15.570
hey you got,
and then he finally wasn't up and started playing the game.

285
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.530
That thing about you ain't,
you can try and that sort of,

286
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.580
that's sort of one side of buds.
And what was cool was when I went through buds,

287
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.610
they actually told us like these couple of instructors were,
were like,
listen,

288
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:32.280
that's a little saying it's not true.
They actually said if you're cheating,

289
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.210
you're cheating yourself.
Right.
Which I was.

290
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.810
And then obviously then they start saying,
look,

291
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.750
if you've got guys that are cheating here to get through this training,

292
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.000
you don't really want them in the teams with,
you know,

293
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.910
I don't want a guy that that it has to cheat to,

294
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.570
to complete a run or a swim negative.
Yeah.

295
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.420
I mean that there's difference between like cheating,

296
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:51.180
like cutting off the run versus like you're in competition,

297
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:53.640
you're not going to other guy,
whatever,
you know,
competing,

298
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.380
hitting a guy in the face of the paddle,
just that type of thing.
Right.

299
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.180
So you get done.
So you get done because you were a junior.

300
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:02.570
When you get to the tee,
you went rights team three,
right?
Right.
Yeah.

301
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.610
So you get to team three,
but you don't get to go on deployment with team three.

302
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.010
They cook you up with being a boat unit commander.
Yeah.

303
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.560
So no one's gonna know what that is.
All right.
So,
so the deal was,

304
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.530
and this is changes throughout the years,

305
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:18.990
but like when I checked into team three,

306
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.870
there was this brief period of time where it was in charge at the time.

307
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:25.710
Decided that third,
Oh is in a platoon was a bad idea for officer development,

308
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.970
says no more third [inaudible].

309
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.540
So basically I was faced with being a talk jockey or going over to the boat team

310
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.170
and at least being in charge of something to get some leadership experience.

311
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:43.020
So I went over to the special boat teams,
which is part of naval special warfare.

312
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.310
And ultimately when they deploy the deploy as part of the task unit and,

313
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.790
or the task group,
and it's all integrated and part of,
you know,

314
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.570
visit board search and seizure maritime operations such as,
uh,
leadership,

315
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:58.780
interdiction,
maritime interdiction operations.
And so the boat unit,

316
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:03.700
which is special boat teams,
is run essentially at the,

317
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:07.780
at the leadership level by seals.
So the commanding officer of the boat unit,

318
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:11.820
the executive officers are,
are seals the boat.
That OIC is the mark fives all,

319
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.860
we don't have mark fives anymore.
Um,
our,
our seal officers.

320
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.540
So look as a brand new officer,
at least had an opportunity to deploy in a,

321
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.580
in a combat zone to lead men and,

322
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.580
and to work with my seal brothers who were conducting operations in the northern

323
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:26.410
rubion golf.
Yeah.
And just an overview,

324
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.510
I'm just going to sum this up as quickly as I can.

325
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.050
So obviously seals work on water a lot and we,

326
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.450
we drive our own little bullets,
our own little,
you know,

327
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.560
12 foot Zodiac boats with 55 horsepower motors on them,

328
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:43.180
or 35 horsepower motors on them or whatever.
But the bigger boats,
we don't,

329
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:44.920
we don't drive those.
So anything,
you know,

330
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.870
you see any of those bigger bullets are,

331
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.540
are driven by these guys that are called,

332
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.650
they're now called sweat special warfare combatant crewman,
which are guys that,

333
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.150
that's what they do.
Their boat drivers.
So,
and they do,
they insert,
extract us,

334
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.770
you know,
drop there,
dropped their boats out of various aircraft.

335
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.710
It's so it's,
it's a legit job and they,
and that's what they do.

336
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.580
And so you were in charge of uh,

337
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.640
a group of those guys took boats on deployment to the Arabian Gulf and did what

338
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:16.180
you did over there.
Right.
The reality is,
is not the,

339
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.590
it's not the dream for the seal young seal officer to be that,
to do that.

340
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.260
But it's a good,
like you said,
it's good.

341
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.880
All of a sudden you're in charge of something real.

342
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.520
You know when you're out in the water.
And I'd tell people,

343
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.740
I used to tell people this when I was in the teams,
I say,
listen,

344
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.540
when you're on the water,
it's a real world op.
Cause.

345
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.050
Cause if something goes wrong when you're in the water,
I mean first of all,

346
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:37.390
you can drown.
You could and that's,
and you can get lost.

347
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:38.590
There's all kinds of bad things that happened.

348
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:40.450
So if you don't plan right on the water,

349
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:43.750
it doesn't matter if there's an enemy or not.
You got a big giant enemy,

350
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:47.290
it's called the ocean and they will kill you if you're not squared away.

351
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.800
And I think actually that's one of the things that make seals good is that we

352
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:52.980
work in the water and the water's one of the toughest enemies.

353
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.570
You can come up with one forgive.
It's unforgiving.
Yeah.

354
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.080
So that wraps up that you come home from that deployment.
Yep.

355
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.680
And now you are still in seal team three or you go back to seal team three I

356
00:23:04.681 --> 00:23:05.910
guess technically.
Yeah.

357
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.100
And now we form up and you become the Delta platoon assistant platoon commander

358
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.690
checking in.
Awesome.
Working for the Delta platoon commander.
Who you,

359
00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:18.730
you guys were [inaudible] we're bros.
Yeah.
We've known each other for years.

360
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.070
Went through buds together and Lafe.

361
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:23.600
So you guys must've been pretty stoked on that.
It was cool.

362
00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:26.540
It was kind of like get the band back together and you know,
and those,
and look,

363
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.000
those two guys had just come off of not the greatest appointments either in

364
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:33.070
terms of the junior officer seal.
Right.

365
00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:36.550
Because they were deployed and they were the assistant commanders and they were

366
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:39.360
getting stuck with not so fun work.
Right.
You know,

367
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.680
so we were stoked to be all right.
They were soaked like hey now we're the OIC.

368
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.010
We're not going to be the guy stuck back

369
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.550
<v 2>doing the paperwork and we were getting the band back together and then when we</v>

370
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:52.460
found out you are our task unit commander,
it was like,
oh cause we,

371
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.040
we all knew we were going to be in the platoon together and tasks you and

372
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.320
together we didn't know who RTU commander was going to be yet.

373
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.840
And then we were all those rumor rumor who were going to get,

374
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:03.890
and then we heard this Guy Jocko was coming over you who I was,

375
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.750
I only knew who you were through them.
Like when other guys like said,
oh Jocko,

376
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.880
bad ass to do this is going to be awesome.
Right.

377
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.190
Because like we already had an inkling that like if,

378
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.080
if this dude was going to be or to commander,

379
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:16.550
we had our best shot at getting it in combat.

380
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.200
Although we had no idea what was about to happen.
Good assessment.
Yeah.

381
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.590
Yeah.
Your reputation,
your reputation was great,

382
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:28.430
but you were coming over in that case for being the admiral's sales coming from

383
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:33.020
being the animals.
Yup.
13 months with,
uh,
with the admiral,
which was a,
uh,

384
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.600
a rough tour in terms of things that normal seal,
same thing,

385
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:43.490
right?
Like to do,
that's right.
And I,
and,
and you know,
for instance,

386
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.360
I mean,
just,
just straight up wearing a uniform every single day.
Which zoo,

387
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.690
so people don't,
so people understand in the world when,

388
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.410
and I don't know what it's like this moment today when I was in the teams,

389
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:58.700
when I was at seal team,
one seal team to seal teams,
we,
I didn't wear a shirt,

390
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.350
right?
No.
I'm a 35 year old man making money,
doing it with a family.

391
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.690
I'm not wearing a shirt at work,
like,
Oh,
I'm in my office call,

392
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:08.060
I'm not wearing a shirt,
I'm wearing shorts and a pair of jungle boots.
Right?

393
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.410
That's it.
So I do that for my whole life,
right?
Since I was a kid,

394
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.150
since I was like 19 year old kid when I got through,
boom.

395
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:20.410
So I now I go to be the admiral's aid and I have to wear a uniform every day,

396
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.740
not just one uniform.
I have to wear Khakis,
then whites,
then blues.

397
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.990
And you're just in this constant uniform.
And,

398
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.130
and seals are not good about uniforms.
They just,
they're just not,

399
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:34.210
it's not one of our strong points.
And so,

400
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.060
so that's one of the things that made the job,
not very fun,

401
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.610
but there's a good lesson there,
right?
So here,
I mean,

402
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:45.080
everybody knows you as an incredible leader,
awesome seal.

403
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.160
And yet for this period of time you had to do this job that was not particularly

404
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:50.150
fun.
It's kind of like,
you know,

405
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:52.910
I had to go over and be the seal at the boat unit.
Right?

406
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.180
But do life is full of things like that.
And when you are part of the team,

407
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.460
no matter what you do it to the best of your ability.

408
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.310
And you did an awesome job is the admiral's aid,

409
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.370
not necessarily what you wanted to do,
being a trident where in frog.

410
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760
So I got an email from one of the assistant platoon commanders in Charlie

411
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:15.920
platoon a year ago and he said,
hey bro,

412
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.420
I'm going to go be the aid.
Yeah,
talking to me.

413
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.170
And so I just saw him and he was laughing.
He goes,
your email back to me,

414
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:28.790
you said this is going to be very hard for you because you're not good at this

415
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:30.800
kind of thing.
And I was pretty good at it,

416
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:33.590
so you're going to have to work extra hard to make this happen.

417
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:34.290
And he was laughing.

418
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.820
We were both laughing because you know what I'm talking about it.

419
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.760
He's not a guy that is all over the,
the,
the minutiae.

420
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.310
Of course he did a great job because he stepped up his game.
But yeah,

421
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.570
when you get a task with something,

422
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.450
you do it and you do it the best of your ability.
And,
and you know,

423
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:51.570
just to continue that story,
cause I have to say this,
it was a,

424
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:56.550
it was a pain in the ass job.
It wasn't fun for me,
but man,
did I learn a lot?

425
00:26:56.551 --> 00:27:01.260
Did I understand a lot?
Did I get to know all the inner workings of,

426
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.350
of the community because I was there with the guy,
you know,

427
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.120
with the animal that was in charge of all the seals.

428
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.280
I was with him for 13 months.
I mean all day travel,

429
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.630
w you know,
wake up PT.
We were just,
I every meeting,
you know,
so it was a,

430
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:20.400
it was a great learning experience for me and I was appreciative and he was a

431
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:24.800
great guy.
He's a great guy and he really cared about the seal platoons.
So,

432
00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:28.440
which is,
which is awesome when a guy puts the number one priority,

433
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.810
he'd always talk about,
okay,
what's,
what's the seal platoon need?

434
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:35.040
Or how does this affect the seal platoon?
Yep.
So then we got in,

435
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:39.150
but now you're in your first workup,
right?
Going through workup,
getting,

436
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:43.800
getting your game on.
Awesome.
Best time of my life.
Awesome.

437
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.910
Yeah.
Anybody who's in the military right now and active duty teams,

438
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:50.880
if you're listening to this demand,
just enjoy it,
man.
Enjoy it.

439
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.360
I mean there's other things in life.
Sure.
But like you can,
you just,

440
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.920
you can't replace that time it and there's stupid stuff you deal with.
Yes.

441
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.660
But trust me,
enjoy this man.
You won't find anywhere else.

442
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.090
Nothing like that.
Awesome.
Yeah.
Do you,

443
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.170
what do you I would talk about this sometimes.

444
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.580
So one of the scars that you get from the military,

445
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:17.730
from the seal teams is if you go,

446
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:22.380
if you like to shoot weapons still.
Oh yeah.
And you want to go shooting,

447
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.240
you have to pay for ammunition.
There's an expensive and,
and I'm serious.

448
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:30.780
I remember times in the seal teams where,
I mean your,

449
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:32.490
your thumbs are getting,

450
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.930
your funds are literally getting sore from reloading magazines for days and
days.

451
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.800
You're shooting all the,
all the bullets you could possibly ever,
ever,

452
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:44.850
ever want to shoot ever.
You're going to shoot them all in a week or two weeks.

453
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.180
And so it's,
it's so fun.
It's so fun.

454
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.690
And you know for us,
and for those of you that don't know,

455
00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:53.820
so you go through a workup prior to going on deployment,

456
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.530
which is now you're working together for the first time.

457
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.050
This is when I'm getting to know you guys.
You guys are getting to know me.

458
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.550
We're all getting to know each other,
where the whole,

459
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.700
the whole unit is coming together as a team and this is where the real bond

460
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:08.760
forms and you're doing super hard training.

461
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.600
You're,
you're living together,
you're working out together,

462
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:14.310
you're working together,
you're partying together,

463
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:15.630
you're eating your meals together.

464
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.950
It's just a 24 seven rock and roll awesomeness.
And then that's how,

465
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:22.170
that's how it,
that's how you get to know these guys.

466
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.550
That's how you get to know your,
your,
your team.

467
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.230
Yup.
So me,

468
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.260
Mikey and another guy were the knee or the new guys and Netflix and one other

469
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:36.510
guy.
He saw an active duty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,

470
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:40.020
I'm just saying there was only three new guys in Appleton.
Yeah.
Dang,

471
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:43.870
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
In our,
in,
in,
in,
in Delta and Delta.
Yeah.

472
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.410
Needless to say,
Delta and Charlie were slightly different dynamic.
Yeah.

473
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.590
You guys were,
you guys are a different dynamic.
A different,

474
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.360
just like people have different personalities,

475
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.240
full tunes have different personalities and teams have different personalities

476
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.570
and they can morph and change.
But nonetheless,
uh,

477
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.040
both grateful tombs,
both your platoon.
Oh yeah.
It's,

478
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:11.080
it was only you and Mikey and one other guy.
I know who the other guy was.
Yeah.

479
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.970
Yeah.
The tick,
you guys were the only three new guys in there.
Yup.

480
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.130
So it can be a harsh,
it's,
it's,

481
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.450
it's a harsh environment to come into when you're,

482
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.320
when you're a new guy in a seal platoon.
But,
so I'm with,

483
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.390
so I'm with Mikey and we're doing,
we're just,

484
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.920
I don't even think we're doing mobility,

485
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:34.780
but we are driving out to the ranges and he's the,
uh,

486
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.450
he's the Turret gunner,
right.
And

487
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.460
I say something to them like,
Hey,
when we're approaching a road,
you know,

488
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.210
you look at your field of fire and if there's no vehicles coming,
you know,

489
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:49.260
say clear.
Right?
And so he,

490
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.320
he did it once and he's clear,
clear,
right.
You know,
kind of quiet and I was like,

491
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:56.530
hey man,
you got to sound off the drivers try to drive.
He's got it.

492
00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:58.960
He's got radio on and he's,
he needs to know what's going on,
man.

493
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:03.160
You need to sound off.
Yeah.
And the next row intersection we've got to,

494
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.970
he's like clue.
Right.
And he said it super loud and I thought to myself,

495
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:11.800
wait a second,
is he,
is he,
you know,
taking the piss out of me as he,

496
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:16.180
is he being sarcastic with that yell,
right?
No and no.
He was not.
No.

497
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.530
I told him to yell,
but he was like,
okay,
I will yell.
And that's,

498
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:22.840
that's the way it worked.
The other,

499
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.660
one of my other favorite stories about Mikey was,

500
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.530
and this is another like new guy related story,
was,

501
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.390
so you go through CQC training,
close quarter combat,

502
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:38.830
close quarter battle,
whatever.
It's basically shooting in small spaces,

503
00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:42.220
taking down buildings,
that kind of thing.
And it's,
it's a,
it's a,

504
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.260
there's,

505
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.260
there's a lot of instructor focus on the mechanics of what you're doing.

506
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:52.960
So it's a very,
it's a very mechanical thing.
And if you,

507
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.060
if you're making mistakes,
it's not going to work out good for you.

508
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.820
And by the way,
as a new guy,
there's tough scrutiny.

509
00:31:57.821 --> 00:31:59.890
But the reality is it doesn't matter if you're new or not.

510
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.140
Like they were watching everybody,
but he's getting watched.

511
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.710
You can be a third platoon guy and get canned from the platoon for a safety

512
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:07.600
violation and you'll get a safety violation in two seconds.

513
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:10.870
He's not there and in a half a second.
Yeah,
it doesn't take much.
So,

514
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.080
and what they're trying to do is they're trying to put more stress on you,
right?

515
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.360
Because they want to,
they want you to handle the stress.

516
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:20.380
So they stressed people out by just,
you know,

517
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.250
these little minute details of what you could do right and wrong.

518
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.730
And to be honest with you,
some of them don't matter.
Some of them you're like,

519
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:30.580
okay,
that doesn't matter you and,
and,
and I know they don't matter cause they,

520
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.990
they morph over time and they'll teach you one s phase.

521
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.780
There'll be teaching one thing and then later they'll teach the phase,

522
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:40.100
they'll teach another thing and then later they'll teach another thing.
So

523
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.320
<v 4>it's not,
there's a million different ways to do it.
Yeah.</v>

524
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.460
And you could argue this one's better,

525
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.340
but there's a million different ways to do it.
But they do,

526
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:50.990
they pick whatever they're going to choose for.

527
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:54.230
That block of training is what you're going to do.
And,

528
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:56.660
and if you want to sit there and argue with them,

529
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.300
oh boy is not going to work out good for you.
So what?

530
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:01.940
I told all the new guys and Delta and Charlotte too,
and I said,
well,
hey,
listen,

531
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.320
when the instructor cadre is telling you to do something or they're yelling at

532
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:09.110
you or they're getting on your ass about something,
you just look at him and say,

533
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:13.640
Roger,
that guy's got it.
Roger that.
And these guys were like,

534
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.320
Roger that.
And that's the best attitude you want to have,
right?

535
00:33:16.321 --> 00:33:19.100
Because what you want,
what do you want to be a new guy that's like,
hey,
no,

536
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:22.010
I don't agree with your tactics.
They're a person that's deployed,
you know,

537
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.710
oversees 14 times.
No you don't want to be that guy.

538
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.650
You might think you're right but no,
this is what you know,

539
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.390
that's not what you want to do.
So I told the guys,
say Roger that.

540
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.130
So we're going through the training,

541
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.140
the training is great and we're doing really well.
Our tasking,
it's doing great,

542
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.510
you know,
but still guys are guys are making mistakes,
whatever.

543
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.470
And finally the master chief and of course for like Tony and I were friends with

544
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.740
all the cadre guys cause they're all our bros from being in teams.

545
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.110
And one of the the leader guy,
he comes up to me and he's like,
hey,

546
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.610
he's hard.
But it was these guys.
He goes,
hey,

547
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.060
what's up with this guy Monae store?
And I was like,
auto,
what do you mean,

548
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.340
what's up?
He said,
he's been doing a good job.
What's up?
He goes,

549
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.690
every time I tell him something,

550
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.800
all he does is to just look at me and say Roger that.
And I go,

551
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.670
hey brother,
you know what?
He's doing exactly what I told him to do.

552
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.750
I literally told him,

553
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:14.990
the only thing I wanted wanted him to say to you guys are wanting any of the new

554
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:17.030
guys to say to you guys was Roger that and make it happen.

555
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.290
So when we were out there,

556
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:22.910
there was another platoon that was there at the same time.
Do you remember this?

557
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.670
They were,
and,
and I,

558
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:30.260
I'm pretty sure the chief got canned from the platoon he safety violation.

559
00:34:30.261 --> 00:34:33.440
And there was some,
and there was that talking back going on,
right?
Like,
Hey,

560
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.020
I've got three deployments under my belt.
And you know,

561
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:40.040
there's a degree of humility in that Roger,
that response,
right?
It's,
it's,

562
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.540
it's Roger that I'm open to the correction you have for me.
Yeah,
for sure.
And so,

563
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.410
and these guys,
him and there's a balance there.
I mean,

564
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:51.770
he's leading his platoon and taking a stand for,
you know,
and being in charge,

565
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:55.160
but at the same time,
like there's a humility and a respect in that response.

566
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.290
And he was not doing that.
And I'm telling you like,

567
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.040
he screwed some things up and they safety review board.

568
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:03.890
I mean I'm going to have a holding a safety review board for the chief of that

569
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:07.840
platoon.
It was not our task unit [inaudible] they do not play around.
No.
And,

570
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.660
and that's the way it's supposed to be because it's intense and when people

571
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:15.720
don't get is that you're trying to recreate the intensity of combat as best as

572
00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:20.510
you can.
So they're creating high stress situations as stressful as possible.

573
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.500
And like you said,
sometimes creating elements that aren't necessarily real,

574
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.070
but just to overload you with a number of things you have to process under

575
00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:31.340
pressure and then are you going to make good decisions under pressure?

576
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.640
And that right there is what translates to combat good decisions under stress

577
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:39.150
and under.
Yeah.
Yeah.

578
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:44.210
And you're right though about that humility piece and that was our attitude

579
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:49.200
going through.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Between me and Tony,

580
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.280
I don't think there was,

581
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.400
I'm just trying to think if there's any instructor cadre that was putting us

582
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:57.330
through.
Right.
There were some guys that were,
but there was,

583
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.320
it wasn't like there was someone that was just,
you know,

584
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:04.070
had tons more experience.
And then the two of us.
And yet we,
you know,

585
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.140
both Tony and Roger that,
yeah,
hey,
it sounds good.
We'll,

586
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:09.660
we'll make that adjustment because you know what,

587
00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.250
it's great just having Tony on the other day.
He was just saying,
look,
you can,

588
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.890
I'm learning something new all the time,
learning something from the new guys.

589
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:21.510
And that's the attitude that prevailed through the task unit.
Not of,
Hey,

590
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.960
we're the best.
We don't have to listen to me buddy,
but hey,

591
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.830
we're going to work as hard as we can.
We're going to be the best we can,

592
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.890
but we're,
we had open minds and we're ready to learn at all times.

593
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.070
It's a fine line between confident and cocky,
no doubt about that.

594
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.310
And being humble,
you can be confident.
You can be sure.

595
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:41.700
And you can be humble and respectful and open to learning new things and may be

596
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.520
surprised at what you learn.
Yeah,
there's no doubt about that.

597
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.730
So what else do you remember from workup in terms of,

598
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:52.080
hey,
you're a new guy,
you're checking in.
You know,

599
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:54.840
Tony and I told some stories of what it was like when we were checking into team

600
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:57.180
won.
It was when we were new guys.

601
00:36:57.181 --> 00:37:00.730
It was a very rough environment to roll it into.
Yeah.

602
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.620
What did you think when you got to,
you know,
being a new guy?
Well,

603
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.190
I remember like literally day,

604
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.670
first of all day one that I was checking into the platoons space.

605
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.940
I got like the Combo to the platoon space,
right?
And I went in and I'm me,

606
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.300
I'm brand new and a so I'm going to be protective of my platoon,
you know.

607
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:20.490
So I go in,
I'm walking out of the platoon space,

608
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:22.950
making sure the door is locked behind me cause you know,

609
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.920
other platoon Kaz go in and just destroy it.
Other guys,

610
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:29.600
platoon in space or whatever.
And I'm walking down the hallway and um,

611
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.700
our LPO,
who is,

612
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.580
goes down to the door and he doesn't have the Combo,
right.
And he goes,
he goes,

613
00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:39.750
hey,
hey,
what's the combo to the space?
I'm like,
I gave him some,

614
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.240
why is astronaut not know him?
No,
didn't know him yet.
Right.

615
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.680
How'd that work out for you?
It was hilarious.
Like he,
he,
he goes,
hey,

616
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.650
what's the combo to the space?
I'm like,
hey man,
I can't give that to you.

617
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.910
And then I didn't know is the LPO.
And he's like,
he goes,

618
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.390
he goes on the Goddamn Lpl.
What's the fucking Combo to the Muldoon space?

619
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.200
Like Roger,
that three,
three one together then to,
you know,

620
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:05.640
and I'll proceed to walk down the steps.
Oh God.
All Mighty.

621
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.990
I am just,
I just met the LPO and it was not on good terms.

622
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.070
Oh man,
that's awesome.
He and I turned out to be good friends,
but um,

623
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.030
I remember were out doing land warfare training and this is like where,
you know,

624
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:19.200
you're cutting the metal,
like you said,

625
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:21.060
you're getting to know each other and you know,

626
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:24.090
the guys in the platoon also trying to figure out what these new guys like.

627
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.110
All right,
what have I,
what have we got here?
What can we rely on,
you know?
And uh,

628
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620
so one night I remember us doing a little bit of boxing and it was forced

629
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.260
boxing,
new guy on new guy.
You know,

630
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.240
and a survival of the fittest it.

631
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.350
And then at times it was just three on,
you know,

632
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.120
every man for himself.

633
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:53.530
And it's just like your head's on a swivel and it's Mikey the tick and me and

634
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:56.860
we're just whaling away and it's just going and it's,
hey,

635
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.840
who's going to continue to fight basically,
right.
And everything,
you know,

636
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.540
I'm an officer and these two guys are just,
you know,
obviously we'll in a way,

637
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:08.020
but I'm like,
hey man,
I'm going to just fight to the bitter end.
And it was,

638
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.280
it was pretty awesome.
Hey,

639
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:14.080
did you do Jujitsu before you got you had just enough?

640
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.710
I didn't make it that you could hold your own.

641
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.840
I would when I would do the officer Coumadin.
Yes,
I did do some.
And you know,

642
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.080
to keep in mind,
did you train on the east coast?

643
00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:29.680
When I was in high school and I got in,
I got into Gracie Jujitsu,

644
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:34.550
like literally like I was already training when the first UFC ever made.

645
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.430
Right.
And so it was pretty cool.

646
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.960
And then that was always a big shocker for people because you were,

647
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.020
you are by far smaller than the other platoon officers and yet you had that

648
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:50.350
Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.
When you have the Jujitsu,
you didn't have a lot either,

649
00:39:50.351 --> 00:39:53.080
won't know.
Even a blue belt,
I don't even know.

650
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.370
You were probably like a high level white belt.
But,
but to be fair,

651
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:59.440
like at the time it was all very new.

652
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:04.300
Like the world of MMA today is totally different.
Totally different as you know.

653
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.930
But at the time,
like,
I mean I even went to in high school with my,

654
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.990
with my instructor who was that,
who was a teacher at my school.
He was into it.

655
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:14.800
So he and I would train like five in the morning before school.
Me versus him,

656
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.690
much larger men,
but we learned to just to,

657
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.470
and then we went in and did seminars with hoists,
Gracie,
um,

658
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.890
in upstate New York we would drive.
And uh,
it was cool.

659
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:25.570
Like I got to get out of school.
And again,

660
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:29.560
this is just proof that you just see so good because he would,

661
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.390
I would make these,
these officers,

662
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:33.490
like we meet at five o'clock in the morning and I'd say,
okay,

663
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.140
and I would train with everybody,
but then I'd say,
okay,
now you,
you to,

664
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.660
to fight to the death.
And they would just get after it.
But,

665
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:44.800
but he was,
he was 150 pounds.
He's going against guys that are 200 pounds,

666
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.660
you know,
they haven't by 50 pounds and taller than me and taller and,

667
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:52.420
and he would just,
you know,
there's,
you know,
it just doesn't work.
You know,

668
00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:55.300
you gotta,
you gotta know that you did sue.
Yeah.
And I'm not going to,

669
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.810
I'm not going to say that I wailed and these are tough guys drive though.

670
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.230
That's right.
That's right.
Like they weren't tapping me out,
you know,

671
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.380
then you usually tap them.

672
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.850
I usually choked out a certain guy who didn't like that very much.

673
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.440
It's a hard,
it's all,
it's,
it's a humbling thing,
but you know,
and,

674
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.330
and the thing at that time,
because they are bigger than me,

675
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.730
was more about energy conservation.
Right.
And so like,
I mean,

676
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.630
I'd just let them wear themselves out and then they try and get things on me and

677
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:21.640
then I'd just sneak my way around there.
Buddy.

678
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.320
Also remember you volunteering for the taste.

679
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.240
So I actually had an attitude like you had it,
you look like I can here,

680
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.460
I'm going to handle this.
Like no factor.
What you want to tase me,
bring it.

681
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:38.420
That's right.
You'll know you don't see the guys on the cops.
When is big,
tough,

682
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.040
crazy guy all on PCP and he gets Tazy rips the Taser out and throws the thing

683
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.180
and he just keeps coming.
That's what Andrew Paul had the look like.

684
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:52.190
I'm gonna go,
you're gonna tase me.
Bring it,
let's go.
I mean,
Hey,

685
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:55.880
I'm a new guy in the platoon,
right?
I mean,
I've got to earn my spot.
Right?

686
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.900
And so somewhere somebody had,
actually,
it was the Lpo he had,

687
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:03.890
he had one of these things and I was like,
oh,
I'm going to tell you what,

688
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:06.680
like it had these like two modes and one where you could shoot or you could like

689
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:09.560
put it right up to the guy,
you know?
And I was like,
Hey,
let's go shoot him.

690
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:13.670
Be like,
really?
I'm like,
come on,
let's go.
And then like throw platoon,

691
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.930
like everybody like met down in the bat cave and um,

692
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:18.530
there may be a video floating around somewhere.

693
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.400
This one had the winter barbs at those.
He doesn't know what a Taser is,

694
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:23.234
like the Bar,

695
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.440
the winter barbs or longer to get through the sweater.

696
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:30.020
Who that down coat.
Yeah.
And um,

697
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.790
so when of course he was like,
what were you in a t shirt or just no shirt.

698
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.380
I was in a tee shirt.
Yeah.
And uh,
I was like,
oh,

699
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:42.050
those are winter Barb's work out for you.
So it's like,
there's like,
oh,

700
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.620
they're getting ready to do it.
They're like,
oh wait,
wait.
And you know,

701
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.330
these are my guys looking out for me.
I appreciate it guys.
They're like,

702
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:50.810
oh wait here put this I pro on,
oh that's a good idea.
Right.

703
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:54.530
So puts them on a pro on and then like,
like it's got a laser on it.
Right?

704
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:56.240
So the laser,
I mean if you seen the video like,

705
00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.530
like you hear guys going like guys or wincing like nobody's been tastes like

706
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:02.600
nobody knows what's going to happen right now.
Right.
Boom.

707
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.580
So this thing comes out at like 45 degree angle in one like goes into my sternum

708
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.930
and the other one goes below my belly button.

709
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:18.250
So I'm like instantly over all that thinking he was just going to rip those six

710
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.700
out.

711
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.700
He went ridge and thank God we put a mat down cause he went rigid straight and

712
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:29.690
fell like a brick boom.
Nothing.

713
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:33.140
And it just so it so clearly,
and I remember this too,

714
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:34.970
like it hits you and hits you in that,

715
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:38.060
in that spot and like your hands go to like you've been stung,
you'd been hit.

716
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.060
So you my hands,
my hands get like three quarters of the way there.

717
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.580
By the time the electricity freezes the body.

718
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.030
So my hands are kind of like stuck in front of my chest and my admin as it

719
00:43:47.031 --> 00:43:51.080
attempted to grab the spot.
So I go over and um,
all right.

720
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:53.600
They'd turn the thing off and then,
um,
they go to get these things out.

721
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:56.180
Somebody got a pair of pliers and,
and the Barb,

722
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.410
I remember that good with you need to dislodge them.

723
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.350
So like you went into the muscle like,

724
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:08.330
because like I remember ripping and coming free but not free.
And it was,

725
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:13.290
but it was still beneath the skin and uh,
and then it just like,
just rip it.

726
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.440
This is the team's Bam.
This is what makes the team so fun.
Yeah.

727
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.980
One day you show up at work,

728
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.710
you use volunteer to get tased and you're going to get some,

729
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.360
the best thing you can do is just volunteer in a situation like that,
you know?

730
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.830
And just be like,
come on,
let's go.
Yup.
Brilliant.
And then they go,
oh,
okay.

731
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.070
Right on.
You know?
Yeah.
Well you did

732
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.380
<v 2>the right thing.
I'm sorry it didn't work out too well.</v>

733
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.580
I think it worked out great.
All right.

734
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:43.110
So we get word we'd get done with our work up and now it's time to go on

735
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:47.090
deployment and um,
get on to the limit.

736
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.670
And we found out what,

737
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.860
two weeks before you guys were on leave when we found out where you're going to

738
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:56.040
Ramadi instead of where we were originally supposed to go,
which was in Iraq,

739
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.230
but we knew,
I mean,
I knew Ramadi was going to be the,
uh,

740
00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.490
the best place to deploy to and

741
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:08.120
we show up over there.
And what was cool,
I thought about with,
uh,

742
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.160
with that deployment is the way we task organized and every basically every

743
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.300
leader got their own element.
Yeah,
yeah.
And put you guys,
it was like,
oh yeah,

744
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:20.250
you know how you've been working for this and we've been all with,
no,

745
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.940
you're going out on your own.
You're,
you're in charge.
And that was a,

746
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.750
that was awesome.

747
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.160
And that what made me feel good was that when we were in the workup and we made

748
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:30.270
you guys run operations,

749
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:33.180
even though you were new guys and made you put you in pressure situations and

750
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.470
put you in charge of ground force commander while you were,
you know,

751
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:41.520
most troops didn't do that.
But I knew that there was a possibility.

752
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.690
And furthermore,
what happens if you know you're a platoon commander gets killed,

753
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.670
what happens if I get killed?
And then you're the guy,

754
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.440
then you got to be able to step up and run stuff.

755
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:53.010
And so we did that through the chain of command and,
and we did,

756
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.810
I will admit to this,

757
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.280
we made sure that we hit crushed the workup and then it was like,

758
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:02.670
okay we've dominated,
okay now we start training the new guys up on how to lead.

759
00:46:02.671 --> 00:46:03.360
And that was,

760
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.710
that was important too because it's you want to do well in the workup you want

761
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.040
you,

762
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.710
cause that's where your reputation has a task and your comes from is how well

763
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:12.600
you do going through these various training box.

764
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.810
<v 3>That's why we earned earned the spot.
To be able to go to Iraq.
Right.</v>

765
00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:19.550
Because the thing is is that some guys are going elsewhere and you're all via

766
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:19.831
look,

767
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:23.010
I mean you're all vying cause you want to go to combat and some guys are going

768
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.390
someplace else,
not in Iraq.
And um,
you know,
I hate to say it,

769
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:30.930
but that's not where any of us really wanted to go.
Nothing to say about that.

770
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.090
If you are in the seal teams,
you want to go to war.
That's right.
That's right.

771
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.470
We all wanted to go to war.
That's what we were fighting for.
We were competing.

772
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.430
There's three tasks,
units.

773
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:42.300
We were competing as a task unit to get top spot to the most dangerous place.

774
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.540
And that's what we want to go.
And that turned out to be Ramadi.
Now,
by the way,

775
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.450
not on that workout too,
just from a leadership perspective.
And if you remember,

776
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:51.600
you know,
not everybody made it through the workup.
Um,

777
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.460
they were guys who were cut loose,
um,
safety issues,
not stepping up,
not leading,

778
00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:56.671
right.

779
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:59.520
Pushing that leadership opportunity to down to the junior officer or whatever

780
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:03.750
and not stepping up or doing something unsafe or just not having what it took.

781
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.710
And um,
you know,
and you know,
just from a leadership perspective,

782
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:12.300
you have to be willing to make that hard decision and reality.
And I know,

783
00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:12.540
you know,

784
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.750
you and life have talked about it when you've given everybody that guy every

785
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:16.410
opportunity,

786
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.650
when you've evaluated it and you've kept notes and you've tried to train and

787
00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:22.880
you've tried to correct,
it's not a hard decision.
Right.

788
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.390
<v 2>Actually,
the commodore,
I don't know if you were there,</v>

789
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:30.100
but the commodore asked me,
we were on deployment and he goes,
you know,
hey,
hey

790
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.860
<v 4>Jocko,
this is in front of everyone.
He says,
you know,
well,</v>

791
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:35.350
I shouldn't say everyone was from in front of the leadership.
He says,
hey,

792
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.770
how were the guys that were in workup maybe weren't performing up to par?

793
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:40.960
How are they doing over here?
And I was like,
sir,

794
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.740
they're not in this task and not here.
That's right.
Yeah.
They didn't make it.
Yes.

795
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:49.720
Right.
They've been removed.
That's right.
So,
yeah,
that's a great point.
And again,

796
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.420
it's hard thing to do cause you,
cause you're really,

797
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.140
you're really wrecking someone's life.
Well,
think about it,
right?

798
00:47:56.141 --> 00:48:01.120
So this is a guy who was who,
so there's a guy who's an officer,
right?
So you're,

799
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:02.590
I mean,
we didn't really,
we kind of glaze through it,

800
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.950
but it's hard to get a spot to go to buds as an officer.
It's very competitive.

801
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:08.290
So this is a guy who was an officer who got a spot to go to buds,

802
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.660
made it through buds,
which is hard.
Um,
made it through.

803
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:18.340
Sqt got to a platoon.
This,
this guy is not a slouch physically,

804
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:21.960
you know what I mean?
Like this is not,
this is not some loser.
You know,

805
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:26.890
this is a guy who knows a great American,
right?
Patriotic Person.
That's right.

806
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:31.600
Great Guy who stepped up,
who made it through something that many,

807
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:36.601
many other men could not make it through and had to make a hard decision.

808
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:37.900
Um,
you know,

809
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:42.370
on your part with the Delta platoon commander to not have this guy continue with

810
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:46.170
us.
And so if that can happen,
even within the seal teams,
any of he goes,

811
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.560
we were listening.
Right.
I mean,

812
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.010
don't you think that's also possible that within your organization you might

813
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.330
have to make a similar kind of decision?

814
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.030
We also have to make that decision in the seal teams.
Yup.

815
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.990
We're not exempt from making that decision.
Yeah.

816
00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:03.070
And also very much like the civilian sector.
Um,
you know,

817
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.310
there's HR basically in the military there's HR,
there's,

818
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.710
there's human resource department and you can't just walk into,
and I'm like,

819
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:12.340
this guy a firearm.
That's right.
No.
Okay.
Well what have you counseled them?

820
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.370
Has you paperwork on him?
Does he know that Dave,

821
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:17.140
you verbally have you written it.
It's all these things.

822
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.990
That's where we went through that whole procedure.
And you know,

823
00:49:19.991 --> 00:49:22.990
if there's an extreme case,
of course you can,
you can make it happen,

824
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:25.900
but it's going to cost you a little bit of political capital.
Because honestly,

825
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.540
if I'm your boss and you come to me and say,
Hey,
I want to fire this guy.

826
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:32.410
And I say,
okay,
why?
Well,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,
he's not doing his job anymore.

827
00:49:32.411 --> 00:49:35.650
And I said,
okay,
did you counsel them?
No,
not yet.
But I want to fire him anyways.

828
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.380
That's going to cost you some political capital.
Yeah.

829
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.940
I'm actually looking at you going,
wait a second,
why didn't you train this guy?

830
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:42.220
Yeah.
You as a leader,
why didn't she step up and train this guy?

831
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.190
What are you doing?
Cause it,
cause that can be a cop out,
right?
Hey,

832
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:48.730
if I'm too lazy to train,
Mentor,
then you're copping out as leader.

833
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:51.910
But if you've done all those things as a leader and you can really document that

834
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:53.860
and see that and the guy's still not performing,

835
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.730
then the next leadership decision is tough part way.
And that really is,

836
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.150
I mean that really is one of the best things about the seal teams is,

837
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.840
is when you're raising your guys up,
when you,
when you're teaching guys,

838
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:08.980
which you know,
and you're saying,
hey man,
this is what you need to do.
Hey Bro,

839
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.080
here's what,
here's the way this works.
Here's what you did over here.

840
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:14.950
Here's what you should do.
You know,
that's just,
that's your,
that's your legacy.

841
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:16.540
That's what you're leaving behind is,
is,
hey,

842
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:19.840
this is what I learned and I want to teach it to as many guys as I can.

843
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.020
That's what you're trying to do.
So if your lab,
if you're not doing that,

844
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:28.190
that's jacked up,
you know,
that's jacked up and it's the same thing.
The civilian

845
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.070
<v 2>sector,
you don't,
here's a good one.
Uh,</v>

846
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.130
I was working and we work with companies and I was working with a company the

847
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:38.510
other day and they got a guy who sort of,
you know,
oh,
well,

848
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.190
well maybe he's not the best mentor,
right?

849
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.270
But he wants to get promoted,
of course,
cause everyone wants to get promoted.

850
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.790
So this guy wants to get promoted and they're trying to,

851
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:52.610
they haven't had luck saying,
look,
you got to be a mentor.
You've got to lead.

852
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:56.570
You've got to be a better leader.
You've got to raise people up.
And,
uh,
I just,

853
00:50:56.571 --> 00:51:00.470
you know,
talk,
talk to the boss.
And I said,
well,
ask him this question.
Yeah.

854
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:03.320
You know what?
I definitely am looking forward to promoting you.

855
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.530
Gimme the three names of people that you've prepared to take your position,

856
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.940
right?
Goose eggs,
right?
That's going to be goose eggs cause he hasn't done that.

857
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:15.170
That's right.
So that's a key component.
You know,
you definitely want to,

858
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.540
you want to be as a leader,

859
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.560
you should be looking for your replacement all the time.
And I with with,

860
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.190
with life and the,
with the Delta between commander,

861
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.980
I wanted those guys be able to do my job and that's my whole goal.

862
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.930
And I wanted you to be able to do my job right.
And,

863
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.970
and I'll tell you by the time we went on deployment,
they,

864
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:32.060
everyone pretty much could do my job.
So that,

865
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:35.450
that was success for me because guess what that allowed me to do on deployment.

866
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:38.780
But look at the look up and look out and figured out what we're going to do next

867
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:40.010
and all that other stuff.

868
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.730
So that should be your goal from a leadership perspective for sure.

869
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.650
And as you just pointed out,

870
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.080
when you get to a situation where you've done the coaching,

871
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:50.960
you've done the mentoring,
you've done the counseling,
you've written,

872
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:51.970
you've set the expectation,

873
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.650
you have a person that's stolen and cutting the mustard,
you got to go.

874
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.430
Not a hard decision at the end.
You have to be loyal.
People get mixed up too.

875
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:01.130
Cause there's a loyalty component because you formed those relationships.

876
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.710
You just talked to her about an hour about this big relationship with all these

877
00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:04.670
people.
Well guess what?

878
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.950
You have a relationship with that person that you're about to fire too.

879
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:11.390
But then the question becomes are you going to be loyal to that individual?

880
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.700
You can be loyal to the teams because you're hurting the tough side.
Yeah,

881
00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:17.480
that's exactly right.
It's the team.
Yup.
So that's that.

882
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.430
We went on deployment with a strong bunch of pipe hitters.
All right,

883
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.200
so we get on deployment.
We you,
you guys,
we kind of,
and this is again,

884
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:30.110
this is something Tony and I talked about.
We were task organizing.

885
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.740
We changed that.
We changed it on a fairly regular basis.
Okay.

886
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.430
We know what this area is getting hot,

887
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.130
we need more guys over there and we would just kind of,
there's a lot to do.

888
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.100
There's a lot to do and then a lot of work to be done.
It was a lot,

889
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:44.390
a lot of bad guys.
Um,
when you,

890
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:46.220
when you look back and you're kind of,

891
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.900
so now you're on your first combat deployment,

892
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:53.000
what was the thing that struck you as day?

893
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.880
Like,
okay,
this is what,
cause I'll tell you,
people ask me that.

894
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.750
Like the first fire fight I got in while my first deployment to Iraq.

895
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.310
And honestly I was like,
okay.
I felt like I was 100% prepared.

896
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:07.700
I agree completely.
And I was like,
okay,
cool.
Hey guys.
You know,

897
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:11.060
he's just very simple,
very straightforward.
So some guys said to me one time,

898
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.390
and this is an outside guy and said,
he goes,

899
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:18.020
because it seems to me that in the seal teams he goes to stress inoculation

900
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:18.854
really well.

901
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.890
And so I would say yes because that is exactly my same first firefight I got in.

902
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.980
I was like,
no big

903
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.110
<v 3>deal.
And you know,
look,
you know,
when the rounds are close,
right?</v>

904
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.440
Like you know what that sounds like and they're,

905
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.200
and they're really close and it's no big deal by the way.

906
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.960
It's not really very loud when they're shooting at you.
Right?

907
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:38.830
I mean you hear a certain sound.
Um,

908
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.370
but then of course he's fire maneuver and it gets a little loud.

909
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.001
But that's awesome.

910
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:45.270
It's just like every drill we've ever done and it was no big deal.
It was just,

911
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.310
it was almost habit at that point.
You can do exactly the newer,
so no big deal.

912
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.440
The first,
the first time I went out in a Humvee in Ramadi.

913
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:59.790
So keep in mind,
like you said in the introduction,
we got there guys,

914
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:03.630
we're getting IED and killed every single day.

915
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:08.880
Every day the message traffic came over and it was Kia,
you know,

916
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.360
IED.
So first Humvee ride,

917
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.320
I go out in and I'm looking out the window.
And by the way,

918
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:19.140
like you can't really roll these windows down.
It's not like you can,

919
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.050
you don't want to roll these windows down by their way.
Proof windows.

920
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.600
You want to keep them up right.
And you know,

921
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:29.460
so like you actually can't shoot back if you want to write the only guy that can

922
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:30.660
shoot back as your turret gunner.

923
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.860
And for the first like I would just say minute and a half,

924
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:39.360
I was like wincing.
I was like waiting for this clack to go,

925
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.960
you know?
And then finally I was like,
you know what,

926
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.430
there's nothing I can do about it.
And I literally let it go right then.

927
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.950
So that was that.
That was like,
that's a strong memory.

928
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:52.890
Like I remember even for all the training,
and again,

929
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:57.630
the first fire fight was no big deal.
And um,
but driving down in a Humvee,

930
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.360
sitting in the back,
completely helpless.
I mean,

931
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:02.250
you have two choices in life is a lot like this.

932
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:05.040
You can sit there and worry yourself away about it.
Well,

933
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.760
is it this intersection is at this intersection or just go,
you know what,

934
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:10.950
here's the deal.
I can't control it,
so I'm just going to be ready.

935
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:13.710
So when it's my time to bust out this door or do whatever we got to do to do an

936
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:17.160
immediate action drill or whatever,
I'm ready to do it.
And the rest of it,

937
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:21.150
you just let go.
You let go.
Because anything else is not effective.
Yeah.
You,

938
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.380
you're not,
you're not.

939
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.930
<v 2>Yeah.
It's not only just are you worried,
but now you're,</v>

940
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.930
you're actually doing things bad.
You're actually being negative here.

941
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:31.170
You're thinking about things that you shouldn't be thinking about and is not

942
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:34.500
helping you.
It's not helping your team.
So I like that.
Just to,

943
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.860
just to kind of sum up what you said,
you were in Ramadi for six months,

944
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.540
you were scared for about a minute and 30 seconds.
Yeah.

945
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:45.120
And after that you're like,
all right.
And I think that's,
that's the attitude that

946
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.290
I think that's the best I hate.

947
00:55:48.291 --> 00:55:50.000
I don't know if this is the right thing to say or not,

948
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.620
but to accept the fact that there's things you can control that you can not

949
00:55:54.621 --> 00:55:59.330
control.
And that one of those things is,
you know,
an ID,
a sniper bullet.

950
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.590
I mean there's things that you can do to influence.
Cause guess what?

951
00:56:03.591 --> 00:56:06.620
We do training.
We prepare,
we're keeping our eyes peeled.

952
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.130
We're taking routes that we know have been cleared to the best of our ability.

953
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.960
We're,
we're,
we're,
we're on the street,
we're moving,

954
00:56:11.961 --> 00:56:14.150
we're moving from cover to cover.
We're doing everything that we can.

955
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.510
But guess what?
It doesn't matter.
You can do everything right and doesn't matter.

956
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.930
You can still get blown up.
You can still get shot.
That's the way it is.

957
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.190
So if you sit around and just about that all the time,

958
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.280
it's just going to drive you crazy one.
And number two,

959
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:29.450
it's going to make you do your job worse.
Yeah.

960
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.840
Cause you're gonna be less aggressive.
And I think

961
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.210
you gotta stay aggressive to stay alive.
You,
you want to be aggressive.

962
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:39.560
You want to be,
you know what?
Yeah,
we'll go make that happen.
Oh there,

963
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.600
do I want to sit in the vehicle in order to get out and get out and get some

964
00:56:42.601 --> 00:56:45.360
ground?
I mean,
that's just the type of thing,
that mindset,

965
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:47.170
it's a mindset that wins.
Yep.

966
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.800
<v 3>That's it.
It's the winning mindset.
And if your goal is to win,</v>

967
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.820
did you have to recognize a certain thought processes are not effective and they

968
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:58.450
take away from your ability to win and will ask if people get worried about

969
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:02.190
stuff,
that kind of thing.
Right.
So,
um,
you just,
you take a step back.
You,

970
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.950
I want to win,
right?
The Guy said to me one time,
hey Ya,
do you think,

971
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.330
do you think fear is a,
is a useful emotion?

972
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:12.760
I thought about it for a second cause I never heard lots of different people

973
00:57:12.761 --> 00:57:16.600
talk about fear and you know,
this is an ad.
And you know,
I would say for,

974
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.820
maybe I'll change this one day,

975
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:22.000
but right now this is where I've come to one fear,
um,

976
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:26.140
maybe for the caveman who's walking through the jungle and they get attacked by

977
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:28.060
the saber tooth tiger.
And that fear,

978
00:57:28.061 --> 00:57:33.010
that fight or flight response is enough to make him react in a moment in order

979
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:36.850
to avoid being slashed by the tiger.
But other than that,

980
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:42.090
fear was not effective in battle because you do not make good decisions when

981
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:45.310
acting in fear.
And you have a better chance of survival.

982
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.650
You make better decisions and you have a better chance of winning in defeating,

983
00:57:48.651 --> 00:57:53.500
in crushing the enemy when you remain calm.
When you do Ooda loop,
observe,

984
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.520
Orient,
decide,

985
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.650
<v 2>act.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got,
I could ask to,
I've obviously,</v>

986
00:57:57.651 --> 00:58:00.380
you get asked about fear a lot and you know,
I always say,
look,

987
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.700
fear is the fear is not a bad thing because it's the thing that makes you go,

988
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.950
okay,
I need to be ready.
Right.
Is the thing that makes you rehearse.

989
00:58:06.951 --> 00:58:09.620
It's a thing that makes you say,
okay,
cause you,
and for me,

990
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:10.810
<v 1>okay,</v>

991
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.290
<v 2>the,
again,
the fear wasn't about the fear of getting killed,
getting blown up.</v>

992
00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:18.770
The fear was always about,
I want to,
I don't want to do a bad job.

993
00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.500
I don't want to make a bad decision that I'll tell you,

994
00:58:21.501 --> 00:58:22.490
you're in a leadership position.

995
00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.170
That is the heaviest fear that you have is I make a mistake,

996
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.180
my team does something that doesn't,
doesn't,

997
00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:31.920
<v 1>okay,</v>

998
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.060
<v 2>bring credit upon us as a unit.
And by that I mean it doesn't do a good job.</v>

999
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:39.030
Like you're just,
I don't even know where that comes from.

1000
00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.360
It's just want to do a good job.
And the fear is,
hey,

1001
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:44.370
I hope I don't do anything that gets my guys hurt or killed.

1002
00:58:44.371 --> 00:58:47.340
I hope don't do anything that's a bad decision that makes,
that does.

1003
00:58:47.341 --> 00:58:50.040
That hurts a strategically as a nation.
Yup.

1004
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:54.810
Those are the two fears that I think make you a hearse,
make you practice,

1005
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.330
make you reinforce,
make you

1006
00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:58.520
<v 1>okay</v>

1007
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.320
<v 2>aware of what's happening,
but you can't.
What you can't do,
I mean,
for me,</v>

1008
00:59:03.321 --> 00:59:06.230
if your fear is making me aggressive,
like,
oh,

1009
00:59:06.231 --> 00:59:09.020
I think this guy's got to go to do something to me.
Cool.

1010
00:59:09.021 --> 00:59:11.630
I'm afraid of him Coleman to attack them.
I'm going to kill him.
You know,

1011
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:13.670
I'm going to take him out.
I'm going to do something.
You know?

1012
00:59:13.671 --> 00:59:15.060
And I actually see that time.
You know?

1013
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.950
I see that in MMA to where when you see someone that happened to somebody where

1014
00:59:18.951 --> 00:59:23.690
they get a little bit,
they get a little bit or something.
If they,

1015
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:28.220
if they let that fear make them back off and go into a defensive mode.

1016
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:32.060
It's exactly what you just said.
If it makes you into a defensive mode,
it's good.

1017
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:35.120
You're gonna the person is going to cause,
man,
you can smell that.
That's right.

1018
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.780
You can smell that.
So when I think the reaction to fear,
it's like,
oh,

1019
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:41.720
I'm afraid right now Coleman to attack.
I have to attack like,
oh,

1020
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:45.050
I don't feel comfortable about where the troop is moving right now or where my

1021
00:59:45.051 --> 00:59:47.540
squad is moving right now.
I don't think it's a good thing.
Cool.

1022
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:49.340
I'm going to attack them and take some high ground.
I'm gonna Maneuver.

1023
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.570
That's why it's healthy.
It's a healthy fear that that's healthy.

1024
00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:56.210
But you're also trained and prepared mentally for that kind of thing.

1025
00:59:56.211 --> 00:59:59.240
Most people,
when they start acting in fear,
they start making poor decisions.

1026
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.940
So in that sense it's like,
Hey,

1027
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:04.880
get over your fears because you have to recognize that when you're acting in

1028
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:08.720
fear,
you'll have a less desirable outcome.
Then if you can get over it,
calm down,

1029
01:00:08.721 --> 01:00:13.430
sip,
you know,
observe,
Orient,
decide,
act.
No doubt about it.
All right.

1030
01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:16.220
What about,
what about just plain leadership challenges?
I mean,

1031
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:19.050
here we are stressful deployment.
Yup.
It was,

1032
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.720
it was the most stressful deployment that anybody had had up until that point in

1033
01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:27.980
Iraq.
Yup.
Um,
and even talking to,

1034
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.920
you know,
the Vietnam guys,
this was a stressful deployment,

1035
01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:36.280
a very stressful deployment in the amount of combat that was happening.
Oh,

1036
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:40.670
urban combat hap,
things happen so fast.
Yep.
Uh,
so,
but,

1037
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.770
but from a leadership perspective,
what did you,

1038
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.230
was there anything that you didn't expect?

1039
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.630
Was there any lesson that got confirmed?
Termed?

1040
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.350
<v 3>Yeah,
so,
and it's funny because,
you know,</v>

1041
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.060
over time in the deployment you really mature,
um,

1042
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:59.180
even in a short amount of time.
And I,
and I'll give you a quick,
quick story.

1043
01:00:59.360 --> 01:00:59.810
So it was,

1044
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:04.810
it was one of my last ops before I left country and there was another unit that

1045
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:10.790
had come in to kind of partner up with us.
And,
uh,
we went into this op.

1046
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:15.530
And so the officer in that unit,
who's a good friend of mine,
by the way,
um,W was,

1047
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.980
it might have been his second combat op.
Right.
And so I've been on,

1048
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.130
I don't even know how many at that point.
And uh,

1049
01:01:22.131 --> 01:01:26.900
so we went and did this operation and it involves some army units and a,

1050
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:30.740
so we're sitting in this position and,
um,
so

1051
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.580
like classic blunder,

1052
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:39.830
the Army Guy who sitting there is on the rooftop and he's smoking a cigarette.

1053
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.040
Like,

1054
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.040
like the classic World War Two sniper victim smoking a cigarette.

1055
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:51.780
Yeah.
Trail of smoke going up.
And uh,
I mean this is a classic,
I mean,

1056
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.360
single sniper shot shoots him and it,

1057
01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:01.040
it just,
I mean,
it misses his face.
Well,
let me put it this way,

1058
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.460
it took his ear a little off,
right.
Round cracks under the wall behind us.

1059
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:07.890
That's it.
Immediately everybody just by black,

1060
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:11.330
like just unloads firefight.
Right.
And,
uh,

1061
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:13.300
so we're calling the metadata for this guy because it Kinda,

1062
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:17.960
it's still cut them pretty good.
And,
um,
I'm trying to figure out,

1063
01:02:17.961 --> 01:02:20.010
there's gonna be any more fire or whatever the situation is.
So,

1064
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.970
so this guy is like,
well on my case,

1065
01:02:22.971 --> 01:02:26.970
so time to call the QRF and get out of here.
He's like,
well,
you know,

1066
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:28.770
I think I'm like,
you think what dude,

1067
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.600
what else do you think is possibly going to come from this?
And you know,

1068
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.390
I mean I probably would've thought,
hey,

1069
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:39.300
maybe we can still get something from this.
It was when my first or second.
Right.

1070
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:41.850
But it was just clear like,
I mean,
at this point,
I mean we've already,

1071
01:02:41.851 --> 01:02:44.040
we've already got a lot of guys hurt on this deployment.

1072
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:47.940
We've already lost mark and um,
a few other guys.
So,
you know,

1073
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:51.400
because it's already been shot at this point.
So,
um,

1074
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.120
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1075
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.840
<v 3>you have to weigh like what,
what more are you going to gain?
I mean,
first of all,</v>

1076
01:02:56.841 --> 01:03:01.130
this guy,
just this sniper just got a bead on this guy.
I mean in,

1077
01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:05.900
by the grace of God,
he is still alive and we've shot like,

1078
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.700
so what else is going to happen?

1079
01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.520
I mean they're either just going to set up and get a better position or get

1080
01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:13.340
another shot,
but they certainly aren't going to do anything.

1081
01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:16.880
We certainly aren't going to see anything that they don't want us to see at this

1082
01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:20.630
point.
So the battlefield is lost.
I mean,
this op is a,
it's over.

1083
01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:23.090
It's it's time to pull chalks and go.
So anyway,

1084
01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:26.320
that army came and busted down the swan with the fighting.
It was awesome.
I mean,

1085
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.050
I love the breading Bradley fighting vehicle.
Um,
but you know,

1086
01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.860
that's just sort of like a quick,
it's like obvious.

1087
01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:33.980
It's obvious to me at that point and I on a Monday morning comp,
you know,

1088
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.650
quarterback 10 years later as I'm explaining this,

1089
01:03:36.651 --> 01:03:39.560
like anybody's listening can go,
well yeah,
obviously time to go,
right?

1090
01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:40.041
But you know what,

1091
01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:43.010
you're in that position and guys are still trying to get after it and there's

1092
01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:44.750
still things going on out there.
You might think,
well,

1093
01:03:44.751 --> 01:03:45.560
maybe there's still something

1094
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.690
<v 2>you can do here.
Yeah.</v>

1095
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:52.340
And by the way that there was other times where similar situations happen in

1096
01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:55.850
different decisions were made and they worked out great.
Yep.
You know,

1097
01:03:55.910 --> 01:04:00.910
and so I think your overall statement is like you gained perspective right over

1098
01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:06.530
time and you should be able to look at things from a,

1099
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:11.120
from a better perspective and from a higher altitude for a lack of a better way

1100
01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:13.820
to say it.
You are able to understand what's happening on the battlefield more.

1101
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.210
Yeah,

1102
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:18.530
that's definitely something that if people are listening and it's something that

1103
01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:19.790
they want to become aware,
it's,

1104
01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:24.560
if it's something that you can actually act on because that perspective,

1105
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.430
it can be gained through time and experience.

1106
01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:31.670
But it can also be gained by detachment and saying,
okay,

1107
01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.110
what am I really doing here right now?
What are we really going to gain?

1108
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.500
And you can make a faster progress down the line to have to make good judgment

1109
01:04:42.231 --> 01:04:46.080
calls based on not just experience but just on knowledge and,
and,

1110
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.710
and trying to capture the right perspective at the right time.

1111
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:52.790
Plus a big tactic for that.
For those guys who was slowly evolving.
And,

1112
01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.920
and happened,
uh,
after we left.

1113
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.880
So is there anything else that you start that,

1114
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:03.860
that you learned again that you didn't expect or that was useful for you?

1115
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:06.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1116
01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.450
<v 3>Eight.
From a leadership perspective.
Yeah.
So,
you know,</v>

1117
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:14.800
I found myself in a position a lot of times of kind of stitching the,

1118
01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.730
keeping it platoon to stitch together,
you know,
in an intense situation,

1119
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.230
guys start to have different opinions about things,
you know,
they do indeed.
Yup.

1120
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.360
And so,
um,
so on this deployment,
I was not the platoon commander,

1121
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.670
right.
My good friend was the platoon commander.

1122
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.800
And when you're in a position of leadership,

1123
01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:37.000
you're making a lot of hard decisions and not everybody always agrees with the

1124
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:37.900
decision that gets made.

1125
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.560
And so a lot of times the role I needed to fill was to back my platoon commander

1126
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:47.510
and continue to keep the platoon together behind the platoon commander because

1127
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.120
he,
he had,
he was tasked with making some hard decisions.
So,

1128
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.390
um,
sometimes it was,
you know,
sometimes,
you know,
so look,

1129
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:58.780
I would just do analogy I would give to you is that you may be enrolled in a

1130
01:05:58.781 --> 01:05:59.590
company,

1131
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:04.360
in an organization where the best thing you can do to be part of the team is to

1132
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:09.860
help keep the team on focus for the mission.
And that might mean,
you know,

1133
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:14.530
spending some time with one or two guys who are over here,
uh,
uh,

1134
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.910
having a disagreement about the decision or which way things are going.
Okay.

1135
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.210
<v 2>And truly one of the best ways that you end up having to do that or doing that</v>

1136
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:25.200
is number one,
you build the relationships with the guys,
right?

1137
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.070
So they know and trust you.
Number two,

1138
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:32.470
your platoon commander is got a lot of stuff on his plate,
right?

1139
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:37.890
And so one of the easiest things for him to cut short is the guise of,

1140
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.820
of explaining,
hey,
here's why this is going on and here's why this is going to,

1141
01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.180
so you as the intermediary isn't okay,
I know what he's doing.

1142
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:48.130
I know why he's making this decision.
Let me explain this down.

1143
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:51.760
The chain of command.
That's right.
And that's so helpful.
So helpful.

1144
01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.250
And when you've got guys in the platoon or any organization,

1145
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.570
a high performing organization that are really strong willed and have strong

1146
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.960
opinions and by the way are an intelligent and it can make really articulate

1147
01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:06.760
points as to why they don't agree with something.
You know,
again,
my role in that,

1148
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.800
in that situation was to ensure that mission success continued to happen,

1149
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:13.510
that we were still effective as a unit.

1150
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:17.470
And that meant me kind of behind the scenes trying to keep,

1151
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.950
keep some guys on board.
Yeah,
and it's interesting,

1152
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.480
I'm sure people have noted this already,

1153
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:26.320
but when you said there's these different people inside of what platoon,

1154
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.110
I mean just if you listen to the podcast that I just,

1155
01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:33.340
where did with retired senior chief Tonia fratty and you,

1156
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.660
you guys personalities are,
are very,
very different.
Very,
very different.

1157
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.260
And that's just some of what you get in a soup tune and you know what,

1158
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:44.650
it's not just some would get seal up tune.
It's some of what you get any,

1159
01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:47.500
any organization.
That's right.
There's no clones.

1160
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.670
There's not people being turned out,
they can have the same background,

1161
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:54.220
they can go to the same school,
they can have the same level of experience,

1162
01:07:54.221 --> 01:07:55.480
they can be totally different people.

1163
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.340
That's the way it is and that's the way it is in the seal teams and that's the

1164
01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:59.470
way it is.
And every organization is part of why we're so good.
Right?

1165
01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:01.360
Cause you've got guys that think differently and then you have problems

1166
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:02.210
differently.
Yes.

1167
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:07.090
But I like the fact of what you're saying is you had to be,

1168
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.850
you found yourself in the role of okay you know what?

1169
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.620
I got to make sure that the guys understand where the platoon commanders coming

1170
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.340
from with the God that if there's something that actually makes sense,

1171
01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.930
I got to bring it back over to the commander and say look,

1172
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.540
this isn't one of the guys you know complaining about something.

1173
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.850
Here's the legitimate point that's being made.
Right?

1174
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.820
And then you guys can have that discussion discussion.

1175
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.550
Maybe brings in one of those guys that were good with,

1176
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:28.730
tell me what you're talking about here.

1177
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:31.880
And then you guys can move forward and come up with the best possible plan.

1178
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:33.320
But yeah,

1179
01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.670
as a peacemaker for all practical purposes is,

1180
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:42.710
is what's his,
where you,
what you end up being.
And um,
you know,

1181
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.660
before I w w the one of them

1182
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.480
is needed because it wasn't a lot of peace over there.
Not a lot of peace.

1183
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.520
One of the stories,

1184
01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:58.521
I think that little Mikey story here that kind of shows you the level of

1185
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:01.270
violence that was happening

1186
01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:01.870
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1187
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:06.610
<v 2>In Ramadi.
So I came to visit.</v>

1188
01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:07.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1189
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.170
<v 2>Uh,
yeah cause I was a,
I was on the other side of Ramadi and,</v>

1190
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.470
and the guys from Delta first,

1191
01:09:13.471 --> 01:09:16.260
a small section of guys from Delta and then all of them ended up on the,

1192
01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.070
on the eastern side of Ramadi with the first of the five or six band of
brothers.

1193
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:21.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1194
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:22.890
<v 2>Awesome.
Outstanding unit.</v>

1195
01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:28.010
All amazing guys to a man and with an amazing commander.

1196
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.760
But so Delta platoon ended up over there.
Well anyways,

1197
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:37.440
I had gone over to visit,
go,
go do some ops with them and see what was going on.

1198
01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:39.730
And when I showed up,
you know,

1199
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:44.460
I showed up and this was a few is probably like a month and a half in,

1200
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.190
uh,
because the guys had taken over some crappy uh,

1201
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.160
<v 1>okay.</v>

1202
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.810
<v 2>Building and full metal jacket,
full metal jacket and had built it out.</v>

1203
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.990
FMJ So if you guys seen the movie full metal jacket,

1204
01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.590
that's a scene in the movie where these guys,
these buildings are all blown out.

1205
01:10:01.591 --> 01:10:05.820
Well this building were not,
not just the seals,
but a bunch of guys,

1206
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.960
army guys lived in this building and it was all blown out and it looked like

1207
01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:14.340
this is awesome.
It was awesome metal jacket.
And when we first got in there,

1208
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:17.760
the first one we first went out there,
it was dirt.
It was literally dirt floors,

1209
01:10:17.761 --> 01:10:21.180
just mosquitoes everywhere.
It was told it was just horrible.

1210
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:26.040
And now some time has passed.
And the guys,
of course you put seal somewhere,

1211
01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:29.240
they're going to dial some stuff in the CBS that we have with this.
Awesome.

1212
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:34.680
Oh my gosh.
The cvs we had were phenomenal and we don't know what cvs are there.

1213
01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:38.860
They're sort of the navy's version of engineers and they're,

1214
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:42.720
they're fanatically hard workers.
And the crew that we had with us in Ramadi,

1215
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.150
that was we,
they were part of our task unit.

1216
01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:50.610
They were just total hard chargers and bust their ass and make stuff happen.

1217
01:10:50.611 --> 01:10:52.470
So they had,
and the other thing,

1218
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.530
the other thing you have to do when you're a CB is you have to learn to acquire

1219
01:10:55.531 --> 01:10:59.790
things because there's a lack of things in combat zones.
Right.

1220
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.470
And so you're good.
CBE can come up with,
let's call it,
you know,

1221
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:09.310
120 sheets of four by eight plywood,
right.
That our master,

1222
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:14.250
our CVE master chief.
Awesome.
We got there.
Did they had,
they had these racks

1223
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.180
<v 4>built out for us in,</v>

1224
01:11:15.181 --> 01:11:20.130
this was blown out concrete building that had like shelves and stairs to go to.

1225
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:23.190
The upper duty was awesome.
Yeah,
it was.
So they take date,

1226
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:24.220
that's what they had done is taken,

1227
01:11:24.221 --> 01:11:27.990
it just built the like into these basically small plywood condominium,

1228
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.040
full metal jacket.
And I saw,

1229
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:36.330
I showed up there one time and you know,
we're hanging out and you know,

1230
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:39.300
the platoon commanders give me a little debrief on stuff and just kind of

1231
01:11:39.301 --> 01:11:42.330
telling me how things are going.
And then someone says,
Hey,

1232
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:47.130
did you see Mikey's video?
And I go,
I go,
no.
And they go,
go,

1233
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:51.840
go see Mikey's video.
And so I go,
okay,
so they go,
he's rooms back there.

1234
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:55.020
And what is his room say on it?
Oh man,
Mikey's palace or something.

1235
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:58.800
Like I would a great story about Mike.
He's palace by the way.
So go ahead.

1236
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.490
Let's talk about Mikey's palace.
So the,
so the cvs had built the,

1237
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:06.510
these awesome plywood paradise for us.
And um,
so,

1238
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:08.730
you know,
people would sleep,
we would sleep at all different times,
right?

1239
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:10.290
I mean daytime,
nighttime,
whatever.

1240
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:13.860
Because the obstacle was so intense and so everyone was totally blacked out.

1241
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.940
And I got like an odd sleeping style.
Like I could,
well,
as a mall rat,

1242
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.210
we know we have slightly different cycle.

1243
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.910
So Mikey had a different cycle.

1244
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.060
Like everybody would be asleep and I would be awakened back.
Ah,

1245
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:31.050
I always could find Mikey awake.
And Mike,
so you go in,
you go in,

1246
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:34.770
he was on the ground floor and so you'd go down and it was pitch black and you

1247
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.090
gotta like feel your way through it,

1248
01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:38.880
all these bunks and then you'd go down around this corner,

1249
01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:42.120
down this hallway and you make a sharp right.
And um,

1250
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.740
and then there'd be this faint glow coming from Mike Keith Palace.
And so Mike,

1251
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:50.700
he's bunk was the last one up against the wall and there was like an extra like

1252
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.400
three feet between his bunk in the wall this way,
like the way it worked out.

1253
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:57.780
And so he had like these tapestries that his family had sent him hanging from

1254
01:12:57.781 --> 01:12:58.950
the wall and,

1255
01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:02.850
and you'd have like Poncho liners all hung out blocking the whole thing out.

1256
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:03.910
And so it was all dark.

1257
01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:07.070
He was like his little cave and you go back in there and uh,

1258
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:10.590
I don't know where he got and he had like extra pillows on his bunk and like he

1259
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:14.580
had his laptop,
like,
like rigged.
That's like a TV screen.

1260
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:15.780
Have you always be watching movies?

1261
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:18.240
And he always had all kinds of Guidant back there.

1262
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.810
So I go back in there and I go in a glow from Mikey's palace.

1263
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.880
I go back in there and then we just sit there and go,
hey man,

1264
01:13:23.881 --> 01:13:28.260
you want some of that?
You'd have beef Jerky,
that's sodas.
He'd have like Ramen,

1265
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:31.280
ramen noodles.
And he'd always had,
he had like this heating element there.

1266
01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:33.750
Like once like you plug into the wall,
he's like,
hey man,

1267
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:36.450
and you a cook up the heating element,
boiling water,
right.

1268
01:13:36.451 --> 01:13:39.630
There are some Brahmin if ever I was hungry in the middle of the night,

1269
01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:41.000
I could get down there to Mikey's pass.

1270
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:44.160
I knew I could get some grub and he United hang out and watch movies and stuff.

1271
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.700
And uh,
he was always up weird hours.
Like,
man,
it was just cool man.
He had just,

1272
01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:51.540
yeah,
it was cool.
Pictures,
posters hanging on the wall.

1273
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:55.470
He had that thing correct out.
Failed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1274
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:59.660
So these guys are like,
Hey,
have you seen Mike?
He's movie.
And I go,
no.
It's like,

1275
01:13:59.661 --> 01:14:01.380
oh,
we'll go back to Mikey's palace and check it out.

1276
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.190
And so I make my way back there.
Same thing,
you know,

1277
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.500
you're making your way back there.
The dark at the headlamp on,

1278
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:09.780
even though it's noon or something like that outside,

1279
01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:12.070
but the place is blacked out.
Anyways,
I get back

1280
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.210
<v 2>there and I'm like Mikey and,
and he,</v>

1281
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:20.190
he didn't know I was at that.
I was at Corregidor,
you know,

1282
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:25.130
so he was just,
hey,
you know,
kind of like hop two or whatever in a very,

1283
01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:26.920
I don't want to make that sound too extreme.
Right.
You know?

1284
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But he was surprised to see the commander.
Right.
But,
um,
anyways,
I'm like Mikey,

1285
01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.120
he's like,
oh.
He's like,
Hey,
you know,
when these all chill.
And I said,
Hey,

1286
01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:38.450
let me see your movie man.
And he goes,
he gets a smile on his face and I go,
okay,

1287
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:41.540
this must be addressed.
So anyways,
he breaks out,

1288
01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:43.910
his camera is showing me the movie on the camera.
Right.

1289
01:14:43.911 --> 01:14:45.470
But it's got volume and I'm sitting there watching it.

1290
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.120
And any ways that the movie is,
it's a,
a big firefight going on.

1291
01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.150
It's just,
there's,
this is a big bad firefight.

1292
01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.800
There's machine gun fire going off and he's literally sticking his hand up with

1293
01:14:57.801 --> 01:15:01.460
the camera above the edge of a rooftop and he's filming,

1294
01:15:01.461 --> 01:15:03.380
you can see stuff getting shot and whatever.

1295
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:07.940
And then the funny part is he brings the camera down.
He's,
you know,

1296
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:10.730
hiding in this rooftop and he points the camera at himself.

1297
01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.950
And the area of Ramadi that they were working in was a place called the melodic

1298
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:18.450
district.
And like many things in the military,

1299
01:15:18.451 --> 01:15:22.640
you had taken on its own little life,
its own little legend,
the melodic district.

1300
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.540
And Mikey points the camera at himself and he says,

1301
01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:31.310
it's the Moodle out the mood I baby.
And uh,

1302
01:15:31.311 --> 01:15:34.520
so it was really funny.
Yeah.
And any,

1303
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.550
I get done watching this and of course I'm still,
you know,

1304
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.990
mister big bad Jocko and,
and I get to Washington,
I go,
I go,
hey Mikey,

1305
01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.780
listen bro,
when you're out there,

1306
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.690
you shouldn't be filming stuff you need to be on are gone.
I mean,
that's just,

1307
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:49.450
that's just what you need to be doing.
Do you need to get on your gun and,

1308
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.600
and you need to keep shooting.
You need to be putting down suppressive fire.

1309
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.630
And He,
and he looks at me and he's kind of sheepishly,
you know,

1310
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:58.990
cause he felt bad and he goes,
he goes,
he goes like,
Hey sir,

1311
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.150
I was out of Ammo

1312
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.320
and I started laughing because that's probably an 800 rounds,
maybe,
maybe more,

1313
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:10.580
probably more.
Probably probably 1200.
Yeah.

1314
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:15.160
Just a massive amount of machine gun rounds that he'd gone through and he'd shot

1315
01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:19.180
them all.
That's what Winchester means.
Means you'd shot,
you had nothing left.

1316
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.730
And he said,
you know,
sir,
I'm sorry sir.
I was,

1317
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.610
I was Winchester and I just started laughing.
I was like,
well,

1318
01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.860
if you're Winchester makes them good movers.
I guess my brother he got after.

1319
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:32.380
Yeah.
So that's uh,
another good Mikey story.

1320
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:34.203
So,

1321
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:36.030
<v 1>okay.</v>

1322
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:40.590
<v 2>You actually ended up going home early from deployment.
Yup.</v>

1323
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.510
And because you had another kid on the way.
Yup.
Gunner.

1324
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.480
He,
um,
and the thing is,
is it's like God,
I mean,
hindsight's 2020 men,

1325
01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:56.310
you know,
when,
when man,
when this stuff goes like this,
um,

1326
01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.163
<v 1>Ma,</v>

1327
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.090
<v 2>we had point,
we knew that that was going to be the end of the deployment.</v>

1328
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.160
And so it's like,
all right,
cool.
You know,
you just go back with the,

1329
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:09.980
with the ad bond for the redeploy.
And so that was all part of the plan from

1330
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.960
<v 3>day one basically.
All right,
cool.
Um,</v>

1331
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:16.340
because my first son had been born on my last appointment,
so as it was,

1332
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.660
and,
and by the way,
so it started heading back,
wife gives birth early anyway,

1333
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:23.450
so there you go.
Two deployments to kids,

1334
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.260
not their common story for a lot of military guys.
Um,

1335
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:27.500
but for people who are not yet,
I mean,

1336
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:30.230
imagine like you're not being there for your,
for either of your kids.
My wife,

1337
01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:33.400
she's a trooper,
but she was running out of steam.
Um,

1338
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.440
so it was cool to be able to go back,
at least try to be there,

1339
01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:41.780
but gunners always been in a hurry,
so he came early.
Um,
and then so yeah,

1340
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.630
went back,
um,
start handling the redeploy.

1341
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:50.020
And by that he means we're some guy comes home from deployment a little bit

1342
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:53.390
early to start basically preparing for us to come home,

1343
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:56.240
getting ready for all the administrative stuff that's going to take place.

1344
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:59.510
And Andrew was that guy and there's like that happen.

1345
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:02.750
And then there was like three other guys that like a week later came.

1346
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.690
They all love me too.
So it was,
it was,
you know,
near the end,

1347
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:10.070
but it tough but a tough call anyway.
And then,
um,

1348
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.000
I mean,
I remember where I was when,
when I got the word,
so,
you know,

1349
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:16.760
I was back at the team and,
uh,
I was,

1350
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.810
I was actually chatting with Delta platoon commander,

1351
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:25.640
um,
via a method that we use.
And He,
uh,
I just,

1352
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.340
I knew they were going out and,
um,
and I mean,

1353
01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:31.760
I distinctly remember going all right,
may get some,
get some for me,
you know,
and,

1354
01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:36.470
uh,
so I was home,
I got the call at like 1230 at night,

1355
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.670
um,
our time,
local.
And,
uh,

1356
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.340
so I knew right away that was one of our guys.
Uh,
they wouldn't,
you know,

1357
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:45.950
nothing over the,
you know,
over the phone specifically,

1358
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:49.370
but I knew because I had just talked to our guys,
you know,
and I was like,
God,

1359
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:54.050
I'm money.
So I raced into,
so you get to call,
it just says,
come to work,

1360
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.290
get to work.
And I'm like,
all right,
so,

1361
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:01.910
and admittedly I'm a little frantic,
you know,

1362
01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:06.230
because these are my brothers,
you know,
and I'm not there and it's really hard.

1363
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.680
So,
you know,

1364
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:16.670
you can have some survivor's guilt over that kind of thing,
you know?
Um,
uh,

1365
01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:20.900
you know,
it seems like,
Hey,
look,
we got this deployments basically over.

1366
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.980
Um,
and go back thinking you're making a right decision,

1367
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:28.970
trying to balance stuff with your family.
Um,

1368
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:34.070
and then for that to happen.
Uh,
and you know,
he's one of my guys,

1369
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:38.870
he's one of my guys and I wasn't there.
And,
uh,

1370
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:41.320
that's hard.
Um,
you know,

1371
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:45.860
it's been almost 10 years now and time helps to heal those kinds of things,

1372
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:50.330
but I had a lot of guilt over that.
And,
um,
so anyway,

1373
01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:52.140
we kind of figure out what's going on.
Um,

1374
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:56.720
I get the brief and figure out who it is.
So,
um,

1375
01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.710
start figuring out,
okay,
so now it's,
now it's a race for those guys.
I don't know.

1376
01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:05.300
I mean,
look,
here's the thing.
We live in a 24,
seven news world,
um,

1377
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.690
and it's a race to notify the before they find out through some other means.

1378
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:14.100
And,
uh,
he lives up in Orange County.
So we started assembling the team,
um,

1379
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.000
and you know,

1380
01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:20.430
admirals and,
uh,

1381
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:24.210
commodores are involved and,
uh,
it looked,

1382
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:29.130
this is the second guy that we have not lost seals in Iraq to this point,

1383
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.740
mark and Mike now.
So,
um,
uh,
you know,

1384
01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.820
who's going to go up and do the notification?
And I mean,

1385
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:38.850
like I had to like dig my heels in and I was like,
listen,
this is my guy.

1386
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:43.920
I'm going.
And it was at first like,
hmm.
And then I was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1387
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:48.540
I'm going and thank God I did that because I mean,

1388
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:52.320
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Um,
we're racing,
we put,
put the guys together,

1389
01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:55.560
throw the blue zone,
we drive it up.
And,
um,
you know,
look,
when we,

1390
01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:58.690
when we got to Mikey's family's house,
um,
you know,

1391
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.850
look at all they wanted was to talk to somebody who knew Mikey and the other

1392
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:06.030
four guys that were standing there didn't know him,
didn't serve with them,

1393
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:09.540
didn't work up with him,
didn't deploy with them.
And you know,

1394
01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:13.800
in this grand scheme of God's plan,
I have to ask,
you know,

1395
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:17.520
we pulled over before pulling up,
pulling up to the house and put on our blues.

1396
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:18.990
And I literally thought to myself,
okay,

1397
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:24.190
that we are about to give the worst possible news to,

1398
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:28.710
to a parent that their kid is dead.
And,
um,

1399
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.920
I remember thinking,
you know,
God just used me right now.

1400
01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:36.560
I don't know why I'm here in this timing.
Um,

1401
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:41.640
but just work,
work through me,
just use me,
you know.
Uh,
so,
you know,

1402
01:21:41.641 --> 01:21:44.460
we knocked on their door and,
and,
um,
you know,

1403
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.380
Mrs Monsu or looked out and she later new,
you know,
that we,
I mean,

1404
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.820
she took a few minutes to get to the door.

1405
01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:54.270
She looked out and saw five men standing there and blues.
Um,

1406
01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.040
so that was very hard.
You know,

1407
01:21:56.041 --> 01:22:00.630
you go in and obviously family is upset and you're doing the best you can to

1408
01:22:00.631 --> 01:22:04.310
keep it together.
I mean,
for me,
this was my guide.

1409
01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:08.160
This was my brother and I'm standing there giving them the news and trying to

1410
01:22:08.161 --> 01:22:12.030
keep it together myself.
And,
um,
you know,
the,

1411
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:16.020
the good news is,
is that one by one they sort of looked around and said,
well,

1412
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:21.000
did anybody know Mikey?
And I was like,
yeah,
I knew Mike.
He is mine.
And,

1413
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:24.160
uh,
so they politely asked everybody to leave.
Um,

1414
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.570
but wanted me to stay and just talk about the deployment,

1415
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:32.460
tell stories about Mikey,
what he was like,
what was going on in,
you know,

1416
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:33.510
I want to,
uh,

1417
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:37.000
<v 1>okay.</v>

1418
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
<v 0>The monsters are an unbelievable family and I totally want to respect their</v>

1419
01:22:42.551 --> 01:22:47.470
privacy.
Absolutely.
The family.
Um,
and they're just,

1420
01:22:47.471 --> 01:22:52.330
they just been so amazingly humble and gracious through this whole thing.

1421
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.590
And I just don't want to sit here and tell stories about,

1422
01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.330
about this.
Right.
I don't want to do it.
Um,

1423
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:10.190
one of the things that are the,
the,
the only,
the only thing I'll,

1424
01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:14.700
I'll say about this again,
out of disrespect for the monster,
we're family,

1425
01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:20.070
um,
is w when you just said about about,

1426
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.483
<v 1>mmm.</v>

1427
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:26.390
<v 0>You tell them what deployment was like.
Well,
in talking to them,</v>

1428
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:32.470
one of the things that they said was their impression of the deployment.

1429
01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.770
So,
so like I said,

1430
01:23:36.771 --> 01:23:39.800
and you guys have heard stories about Ramadi and you could go and you can go on

1431
01:23:39.801 --> 01:23:43.310
youtube and just put Ramadi 2006 and you'll see what Ramadi was like.

1432
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.320
That's what Ramadi was like.

1433
01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.000
And it was incredibly violent and crazy.

1434
01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:54.120
And these guys,
Charlie and Delta tune,

1435
01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:55.850
we're in the thick of it,

1436
01:23:56.150 --> 01:24:00.650
in the thick of it on a almost daily basis.

1437
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:06.350
And the reason I'm building that up is because the emails that might get sent

1438
01:24:06.351 --> 01:24:10.580
home to his family were,
oh yeah,
I haven't fun.

1439
01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.890
Not much going on here.
Right.
Don't worry about me.

1440
01:24:12.891 --> 01:24:16.580
We're just training some Iraqis.
Don't worry about me.
I'll,
we're just,
we're just,

1441
01:24:16.581 --> 01:24:20.750
uh,
trying to work on the infrastructure.
Don't worry about me.
It's all good here.

1442
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:22.340
I'll be home in a little bit though.

1443
01:24:22.341 --> 01:24:27.341
Those are the kinds of emails that he was sending home in order to make sure

1444
01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:29.270
that his family wasn't worried about it.
Right.

1445
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.870
And it shows you what kind of a guy that Mikey was.

1446
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:35.383
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1447
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:40.870
<v 0>So,
so
any,
is there anything else,
again,</v>

1448
01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:45.410
without,
without going into your personal yeah.

1449
01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:46.150
You know,

1450
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:51.150
your personal interactions with this incredible family that you want to say.

1451
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.970
And maybe from the perspective of,

1452
01:24:57.330 --> 01:24:59.250
as much as,
I hate to say this,

1453
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.520
there's many other people that are going to do this job being this person that

1454
01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:03.630
does the notification.

1455
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:09.450
Is there anything else that you could give advice to people that have to do this

1456
01:25:09.451 --> 01:25:14.250
job or you know,
if they,
if that ever befalls people that are here.
We get a lot,

1457
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:17.280
Andrew.
We get a lot of big,
a lot of military guys that,

1458
01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:20.010
that reach out to me all the time that are active duty,

1459
01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.040
that are doing the work and anything that strikes you as something that you

1460
01:25:26.281 --> 01:25:27.600
learned from this experience.

1461
01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.110
<v 3>Here's what I learned is the worst thing I've ever done in my life.</v>

1462
01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.160
And the worst thing and combat itself was a piece of cake compared to this.

1463
01:25:38.850 --> 01:25:43.850
I would love to go back to combat any issues or concerns or anything from my

1464
01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:46.740
military service was completely centered around.

1465
01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:51.000
This is an extremely heavy burden to bear.
So if you were ever in this position,

1466
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.560
I don't have any good advice for you.

1467
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.340
There's nothing you can do to prepare yourself for that,
this type of situation.

1468
01:25:56.730 --> 01:26:01.500
The only thing I could tell you is reach out to guys who've done it before.

1469
01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.040
I will gladly talk you through it because one of the best solves that I've found

1470
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:11.060
for this kind of pain is hanging out with your brothers and spending time with

1471
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:14.390
them.
Um,
I will always have time for someone who's had that be a Keiko.

1472
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.220
Always call me.
Let's go out.
Let's hang out.
I won't suggest drinking a beer,

1473
01:26:19.221 --> 01:26:22.280
but if a beer is what you want to do,
we'll do it.
But the bottom line is,

1474
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:26.630
is that just the intimacy of being around another guy who's been there is very

1475
01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:30.800
comforting.
And so,
you know,
when you go through a stressful situation like this,

1476
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.600
do not isolate yourself.

1477
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:36.290
There are other guys who have been through this and um,

1478
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.350
in a true brother will be,
we'll be willing to take the time for you.

1479
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:43.430
I'll find a time for you no matter what,
no matter how busy I am.
And so,
um,

1480
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:44.730
I just want to be a resource.

1481
01:26:44.731 --> 01:26:46.490
Now I know that there's only so many hours in the day,

1482
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:47.600
but if you're going through something,

1483
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:50.270
if you've gone through something like this,
reach out to your brothers,

1484
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:55.280
find a connection to another military guy cause nobody can understand it like

1485
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:57.860
another military guy.
And that's part of the stress of it.

1486
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.060
Part of the stress of it is,

1487
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:02.450
is that you don't feel like you can't possibly explain what you're dealing with

1488
01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:05.810
to anybody else.
There's no way they could possibly understand and comprehend it.

1489
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.140
But another guy has been to combat cancer and we can sit in the room next to

1490
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:12.380
each other.
Even if we sat there and said nothing,
we would get each other.

1491
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:15.620
And so you got to reach out to each other.
Do not isolate.

1492
01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.500
<v 0>That's,
that's great advice.</v>

1493
01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:23.280
And actually one thing that's very interesting to me is that a,

1494
01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:28.281
I get emails from guys and they're basically doing that.

1495
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.170
They're going to do that right now with us.

1496
01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.760
There's some of those guys out there that are better are going okay.
Yeah.
And,

1497
01:27:35.761 --> 01:27:37.530
and the message is,
yeah,
I mean,

1498
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:42.540
the military guys who had been through this kind of stuff before,
again,

1499
01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:45.540
I was never Keiko.
I'd never even came home from my guys.
You know,

1500
01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:47.550
that was another kind of

1501
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.490
another kind of misery I guess to does.
No,
you're just sending people home.

1502
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:59.000
It's awful.
Um,
but yeah,

1503
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.270
don't isolate yourself.
Talk to your brothers,

1504
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:06.290
find him and tell him what you're thinking about.

1505
01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.650
<v 3>Yeah.
And this is awesome,
right?</v>

1506
01:28:08.651 --> 01:28:12.760
Because Twitter and Facebook and messages like this,
you know,

1507
01:28:12.761 --> 01:28:14.230
we can kind of reconnect.
You know,

1508
01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:16.870
we can kind of talk about doing some cool stuff together,

1509
01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:20.680
whether it's Jujitsu or running a badass race or doing something to challenge

1510
01:28:20.681 --> 01:28:21.790
you physically or mentally.

1511
01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.670
We all can kind of give ourselves a electronic high five,
you know,

1512
01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.600
for something bad ass you're still doing today.
And you know what?

1513
01:28:28.601 --> 01:28:31.660
Here's the other thing to transition,
man,
man.
So,
so,
so,

1514
01:28:31.661 --> 01:28:35.740
so we,
so that happens.
I'm home.

1515
01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:40.720
And in February,
2007 I got off active duty and I

1516
01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.050
<v 0>so,
so for those of you that don't track in the calendar here,</v>

1517
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.910
Mikey died September 29th,

1518
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:51.990
2006 that whole thing on fault.
We got home,
I got home,

1519
01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.680
I was the last with the last group to leave and we left a Ramadi October 21st it

1520
01:28:59.441 --> 01:29:02.040
took us a couple of days to get home,
but we're home.
We get

1521
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.000
<v 4>post deployment leave,
we reassemble,
I do post deployment,</v>

1522
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:08.850
kind of debrief types up.
Then we get post deployment leave.

1523
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.060
So now you're talking,
it's December.
All of a sudden December,
you know,

1524
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:13.640
October is November,
it's now it's descent.

1525
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.110
Your thanksgiving now it's on this December boom.

1526
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.150
And so not much time has gone by.
It's been packed in February.

1527
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:24.900
You're getting,
now that I'm gone and that war machine keeps cranking by the way.

1528
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.790
So the guys are back to write and do another platoon.

1529
01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:29.580
They're doing predeployment working,
whatever,
dude,
whatever.
It just,

1530
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.790
it keeps on cranking.
And then Poof,

1531
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.710
I'm out of the navy and I jumped right into the mortgage business because you

1532
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:41.970
know nothing like a natural transition from the seal teams and the battlefield

1533
01:29:41.971 --> 01:29:45.510
of Ramadi to do in 30 year fixed mortgages.
And it's,

1534
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:47.760
and it's 2007 though.

1535
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:52.880
So you actually weren't doing fixed mortgages for 30 years that the mortgage

1536
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:53.401
industry,

1537
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:57.750
for those of you that don't know the mortgage industry in 2007 was a place where

1538
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:02.160
a lot of people were making a ton of money and it was about to all come to a

1539
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:06.270
screen.
I was not making a ton of money.
I would just like to add,
I was brand new,

1540
01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:09.090
right?
So I leave this steady two week paycheck,

1541
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:14.450
brotherhood and a job I'd wanted to do my entire adult life at that point and

1542
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:17.440
had to just come have a great deployment and get in the morning.

1543
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.720
And I did that because I need to be home.

1544
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:23.400
<v 3>And by the way,
as much as the struggle was to get out and I really,</v>

1545
01:30:23.401 --> 01:30:27.120
my heart was truly torn in two opposite directions.
Um,
man,

1546
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:29.070
I look back in the last nine,

1547
01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:34.071
10 years that I've had the opportunity to raise in shape my two young boys to be

1548
01:30:34.081 --> 01:30:38.370
the young men that they're becoming had been absolutely priceless.
And,

1549
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:39.121
but you know,

1550
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:43.860
so I find myself February sitting in a quiet office of a mortgage office at like

1551
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.190
six 30 in the morning cause that's just how I roll.
I got a key,

1552
01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:50.000
I'm going to get in there early,
I'm going to figure it out.
And it,
nobody,

1553
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:52.380
no first guys not showing up.
It's like nine,
you know,

1554
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.090
I'm in their written guideline books trying to just,
you know,
I have no,

1555
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:59.160
I have no paycheck,
have no income.
And so man,
it got rough.

1556
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:00.930
I started to struggle,

1557
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:06.330
I'm struggling financially for one thing,
I'm struggling emotionally,

1558
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:10.260
um,
of struggling and build a new relationships and,
you know,

1559
01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:13.440
kind of like a little bit of a chip on the shoulder and a sort of a little bit

1560
01:31:13.441 --> 01:31:17.370
of an attitude from combat to trying to build a relationships in the civilian

1561
01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:21.480
world.
And it was tough.
Um,
but I mean,

1562
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.460
there were mornings I sat there quietly.
And by the way,

1563
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:25.590
that picture that you talked about at the beginning of this deal,

1564
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.940
I have that hanging on my wall.
I look at it every single day.
And,
um,

1565
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:34.380
one of the things that continued to drive me and for military guys who are

1566
01:31:34.381 --> 01:31:37.840
listening,
um,
as Corny as this may sound,
um,

1567
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.170
the legacy of my brothers is what drives me.
Um,

1568
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:46.080
the opportunity to help my fellow veterans drives me,
um,
because I'm,
you know,

1569
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:48.810
doing mortgages.
Yeah.
Not Super Exciting,
right.

1570
01:31:48.811 --> 01:31:53.460
But I sat there quietly trying to figure it out.
Um,
I,
I all,
I got divorced,

1571
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:58.530
I lost a house to foreclosure.
I short sold another house.
Um,
there's a time when,

1572
01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.080
um,
I looked over my young son,
Gunnar is sleeping on the floor.

1573
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:04.340
I got no furniture in the house,
a house that's days from,

1574
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.960
it's already been foreclosed and it's days away from the sheriff coming to
essay,

1575
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.350
get out.
And that drives me.

1576
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:16.090
And I think about Mickey and the sacrifice that Mikey and mark made.

1577
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:20.830
And it drives me because they made a sacrifice.
And

1578
01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:25.060
in some ways this is,
this is bad talk right here.

1579
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:29.110
In some ways I beat myself up that I wasn't on the roof that day with Mikey

1580
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.920
because that was my platoon.
And I came home early from my son.

1581
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:37.120
But then I think,
well,
if I had been on that roof,

1582
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.660
maybe it could have been me and then there wouldn't be a father there to raise

1583
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:45.130
gunner and to raise Triston into the next generation of warriors.
And either way,

1584
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.600
the sacrifice it Mikey made,

1585
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:53.190
he made that so that I could live and I have an obligation to use every ounce of

1586
01:32:55.331 --> 01:33:00.331
my ability to use my mind and my body and my drive and my determination to fight

1587
01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:04.300
and kick and scratch every single day to honor his legacy,

1588
01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.060
to build and to mentor young men,

1589
01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.980
to help my fellow veterans and to make this country a greater country and all of

1590
01:33:11.981 --> 01:33:14.140
those things.
The more I do,

1591
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:19.000
the more I feel like I can honor Mikey and his legacy and to do anything else

1592
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:22.150
would be to slight the great sacrifice that he made.

1593
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:25.360
And so take your brothers,

1594
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:28.630
if you're at a military and you're out now you're trying to figure out what we

1595
01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.740
think your brother's honor them.

1596
01:33:31.210 --> 01:33:33.360
<v 0>Andrew,
you and I were having dinner.
Uh,</v>

1597
01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.440
actually we were having dinner at the Christening of the USS Michael Montessori

1598
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.950
awesome.
The ship.
And you are going into that situation.

1599
01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:48.200
You just kind of rattled it off just now.
Like it wasn't no big thing,
right?

1600
01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.860
Your kid is sleeping on the floor cause you have no bed,
no furniture.

1601
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.910
You're that by the way,

1602
01:33:53.911 --> 01:33:57.480
that that paycheck you've been accustomed to getting for whatever,

1603
01:33:57.510 --> 01:34:01.740
five years in the navy is gone,
right?
When you get out of the military,

1604
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:04.540
after five years,
you don't get anything.
You get nothing.
Right?

1605
01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.300
So you have no paycheck coming in,

1606
01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:09.070
but there's no salary in the mortgage industry,
right?

1607
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.620
So it's all a hundred percent commission.

1608
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:15.810
You're son is sleeping on the floor because you have no furniture,
right?

1609
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.950
You foreclosed on one house,
you short sold another house,

1610
01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.630
and you're about to get evicted.
That's your life at this point,

1611
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.553
right?

1612
01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:30.540
Not to mention in the back of your mind or in the front of your mind,

1613
01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:37.190
you got this thought that Mikey died and you weren't there.

1614
01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:41.363
Right?

1615
01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.920
How did you look at all of that

1616
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:50.030
and shrug your shoulders,

1617
01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:55.520
Grit your teeth and say,
I'm going to kick this thing's ass.

1618
01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.130
Where

1619
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.060
<v 3>did you start?
At the very bottom.</v>

1620
01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.690
I'd like to think I bounced because I hit so hard.

1621
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:13.580
Never give up
the legacy of my teammates.
I mean,

1622
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.593
here's the deal.

1623
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:18.470
I think about guys that are committing suicide today or thinking about

1624
01:35:18.471 --> 01:35:23.000
committing suicide and
think about this,

1625
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:28.090
do you want to give that nasty enemy even one more victory.

1626
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:31.880
Fuck them.

1627
01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:37.910
I am going to win because I am not going to let them defeat me.

1628
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:43.090
And I look at my boys,
I prayed a lot for me.

1629
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.080
It's my faith and Jesus Christ saved me.
So I keep fighting.

1630
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.680
And you know what,
that's just never gonna quit.
Never.

1631
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:59.330
You are not done until you're six feet under the ain't done.

1632
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.080
I would tell you if I ever found myself in combat where I was shot and dying and

1633
01:36:05.151 --> 01:36:07.730
often my own and Afghanistan or something like that.
For example,

1634
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:10.670
I would take the glass grenade,

1635
01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:15.260
I had pull the pin and laid underneath myself so that when the enemy came to try

1636
01:36:15.261 --> 01:36:20.261
and get my gear and they blow themselves up cause I am not done until I am gone.

1637
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:25.340
And even then,
if you've laid the right foundation,
the legacy you leave,

1638
01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:29.600
the messages and what you've done to help the next generation,
that's it.

1639
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.070
I'm just never gonna quit.
Never.
You can knock me down and I will get back up.

1640
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:38.060
You can not be down and I will get back up.
I will get back up.
I will get back up

1641
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.420
<v 2>obviously.
Well for those of you who don't know cause you don't know Andrew,</v>

1642
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.780
he did get back up.
He absolutely got back up.

1643
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:51.030
He now runs a very successful business and is out kicking ass on a daily basis

1644
01:36:51.631 --> 01:36:55.770
and taking names and it's been,
you know,
a lot of this,
you know,

1645
01:36:55.771 --> 01:37:00.771
again w whenever I look at myself and I went on this big little or I went on

1646
01:37:01.771 --> 01:37:02.760
this big kind of

1647
01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:09.030
tirade about how you need to mentor your people and all that and take care of

1648
01:37:09.031 --> 01:37:10.290
your brothers.
Well guess what?

1649
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:15.600
You know where I was when Andrew was going through this shit.
I was working,

1650
01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.960
I was working,
he didn't call me.

1651
01:37:18.961 --> 01:37:23.550
He didn't and I didn't make myself available.
You know,

1652
01:37:23.551 --> 01:37:28.050
so you
go,
you know,
taking care of,

1653
01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:32.310
of your friends goes beyond just when they ask for help,

1654
01:37:32.311 --> 01:37:34.350
you need to seek them out and make sure that they're doing all right.

1655
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:37.650
Because I let him go.
And that was that.

1656
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.140
He got out of the navy and it was bye bye

1657
01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:43.590
<v 3>mine.
I wasn't going to come and ask you,
cause maybe I was a little embarrassed.</v>

1658
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.190
You know about how dire my situation was.
So if you're a leader,

1659
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:50.010
just know just like kids who are going through buds,

1660
01:37:50.011 --> 01:37:52.710
they're going to hide their injuries.
Right.
Because you know,

1661
01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.800
I don't want to come to the guy who I respect and say,
Hey,
I am out right now,

1662
01:37:55.801 --> 01:38:00.030
bro.
You know,
so I'm just going to keep digging.
And I know we've talked about it.

1663
01:38:00.031 --> 01:38:03.450
You're like,
man,
why didn't you come to me?
I don't,
you know what?

1664
01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:08.010
It wasn't in my nature to do so.
Yeah,
maybe that wasn't the best decision.

1665
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:11.640
Maybe I should have reached out,
but um,
either way I wasn't gonna quit.

1666
01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:15.323
Well,
that's awesome.

1667
01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:20.160
It's awesome to see what you've done and see where you're at now.

1668
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.130
Like I said,
kicking ass and taking names and,

1669
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.450
and raising to a bad ass young men,
they're good boys,
man.

1670
01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:28.740
The next generation of warriors,

1671
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:30.960
that's one of the things I've become passionate about.
I'll tell you,
you know,

1672
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.750
when you get out and you transition,

1673
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:37.540
it's hard because you leave this brotherhood,
you leave this common,

1674
01:38:37.541 --> 01:38:40.290
sent this common goal and you know,
you're fighting for freedom,

1675
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:42.420
you're fighting for liberty and you're fighting for your brother and your
sister,

1676
01:38:42.421 --> 01:38:43.254
your right and left.

1677
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:48.470
And then you get into some job where you're sitting at a desk typing on a

1678
01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:52.710
computer,
which is boring.
Um,
so you have to look,
here's the deal.

1679
01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:57.380
You have to find a purpose behind what you're doing.
And mortgages,

1680
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:01.260
like seriously jumping out of planes,
blowing things up,
shooting guns,
dive in.

1681
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.250
Rebreathers on a hall high,
ends up doing 30 year fixed mortgages.
I mean,

1682
01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.600
Wall Wall.
I mean,
how do you,
how do you get excited about that?
Look,
you don't,

1683
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:11.720
you don't get excited about doing that.
All right?
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1684
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.520
What'd you get excited about it?
It's something else behind it.
And for me,

1685
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:16.290
it's helping my fellow veterans.
So they'll,

1686
01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:19.710
you don't know 90% of my business I do VA loans.
Okay?
So why?

1687
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:21.360
Because I want to help my fellow veterans.

1688
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.060
Nobody will take care of that are better than I will.
And that's,
that's,

1689
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:26.700
that's my mantra,
right?
If,
if,
if a guy goes down the street,

1690
01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:31.590
he will not be taken care of better than if he comes to me because I am deeply

1691
01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.360
passionate about helping my fellow veterans.

1692
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.970
And that's how I get passionate about the job that I do.

1693
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.950
Now I found a purpose behind what I'm doing.

1694
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:41.540
And so you might be in some job now that you're out and you might go,
God,

1695
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:45.870
this sucks.
You know,
but find a reason behind.

1696
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.180
It could be a small thing,
right?

1697
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.760
Like there were jobs in the military that sucked.
They were job.

1698
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.350
There's parts of every job that sucks.
You just gotta deal with it.
That's life.

1699
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:58.260
And find a purpose behind what you're doing.
And then,

1700
01:39:58.350 --> 01:40:00.120
and then I will just tell you,
this is a,

1701
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.820
this is like one of these secrets of life that I have found.

1702
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.270
Life is easier when you find a way to help somebody else.

1703
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:09.810
When you find a way to help somebody else,
miraculously,

1704
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:15.360
your problems begin to go away.
So focus on somebody else's problems.

1705
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:18.090
And how you can help them and all of a sudden you forget about yours.

1706
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.660
And so find a way to help other veterans.
I see guys,

1707
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:23.100
I see veterans today who are,

1708
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.180
who have been blown up and lost limbs and have been in similar difficult

1709
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:28.800
situations and they are making,

1710
01:40:28.801 --> 01:40:31.590
they're doing fantastic because they've started organizations.

1711
01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:34.800
We're a leading organizations or deeply involved in organizations that are

1712
01:40:34.801 --> 01:40:37.950
helping fellow veterans.
And there it is.
It's like this.

1713
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:41.520
It's like this miracle you sit out to help somebody else and all of a sudden

1714
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:45.150
your problems just seem to melt away.
So if you're struggling right now,

1715
01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.750
you can reach out to me,
Facebook,
Twitter,
whatever.
Just share your story,

1716
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:56.830
connect and then find a way to help someone else in do it in a way that you're

1717
01:40:56.831 --> 01:40:58.130
passionate about.
Man,
I mean I,

1718
01:40:58.131 --> 01:41:01.780
I'm passionate about raising my two boys into the next generation of warriors.

1719
01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:04.220
I'm,
I'm passionate about,
I mean,

1720
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.980
first look around at the spineless coward that society is raising today,

1721
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.640
who is raising the next generation of warriors to keep America the greatest

1722
01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:15.910
country on the planet.

1723
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:20.590
This generation that says that everybody gets a trophy,

1724
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.040
that you get a fricking graduation certificate when you graduate from first

1725
01:41:26.201 --> 01:41:28.660
grade.
That's bullshit.
All right,

1726
01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.830
so get a piece of coal and a kick in the ass.
That's right.

1727
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:38.790
You get something when you earn something and so raising my boys into hard young

1728
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:43.600
men to become gentlemen,
strong warriors,

1729
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:45.700
men of character who will,

1730
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.610
who will have a spine and stand for something.

1731
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:52.310
That's what we need to do and those are guys who have been to combat and serve

1732
01:41:52.311 --> 01:41:56.660
in our military.
You know how to do that.
You don't have kids find that.

1733
01:41:56.661 --> 01:41:57.850
We get involved in local high school,

1734
01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:02.090
maybe a local middle school and said be a role model and set an example for some

1735
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:06.160
young boys to be the next generation of bad ass American warriors who will stand

1736
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:09.430
for and protect this country and protect liberty as something to get pretty

1737
01:42:09.431 --> 01:42:10.930
excited when I get passionate about that.

1738
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.750
<v 0>Yeah.
That's something that everybody needs to get passionate about.</v>

1739
01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:19.460
And like you said,
especially the veterans that
that no one understand that.

1740
01:42:20.210 --> 01:42:23.420
And they know and understand and appreciate what real freedom is.
That's right.

1741
01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.810
Well I think that's
all we've got for tonight.

1742
01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:34.220
Did you have any closing comments?
I think you just about summed up

1743
01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.290
well first and foremost,
Andrew,
thanks for your service.

1744
01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:48.190
Thank you for answering the nation's call and I appreciate what you did for me

1745
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.210
and what you did for the teams.

1746
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:55.550
Thanks for coming on the podcast and sharing your lessons learned not only about

1747
01:42:55.551 --> 01:42:58.490
combat but about what comes after combat.

1748
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:05.430
And for those of you out there listening to the podcast and you want to keep

1749
01:43:06.231 --> 01:43:08.690
listening to the podcast,
you want to support the podcast,

1750
01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.200
my brother Echo Charles is going to tell you how to do that

1751
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:14.281
<v 3>before I tell you,</v>

1752
01:43:14.281 --> 01:43:18.780
actually I have a question way light hearted question compared to,

1753
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:22.680
so when you go into the mortgage industry yeah.

1754
01:43:22.890 --> 01:43:24.840
And you know there's other people in the office as well.

1755
01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:29.760
Like what did they think about,
did they know,
you know,
your,
your,
your past.

1756
01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:33.450
They find out,
you know,
but it's hard to write because in the seal teams we have,

1757
01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.780
we have a quiet professionalism.

1758
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.080
And so one of the things that I've struggled with is,
you know,
look,

1759
01:43:40.081 --> 01:43:43.020
I'm certainly proud of my service,
but I don't want to use my service.

1760
01:43:43.021 --> 01:43:46.430
And My background in the seal team does a way to advertise and they are main,

1761
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:51.440
there are douchebags in the mortgage business who prey on military and,

1762
01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:52.010
and

1763
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.010
<v 4>they've got some great fancy marketing,
but their heart's not in the right place.</v>

1764
01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.110
So relationships little by little it,

1765
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:00.260
it sneaks out and it's fine if other people know.
But no,

1766
01:44:00.261 --> 01:44:03.720
I don't walk in there and tell people that,
hey,
I'm a navy seal.
I mean,
style.

1767
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:07.400
He was just on it.
And I don't know why.
We've never talked about this before.

1768
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:08.234
I've never talked to before,

1769
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.920
but like anyone that actually calls themselves a navy seal is like suspect.

1770
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:15.580
You go,
hey,
how's it going?
I'm an EVC.
All right.
It wasn't easy on it.

1771
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:17.600
Just so like you can tell me that you're going,
wait a second,

1772
01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:22.520
what's this guy's deal from them?
Right.
No.
Right,
no,
right,
exactly.

1773
01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:25.250
But like you,
like,
okay,
Jocko walks in,

1774
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.840
we meet Jocko [inaudible] for example,
and he's,
you know,
whatever,
he's Jocko,

1775
01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:35.300
we're going to be kind of like,
Hey,
are you a navy seal?

1776
01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.650
Kind of thing.
But you,
you're kind of like an everyday guy.
I kind of feel,

1777
01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:40.281
so you're like,

1778
01:44:40.281 --> 01:44:43.730
kind of like the guy in the movie who they show him working or whatever,

1779
01:44:43.731 --> 01:44:46.640
and it flashes back to his past and he's kind of the superhero,
you know,

1780
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:51.210
you're like one of those kind of guys.
Do they like,

1781
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:54.120
do you think that they looked at you like that?
Like,
Oh yeah,
you're just,

1782
01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.130
you know,
our guy,
coworkers kind of thing.
But,

1783
01:44:56.131 --> 01:44:59.430
and then maybe one guy heard a rumor,
a,
this guy is,
you know,
this,
this,

1784
01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:02.850
the hardened warrior in there.
The other guy's like,
no,
no,
he's no way.

1785
01:45:02.851 --> 01:45:06.720
Look at that.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Um,
and that's how I prefer it.
I mean,

1786
01:45:06.721 --> 01:45:10.140
I'd rather be,
oh,
they're not knowing.
Yeah.
I'd rather be in the shadow.
I mean,

1787
01:45:10.141 --> 01:45:13.050
because look,
here's the deal.
None of us do this for accolade.

1788
01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.130
None of us do this for the look at me and the guys who advertise,

1789
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:17.070
it's like Jack was saying,

1790
01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.840
they're suspect because they probably didn't really do it,
you know?
Um,

1791
01:45:19.890 --> 01:45:24.630
but I'd say probably one of the best compliments I probably ever got was I heard

1792
01:45:24.631 --> 01:45:28.500
about a conversation that happened when I wasn't there and this guy was like,

1793
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:33.490
hey,
yeah,
did you know that guy's a navy seal?
And the other person said,
no,

1794
01:45:33.491 --> 01:45:38.310
we don't.
When it guys,
he's so nice.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1795
01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.160
I'd rather be,
I'd rather be stuff like that.
So you know,

1796
01:45:41.161 --> 01:45:44.790
what makes it even more interesting is again,
we'll use Jocko as an example.

1797
01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:47.760
If Jocko kind of walks in a room and guys,
you know,

1798
01:45:47.761 --> 01:45:50.010
let's say a trouble maker guy.
Yeah.
There you can look at and be like,

1799
01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:53.370
I dunno Vaughn,
I started even being with this day.
It's big.

1800
01:45:53.371 --> 01:45:56.910
You may or may not have been a,
you know,
a team die,
but then you,

1801
01:45:56.911 --> 01:45:59.300
you don't have that to look at you.
Right.
What'd he said?

1802
01:45:59.310 --> 01:46:03.150
Not only what you say and you know what you did too though.

1803
01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:07.230
To me that makes it even more about,
that's all you need really.

1804
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:11.520
So it makes it that much more interesting to me.
You know,
and it's great,
right?

1805
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.020
Because you know what,
a lot of times

1806
01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:18.180
I would say more often than not when we,
if we were out as a platoon,

1807
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:21.600
guys would actually want to start a fight with a guy that looks like Jocko

1808
01:46:21.601 --> 01:46:25.350
because they're,
they're looking to like test themselves.
Whereas like guys,

1809
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.840
I mean that would be a massive miscalculation.

1810
01:46:28.410 --> 01:46:33.410
Like really end of life event extinction event kind of decision to be,

1811
01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.840
not to counter.
I know exactly what you're saying,

1812
01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.220
but like the facts are people don't mess with me when I'm out in public.
Yeah,

1813
01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:43.230
they just don't.
But I know exactly what you're talking about.

1814
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:47.460
It's always some big guy.
The tall guy gets somebody coming up to him.
And uh,

1815
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.100
and actually,
you know,
you and I talked about this for those

1816
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.470
<v 2>of you on the podcast and you can't,
you know,
that are listening.</v>

1817
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:57.750
Andrew doesn't look like stereotypical seal.
He's 155 pounds.
He's,

1818
01:46:57.950 --> 01:47:00.540
what are you,
how tall are you?
Five,
seven,
five,
seven.
Susan,
look,

1819
01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:04.470
he's not your stereotype,
not new stereotypical seal looking guy.

1820
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.960
Now again that the public would,
that the public would think,

1821
01:47:06.961 --> 01:47:10.530
cause I was going to say there is no stereotype and some of the most bad ass

1822
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:12.600
guys are there every size.

1823
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.160
But this is something that Andrew said to me one time,
which was,

1824
01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.330
you know,
he,
you know,
basically people see me and what do they think?
They think,

1825
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.180
oh,
this guy,
you know,
he's just going to be a knuckle dragger and,

1826
01:47:24.210 --> 01:47:28.200
and he's thinks everybody needs to be big giant,
uh,
you know,

1827
01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.010
head smashers right.
And the fact of the matter is,

1828
01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:37.020
what I care about is can you do your job and can you do it well?

1829
01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:39.990
Are you tough?
Are you brave?
Can you lead?

1830
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:43.170
And that's why Andrew,
I,

1831
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.700
he was like actually surprised.
Like what do you,
when you finally throw,
you know,

1832
01:47:47.710 --> 01:47:52.140
he's like,
man,
you know,
I was kind of fought.
You might not like me,
you know,

1833
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:55.650
because,
um,
you know,
smaller and,

1834
01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:00.660
and you know,
I don't look like a seal.
And I was like,
Bro,
it's not about how,

1835
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:04.620
what you look like,
it's about how you act and can you do this job?

1836
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:07.530
Are you brave?
Are you going to step up?
Can you lead?

1837
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:10.080
<v 4>Great example leadership,
right?
Like that's what you,
that's what you,</v>

1838
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:12.960
that was one point is that you focused on what was the capability of the person

1839
01:48:12.961 --> 01:48:15.450
on your team,
not what they look like.
And,
and some guys can do that,
right?

1840
01:48:15.451 --> 01:48:19.200
They can,
they can go,
well,
you know,
this or that,
but you were like,
hell no.

1841
01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:22.200
I mean,
this guy he puts out,
he can get the job done.
He's leading.

1842
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.510
So you know how you're kind of like his,
um,
Dalton Yerba watch?
A roadhouse.

1843
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:31.860
Oh,
I remember,
yeah.
When they're like,
Hey,
I thought you'd be bigger.

1844
01:48:31.861 --> 01:48:36.030
He's this bad ass bouncer with,
is that a bad comparison?
Will that get me killed?

1845
01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:39.130
Neck roll?
Or he does.
He does actually.
Uh,
you know,

1846
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:43.180
look a lot like Patrick Swayze.
Thank you.
I appreciate your,
yeah,

1847
01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.340
I'd rather remain stealth,
you know,
and,
and,
and use that to my advantage,

1848
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:51.960
you know,
um,
and kind of remain thought as the underdog.
You know,

1849
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:56.010
he won't see me coming.
I remember we were hanging out at your house,
Jack and,

1850
01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.390
and um,
and Tristan said,
he goes,
Hey,
who would win in a fight?

1851
01:49:00.391 --> 01:49:04.730
You were Jocko.
And I was like,
thanks buddy.
Right in front of Jackie.

1852
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.990
And I was like,
you gosh.
Mashy later.
And I go,
well,

1853
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.610
I'm not stupid enough to start a fight with Jackie.
It'll wait till he's asleep.

1854
01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:22.770
Awesome.
I'm glad we're on the same team,

01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:50.780

Yeah.
Women's is out.

1877
01:50:51.710 --> 01:50:56.220
I got say I liked the Krill oil.
I use the Krill and I'm like,
Yup.

1878
01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.420
And I'm on the um,
like the um,
the,

1879
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.650
what's that the true magic that is getting you through the work.

1880
01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:08.650
I like it was,
I was like,
well shit,

There's shroom tech is legit as is the Krill Oil Krill oil.

1882
01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:17.530
I was telling them last time where I started the Krill oil and cause I was

1883
01:51:17.531 --> 01:51:20.590
looking where when I work out I have strong,
you know,
sore joints,

1884
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:24.790
but I do have sore joints when I wake up.
I just never thought about that.

1885
01:51:24.791 --> 01:51:26.740
When people say she's sore joints and stuff,
you know,

1886
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:31.120
you just saw all this and my daughter would jump on my back to wake me up.

1887
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.470
I got to walk downstairs with his girl on my bat.

I don't want to leave you with this.

01:54:11.190 --> 01:54:14.070
Mikey monster was named after Saint Michael.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1931
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:18.320
<v 0>Saint Michael is the war.</v>

1932
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:22.980
Your Archangel that led to heaven's army against Satan.

1933
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:30.340
Saint Michael was known as the principal of the angelic warriors,

1934
01:54:33.630 --> 01:54:34.610
and it was seen

1935
01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.720
as a protector against the darkness.

1936
01:54:41.190 --> 01:54:45.930
They didn't the Christian religion specifically in the Anglican and the Catholic

1937
01:54:45.931 --> 01:54:47.460
and the Lutheran churches.

1938
01:54:47.730 --> 01:54:52.730
September 29th September 29th is known as Michael Mass

1939
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.340
or Saint Michael's Day.

1940
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.793
<v 1>And that day,</v>

1941
01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:09.390
<v 0>September 29th,
2006</v>

1942
01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:15.960
was the day that our Saint Michael,
Mikey Monsoor

1943
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.920
was killed in Iraq,
the city of Ramadi,

1944
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:25.280
sacrificing his life

1945
01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.830
to save the lives of three of his teammates.

1946
01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:33.460
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1947
01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:37.880
<v 0>Three of his brothers,
three best friends.</v>

1948
01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.890
And I would ask this,

1949
01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:49.780
when September 29th comes around,

1950
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:56.430

right?

1951
01:55:56.470 --> 01:56:01.470
I would ask that while you honor the hero and you honor the warrior that Michael

1952
01:56:04.641 --> 01:56:07.970
[inaudible] store was,

1953
01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.740

1954
01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.153
<v 1>okay?</v>

1955
01:56:18.370 --> 01:56:20.350
<v 0>He was a smiling kid.</v>

1956
01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:24.430
He was a jokester.

1957
01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:28.690
He was it determined man,

1958
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:34.920
<v 1>a brother,
a son,
or an uncle,</v>

1959
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.863
or a friend.

1960
01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:44.480
<v 0>Michael Monster War was a young man</v>

1961
01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.160
with hopes and plans and aspirations and dreams,

1962
01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.160
dreams for his future,

1963

<v 0>And dreams for his life.</v>

1965
01:57:08.890 --> 01:57:12.160
And in that moment of truth,

1966
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:16.110
he gave the mall

1967
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:21.600
all those hopes and all those dreams.

1968
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:23.750
He gave them all

1969
01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.133
to us.

1970
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:35.143
